### "I do not recommend this airline"
I wanted to travel with my family and service dog from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City then to bacalar, we drive 30 minutes to the PV airport to verify with the manager at viva what paper work we needed to fly with viva. She gave us the information, we went to the veterinary and got all paper work. We moved forward to buy our tickets and we left PV with no problems, we left Mexico City with no problems, we landed in bacalar which we don’t recommend because the locals are horrible and not friendly. When we arrived to the airport in bacalar after our trip, the viva gate agent said we didn’t have the proper paper work. We explained how can this be when we left puerto Vallarta and Mexico with viva and we had NO problems. She wouldn’t let us back on the flight. No customer service at all. Absolutely horrific! I do not recommend this airline.

### “totally indifferent, disrespectful”
Not Verified | Terrible experience, avoid flying with this airline, I had one of the worst experiences of my life with VivaAerobus. They changed my flight schedule without prior notice, ruining my plans. The worst part was their customer service: totally indifferent, disrespectful, and lacking any empathy for passengers. We pay for a service they fail to deliver, and they don’t even have the decency to inform passengers of the changes or provide an appropriate solution. When I tried to resolve the issue, they simply told me there was nothing they could do, completely ignoring their responsibility. It’s clear that they don’t care about their customers, only about the money. I strongly recommend everyone to avoid this airline at all costs. There are better options out there that respect their passengers.

### “crew didn’t inform us what was going on”
Worst experience of my life flying. Flight didn’t land in LAX as planned and was diverted back to Mexico. We were circling for over 45 minutes and then started flying south, crew didn’t inform us what was going on. Then Crew lied saying it was due to weather but weather in LA was perfect. Then we landed in Mexicali, and were kept in the plane for over 2 hours with no information. Then they told us we could either get off in Mexicali or fly back to Mexico City. They lied about the situation, it seems they had an issue with their landing permits. All just horrible. Don’t ever fly with them.

### "been the worst experience"
Not Verified |  This has been the worst experience. My son was supposed to fly from Havana to Cancun, but his flight was canceled due to Hurricane Helena. They rescheduled his for an early morning flight today, but when he arrived at Havana airport three hours before the flight, they simply did not check my son in. Despite having a ticket and an assigned seat, VivaAerobus staff kicked a minor off the flight and said that all the seats were already taken! They offered him a later flight with an overnight layover of more than 10 hours in Mexico City! Can you even imagine how a minor is supposed to handle such a flight alone? Este ha sido el peor experiencia con la aerolínea VivaAerobus. Mi hijo debía volar de La Habana a Cancún y su vuelo fue cancelado debido al huracán Helena. Nos reprogramaron para un vuelo matutino hoy, pero al llegar al aeropuerto de La Habana con 3 horas de anticipación, simplemente no registraron a mi hijo en el vuelo. A pesar de que tenía boleto y asiento confirmado, ¡los empleados de VivaAerobus sacaron a un menor de edad del vuelo y dijeron que ya todos los asientos estaban ocupados! Le ofrecieron volar más tarde, con una escala de más de 10 horas en Ciudad de México durante la noche. ¿De verdad pueden imaginar cómo un niño menor de edad va a lidiar con un vuelo así estando solo?

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience with this Airline - regarding flight Cancún to Monterrey 11am flight on 28 August 2024: I paid extra for extra luggage and despite they did not follow their own rules and they were very rude in the process I tried to check-in a finishing net that I bought for my son, but at the check in counter they refused as it was not in a plastic container or box or luggage So I tried to bring it on the cabin where it can fit perfectly well. I was able to pass easily security as this is just a fishing net and does not represent any security risk, in fact security take away my 2 bottles of water but allow this. But at the boarding gate the same person that refused to check it in also refused to board unless I leave behind the net. The reason for denying us the boarding with the fishing net was claimed to be that the object in his opinion could look like a weapon and the airline has the right block it. I asked for the supervisor to and VivaAerobus Station manager to whom I asked to show me such a policy and he was not able to show it to me. But he still insisted that the fishing net can not be brought on-board and also that they could not provide any form or document showing that the object was confiscated by VivaAerobus Cancún Station. They waited until the very end of the boarding and then bullying us that if we did not leave the net behind the would deny us the boarding. Interesting fact is that we brought this same net all the way from Italy on the cabin of multiple airplanes: Milan-Atlanta with Delta, Atlanta-Mexico with Delta, Mexico to Cancún with Aeromexico. But today to go to Monterrey VivaAerobus applied different rules based on the opinion of their ground staff putting themself above the security of the Cancún Airport that allow us to bring it onboard. Below the photos of the fishing net that was stopped at the gate. I will also put a formal complain to VivaAerobus and see what they have to explain this incident.

### "They simply do not care"
Not Verified |   I am beyond amazed at the ineptitude of this airline. These guys are the absolute epitome of "I do not care, not my problem". I missed a flight because of a delay on the airline's end and to further exacerbate this, they took my bags before I boarded the plane because there was no longer room on board the plane. I explained to them I had a flight to catch upon arriving in Cancun and they assured me that I would receive my bags in time for me to catch my flight. Well that was a lie. Upon arriving in Cancun, they took an absolute eternity with getting me my bags. I had to abandon them and hope they would send them to Toronto because I did not want to miss my flight. Well I ended up missing my flight and when I explained the situation to the personnel they had at the check in counter. They only gave me a phone number to call. After calling said phone number, they told me they would not reimburse me or give me any kind of compensation, not even a place to stay for the night because I had nowhere to go. I was beyond frustrated. All they offered was a 25% off voucher for my next flight with them (bold of them to assume I would even want to fly with this POS airline once more). I accepted and gave my email and they said they would send me the voucher in the coming days. I have yet to receive it. I called customer service and they told me they will not send me anything until I provide a confirmation number. I told them I have no such thing and they told me to go to the website where I booked my flight and retrieve it from them. After retrieving this, they tell me that they will not help me at all. I do not understand the way this airline operates at all. It is amazing how bad the customer service for this airline is. They simply do not care. It is ridiculous.

### “not worth it to get a better experience”
Had the worst experience as I was trying to make sure I was prepared by pre-paying my bags and I was charged twice for the same bag. The service at bag check made me pay an additional $69 US. For my golf clubs, they assured me I can get a refund for the original price. I paid already which which was close to $60. I called customer service and they refused to refund my original payment for the bag. Additionally, it took an extra 30 minutes for me to get my bag and I was in a rush once we arrived because the flight was delayed over an hour. For anything oversize, they will make you wait till every bag is off the carousel and then they go somewhere where you can’t go to retrieve your bag which takes so long. It made me late to my appointment and I will never fly with them again. I did not appreciate the customer service person was talking to me, in my opinion they are scam artist they are scam artists. Brought my water and everything onto the plane because I knew it was going to be bare bones But don’t fly it’s not worth it to get a better experience.

### "pay a bit more and AVOID it"
To those who think its a good idea to use this airline pay a bit more and AVOID it. Why? Here is a story that actually happened to me just now. So I booked a flight from Mexico city to Cancun online for the next day with Viva airlines. It sends me a confirmation email. I go to the airport, 2 hours before my flight I go to check in and I am told that my ticket got canceled. Why? Because apparently my card did not go through. I look at my online banking and the payment has been placed. I check my email, I see no notices that anything is canceled. I ask if I can pay again, they said no I have to call the call center. They give me a phone number to call. So I call and wait on hold for 40 minutes, then an agent answers and tell me that the system just canceled the ticket because they didn't get payment confirmation and a refund has been issued. Strange that a refund is issued considering they didn't get the money. I ask if I can pay online or with him, he says that I should go to the airport staff and ask them to do it there. The same airport staff that told me to call him! I explain that and ask why I didnt get any notices that my ticket is canceled. All I have is an email saying congratulations, everything is successfully booked. He said nothing and started to suggest other flights I can buy. Then he found availability at the flight that I booked yesterday but now he said he can't get a ticket on it because it's too late now to book in his computer but he said that if i go to the staff in the airport, they help me. Iask him what I should say to them. Silence. I ask if he wants to talk to them now because I could pass my phone to them and and then, he just hung up on me. Like actually hung up! So to people who want to use this airline just pay a little more and avoid it. You will end up paying more at the end. To people who run this company. 1) fire all your support staff and replace them with an AI chatbot because they are useless. 2) give the people in the airport an ability to resolve these matters or at least to sell tickets or just fire them all and put a machine to self check in. 3) adjust your automations so people get a notice if their ticket is canceled.

### "won‘t recommend the airline"
The staff was so rude and couldn’t care less that my luggage didn’t arrive at the final destination. It was kind of a fight to get it back the next day. Then I noticed that my backpack was severely damaged even though it was in a protection case. I e-mailed the airline twice to ask for a refund for the damage. Both times I got a confirmation e-mail that they received my message but they never replied to me. This incident shows that there is a lot of improvement in terms of customer service. I won‘t fly with Viva Aerobus anymore and for sure won‘t recommend the airline to friends.

### "worst airline for families"
Not Verified |   The worst airline for families, if you have children they take you and separate your family even if you pay extra to fly in front with extra legroom. Fly with any other airline even if you pay more, your family will not be separated specifically if you have small children. La peor aerolínea para familias, si tienes niños te llevan y separan a tu familia aunque pagues extra para volar delante con más espacio para las piernas. Vuela con cualquier otra aerolínea aunque pagues más, tu familia no quedará separada específicamente si tienes niños pequeños.

### "Absolutely horrendous experience"
Absolutely horrendous experience with this airline for an international flight. I lost hundreds of dollars due to rude and incompetent employees. My passport was reviewed at reception and I was told I could board my flight. At the gate, I was subjected to a random secondary search. The people who searched my bags yelled at me, threatened me, and disrespected my mother. After the search, the associates scanned my boarding pass and it came up invalid. They spent 15-20 minutes fiddling with my passport. Finally, they say I need to exit the hanger and go to immigration at the front of the airport. I ran there and back and they still didn’t let me on even though they let two people on before me. I begged them to let me on my flight and they ignored me, then told me it was my fault. I went to reception where they made me wait an hour for some manager who told me it was my fault I didn’t board my plane and they would not refund my ticket.

### "didn't let me board the flight"
These guys didn't let me board because of a tourist fee that i was not supposed to pay since i was just transiting through Cancun to go to my final destination of Vancouver. They said i had to pay $38, which i reluctantly agreed to but then there cc machine wouldn't work, and because of this, they didn't let me board the flight, and i missed my connecting flight from Cancun as well. I had to book an expensive flight the same day and these guys didn't even bother refunding the ticket for their flight, which they made me miss for no reason. Pathetic, never would i travel with this low cost carrier. Lesson learnt.

### "Would avoid if you can"
Basic as they come! Seats are virtually the plastic they're made of, with the thinnest bit of leather interior I've ever seen. Boarding is ridiculous - there is no strategy and took 40 minutes to board everyone. Tip for you - try making use of the rear doors if boarding with steps. Crew were a bit abrupt on both flights Mexico City - Tulum - Mexico City. The price they charge for checked luggage too is a disgrace - more than the flight! Would avoid if you can.

### "stay away from this airline"
Mexico City flight was on delay for about an hour, almost lost my connection fly from Monterrey to Houston. Once I arrive to Houston my luggage’s missing, file a delayed baggage report with the airline and they explain me that because of the delay they didn’t have any chance to move the luggage from one plane to the other (it’s understandable not a big deal). Wednesday January 3 the airline call me that my baggage’s are ready for me to pick it up in Dallas Texas airport - why Dallas? I live in Houston, they state that I’m authorized to send the luggage to Dallas. That is so ridiculous I live in Houston why I would send my luggage to Dallas (4 hours driving distance) today it’s January 6 and I still not have my luggage. Mexico office state that they are working with Dallas Airport to coordinate the luggage to ship back to Houston, Dallas office state that luggage’s where send back to Mexico so they can shipped to Houston. These people are idiots nothing that said it’s true they believe that they are doing a favor to us for using their services I have to call back January 7 to check again the status, to hear the same stupid answers since day 1. Please if you can, stay away from this airline it’s cheap but ain’t worth it. I will not use this airline ever!

### "losing my money for 3 fares"
This airline has a cancellation policy for purchase, which I thought was great. The only issue is the legal fine print. I am not able to cancel because my reason doesn't meet their criteria for cancellation, so I'm losing my money for 3 fares. And I have to pay for another ticket for myself and 2 others.! So now I have to double pay for tickets because this airline wouldn't allow me to switch the date of my flight...

### "First and last time I use this airline"
First time flying with this line was delayed. While waiting for a two hour delay then another 40 minutes total of 2:40 delay I was talking to other passengers they said they do this often. First and last time I use this airline

### “consistently proves to be a disappointmen
Not Verified | Don’t fly VivaAerobús, they consistently proves to be a disappointment with ridiculous delays, lost luggage, terrible communication and customer service. I have had lost luggage, open luggage, delayed flights etc… there was a 14 hour delay when I used it, will only use when there is no other choice, I prefer to pay more and not fly VivaAerobús, hopefully with some competition they will fade away.

### "customer service is nonexistent"
Not Verified |  I cannot stress my disappointment and frustration with this airline enough. The customer service is nonexistent. They will put you on hold and you’ll never progress. They will nickel and dime you more than any carrier I’ve ever flown. The counter staff will run from you rather than help or serve you. They will not make eye contact, and just say “there’s nothing we can do. Call customer service.” Then enjoy spending eternity on hold. Alternatively they will make up policies and change rules to excuse their inadequacy and complete lack of both service and professionalism. If there was ever an airline that embodied everything wrong with modern air travel and customer service combined, this would be it. Please run away before they rob you and run away themselves.

### "flights are horribly late"
It’s a scam. Not only their flights are horribly late (we waited 5 hours), they are also 20% overbooked and what’s worse - they scam you. We purchased space+ exit seats which cost us $50 USD extra. The plane was changed and we were given basic seats instead. When we tried to refund the money, they refused and told us that we actually purchased basic seats (even though the confirmation email clearly stated “space+”). Apary from that, their airport facilities are outdated and too tight. If you value your time and money, fly with Volaris instead,

### "very bad experience"
I do not recommend using this airline, very bad experience, after having spent an hour talking to customer service, I had to pay for another ticket besides mine to be able to carry my extra suitcases. Finally, when I am sitting on the plane, the representative comes and tells me that one of my suitcases had broken and that they had to put plastic bags in it so that my things wouldn't fall out. In short, a nightmare or rather it is a business to extract money from passengers when the plane was practically empty. Don't waste your time use another airline. No recomiendo usar esta aerolínea muy mala experiencia después de haber estado hablando una hora con el servicio al cliente tuve que pagar por otro boleto a parte del mio para poder llevar mis maletas extras. Finalmente cuando estoy sentado en el avion viene la representante y me dice que una de mis maletas se habia roto y que tuvieron que ponerle bolsas plasticas para que mis cosas no se salieran. En fin una pesadilla o mejor dicho es un negocio para sacarle dinero a los pasajeros cuando el avion estaba prácticamente vacio. No pierda su tiempo use otra aerolínea

### "No one would take responsibility"
We used Viva Aerobus to transport our cats from Colombia to Chicago. On the trip to Chicago, we had to receive the cats at the cargo section of the airport after midnight. Before the offices closed, we went to confirm that the location our Pet Services representative told us was correct and to talk with someone at the office to confirm that someone would be there to release the cats. Everything was confirmed. At the time of arrival, an employee was there to greet us. He left to receive the cats, but did not return until 4 in the morning- all the while we were sitting in a parking lot in the wee-hours of the morning. He claimed that no one would surrender the cats to him due to lack of paperwork (which was not true- our broker turned everything in). We went back to our hotel room after he told us we should come back at 8am when the office opened. At 6am, the cats' Airtags marked them back in Mexico- they had arrived to Chicago but then sent back to Mexico. Had it not been for the Airtags, no one would have known where the cats had gone! No one was at the airport in MX to receive them again. It took hours for anyone to confirm that they were in Mexico. No one would take responsibility for the mistake - and the story staff told us about the paperwork wasn't true as the cats would have already been returning to Mexico by the time we spoke with him. The cats returned to Chicago, 24 hours later and due to my diligence at the office all day, the workers at the office, Julio and Luis, made sure the cats were successfully released to me upon arrival. Due to this grave mistake, we needed to stay an extra night in Chicago, spend more money on food and lodging than expected. The cats were in terrible shape - they were extremely distraught and full of their own urine and fecal matter. The airline has not responded for any of the extra charges we assumed due to their error, nor to the toll their error had on our pets that were entrusted to their care.

### "Do not use this airline"
I showed up for my flight on time and my flight was delayed 2 hours. I waited patiently at the gate and when it was time to board, I noticed that my plane had not arrived. I went up to the rep at the gate and asked. Where was my plane and they told me it was delayed again and I had to wait? They didn't tell me that my flight was moved to a different gate. I called customer service and was told to go speak to a representative at the airport "where I checked in". The airport representative told me to contact customer service. Totally to run and now they tell me I have to buy a new ticket. Do not use this airline. I promise you they won't take care of you. They are scammers and don't care about their customers. Me presenté para mi vuelo a tiempo y mi vuelo se retrasó 2 horas. Esperé pacientemente a la puerta y cuando llegó el momento de abordar, noté que mi avión no había llegado. Subí al representante en la puerta y pregunté. ¿Dónde estaba mi avión y me dijeron que se retrasó nuevamente y que tuve que esperar? No me dijeron que mi vuelo fue trasladado a una puerta diferente. Llamé al servicio al cliente y me dijeron que fuera a hablar con un representante en el aeropuerto "donde me registré". El representante del aeropuerto me dijo que contactara al servicio al cliente. Totalmente para correr y ahora me dicen que tengo que comprar un nuevo boleto. No use esta aerolínea. Te prometo que no te cuidarán. Son estafadores y no les importan sus clientes.

### "voucher only lasts for 12 months"
I had a medical emergency and needed to refund my flight. They asked me for a 40% additional cash penalty to qualify for a "voucher" for the flight cost. To add a little more pain, the voucher only lasts for 12 months.

### "the chaotic circus you don't"
I urgently needed a flight from Mexico City to Quito. In haste, I overlooked any reviews and ended up with a truly "stellar" airline experience. Despite already paying for my ticket, I was bafflingly informed of an "outstanding balance" when checking in – the exact amount I had paid. A delightful glitch in the matrix. At the airport counter, they insisted the charge hadn't gone through and asked me to pay again, but only in cash and only in USD while at the Mexico City Airport. After a wild chase for an elusive USD-dispensing ATM and an entertaining markup fee, I returned, just for them to suddenly discover they could, in fact, accept credit cards. How convenient. In Cancun, they skipped mentioning a tucked-away office where I needed an exit stamp (see attached photo of unassuming office with no signage). At boarding, the agent seemed baffled I wasn't psychic enough to know this unspoken rule. All said and done, I sought refuge with Avianca for my next flight. They were once at the bottom of my list, but at least they managed the simple task of pointing out immigration. Moral? Sometimes the devil you know is better than the chaotic circus you don't.

### "the worst and should never be used"
My flight on 24 July 2023 from Tijuana to Mexico City left 3 hours late, and my flight on 31 July 2023 from Mexico City to Tijuana left 2 hours late. Viva Aerobus did not text or email notice of delays either time. On the 31st, I checked flight status online, saw that there was a 2 hour delay, and logically concluded it would be best to delay my arrival at the airport, rather than sitting around there for more hours. However, when I did arrive, with plenty of time to spare before the new, later flight time, I was told by the people at baggage check that baggage check was closed for this flight, had been for some time, since they'd been given a gate long before the new flight time. I had no idea this was a policy, nor that the flight would have a gate so soon before take-off, since my experience at this airport has always been the opposite--where the gate is not posted until just before the flight. Once the baggage check people managed to convey to me that they would not check my bag, they sent me on an incomprehensible wild goose chase through the terminal until one helpful person led me to a security check. At security check, employees proceeded to remove liquids from my bag (liquids I had intended to check through to my destination). These liquids included an expensive bottle of tequila I'd bought my brother as a gift for his 40th birthday. It was, of course, confiscated. At the gate, I was told to wait, for what ended up being about 40 minutes, when an Aerobus employee arrived to check my bag. I was reminded yet again that this bag was too big to be a carry-on (WHICH I KNEW, SINCE I'D PLANNED TO CHECK IT), and was then charged an additional 850 pesos for him to roll it down to the plane. I had already paid to check this bag when I bought the ticket, so this was yet another opportunity for Aerobus to squeeze cash out of me. I endured the usual flight discomfort, worsened by extreme thirst, since I had no time away from the gate to buy water, and since I refused to give Viva Aerobus any more money on-board. At Tijuana Airport, baggage claim was chaos, as our flight was posted for one belt, but employees there shouted us over to two other belts before returning us to the original one (a long time later) to finally get our bags. It was at this point that I discovered that the Viva Aerobus people had broken the retractable handle on my suitcase, making it nearly impossible to move through the airport and CBX. Conclusion: My Mexican friends were absolutely justified when they said this airline is the worst and should never be used. I know I will never fly Viva Aerobus again, and I will tell family and friends in the US to avoid it, as well.

### "Cannot recommend this airline"
Stay away unless you have an emergency . The worst loading procedure ever with the stewardess in the way for us loading our luggage in overhead bins. The stewardesses are just in the way during loading thinking they are helping you to stow your luggage! And if they load from the front and the back, what an issue with people going both ways in the middle! It appears 'on time' is not in their vocabulary! If you don't speak Spanish they people at the desks pretty much ignore you. We paid for exit rows and priority loading only to have it change within 30 minutes of loading. Will ask for a refund. The same thing happened on the first leg of the trip. Paid for supposedly priority and more leg room seats only to not get them. They made us check our carry on luggage when there was plenty of cabin room! The one thing they do right is they only let you load in your correct zone. Cannot recommend this airline to anyone! What a joke!

### "customer service is worthless"
Not Verified |  Both my wife and I were flying from Cancun Mexico with a final destination of Puerto Escondido. When the Viva Aerobús flight arrive Mexico City, my wife and I had over two hours to go to our next flight next-door Voláris. Viva Aerobús did not unload anyone’s luggage from the plane for over one hour because of their laziness we missed our flight and my wife and I both had to pay AeroMexico $1295 to fly to our final destination or spend the night sleeping in the floor of the airport. We complained directly to Viva Aerobus and no one cared. I just phoned their customer service and no one cared to even listen at all. This airline is completely worthless. It’s simply doesn’t care about their passengers or any of the service it delivers. Stay far away from this airline. It will give you nothing but headaches and problems. Their staff is lazy their customer service is worthless.

### "said I had missed my flight"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever. I do not recommend this airline. They over sell tickets. I arrived to the airport 2 hours before my departure and it took me 1 hour to get through TSA and to my gate. My flight would leave in an hour and Viva Aureobus said I had missed my flight. My daughter was in the same flight and she said the plane was full so that means they either sold my seat or accommodated someone else in my place. Employees were rude not reimbursing me or giving me any kind of credit. Never will I ever use this Airline ever again.

### "everything was great"
Not Verified | This is my second time flying with Viva Aerobus and both times I have been pleasantly surprised with my experience. It's a budget airline so it's typically cheaper than Aeromexico (Aeromexico = worst airline in the world), but the value to me has been so worth the experience. The gate staff was super efficient boarding everyone in and he seemed to go above and beyond to ensure a timely and organized boarding process. Most other Mexican airlines from my experience have been way more chaotic. The flight experience was great. I really have no complaints about this airline - everything was great!

### "I will never choose this airline"
Viva like other airlines have a 24 hour cancel deadline however with Viva, you have to cancel via phone. It takes 3 hours to get someone on the phone. Sometimes waiting takes very long and the line disconnects and you have start all over. I couldn't get someone on the phone and after 3.5 hours I went to sleep and tried again when I woke up. I was able to reach someone after 2 hours on the phone waiting however the 24 hours expired and they did not give me a refund. They do not give you a normal boarding pass, it is a little paper that looks like a receipt therefore it is hard to leave them verifiable bad reviews because their so called boarding pass does not resemble one. This airline is very unprofessional and they take your money and waste your time. I picked them because their fare was $50 less than everyone else. Big mistake, I will never choose this airline. Buyer beware.

### "The most irresponsible airline"
The most irresponsible airline I’ve ever seen. The staff are rude. I had two tickets for me and my husband. They clearly sold tickets to more people than they could. Either for our first flight from Cancun to Mexico city and our return flight, we faced the same problem. They are so irresponsible and disrespectful.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I was very sceptical about flying Viva due to the low rating online. However I was pleasantly surprised the plane was very comfortable, The crew was nice and friendly, The flights were on time and I had Zero Issues. I would definitely fly Viva again.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Stay away from this airline. Due to flight delay, I missed the connection flight and was put on a flight on the next day in the morning although there were flights on the same night. The airline sent a sms stating the delay was due to a technical problem. At the airport counter the personnel said it was instructed to say the delay was due to weather which was a lie because other flights in the same direction and at the same time took place on time. They refused any reimbursement for the hotel that was paid for at the destination, no accommodation for the night, no food, not even water on the plane. The personnel when confronting immediately lost the ability to speak English.

### "Don't fly with them"
Don't fly with them. I have flown with then twice this month and both times on my flight home, my flight was cancelled. The first time they were late and missed their time slot. The second time they overbooked the flight. The last straw was when they wouldn't let me order a beer with the dinner credit they gave me at the hotel they put us in. A free meal and drink was the only silver lining that I was looking forward to out of this entire situation and they tore that away. Don't fly with them.

### "absolutely not worth it"
Flying back to Houston through Monterey from Mexico City. When you arrive non stop to CDMX, immigration does not stamp your passport. They give you a paper receipt. When I go to fly back, I arrive at the airport and get in line at Viva’s counter. Their website does not allow you to get a boarding pass you must get in line. Then, they had me wait in line for 30 minutes only to tell me, because my connection is through Monterrey, I must go to another terminal to Vivas domestic counter. Wait in line again, only for them to say, I need to be in a different line. Finally 1.5 hours later I get my pass. The plane is cramped (I get it, it’s a budget airline) when you arrive at MTY, they have jetways, but they don’t use them. So you deboard on the tarmac. It was 97 degrees. Then they take you on a chaotic run through a tight busy terminal to a bus. You board and drive around the airport to a different terminal. Another long run through a worse chaotic terminal. At this point they say, “Houston?” Yes about 7 of us step aside. We wait for 10 minutes they aren’t explaining what or where is next. Finally, follow us. We walk the entire terminal to the farthest gate. I’m leaving out that at every one of these stops, they check all our documents. Multiple times. Now at the gate, they look at passports and declare we have to go to immigration because CDMX doesn’t stamp our passports. Walk the terminal again, checking documents multiple times, onto a bus, walk through another terminal, with multiple stops and checks. Immigration stamps the passport and we are told to walk to either gate 1 or 2. Which one? 1 or 2, it doesn’t matter. Walk back through the entire airport basically back to where we originally were, only to barely make the flight. I had 2 hours in between flights and that’s what it took. It was super chaotic, hot and crowded. Make certain you never fly through Mexico with a connecting flight. It’s absolutely not worth it. And I’ve flown to CDMX many times.

### "terrible experience with them"
This is the worst company I have ever flown in my whole life. I had a terrible experience with them in August last year while visiting Mexico City and trying to fly back to Puerto Vallarta. Their app is horrible and deceitful, and it caused me a big problem. I tried to pay for a carry-on bag through the app and, initially, it would not process the payment (about US$5) until it finally confirmed the payment for my carry-on. However, later on, when I arrived at my gate and was about to board the plane, they scanned my ticket and their system said my carry-on had not been paid for, even though the app showed me otherwise. Okay, it was a simple problem so I offered to pay for it again. Instead of charging me the $5 for the carry-on right there and then at the gate, just like any other airline would, they did not let me board the plane and said they could not receive any payments at the gate. They forced me to miss my plane because they would not let me pay $5 at the gate. When I got back to the check-in counter, their agent said: "We do not have any other flights for today. The next flight is tomorrow, and you will have to pay for the ticket again!

### "Avoid this airline like the plague"
Avoid this airline like the plague. First my flight was delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical issues we were told. My luggage was then lost. Never found. Viva Aerobus is refusing financial compensation. They have offered a small travel voucher. I live in a country that Viva does not fly to so it's worthless to me. According to the Montreal Convention I am entitled to a baggage fee refund and compensation for the contents of the baggage up to a certain limit. Viva is this far refusing. Nor did they offer any assistance while I was still travelling and had only the clothes on back and a few medical essentials in my carry on. They just didn't care

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. The airport employees are rude and have the worst attitude. They do not try and help and above it being their fault they get an attitude towards you. Even if you paid for insurance and coverage they do not respect their policies.

### "Avoid at all costs!"
I had flown with this airline on numerous occasions on the same route. Never had any major issues. I bought a ticket for my mom. I always do check in at home at least 12 hours before flight. But unfortunately the app and website didn't let me check in. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before take off and the woman at the counter asks us where we're flying and we tell her. Her response is you're not flying tonight. I'm like what do you mean? She says airline policy is you to arrive 3 hours before. I explained what happened with the error message and she rolls her eyes and calls another employee. He says the same thing. I ask well what about the ticket we purchased, with insurance. He says not our problem and gives us the 800 number to try to resolve the issue. So we start calling at the airport. Then a guy came up to us and said to do the checkin in the app because he had just done it. So clearly the flight was not closed. I tried in the app again but no luck. No one answered after an hour waiting. We left the airport because her flight left. At home I kept calling and another 50 minutes without any answer. So I had to buy my mom another flight because she had to be there the next day for her brother's funeral. I called early morning to try to get help with the refund. And i asked about their policy about flight closing, she stated it closes 1 hour before. When I asked the insurance they said the reason for missed flight was not under the 27 clauses and that I should of called an hour before take off. I said I did but they didn't answer. I called the 800 line at the same time another day and no answer. When I spoke to a supervisor I asked him "how am i at fault if their employees don't answer or do their job" he rudely said they always answer the line. So we bought insurance for nothing and forced to pay for an emergency flight. When I went to pick up my mom at the airport days later I went to the departures floor for the airline. I asked an employee about the flight closing policy and she again stated it closes 1 hour before. I asked to speak with a supervisor and she said he was "busy". So I left my name and phone number. It's been a week and no answer. This airline has the worst employees who don't do their job and aren't held accountable. Avoid at all costs!

### "wouldn't let me change my flight"
Tried to move my flight because I knew it was raining hard in LA and wouldn't be able to land. Airline wouldn't let me change my flight. Got on the flight and got to LA and circled around the air for two hours and re routed and landed in Tijuana at 12am. No announcements in English, only in Spanish. I didn't know what was going on and thought I landed in LA, to find out I'm still in Mexico. No voucher, no compensation. Employees kept lying to us about having the baggage and we had to wait 9 hours until 9am just to find out its still in Mexico City. No water fountain in bag claim area. They told us they're flying ppl out to LA in the morning and the people who waited for the flight actually got taken back to Mexico city not LA. Now I'm waiting at LAX to pick up my bags for two hours and the employee tells me I have to wait until all the check ins are done to get my bag.

### "Excellent airline"
Excellent airline, comfortable and doing the return trip in a few weeks. Purchased one way. We were given at the check-in excellent seats and that was great as I am tall.

### "our experience went better than expected"
I was a bit sceptical to purchase tickets based on reviews, but our experience went better than expected. I decided to leave a review because it seems like people only review when things go bad. We had a flight from NYC to CDMX and then to Oaxaca, and both flights were on-time and smooth, check-in was smooth, and checked luggage was received quickly. The cabin crew staff were very nice also. We enjoyed our flight. Obviously you pay for what you get. The seats don't recline, they're not as cushioned as other airlines, and you have to pay for food and drinks. My partner and I were aware of this so we prepared accordingly. If you're looking for an airline to get you to point A to point B safely, then VIVA is your go-to. If your looking for more comfort then go with another airline.

### "they lose your luggage"
This airline absolutely sucks with regards to operational practices. You'd think air travel was a new discovery in Mexico as no one seems to know what they're doing or even what their co workers are doing. Then just wait til they lose your luggage (2 bags) like they did for us. On a flight from Guadalajara to Vegas we had to switch to another Viva flight by waking a 1/4 mile outdoors at the Monterrey, MX Airport. I like exercise, but c'mon. We asked two staff about baggage and were assured it would be transfered. After over a dozen calls, most because they left my wife on hold then hung up on her, she was told one bag was found in Monterrey. Initially they said they'd get it to Sacramento then that story changed and Las Vegas would be the best they could do. Best advise as someone whose flown to Mexico a few times is, don't be cheap, buy a round-trip ticket with a major airline, preferably a direct flight.

### "I was extremely impressed"
I bought the tickets without reading any reviews, and so i was a little nervous after I had. I was extremely impressed after my four flights with Viva. The airfare was really affordable, the staff was great, all the planes were new and very clean, and we only had one small delay, (we were a half hour late returning to Chicago) but that is to be expected with any airline when flying in and out of Chicago in the winter. I plan on flying with Viva when we return next year.

### "I do not recommend VivaAerobus"
I had a family emergency and needed to fly home a day early. Viva refused to assist me in changing my flight or to apply some of what I paid to a new flight. $600 later for a one way flight back to Houston was upsetting but I needed to get home. After a 6 hour layover in Monterrey from Mexico City, Viva Aerobus lost my luggage when I arrived at IAH Houston airport. This was 2 days ago, multiple attempts to contact them with no reply. I was given two numbers to call which do not work and no response to my emails. I am extremely disappointed with the customer service and lack of communication and would like my luggage returned to me. I do not recommend VivaAerobus.

### "To avoid at all costs"
By far the worst airline I’ve ever deal with I would not take another of their flights not even for free. In 2023 an international flight with no electric outlets and seats that don’t recline. To avoid at all costs.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline. I've heard bad comments about this airline but I wanted to give it a try. I regret it now. The make you wait for hours, flight was delayed for almost 4 hours. Terrible customer service, I got stolen from my checked luggage and not one employee could give me any information on how to proceed with a report or claim. And then the only reimbursement they offered was a certificate to use with the airline. I ain't flying with this airline ever again!

### "unless I fork in more money, I can't fly back"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight in the summer of 2022. They modified my 3-day flight 3 times to the point in which I was not even going to stay there for a full 24 hours. I wanted a refund, and they asked for my American bank's swift code to process such refund. I hung up to call my bank and retrieve it. I then called the airline back, and they said they could no longer refund me and they had sent a voucher for both me and my daughter. I was upset, but called again in September to book the flight and use the voucher for new year. The man I spoke to, booked my 5-day flight for us both, round trip and said I even had a $200 balance, since January is cheaper than the summer. I just checked and there is no scheduled flight and no credit or voucher. I spoke to another agent who said on his end, he can see the credit I have but it only covers the flight to Cancun, not the flight back, and I had a $100 balance, and that in order to fly back, I would have to pay an additional $300! I had already paid $600 back in the summer just for the flight. I have the original email with my round flight status and $200 extra balance, yet they can't find it, so unless I fork in more money, I can't fly back.

### VivaAerobús customer review
The new A321 NEO aircraft boarded on time and the cabin was spotlessly clean. The flight attendants helped people stow their bags and were friendly and efficient. The flight was full. We left Merida on time and arrived at Tuxtla Gutierrez on time. The rows were somewhat close together, but the 90-minute flight was not uncomfortable. On VIVA Aerobus, passengers pay for refreshments, and there were few takers. Checked baggage was delivered by the time we arrived at baggage claim.

### "do not know about customer service"
The flights delayed for 2 and connection 3 hours. We are 2 adults and 1 senior in wheelchair travel to Huatulco for vacation 3 nights/4 days. Because our bags has important medication for two people with health conditions and did not arrive we have called many times and emails to [email protected]. , but it did not work never either! We did not have luggage for 3 days. Additional that it was VivaAerobus mistake they did not sent them to the Resort. We must travel 45 minutes in taxi to pick up them on last day of our trip. VivaAerobus do not know about customer service. They trained employees to make excuses and pass the situation like ping pong. Nevertheless, the beaches of Huatulco are amazing and its people is very helpful and kind.

### "just horrible, no respect"
I heard bad comments and reviews about this airline but I decide to try I purchase my ticket and was a good price. Later I found that I had to pay for luggage so I pay, then the boarding time was scheduled for 9:13am, and departing time at 9:48am. I was doing my checking at 7:00am, then I was notified by the attendant that my flight was delayed 1 hour so I assume 10:48am departure time - I check the fly status and it’s departing now until 12noon. No one explains anything this airline it’s just horrible, no respect, no care for customers etc. I wouldn’t use this terrible airline anymore even if it’s the cheapest.

### "ignoring standard fees for a checked bag"
Not Verified |  This airline charges whatever they see fit to make a profit by completely ignoring the standard fees for a standard checked bag. It's a complete abuse to us consumers and we are forced to pay because we can't leave the luggage. I was charged $140 for a basic international checked bag weight. No one helped, no respect, they lied and show no respect. No one is organized, and i had to argue with someone to get a wheelchair for my mom! A Basic right for someone with a disability. Complete abuse and lack professionalism. Will never use this airline.

### "their staff is pathetic"
I have traveled so much on different airlines and they have never treated me like they did on this airline. I mean that this airline "VivaAerobús" is the most terrible to treat its passengers. They sell all the services online and oversell the tickets. I bought a ticket from Houston to Mexico 1st class, as it was VIP! for October 14, 2022. The day before I did my checking and paid for my luggage and seat. Grab my boarding pass! I show up at the airport 3 hours before. First the flight was delayed and when boarding they said that my boarding pass had a problem and with me other people. The manager had assigned my room because I missed the flight! When I was in the front row to board as a VIP! They are thieves and their staff is pathetic! I give it 1 star and they don't deserve it! Be careful when you choose an airline like this to travel!

### "wait in line for hours to check-in"
I’d give them a big fat zero if I could. We arrived at Huatulco airport for our flight going back to LAX via Mexico City. Our connecting flight to Mexico City was supposed to leave at 3:20pm (flight 1093). We were in the check in line at 1:30pm. By this time there was already a long line for the check in counter. Problem was, there was no employee attending the counters. Checked the departing board and it had our flight delayed by 3-1/2 hours! Our flight for 3:20 has been bumped to 7pm. Three tour bus full of people came in to check in for their flight to Guadalajara that leaves at 4pm. They only started manning their counters at 1:45pm. At a certain point they realized they needed to check the Guadalajara people in so these people could make their flight. People who had the Mexico City flight was stopped from checking in and we had to wait 3 hours in line until they got through with the Guadalajara people. When they finally opened the counter for check in to the Mexico City flight, we got checked in but not given a seat. This lead us to question why we do not have a seat. We were told that the flight is full. We asked if that means we were on stand by. The counter person said yes. We asked “does this mean we can get bumped off of this flight?” He said yes. This guy did not even have the courtesy to give us this information! We had to ask! He wasn’t being upfront! When we asked why this was so, he said the flight is full. He started to help the people behind us and said he will help us after he helps these people. We let him proceed with them and when he was done, he started helping the next people in line and completely disregarded us. We’ve asked for someone else to help us and we were told that someone will be coming in 10 minutes. It has been an hour and we are still waiting. We have a connecting flight in Mexico City that we will surely miss at this point. There is only one flight out of Mexico City to LAX serviced by Viva Aerobus per day. Do these people care that we will miss our connecting flight? Do they care that we will miss at least a day’s worth of pay? Or have important things to attend to? Or that they need to, at the very least, give us the courtesy of the information that we can get bumped off from this flight, even though we’ve fully paid for it? Viva Aerobus has rude people manning its counters, they make you wait in line for hours to check-in, then bump you off the flight even though you’ve fully paid for it. And they don’t even have the courtesy of giving you that information.

### "the worst flight attendants"
These are the worst flight attendants. This is my 6th flight in the last month and what happened to customer service. I’m 41 and have never written a bad review on an airlines. And to top it off it’s the same flight attendants every time so you can’t even get a nice new face - same faces all the time.

### "Take any airline other than VivaAerobus"
Could not have been worse flight if I had planned it. Book the flight a month in advance flying from Veracruz Mexico to Houston and three weeks later return to Veracruz from Houston. The original airline ticket was leaving Veracruz going to Guadalajara Mexico and then from there into Houston. I knew there would be a layover in Guadalajara as I have friends in Guadalajara I plan to go to dinner with them, so there was a three hour layover in Guadalajara. Coming back I planned on leaving Houston at 4 o’clock in the afternoon arriving at Guadalajara at 6:30 in the evening and had another flight out of Guadalajara to Veracruz landing in Veracruz at 10:30 PM. A week before the flight I got an email that said there was going to be a change because of flight operations and I was then flying out of Veracruz and going to Monterey have a three hour layover in Monterey and then into Houston. I was not happy about it but things happen and I realize that. Then my return trip from Houston into Veracruz what a nightmare. Was supposed to leave Houston at 4:30 in the afternoon headed to Guadalajara and then from there to Veracruz. Three days before my trip I got another email from the airlines saying that they had rerouted my trip and now I was headed from Houston IAH to Monterey with a 10 hour layover. So I never did make it to Guadalajara instead I spent the entire time at the airport in Monterey. And I am actually writing this review at the airport. Now here’s the real nightmare when I went into Monterey I had to go through immigration which let me out into the main part of the airport so I went outside to have a smoke then came back in to eat lunch, the place I wanted to eat was upstairs next to the Gates called Texas fine foods. Went back in through security and was told I cannot enter the airport until three hours before my flight. I am now sitting outside of the Monterey airport in hundred degree weather waiting for seven hours till I can get in to the airport. Take any airline other than VivaAerobus.

### "just pay a little extra and book with another airline"
Simply put, just pay a little extra and book with another airline. They find a way to charge you for everything and do everything very slowly. I don’t think people with connecting flights made their next flight. The flight was very late. There was no need for that. The screen said it was on time, so anybody who got to the counter was probably stressed out. However, it is 9.08 and we are still here. It’s supposed to leave at 8.30. Not worth it. Just pay a little extra from the get-go. They’ll find a way to get it from you anyway.

### "don’t want to fly with this airline again"
They are not that cheap to not even offer water to the passengers. I asked for a cup of water to take a pill and they gave me water from the sink. I couldn't believe they did that. Even the water is for purchase. Also, they offer a wifi that doesn’t really work. The only good thing about my flight was that we made it on time to LAX even though it was delayed for 30 mins the fly from Mexico City. I don’t want to fly with this airline again.

### "saying that I had not paid for my flight"
I bought 2 plane tickets for a flight on May21, and received a reservation confirmation that day. However, on the day of the flight, I was unable to check in, with a message saying that I had not paid for my flight. This was untrue, as my bank showed a successful transaction on May 21 and no issues had come up since then. I also received no emails or error messages. We immediately tried calling Viva, but the phone line hangs up about 5-7 minutes into the call (confirmed by anyone else who has tried to contact them). Also tried messaging. So, we got to the airport as early as we could, stressing because we didn't know what was going on. When we got to the airport, we were refused check in, then had to go across the airport to the ticket sales counter, and argued with 30 minutes a with a rude employee telling us that our tickets had been canceled due to "fraudulent activity. Funny that the fraudulent activity was only flagged on the day of the flight. I then had to pay over $USD1100 to make a new booking (original tickets were $380) and make it home in time -- I had no other option as we needed to get home for work and it was the last flight of the day. The employee could have simply let me re-pay for the original tickets at the very least so it could be easily disputed with my credit card, but she was too careless to understand the situation and knew we were desperate. After she started ignoring us completely for about 10 minutes of me trying to come up with a solution with her, we felt we had no other option. So Viva forced us to buy new tickets. We boarded the flight, which was marked as completely full, but with 2 seats empty (our seats). I have been trying to contact them for the past 2 weeks for hours a day. I get hung up on after 5 minutes of waiting, and have received no response from them even though I have tried contact form, email, Facebook, and Instagram. My partner has also tried Twitter. Save yourself this nightmare and don't take the risk of buying from Viva Aerobus.

### "The worst airline that can exist"
The worst airline that can exist, the prices are cheap but in the end it can be more expensive, buy 3 tickets 2 or 3 months in advance and since I don't care where I sit, I didn't pay to choose the seats, big mistake, upon arrival to the airport and check in, as I did not pay to reserve the seats, which is not justification, they put you on standby, and with all the nerve they told me that they oversell the tickets because the seats are not assigned, but yes, the ticket is already paid, they force you to pay for the seat if you don't want your flight to be cancelled. No airline requires you to forcefully buy a seat if they don't put you on standby. La peor aerolínea que puede existir, los precios son económicos pero al final te puede salir más caro, compre 3 boletos con 2 o 3 meses de anticipación y como me da igual donde me sienten no pague por escoger los asientos, gran error , al llegar al aeropuerto y hacer el check in , como no pague por reservar los asientos , lo cual no es justificación , te ponen en stand by , y con todo el descaro me dijieron que sobrevenden los boletos por no estar los asientos asignados, pero eso si, el boleto ya está pagado, te obligan si o si a pagar por el asiento si no quieres que te cancelen el vuelo. Ninguna aerolínea te exige que a fuerzas compres un asiento si no te dejan en stand by.

### "will not accommodate handicapped passengers"
Incompetent ground staff. They cannot or will not accommodate handicapped passengers. I have flown in numerous developing countries and had more confidence in their airlines.

### "Do not recommend this airline"
The worst experience ever! The flight attendant took my carry on and documented to Mexico City. She gave away my cabin space to someone else. I lost my connecting flight, I had to sleep at Mexico City airport and it cost me an additional $295. I emailed corporate all I got back was the luggage dimensions. Not a real answer. My carry on was fine within size. I don’t understand why they give away your cabin space to other passengers I asked in my email no one ever answered. Do not recommend this airline at all. Spend a few extra dollars on Aeromexico they are the best.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. The worst customer service. I usually travel every three months to different destinations, with different airlines. In truth, if you plan to travel, do not do it on this airline. The employees do not give any information, they delay your flight, they do not tell you why, if they want to cancel or change your flight, they do not let you, they tell you that due to policies they do not return your money. On the airport screen the flight says on time and on the app it says delayed. Airline crap. They do not apologize to the passengers. Esta es la peor aerolínea con la que e viajado. El peor servicio al cliente. Suelo viajar cada tres meses hacia diferentes destinos, con diferentes aerolíneas. En verdad que si piensan viajar no lo hagan en esta aerolínea. Los empleados no dan ninguna información, te retrasan el vuelo no te dicen porque, si quieren cancelar o cambiar tu vuelo no te dejan, te dicen que por políticas no te devuelven tu dinero. El la pantalla del aeropuerto el vuelo dice a tiempo y en la aplicación dice retrasado. Una porqueria de aerolínea. No se disculpan con los pasajeros.

### "for the fourth time the flight time change is ridiculous"
Not Verified |  I bought tickets for a family of 5 and since that time they have been changing the flight time, it's understandable the first time but for the fourth time the flight time change is ridiculous. I called Customer service and they don't care about passengers. They mention the terms and conditions meaning that they can move your flight time anytime they want but really one time is acceptable but four times and when you decided to estimate another itinerary they want to charge you 5 times the original ticket price.

### "never fly this airline"
Mexico City to Chicago. WARNING never fly this airline. The luggage was 3lbs overweight. So we paid extra. The luggage never made it back to Chicago. Someone from the O'Hare luggage carousel 6 from last night's flight basically looked me right to my face and said “I would NEVER use this airline myself”. I will likely never see my luggage again but not will they ever see my business. My wedding is at the end of this year and I already told everyone to pick any OTHER airline over this sorry excuse for one.

### "told there were no seats available"
Not Verified |  The night before our departure (husband, 3 children and myself) I tried to check-in. The message I was getting was "check-in at airport". We arrive at the airport 3 hours ahead of our departure time only to be told there were no seats available and that I had not "purchased seats". Then what did I purchase, my airline indicated the time and date of our departure? I can care less where they sit us. This was the way for them to try and justify that fact that they had oversold airline tickets. Then another agent proceeds by saying "all airline over sell tickets b/c sometimes passengers don't show up" What do they care if passengers show up or not, that's not their business, the ticket was bought and paid for? My friend and her two young girls were traveling on the same flight. One of her daughter's ticket "supposedly" indicated it was for an infant so they made her purchase another airline ticket, mind you an agent had already told us there were "NO" seats available, but get this another passenger had purchased an airline ticket and selected her seat only to find out she wasn't going anywhere either. They didn't even have the courtesy to reimburse us. All they could do was beg other passengers to volunteer to stay behind so that my family and I could board. They got us on the next flight, but no compensation. We had a commitment to attend and we unfortunately missed my cousin's wedding rehearsal dinner due to the airlines fault.

### "I've been waiting 2 months. Avoid!"
We arrived at Cancun airport for our flight to Mexico City. Once at the gate we became aware that there was a delay to the flight. There was no information, the screen just went blank. We got told we would be departing from a different gate in a hour, this led to several gate changes and what ended up being a 5 hour delay. We were going to miss our flight back to London so we didn't get on the flight. Mexican consumer law means we are entitled to a refund as the delay was more than 4 hours, VivaAerobús acknowledge that we are owed a refund however getting that refund is impossible. They don't reply to emails, the only way I can get a response is on Twitter where they tell me the refund is being processed and will take 10 days. I've been waiting 2 months. Avoid!

### "change their flight times constantly"
They change their flight times constantly and cost the flyer lots of money. Their inability to keep their schedule cost me an additional $200 (extra time at the hotel, extra time with the rental, extra day at the parking lot)!!! Plus, to make matters worse, their inconsiderate blunder made me get home at 4 am!! I was supposed to be home at 8pm the latest.

### "I am generally pleased with their service"
Never had any issues with Viva Aerobus, the new website and app are miles better than the old ones. They do still seem to have a problem sending SMS / push notifications when your flight is delayed, however, as does their competitor, Volaris. Unsure what gives with that. The check-in staff and cabin crew were very nice. I think if you pay for the flexi package you certainly get your money's worth, especially being able to skip the check-in queues which can take an hour sometimes. For a low cost carrier I am generally pleased with their service.

### "Please no one fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  I don’t recommend no one to fly with VivaAerobús, 1st we had our plane, seat, & lounge tickets paid since January 2022, have in mind we don’t have our passports so every ending of every month until our flight I called and made sure we were good to fly with out them they had mentioned we were fine to fly with out them. Our flight was on Thursday March 24 2022 once we arrived at the Reynosa Airport they made us pay to take a bus down to Monterrey airport because supposedly since the 1st of March they came up with a new law that no one can fly from border airlines without their passports, but we would have understood if they would sent us an email, phone call, text or even let us know thru our app about the changes made but nothing at all, we had to find out once we arrived at the Reynosa airport. After all this mess we get to Monterrey by bus, their they delay our next flight for 13hrs to Cancun and once we get their we have to repay our paid lounge because they stated the lounge was payed from the flight from Reynosa to Cancun. After the long wait and unnecessary travel we arrived in Cancun at 1am. Once after our vacation on our returning flight we get to Cancun airport and once again our flight, seat, & lounge is paid for to return to Reynosa let me remind you we had our seat # & paid for. Once we get their they give us a layover ticket even after I showed they in our app our seats placed. This airline really tried to give away our check in seats away. So much stress & hassle, as we tried to talk to a supervisor they would only repeat they couldn’t help and we had to wait for our layover tickets. Please no one fly with this airline their nonsense!

### "agent was so incredibly nice"
Everyone was incredibly nice, but specially one person was over the top her name is krisleys Pontojo I think. My first plane with another airline was two hours late to get to Mexico City so I was barely able to catch my plane but I couldn’t wait for my luggage so I couldn’t check in my luggage with vivaAerobus. When I got to Los Angeles I report my luggage with the other airline but they said that they were only responsible for my luggage to be delivered only until Mexico City and that since I paid $46 for my luggage with vivaAerobus they said I should file a report with them even though wasn’t able to check in my luggage with vivaAerobus. I still haven’t got my luggage but the agent was so incredibly nice that she made me forget all my frustration.

### "This is the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline, they will cancel your flight with zero notice because their flights are not full and then they make an excuse that the airport you are flying to is closed or immigration will be closed when you get there. They will not refund your money under any circumstance and will say the flight was cancelled and it was your fault that you did not board the plane.

### "were so kind and helpful"
Not Verified |  After looking at the reviews from viva me and my friends were a little skeptical to ride on Vivaaerobus. However it was the best experience given our situation. Our frontier flight was cancelled so we booked on VivaAerobús very last minute with a layover in Guadalajara. The workers that checked us in, the flight attendants and everyone else were so kind and helpful. They lost a bag but contacted the main person in our group to tell us what was going on, then did everything in their power to find the bag. Once the bag was located we were notified and the workers were so apologetic. With everything that had gone wrong with our trip, VivaAerobús was the only thing that went perfectly smooth.

### VivaAerobús customer review
Not Verified |  Realized I needed to cancel my flight 2 days after. I called and waited and they said zero fare policy, no supervisor, call again tomorrow. So I did, they say it's now 48 hours so no refund, also no supervisor, call on the day of flight and get $50 back. So I called again today. Got hung up on by someone in Monterrey. Called again and agent says no supervisor and try again tomorrow. He says there was only one note on my account and I joked it probably says crying lady wants her money back. He says not everything is about money and when I tell you, having to explain that I wouldn't keep calling if I could afford the $200 ticket price loss. Never buy from VivaAerobus. Other airlines offer flexibility or at least some humanity. The 7 or 8 employees I have talked to sound like they know the company is awful. You have choices. Do not choose VivaAerobus. First and last time I ever make this mistake.

### "canceled our flight one day before traveling"
Viva Aerobús canceled our flight one day before traveling. Therefore, they changed everything for us, hotel, car rental, and we ended up paying donle. And of the luggage they charged us double. Viva aerobús nos canceló el vuelo un día antes de viajar. Por lo tanto nos cambió todo, hotel, renta de carro, y terminamos pagando donle. Y Del equipaje nos cobraron doble.

### "they leave when they decide to leave"
The flight was scheduled for 8:05pm and about 30 minutes before that time a gate assigned. Not long after I got to the gate a garbled verbal announcement was made. I went to the Viva office who confirmed it had been delayed until 10:30pm. At 9:45 the notice board said the flight time was 11:30pm. I arrived at the gate just before 11pm just as the gate notice board changed to indicate the plane had lifted off- 30 minutes before the time indicated. By the time I found my way to their customer service desk there were still about a dozen very angry customers still in line, having missed connections, forfeited hotels and car rentals. When I got to the desk they put me on a flight the next morning. No apology, no explanation of what happened. All I can say is wow - they leave when they decide to leave. And here I am spending the night in the airport.

### "worst airline I have ever traveled"
Hands down worst airline I have ever traveled on! I bought my ticket round trip for 500 usd which is a normal price for practically all airlines but seemed the cheapest. After that I paid for baggage (turns out it was only for a carry-on) so I had to pay for my bag at the airport. Not only was it 110 usd for a bag, but terrible service. After that on my trip back, I tried to buy a bag online to which it said I had one already. Turns out I didn’t and guess who paid in total 220 usd for 1 bag. In total I paid 720 usd for a flight from Mexico to NY (normally around 450 usd) Also no food or beverages, no entertainment, nothing on board.

### "had no issues and I would fly it again"
We usually fly Southwest when flying within the US, but when flying from Cancun to Puerto Vallarta we had to take this local low cost airline. Honestly we had no issues and I would fly it again. The line was very long to check our bags, but we knew it probably would be and arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes before our departure. It took almost an hour to get through the line to check our bags, but we saw that they would announce flights leaving soon and pull passengers out of line to check their bags so they could make their flights. Which was a nice touch because I feel like a lot of airlines in the US wouldn't do that, and if you miss your flight, "tough luck, you should've arrived sooner. The plane was nicer than a lot of Southwest airplanes with plenty of leg room in our row (which was 29). One issue though: I paid for seat assignments when I booked the flight, and for some reason it reassigned our seats prior to check in and split our party of 3 up. Wasn't a huge deal bc I realized it when I went to check us in and was able to pick new seats for us 3 to be together. However, we had seats in the 8th row originally, then it had to be the 29th row. Being a person who doesn't speak a ton of Spanish, which would be necessary to speak to an agent about it, I can see that this may have been an issue if I weren't able to change our seats online to be together.

### "at the end is the expensive and worst one"
I paid for my carryon when I booked my ticket since this airline charge you for everything extra, when I was ready to boarding the woman in counter told me my bag was 5 lbs overweight and I had to pay 20033.00 pesos which is $100.14 American dollars, so I had to pay that ridiculous amount since I had no choice. Please be aware if you don’t overpay in advance even you might not need it you can ended up paying a fortune for few pounds extra. Don’t use this airline if you think is the cheapest one because at the end is the expensive and worst one.

### "Worst Airline"
I purchase my tickets since March for a December flight. Worst decision ever. They canceled my flight with out notification spend more than 24 hours at the airport trying to get back home. No compensation. Worst Airline.

### "The service is really bad"
Not Verified | The service is really bad, delayed the flight about 4 times whit out having a representative telling us. Seats on the airplane are very uncomfortable, no tv or radio. They sell all the snacks and drinks and the flight wasn’t cheap, it was a regular price in other airlines. Also they charge you for all the luggage, the reality is that this supposed to be a cheap flight but is expensive and bad services in all. Our flight was scheduled to board at 6:30 pm we boarded at 12:00 am at the far end where is not a tunnel, just stairs to get in the airplane with kids and we have to carry our luggage on stairs to get to the plane, it was a nightmare.

### "oversold, no seats available"
Worst experience ever, don't waste your money, Worst customer service, professionalism, no ethics at all / no respect after checking in couldn't board my flight, airline tickets were oversold, no seats available. Had to get other flights for next day and flights in between because was the only flights available.

### "Hands down the worst airline I've ever used"
Hands down the worst airline I've ever used. I trusted someone else to book my flight for a Cancun trip from TJ and this will be the last time I will let someone else book my flight. Before the day of departure they changed our times multiple times and canceled our flights just to have us rebook the exact same flights with different flight numbers. They do not provide water nor snacks on the flights. When they have delays they don't tell you anything about why the flights are delayed. They caused me to miss my connecting flight due to a 3hr delay. They changed our flights from a 2-3hrs layover to 12hrs layover. 5hrs flight with no water provided. I will never use them again.

### 2I would not recommend this airline"
The people at the Monterey airport were very rude. I had a connecting flight and they tried to charge me almost $200 just because I happened to go over by 2pounds over weight on my carry on. When I tried to distribute my items to lose to pounds they decided to weigh the other peoples items just to make me feel bad and on top of that they did not let me take any food overboard and made me throw all of it away. I would not recommend this airline, staff are very rude and none of them did the slightest thing to help instead tried to guilt trip me. Avoid airline if possible I know its cheap but their costumer care is always in a bad mood and will do about anything to charge you extra.

### "Terrible and rude customer service"
Not Verified |  Cancelled my flight twice, both the day of a couple of hours before. They never refunded me, was forced to buy day of flights that were over $500, the flights that weren’t cancelled all got delayed and my last flight got switched gates 3 times all while we were supposed to be boarding. Terrible and rude customer service in person and non-existent online. Never ever ever again.

### "Don’t take a risk with this airline"
Not Verified |  This airline is a criminal enterprise. They moved my flight up by 10 hours and sent me a notification about the update 2 hours after the new departure time. How is this even legal? Don’t take a risk with this airline, because they will just steal your money.

### "They are unreliable"
I had a flight from Tijuana to Puerto Escondido on November 5th. First, they delayed the flight a few days before, which is pretty typical of them. When I was in the terminal everyone was confused on which flights were flying from which gate and there were no employees there to help at the kiosks. After an hour of being in the terminal I was able to find my gate, which wasn't showing the correct information or have someone manning the kiosk. When the flight was delayed another hour, no one told all of us waiting through any means of communication, we all had to swarm the attendant when he walked by. Our flight was delayed another hour and an hour after that it was canceled. The front kiosk gave everyone a number to call, which did not work and told everyone to go to the front check in to ask questions. I waited for three hours to talk to someone at the front desk and literally all she gave me was the same faulty phone number and as option to have my flight for 11.30pm 2 nights later. Everyone was upset and some people had their flights canceled two nights in a row and no compensation for the inconvenience. I didn't trust the airline to actually have a flight that would be reliable so I flew back home from San Diego. VivaAerobus claimed the reason for the cancellation was the fog, but I literally flew out of San Diego a few hours later, an hour away. Some planes were still landing at Tijuana and there wasn't much fog. The worst part was trying to get a hold of the company. I had been calling and trying different menus for hours in the airport and talking in circles with the bot. Whenever I got a hold of someone, they would transfer me and drop my call. Terrible communication and it's impossible to get a real person. When I finally reached the manager, they helped very little and only gave a refund on the flight they canceled, not the flight that I had as my return (which I couldn't even use since I wasn't there!) Overall a terrible experience with both the airlines at the airport, the manager, and the call center. Don't use this airline if you want to get somewhere within a couple of days. They are unreliable and don't compensate when they don't deliver on their promises.

### "an attempt to charge you extra"
Do yourself a favor, when they ask you to line up to check bags before boarding, just skip it. It's only an attempt to charge you extra. I had a backpack and a ukulele with me. I was told at the check in counter that the ukulele was fine. Then in this second bag check line the guy said I had to pay a $599 peso fee ($30 USD) for special handling of the instrument. I was not happy about this as the instrument is much smaller than the majority of the carry ons that people had. I didn't have a choice, the instrument wasn't even mine, I was bringing it for a friend. I paid the fee thinking they were going to put it somewhere secure for me. No, I showed the stewardess my receipt and she said just put it in the overhead. Seriously? Then what was the fee for? I put it in the overhead and it fit perfectly front to back. They were just making a grab for extra fees. I was angry, I should have never gotten in that line. I have messaged Viva Aerobus asking for a refund. I doubt I get it. I will try to dispute the charge with my card, because you can't charge a "special handling fee" and do nothing for it.

### "not received my money back"
VivaAerobus cancelled my two flights a day before my flight. The options they gave did not work for me. I had to cancel and buy very expensive tickets with another airline, since Last minute flights are so expensive. It took me 40 minutes on the phone to get a refund, which was not automatically made to the card I used to buy, but a bank refund (why?) I was told to expect my refund in 7-10 days. Two weeks later I have not received my money back.

### "I am not at all impressed"
As a travel agent, I enjoy testing different airlines. This is my first experience with Viva Aerobus, and I have to say, I am not at all impressed. My flight houston to Huatulco was changed by the airline - to a flight it isnt even possible for me to make as i wont even land in Houston until 3pm. (new flight at 10am) After 3 customer service calls, i ended up getting a voucher - it wont be available to use for 3 days. they could not rebook me Houston - Monterrey - Huatulco, even though there are flights available. The USA customer service line does not work, i had to call the Mexico customer service line (yes there is an English option) they would not issue a refund, even though this is a change they did they would only issue a voucher, agent #2 said the voucher is good for a year, agent #3 said the voucher is good for 120 days now I have to wait 3 days to use the voucher to do the Houston to Monterrey to Huatulco

### "better fly Volaris"
Second time flying with them (first one was from CDMX to Los Cabos), and the company also delayed its flight. Its cheap, but better fly Volaris, sure indeed.

### "terrible customer service"
Had trouble booking reservations took for ever to get them to charge card. Then had a reservations and showed up to LAX to check in to be told we had no reservations even though we had a VivaAerobús conformation number and a picture of the email. The ticket agents in LAX then said they wouldn't help us we had to call but no one to call and help us so luckily volaris had a flight leaving 20 min later so we just flew them. So unhelpful and terrible customer service. This is the 2nd time they have pulled stuff on us.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Not Verified |  Worst travel experience imaginable. Purchased my flight for my family received email confirmation. Checked my bank statement and the total cost of the trip was deducted from my debit card. Arrived to the airport 3 hours in advance as I was traveling with a group and returning a rental from hertz that I purchase with the exact same debit card as my families tickets. When I arrived to check in , was informed our flights were canceled due to an issue with my card. Ticket counter advised to call customer service Called my banking institution first, they assured me nothing was wrong with my account and to check with the vendor Called the airline. Spoke to customer service, i was informed nothing could be done and my funds would return in 3 days. I begged for a solution as I was stranded. Customer service instructed me nothing could be done. I was told the situation was my fault and to sleep in the airport until my funds returned if necessary. No travel credit, nothing. Never have I ever been treated so poorly. I called volaris airlines after and they provided me with a solution because they cared about keeping me as a customer. My family went home same day thanks to another airline. Vivaaerobus is the worst service you can choose for you and your family especially as I foreigner traveling in Mexico. Avoid at all cost.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Our flight (flight 167) was suppose to depart at 10:50am, but due to technical issues we were inside the plane up to un hour with no A/C inside, until they decided that we to leave the plane. The next option was to wait until next flight which was until 8:30pm. So we decided to wait until then, but we did ask for a food benefit due to it was a technical issue on their side, they just said we take care of if just be patient. Long story short, it has been more than 6 hours and we still haven’t received any food. I spoke with the manager, which by the way the Manager was pretty rude, because when I went to ask her what was happening, she just continued saying they were still working on it, so obviously told her that was not enough, that they were leaving a whole flight without food. And she just: “you can place a complaint with customer service”, like if that was going to resolve the issue. By the other hand, how is it possible they they don’t have spare planes or have support with other airlines to cover each other’s back when needed. This has been the worst airline ever.

### "Worst traveling experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst traveling experience ever! First my flight time was changed with no notice whatsoever, second I arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to my flight only to be told that I didn’t have a seat and was possibly going to have to take a later flight. Once given my assigned seat, it took an hour to board. Very unorganized and very rude staff. Never again will I travel with this airline.

### "wouldn’t let my dog on board with me"
Not Verified |  I flew to Mexico City from New York City with my dog. He was in his carrier and under the seat the entire time without issue. He was checked in at JFK International Airport, again, with no problem. Our flight itself was delayed an hour because the arriving plane was late and then it felt like we sat on the tarmac for another hour before taking off. The real issue was when attempting to check in for my flight from Mexico City to Guadalajara. The ground staff wouldn’t let my dog on board with me, despite no issues on the previous (and much longer) leg of the journey. The woman kept repeating that the airport in Mexico City is an international airport so they have stricter rules. How do you think I got to Mexico? A domestic flight?? What a scam. I will never fly viva again, and based on this and the other reviews here, I would recommend everyone else stay away too.

### "just use another airline"
Not Verified |  We are going from Cancun to Mexico city (right now) suddenly all flights to Mexico is delayed 5h. The message showed up when we were going to the gate to board. No information before that. The explanation we received after asking why it is delayed: 3 planes is out for maintenance .. can you please explain why you waited this long with communicating this? This is a total ripoff and not something you suddenly decide to do. This was a scheduled and planned move by Viva Aerobus. We are losing money because of this and I was offered a 100 peso food ticket .. just ridiculous. To all that reads this please just use another airline if you haven't booked through this company yet.

### "it's not worth the poor service"
Arrived at the airport, got to the gate 90 minutes before flight. Lax-mty-cuu, 1 hour before flight, announcement that flight was canceled. Few were accommodated to another flight to gdl, others were refund, or rebook another day. One ticket agent to Handle entire flight. 2 1/2 hrs later, I was with the agent, after insisting that I needed to be in cuu by Monday, they booked me lax-mex-cuu. 9 hour layover in mex. Absolutely no compensation whatsoever. No food voucher, no future credit (that I'd never use for this airline). Worst service ever. Flight was canceled because inbound previous flight was delayed to the point customs & immigration was closed, and aircraft was not available. As far as value for money, it's not worth the poor service. I'm obligated to give a minimum of 1 star, really, 0 or n/a is appropriate.

### "You will not get a refund"
Not Verified |  Do not book with Viva. I booked a flight to Los Cabos from Tijuana a few months in advance of my vacation. 2 weeks before my scheduled flight, they emailed me saying that my outgoing flight was cancelled and I was put on a much later flight. I accepted the change. The following day, I was told that my incoming flight was cancelled and there were no other direct flights. All other flights available that day were 8+ hours in duration. I asked for a refund and they said that I could not get a refund as it was not one of the 27 reasons why they give refunds. Keep in mind that they changed and cancelled my flight. Not me. I even had purchased the refund insurance for protection. Still, I could not get a refund. I will be calling my credit card for help. Be warned. Viva changes your flights last minute. You will not get a refund even if you get the insurance.

### VivaAerobús customer review
Their flights coming out of Houston are always delayed 1-2 hours. Literally every time I fly with them and they don’t really seam to care. In addition to that, they close their ticketing counter one hour before the flight because the people that run the gate desk are the same ones that work at the check in counter. So if you are running late, you won’t be able to check in, even though you know the flight is going to be delayed for an hour and a half! They also cancel flights if they’re not a certain percentage full. They really just don’t care about their customers.

### "I asked for a refund and they said no refunds"
Not Verified |  We booked flights to Mexico City for July 4th weekend, and today I get an email saying our flight is cancelled. I called into Viva Aerobus customer support and they said that there was no reason listed as to why the flight was cancelled but that they can book me a flight out of a different city (San Antonio), which is about 100 miles away. I asked for a refund and they said no refunds. They offered a voucher to be used within 80 days but I refused this offer. Why would I want to book with this carrier again if they cancel flights with no notice and don't offer refunds? The agent wouldn't allow me to speak to a supervisor and was very rude and not helpful. I went ahead and disputed the cost of the tickets through my credit card company. I hope if this happens to other travelers that they each let their credit card company know so that eventually VISA or Mastercard stop providing payment services to them. Worst airline ever.

### "Horrible, unprofessional airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible, unprofessional airline they could never solve me about a change in my ticket I always travel with them and I never use this line again, it is the worst I have ever known, I hope they do something about it because I am not the first person to complain about this line. professional and unfriendly. And we are delayed to within the plane 45 minutes I do not know what happens, this is horrible. I will never use this line again. Horrible aerolínea nada profesionales nunca me pudieron resolver lo de un cambio de mi ticket siempre viajo con ellos ya no vuelvo usar esta línea es la peor que he conocido espero hagan algo al respecto porque no soy la primera persona que se queja de esta línea no son profesionales y nada amables . Y estamos retrasados a dentro del avión 45 min no se qué pasa esto es horrible. Jamás vuelvo a usar esta línea.

### "doesn't have any type of organization"
VivaAerobús doesn't have any type of organization whatsoever when it comes to luggage. This is the 3rd time in the same month that they don't deliver it my destination. This is very frustrating when you fly and don't have your stuff with you. Its a very unfortunate inconvenience.

### "professional and friendly"
A great trip. I liked the ground and cabin staff they were very professional and friendly. Although the food service was somewhat expensive it was worth every cent my ticket to visit my family in Mexico City.

### "Worst customer service I have received"
My flight had my maiden name, they cancelled the entire flight instead of helping me with the name change. Then instructed me to repurchase my entire round trip. Their 4 Hour policy did not apply. Worst customer service I have received from an airline. Extremely unprofessional customer service agents

### "goes through several shady practices"
Not Verified |  I recently visited Mexico and I didn't have any issue going to my destination. Although the boarding started later than expected at DFW, I wasn't surprised. However, on my way back it was a different story. I arrived at the airport in Monterrey and got my covid test. I went to check in and the representative canceled my flight although I had a negative result without even telling me the trick she had just pulled. However, she advised me to continue to security and I even waited an hour to board, when it was time to board I wasn't allowed to board because the customer service representative had canceled my flight without even notifying me. The representatives didn't know what to say but they said they will give me a ticket for the next flight to my destination. Upon arriving to speak to management, the manager sent me to sales and sales sent me to the same customer representative who canceled my seat. She then proceeded to say I'd be lucky if she could give me a flight for the next day or two. She was beyond unprofessional and rude while continuously laughing at my situation. I decided to not waste my time with them. I had to buy another ticket to my destination and the American Airlines personnel were a delight unlike everyone I had to deal with VivaAerobús. VivaAerobús goes through several shady practices and flying with them is a risk I'm never taking again.

### "We regretted we didn’t get Aeromexico tickets"
Not Verified |  Firstly the flight was delayed for 5h rs. No announcements were made. We found out about this just accidentally checking the incoming flight on the flight radar. I guess airlines in MX are not obligated to take care of passengers in case of delays, but come on delayed flight for 5hrs, which leaves at 11pm (ATD 3.50 am) and you just say sorry, no food coupons, or at least informing us so we could leave our hotel later for the flight. Our transfer service in Cancun was cancelled because the driver couldn’t pick us up so late. We lost one day in Cancun because we just slept all day after a sleepless night and you just say “sorry”. Very disappointed but that's not all! I guess there were lots of security violations (letting people store their hand luggage in front of them in the first row, somehow safety demo was only in Spanish). Overall, all PA’s were in Spanish, despite lots of English speaking passengers onboard. Crew just chooses to ignore them and speaks only in Spanish. We regretted we didn’t get Aeromexico tickets, and decided to go cheap. That was a lesson for us to learn. Never again!

### "This is by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This is by far the worst airline I’ve had the displeasure of flying with. My flight was changed by the airline and they never notified me about it, yet they said because I had purchased the flight through a third party that it was in fact the absence that had changed my flight. Now, I find that hard to believe and think that the airline had overbooked their flight and bumped me off. I get to the airport and explain that I never received any email notification regarding my flight changed and they would not budge. They didn’t even consider putting me on standby and they told me that my only option was to take a 10:40pm flight (I arrived at the airport at 12pm) and I would have to pay the difference which ended up being close to $200. In total, I spent a bunch of money and wasted a ton of time (10 hours to be exact.) The airline is insanely disorganized, flights are always late because they don’t know how to board people on the plane properly and they will charge you for any and every thing. I would run for the hills before flying with this airline again. Not only that, but the customer service agents in the Cancun airport that work for Viva were not willing to help me at all. They really couldn’t give a damn as much as I tried to make my case and showed them evidence on my phone that my flight had been changed without me being notified.

### "Worst customer service I've ever seen"
Not Verified |  Horrific customer service. Apparently their Terms & Conditions state no refunds, but any reasonable airline honors refunds for flight cancellations. I booked a direct flight in June 2021 from La Paz to Monterrey for a Wedding and my flight was canceled (not rescheduled, just canceled). The only other options that day added an additional cost (at least $100+ USD) and anywhere between 8-20 hours of flight/layover time. Obviously, this didn't work, because I was going to a wedding and depending on flight would have booked additional accommodations in another layover city or miss the wedding. Neither of which worked. I called and spoke with the airline and was told no refund. I spoke with an airline supervisor who said the same. I told him the situation and he had zero sympathy and said to feel free to call my bank to dispute but he would not refund. They give you 2 options when they cancel your flight: 1) An electronic flight certificate. 2) Flight change. Neither options worked cause I'd miss a wedding or add 8+hrs to travel (flight originally booked was 2hrs direct, so this wasn't even close to comparable). Worst customer service I've ever seen.

### "Worse experience ever"
Guadalajara to Chicago . Do not fly with them just cause it’s cheaper. They make up for it by getting you with every little thing while you are about to board. Worse experience ever. Will never be using them again.

### "horrible and frustrating experience"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Mexico City to Oaxaca was cancelled due to an airport shut down in Oaxaca. We didn't learn about this cancellation until we were at the airport, and the agents at the airport were not helpful at all! Instead of giving us all of the information, they wanted to re route our flight to another city that was 7 hours away. I received an email from Viva Aerobus after the flight time communicating the change, as well as providing the option of receiving the full refund in a voucher. However, when I called their customer service they refused to honor this, since "the airline did not cancel the flight. After some debate the agent confirmed that they will be honoring the voucher, he would get the process started and I should be hearing back in the next 24 hours. After not getting any communication from Viva, I called their customer service number the next day. At this point, the customer service agent continued to tell me that they will not be giving a refund voucher in this instance, due to the "airline not cancelling the flight. Even though I had an email from Viva Aerobus that I will be receiving the 100% of what I payed for in a voucher, and the customer agent telling me that he is generating the voucher the first time I called. This has been such a horrible and frustrating experience, and they do not deserve anyone's business.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever, the staff that day were extremely rude and knew I had walked in through security and was sent to immigration which was far away. When i try to go back to my flight the security that day refused to let me in because I was 1 min late even though i explained my situation. Please people do not buy airplane tickets from this airline you will regret it.

### "comply with their baggage policy"
Not Verified |  Make sure you comply with their baggage policy, weight and size. They check just before boarding at the gate. Better pay beforehand, the rates should be better. My backpack was a few cm to big and the extra payment was almost equal to the ticket price itself (850 pesos). The viva employee became aggressive right away, I even didn't complain. I knew my backback was too big (it has a metal frame) though it fits even in the smaller Embraer planes and this was an Airbus. You want to fly without your backpack or pay.." "so you want to leave it here" and so on. Another flight with this company got cancelled. I will fly Aeromexico whenever possible instead, the cost is the same in the end. The plane was a new Airbus320neo.

### "never book with them again"
Not Verified |  Do not book with them - Chances are flights will be extremely delayed or cancelled. We were supposed to fly with this airline on a Sunday night. We were sitting at the gate already when we were told our flight is delayed two hours. Okay, not a big deal. After two more hours of waiting we were told the airplane has technical issues and they're fixing them now and that they're updating us very soon. Another two hours passed. People were starting to get angry, everyone had been waiting for over four hours already. Finally after midnight  we were told that the flight is cancelled and that we should all go home and come back at 9am because the flight will leave at 11am the next day instead. We had to pay our own transport to the closest hotel (which in Tuxtla is a 40min cab ride) and also our own hotel. We came back the next morning at 9am as they told us to (after not getting a lot of sleep) and we were told right away that the flight will be another two hours delayed. In the end that wasn't even true- We had to spend all day at the airport and the flight finally went at 5pm (so another 9h at the airport). Absolutely awful experience. Employees are terrible and were deliberately withholding info from us. We weren't offered any sort of compensation either. They basically wasted 1.5 days of our lives for no reason. I've also heard from other passengers that Viva is always delayed for hours (in our case it was a 21h delay!). Will for sure never book with them again.

### "did not accept our valid COVID tests"
VivaAerobus did not accept our valid COVID tests we received within the 72 hour limit. They made up reasons as to why it was invalid. First it was “the doctors name isn’t on it” and second “it doesn’t say antigen” The tests were valid and approved with the official Mexican government stamp. No where on their list of requirements does it say these reasons as to why the test would be invalid. Then they tell you to go to leave the airport and go to the Marriott to take their Covid test. We didn’t do it. They will find a way to inconvenience you. We rebooked another flight on United, they accepted our Covid tests as valid.

### "they never call"
If you planing to save some bucks by using VivaAerobús let me tell you to think twice. I have 2 pieces of baggage lost for a week from my flight from Guadalajara to Chicago. I have placed multiple phone calls, emails and social media messages and still nothing. All they said is wait for a call and they never call. I suggest you spend more on another airline rather than this garbage. Airplanes are old, most of the time it is delays for technical issues, and now missing baggage. Not even Volaris is this irresponsible.

### "worst airline I have ever experienced"
This is the worst airline I have ever experienced. The customer service is atrocious. I arrived in plenty of time to board my flight. The online check in service wasn’t working, which staff admitted had been a problem all day, and so I needed to obtain my boarding pass. I waited in this ridiculously long line and arrived with more than an hour until my flight. Customer service told me I could not check in, despite not having checked baggage they continued to tell me I was too late. This is more than hour before my flight leaves.. we continued arguing until 50 mins before my plane would leave and they refused to help me. Told me I could not have a refund but I could purchase a new ticket to leave 2 days later. I had more than enough time to board the plane still and they would not do anything for me. I had to cover the costs of a hotel and a new flight with a different airline the next day costing me hundreds. I emailed in to discuss this with the company and they again just refused to help me. Awful customer service and I will never use them again.

### "you have to pay overweight"
We were traveling with just backpacks and handbags at the time of check in we were asked if we check in any luggage for which we were not just personal items as the check in person confirmed then she give us our boarding passes and instructions, but at the time of boarding the plane staff asked me for payment saying that I was having 2 personal items which was my backpack and my funny belt. She asked me to pick one or another or pay for an extra item so politely asked if she can reconsider for what she just ignored me and start calling other passengers. I ask if I can talk to a supervisor she said yes then move aside to talk on the radio then she asked my daughter to insert her backpack in a metal measuring cage which she did with a little trouble for what she said that item will have pay. I try to talk to her showing her fit my daughters backpack in and out  she said “if you want your backpack in the plane you have to pay overweight or just lose it”. when superior arrive he was carrying a credit card payment device, I try to explain the situation for what he didn’t let me finish saying here is a copy of the items and dimensions your ticket allowed you to carry. I took my funny belt out of my waist and put it in side my backpack thinking this is so stupid since is going to be inside the plane anyway.

### "not respected any kind of social distancing"
A terrible service, was not respected any kind of social distancing all piled up in rows of three passengers all seats full, incredibly an attack on the health of all passengers, I hope we all leave this flight healthy God help us! Un pésimo servicio no se respetaron ningún tipo de distanciamiento social todos amontonados en filas de tres pasajeros todos los asientos llenos , increíblemente un ataque a la salud de todos los pasajeros, ojalá todos salgamos sanos de este vuelo Dios nos Ayude! !

### "Horrible customer service"
Worst airline. They are so desperate for money they charge for everything. I paid for luggage that got checked for weight and got check all the time. They targeted us since we left Cancun I saw the paper they target us we fit everything, they said regarding regulations, and they threaten  us that If we didn't pay something they would not let us board. We ended up paying because we didn't want to miss the flight. Horrible customer service.

### "I basically just wasted my time and money with them"
I purchased insurance on my flight tickets. My first flight got delayed twice (long story short I was going to have to cancel this flight, because I wasn’t going to make it on time). I kept trying to call to cancel and never got through to anyone. About 2 hours before the flight time (still in time to cancel according to the insurance policies) I sent an email requesting to cancel and get a refund. Customer service kept giving me different excuses of why I couldn’t get a refund or save my flight to be used another time. I sent them all the documents they asked for to show that it was a legit reason, but I basically just wasted my time and money with them.

### "a deliberate action in order to get money"
VivaAerobus employees extort money when passengers board the plane. We bought a baby package, which includes priority boarding, a stroller and additional luggage weighing up to 10 kg. Three inspectors on flight VB1016, Mexico City-Cancun, October 18, 2020, tried to prove to me for 20 minutes that the extra baggage is not included and I have to pay for it. It is impossible to imagine that they did not know this, because it is practically the only thing that they should know. Obviously, this is a deliberate action in order to get money. Their aggressive behavior and psychological pressure leads to the passenger not arguing and paying. I had to go to the company's website and find in the rules what is included in this children's package, but how many will do it, being stressed before the flight? After showing them what was included on the airline's website, they hid their badges and evaporated. I hope this is not a deliberate policy of the company and these people will be found.

### "Not dependable airline at all"
Not Verified | Not dependable airline at all booked my flight back home a month in advance and when I get to the airport the flight has been canceled with out any warning they state they sent out a. Email and I never received it. I was left stranded in a foreign country with. No help they refuse to offer any other options at the kiosk at the airport other than give me credit for their next available flight which was over a month later so I called the 1800 number and they were just as useless I had to pay 400usd with a different airline for the following day leaving me in the streets over night all because the airline could do nothing or offer any other options the supervisors were just as rude as the workers if not worst. How stressful it was to sleep in the airport floor over night and they could not give a care in the world

### "not a dependable airline"
My Husband and I purchased round trip tickets from Monterrey- Tampico- Tampico-Monterrey and I was notified that our return flight was canceled due to the Covid but I had a Choice to take a later flight (next day) but this doesn’t work for us because we’re traveling from the USA into Monterrey and from Monterrey back to the USA on United Airlines we just bought flights to get to where we needed to go in Mexico from Viva Aerobus. When I contacted the airline and explain to them that I had to catch another flight on the 13 back to the USA and I couldn’t take a later flight because I will be missing my other flight and the choices they were offering me will not work for me and that I would like my money back, the woman told me that it was not one of my choices and hung up on me with out any other explanation. I called back and explained everything to the next person again and she told me that I will not be getting my money back and that I should not depend on Viva Aerobus to honor my flights or be able to flight on the day of my reservations. So now I have to find another way to get back to Monterrey (on my dime) so that I can catch my United Airlines back to the USA. I will tell everyone else that a Viva Aerobus representative told me that I should never depend on them to honor my flight because they are not a dependable airline.

### "Left me stranded in Guadalajara"
Worst airline ever, they overbooked my flight. Left me stranded in Guadalajara. They dont give refunds for the flight, only vouchers. They also wont pay for another ticket on another airline nor a hotel. So here i am sleeping in the airport waiting 6 hours for another flight on another airline. Which cost me more than the whole round trip with VivaAerobús . I understand its cheap but its not worth it.

### "VivaAerobus flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  I purchased 2 tickets in Feb 2020 with VivaAerobús one for myself and the other for my hubby from March 23 through March 28. In March 2020, the COVID-19, pandemic was in full swing and by the time March 16, 2020 came around, our government made the call of having each individual state make decisions on closing down non-essential businesses. On top of this, there was a strict travel advisory concerning certain countries. I watched the news night and day trying to figure out if I should go because I also knew my bone graft procedure required a 5 to 6 month healing timeframe. I called my dental office in Cancun several times inquiring if there was any news from their administrators, I also watched news pertaining to Cancun, read news articles from Cancun and read numerous travel advisories from the US Dept of State concerning Cancun / Mexico. I was told that everything was a go by my dentist. I also kept calling my dental office, my hotel and finally VivaAerobus 1 week prior to departure to inquired what would occur if I should cancel due to the pandemic or if there had been any changes due to the pandemic that I need to be aware of. But Vivaaerobus customer service agents told me that my flight on March 23, 2020 had not been cancelled nor do they see of any future changes or cancellations for both my inbound or outbound flights. All 3 Vivaaerobus CSR agents who I spoke to prior to my departure on 3 different occasions each said the same thing including that “I would lose both of my airline fares for myself and my hubby and that I would not get a refund because it was a non refundable ticket. I explained to them that I did not want to get “stuck” in another country of course even if it’s Mexico but I was advised by these 3 CSR agents, that if my flight becomes delayed or cancelled, I could log onto the Vivaaerobus App and the updates would be there or that I could call the 1-800 number for Vivaaerobus and reach a CSR agent for further assistance if that occurred. I felt I had no choice and I didn’t want to lose our hard earned money so on March 23, 2020, my hubby & I went off on our trip. We had the Vivaaerobus App installed on both of our cell phones and we were able to check in and obtain our boarding pass 24 hours before our flight departed from Charlotte, NC. We were both hoping that after we got to the airport, that our flight would be cancelled so we could request a refund but it was not cancelled. The arrival/ departure screens at Charlotte Douglas Airport showed that our flight to Cancun was still scheduled and on time. We didn’t have any luggage to check on our flight only had 2 carry-ons. We made it to our gate 2 hours ahead of our 8:00 am flight and our plane was already parked at the gate. There was only 1 other passenger waiting for the flight. We boarded our outbound flight late, landed in Cancun safety. I concluded my dental appointment, constantly checked my VivaAerobus App for notifications none were provided by this airline. 10 hours before check in on March 27, 2020, the VivaAerobus App would not allow us to check in nor obtain our boarding passes. It showed an message which stated that we had to check in 2 hours before departure. We called and the 1-800 number but It was constantly busy, we sent emails/ inquiries through online chat to VivaAerobus but got NO RESPONSE. We decided to purchase a ticket with another airline. The VivaAerobus flight was cancelled. Had we not been proactive, we would have stranded.

### "they only give vouchers"
Mexico City to Puerto Pallarta. I had two different flights scheduled with Viva aerobus. The first one was cancelled with no information given, the second was cancelled but they rebooked me on a flight 6 days later. For both, I asked for a refund, but they said that their refund policy has recently changed, and they only give vouchers. And you only have 15 days to decide if you want the voucher. I checked for flights in the future using random dates, all were at least double of what I paid. Price gouging at its finest. Anyways, when I told them that Mexican law says I should get a refund, they sent an email saying that they were done talking to me. Now it is left to my credit card company to refund the money. Buy from them at your risk!

### "rejected my request for a refund"
Los Cabos to Mexico City. I have spoken with Customer Service, who does not speak much English, so I translated to Spanish. They rejected my request for a refund on 2 flights, which I could not use as I am trapped in UK due to COVId-19. I cannot have a voucher either as I am using all my holidays. Horrible company to look for money from foreign customers. oh no sorry they do everything for their customers. I spent all my savings to go to Mexico. I lose my holiday and money. You offer everybody to change their flights to follow Health's Minister advisory. Due to cancellation some PARTY in Monterey you allowed others to get change a flights or a refund and want to rip me off!

### "not let clients change their flight"
Cancun to Veracruz. The airline does not let clients change their flight due to the pandemic of Coronavirus. This is a shame, no humanity. I would never take a flight with them, they only care about money. I had other airlines changing my flight with NO fees, such as InterJet or American Airlines.

### "better than the first time"
Not Verified |  Puerto Escondido to Mexico City. Second time I’ve flown this airline and it was better than the first time because I checked in 48hrs prior, I paid the priciest ticket and my luggage was at the exact weight allowed; the attendant was pretty nice and cordial at the time of the luggage drop off. I learnt the hard way as the first time I didn’t check in Online and Once at the airport i was not allowed to check in at the airport as I was within the hour of plane taking off (plane was not even at the airport yet) as the flight brings in passenger from Mexico City and flies back. Airline customer service is one of the worse I’ve experienced.

### "worst airline in Mexico"
Not Verified |  Tuxtla Gutierrez to Cancun. The worst airline operating in Mexico! They let you pay for everything! I just paid money extra for my ukulele even though it fitted in the measure box. The communication with the staff was just horrible! Without any respect, without elementary manners. Last time the flight was 3 hours delayed - and they told me straight that they don’t care - that I can call to the airport office! Not the company hotline - but complain to the airport... what?

### "weigh everything on you"
Not Verified |  Guadalajara to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline, they will rip you off at check in. You will end up paying a lot more than expected. Avoid this airline if possible, they will weigh everything on you, including purses and backpacks and they will consider it part of the weight for carry on luggage .

### "did not want to refund my flight!"
Guadalajara to Mexico City. I had my flight in connection to Madrid delayed 3 hours of course maintenance and I had to buy another flight with Volaris at the window so as not to lose my flight to Madrid they did not want to refund my flight! And now I return to Mexico City to connect with Guadalajara and also this afternoon until further notice! Very bad customer service when you call for help! Do not buy tickets with VivaAerobús if you want to arrive on time. Tenía mi vuelo en conexión para Madrid se retraso 3 horas por supuesto mantenimiento y tuve que comprar otro vuelo con Volaris en ventanilla para no perder mi vuelo a Madrid no quisieron reembolsar mi vuelo! Y ahora regreso a ciudad de Mexico para conectar con Guadalajara y también esta tarde hasta nuevo aviso! Muy mal servicio al cliente cuando llamas para pedir ayuda!!! No compres boletos con viva Aerobús si quieres llegar a tiempo!! !

### "Delay time of 3h40m"
Huatulco to Mexico City. Flight delay No. 1093 by VivaAerobus from 17:20 departure time until 21:00 that the plane took off. Delay time of 3 hrs 40 min. Compensation policies are in favor of the airline. | Retraso de vuelo No. 1093 por VivaAerobus de las 17:20 hora de salida hasta las 21:00 que despegó el avión. Tiempo de retraso de 3 hrs 40 min. Las politicas de indemnización están a favor de la linea aerea.

### "the worst customer service"
Mexico City to Guadalajara. This is the worst customer service airline. They force you to pay for a check bag even if you purchased items out of the airport! At the gate they pulled us out of line made us weigh our bags again and told us we were over the weight! I told them we may be over because we purchased items out of the airport and you can’t charge us to carry our bought items onto the plane how does that make sense. All in all avoid this airline.

### "Do not believe their promotions"
Not Verified |  Monterrey to Guadalajara. Do not believe their promotions and prices. When you try to make your reservation there is a notification “we are sorry the price that you are looking for is no longer available”. They are doing false advertising.

### "charge for bring your stroller"
Not Verified |  
New York to Mexico City. Worst experience. You pay a cheap airline ticket but in reality they make you pay more than you thought. They charge for everything!!! They want me to pay for a suppose "baby package" just to carriage my umbrella stroller but I refuse because last time I travel with them I paid it and for nothing didn't work. I never seen an airline to charge for bring your stroller and I was travel by myself with my 3kids.

### "each experience was horrific"
Tijuana to Tuxtla Gutierrez via Monterrey. I'm with all the folks who would give this airline a negative star, if I could. I work at a non-profit organization, and we were taking a humanitarian trip with our interns, so we had a group of about 20 people. It was many of the kids first time flying, and they were already nervous about it. When we go to check in, the airline insists on weighing each person's bags together. I'm aware that the policy states a 10 kg weight limit on one carry on and one personal item, but I've never flown on a flight where they weigh the carry on and personal item together. Some kids' bags were at 7kg, and others were at 10.3kg and they wanted us to pay $50usd for the ones that were over. Of course we weren't going to pay for 10 or so kids' bags because they were a little bit over, so we start rearranging the baggage to spread the weight around more evenly. We also had one check-in bag that we had already paid $100usd for (and it was full of gifts for kids at an orphanage that we connect with when we visit), and they wanted us to pay again, even though we had the receipt showing we had already paid. Once we finally got our stuff reorganized to accommodate their ridiculous lack of logic (honestly, couldn't you just do the math and realize it all evens out eventually rather than being nitpicky?! ), we were able to check in. At this point, they had to hold the plane for us about 30 minutes (and we had a connecting flight in Monterrey that we needed to make, and I'm sure many others did as well). So the kids start giving their stuff back to each other as we're walking...then we realize that they have another scale at the boarding gate and we had to go through the whole rigmarole again. Additionally, the "customer service" agents (if you can call them that - they were incredibly rude and impatient), insisted on charging us for the bags that were "over" (by .3kg) again, even though we showed our receipts. They held the flight for about an hour and half because they were very busy hassling us. I know it's probably because we were in a group, because they didn't weigh other people's bags as they boarded. I couldn't believe how ridiculous the whole process was. After we ended up paying for 3 of the kids bags (twice), we finally boarded the flight (which boasted a sorry excuse for leg room, no inflight entertainment, and no drink/food options whatsoever during the 3 hour flight). Because we had layovers each direction, we ended up flying with the airline a total of 3 times, and each experience was as horrific as the one mentioned above. THANK GOD we took Interjet on the last leg of the journey. I've seriously never appreciated an airline more in my entire life (and I've flown hundreds of times for business). On the way back to TJ, the kids had purchased some blankets, ponchos, etc. to bring back with them (which, retrospectively, we should have shipped...it would've cost less). That meant when we got the airport, and tried to get our boarding passes (which we weren't able to print in advance, and had to pay an additional $20usd for each), we had bags that were 1 or 2 kg overweight. We literally sat on the airport floor and threw away toiletries, clothing, books, shoes, etc. and moved items around bags to meet their ridiculous requirements, constantly weighing and reweighing the bags to try to avoid paying hundreds of additional dollars in fees. We were the last ones to board each and every flight because of their insane extortion.

### "they changed our flight again"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Hermosillo. They changed our flight from direct to connecting after we started our trip. Then we just happened to get phone service and see an email that they changed our flight again. This time with a 12 hour layover and no phone call, we're lucky we saw the email. When we called to ask about it as we saw it was now for an entirely different day, we were put on hold for hours. Then told that the flight was one again changed and our only option was to fly now and then stay in another airport for over 12 hours or fly in two days. Neither of which have a guarantee of not being changed again, nor do they offer any compensation for the time, the extra hotel night, or even refunding the money we've already paid so that we can pick up a separate flight with another company. So now we're rushing to turn in our rental car and try to make an earlier flight to avoid a 2 day delay. We built in one day for things like this but two days is absolutely uncalled for. You've been warned.

### "never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I have flown several times to the USA and back on many different airlines, but this by far was the worst airline I have ever travelled. Flight attendants super unfriendly, no leg room and I was made to put my tote bag under the seat in front of me, giving me no leg or foot room. I would never recommend this airline.

### "Don't ever fly this company"
Tijuana to Mexico City. I have never been contacted as to why my ticket Round trip was cancelled and no attempt to give me a refund. It is a complete ripoff. Don't ever fly this company

### "not allowed to board the plane"
Mexico City to Las Vegas. They are extremely rude and they don't know the meaning of customer service. I was not allowed to board the plane in Mexico City to travel to my place of residence in Las Vegas NV because I didn't have my Mexican passport. They failed to request passport during reservation and payment process, so I traveled only with my green card as I had in the past without any issues. I never received a warning notification during the reservation process or after the fact that this is a new requirement regardless of your legal status in the USA. They took my money and refused to refund it or give me a credit, they simply sold my seat again to someone. They also promote a low fare and when you checked out is a lot more money of what they are promoting. This airline doesn't worth your time or money. You will find better rates and better customer service with other airlines that will treat you as you deserved to be treated.

### "bad customer service"
Tijuana to Culiacan. The big downsides are the booking process, multiple hidden charges and a bad customer service. First of all, the website seems to provide for online-booking and online-check-in. What the site doesn't tell you is that if your credit card is not issued in Mexico, the website doesn't accept your payment and ultimately your booking gets canceled.

### "such bad service"
I understand that budget airlines offer less amenities but politeness and fair business practices do not cost anything. I traveled with my family on a VivaAerobus roundtrip from Mérida to Veracruz and despite being a frequent flyer I have never experienced such bad service and bad business practices - I would recommend that family travelers stay clear of this airline. First I should state that we bought the most expensive tickets with every add on included, i was traveling with my pregnant wife and one year old infant (with a paid seat). First VivaAerobus wanted to deny us taking our FAA authorized car seat on the plane at check in, after an argument and being told to call service center for resolution - we finally were allowed to take it through receiving rude remarks while boarding, on the return the car seat was all of a sudden not a problem but we needed to pay extra for bringing this safety equipment for our child on the plane, despite payment the stewardess demanded that we leave the car seat when we boarded, saying the plane will not leave until we remove the sleeping baby from the seat, not until I started taping the conversation and the captain came and said everything was ok was the issue resolved. This is just the issue of one car seat I will not go into details about no help in dealing with seating together for the family or nobody being able to communicate in English, at least not when they wanted to ignore the customer.

### "smallest seats I have ever tried"
Mexico City to Merida. The smallest seats I have ever tried to sit in. I was hit twice by luggage of other passengers and once by the vendors of drinks and snacks, trying to navigate the narrow aisle. Impossible to stretch your legs under the seat in front of you nor stand up to get out of your seat. To evacuate or exit, the passenger in the window seat has to raise the armrests and slide himself to the aisle. They continuously changed the departure time and listed the aircraft as on time. Very confusing to the driver who was to pick us up. An hour after our so called "on time " flight arrival time, the driver left since the flight supposedly arrived on time and he couldn't find us.

### "This is the worst airline"
Mexico City to Tijuana. This is the worst airline, first and last time flying with them, bad service, delay both ways for more than 4 hours. They did not communicate the reasons for the delay. The seats don’t recline, the airplane was dirty. Worst experience with an airline.

### "$50 to check my carry on bag"
Guadalajara to Tuxtla Gutiérrez. Horrible airline. Worse even than United. Avoid even if it is slightly cheaper. They will gouge you will extra fees just before you fly. My flight was $100, then they added an unexplained $15 "extras fee", then charged $50 to check my carry on bag because it was 12kg instead of 10kg.

### "never fly VivaAerobus again"
Not Verified |  Guadalajara to Los Angeles. My 4 beautiful days in Ajijic ended badly thanks to Viva Aerobus. First of all, you can't check-in online within 24 hrs of departure. But in all fairness, I'm not sure if it's airport policy or because VA hasn't caught on. So I had to be there 2.5 hrs prior to departure, checked in and was given my "VIP" group boarding pass. As we were boarding the plane, several of us were asked to step aside and go to another line to weigh and or measure our hand carry-on bags. When they took my bag, a man, without looking at me in the eyes, proceeded to invoice me for US$52 because my bag was 1" above the limit. He never even showed me the measurements! Mind you, I've used the same bag traveling to Europe, Asia and multiple US domestic flights and had NO problems. Because I felt like I was being bullied by the "polecias", I paid the US$52 and was asked to give my bag to someone by the door of the plane. There was no one there so I proceeded to take my bag in and placed it in the overhead bin. And it fitted perfectly as expected and like it has with all my other flights in the past. Also, it would be nice if VA would send us all an email warning us of their strict policies and perhaps mention that seats do not recline and there is no IFE. So much for being in a "VIP" that they couldn't even accommodate a bag that's 1" over their limit. One thing for sure, I will never fly VivaAerobus again.

### "downsides are the booking process"
Puerto Escondido to Mexico City. The flight was good, punctual, clean cabin, good onboard service, nothing to complain about. VivaAerobus is a low cost-carrier with very competitive prices for flights within Mexico. The big downsides are the booking process, multiple hidden charges and a bad customer service. First of all, the website seems to provide for online-booking and online-check-in. What the site doesn't tell you is that if your credit card is not issued in Mexico, the website doesn't accept your payment and ultimately your booking gets canceled. I spend hours trying to book a ticket online and failed. So if you don't have a Mexican credit card, don't bother about the website, try calling their hotline (during normal business hours they should have English-speaking staff). The booking confirmation does not say you have to check-in online, rather it says do the check-in at the airport. Unfortunately you do have to check-in online, and you can't do it on their website with a mobile phone for some reason. So check-in online with a laptop or, if you don't, you pay an additional charge at the airport (50 MXN in October 2017). If you have any complaints, their staff at the airport will not respond by direct you to their hotline (which I wouldn't bother using).

### "never use this company again"
Cancun to Mexico City. Apart from hiding charges on their booking system (Be very careful on which options are automatically selected every time you click next. The company refuses to allow passengers with children to bring the stroller to the door of the aircraft. I was travelling with my 3 year old on a 9pm flight and the manager made me document my stroller and carry my kid who was already sleeping for about two hours until the flight was due to depart. This includes passing through security. On top of that the flight was 50 minutes delayed and we basically had to walk to the aircraft right next to the people putting the luggage into the plane. The personnel in the ground were also very rude. At the end we were able to manage but with more that 1 kid, or a slightly older kid this would have been almost impossible. The ground personnel indicated that there is a package for travelling with children however since my child is older than 2 this package is not offered. I will never use this company again.

### "price could not be beaten"
Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta. The seating comfort was what you'd expect for a low cost airline, but the flight is short, and the price could not be beaten. I had a good experience getting my ticket, the flight was a bit late, but I kind of expected that. The inflight service was fine and the VivaAerobús crew were friendly.
