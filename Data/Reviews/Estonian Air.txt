### "crew friendly and smiling"
Very nice and comfortable Estonian Air flight from Copenhagen to Vilnius via Tallinn, crew friendly and smiling. Even if Tallinn airport is very small, connection time was too tight. Smaller aircraft to Vilnius, but comfortable. For reasons unknown there were no sales on this 1h 20min flight. A good experience for the price, and safety was taken seriously.

### Estonian Air customer review
At Brussels airport the check in service was smooth, they even accepted my luggage, although it was 2 kg overweight. The boarding was quick due to the small plane. The trip was around 2 hours. I prefer bigger airplanes for longer flights, as these smaller planes tend to rock a bit more and the legroom isn't the best either. The flight attendants were polite and nice. The landing at Tallinn was smooth, managed to clear customs very easily.

Amsterdam to Moscow with Estonian Air, which proved to be good choice. AMS to Tallinn leg was carried on a CRJ200. They served complementary coffee, water and a chocolate. Transfer at Tallinn was seamless, their non Schengen area consists of a few gates and one restaurant. The connecting flight to Moscow was on a slightly worn Embraer 170, leg room okay but the interior had seen better times. Service on both flights was very formal and a smile was nowhere to be seen. Would fly them again due to the easy transfers.

OV174 15th March and OV173 24th March. Amsterdam-Tallinn. Decent legroom nice inflight magazine and even boarding with a proper jetway at Tallinn for the return flight. Good inflight service featuring a solid drinks menu with Estonia's superb A. LeCoq lager and Viru Valge vodka - not a bad little airline at all (I had flown them before in 2010 on a Copenhagen-Tallinn round trip with similar results).

### Estonian Air customer review
Vilnius-Tallinn OV 356 Sept 2014. We were very surprised when the check-in lady at Vilnius airport charged us the equivalent of around 10 Euro pp for the check-in. The use of the existing check-in machines at Vilnius airport would cause this fee as well she explained to us. The only way to get a free check-in would have been the use of a smartphone. We did not unfortunately have this possibility. Up to now I have never encountered costs for the use of a check-in machine at any airport. Apart from this: Flight was on time Aircraft clean. Quiet and comfortable flight. Seats average. Only few travellers on this flight. Drinks and food for sale. Free check-in baggage. Very fast baggage delivery in Tallinn airport.

### Estonian Air customer review
Used Estonian 5 times in the last 12 months. AMS-TLL vice versa. Pleasantly surprised. CRJ900 with a lot of legroom. Charming staff. Disliked the practice of sending economy passengers to a kiosk in TLL to get a boarding pass where you pay 10 euros. Once had a delay of 20 minutes which the captain explained announcements over the speakers were very distorted and hard to understand. Boarding at TLL was a mess. The plane was a bit late arriving disembarking passengers refuelling no bridge from the gate 80 people kept waiting. Catering was okay but you pay through the nose of course. No visa cards just cash.

Estonian Air #145 Tallinn-Copenhagen June 12 2014. Flew Tallinn Copenhagen in flex class (premium economy) which means free meal and bar service 23 kgs of luggage and flexibility to change tickets. The food consisted of smoked salmon on a slice of bread a small but fresh salad and an appetizing Sacher cake. Not too much but enough for the 1hr 20 minute flight. Swift boarding and disembarkation aircraft clean and fresh newspapers available friendly staff clear safety announcements over good audio system and interesting inflight magazine to while the time away. Estonian Air is a small and pleasant regional airline.

### Estonian Air customer review
TLL-AMS a busy morning flight on the perennially cramped CRJ900. Compared to my last flight with Estonian a year ago the service much better and Tallinn airport keeps improving and is now probably the nicest small airport in Europe: clean free wifi comfy seats and even a library. No service whatsoever on Estonian Air which besides being government-owned is on par with Ryanair for what it offers. But as a way to get from Point A to Point B it's acceptable.

### Estonian Air customer review
Stockholm - Tallinn - Kiev and back. Clean and nice Embraer on the first leg and a new CRJ900 on the second. Overall a pleasant experience. Transit at the small Lennart Meri ariport in Tallinn smooth and easy. Staff rather dull but agreeable. I would gladly fly with them again.

### Estonian Air customer review
Tallinn-Amsterdam is a short flight but crew were nice helpful and were able to understand at least 4 languages (they helped my Dutch Grandmother who speaks no English). Amenities not normally provided but because flight was near empty they gave out snacks plus complementary tea and coffee. They also allowed us to sit in vacant seats which was nice. In general a nice trip and much more than was expected for basically a regional airline.

ARN-TLL ERJ170 Equipment. This is the airline where you are never met with a smile. Short flight in an old Finnair ERJ170. The seat Comfort is horrible feels like you have a stick in your back all the time. The crew tries to sell you extremely expensive instant coffee for 4 Euros a cup. I was quite impressed that the two cabin crew never managed to smile once during the 50 min flight. This is however the Baltic States best airline. That tells you how bad the other ones are.

### Estonian Air customer review
ARN-TLL-ARN - Flew from the UK via Stockholm on an SAS Ticket. The leg from ARN was with Estonian Air on a new CRJ900. Economy cabin only has food/snacks for purchase I did not partake so cannot comment upon the choice. The flight itself was on-time both ways with clear announcements inn Estonian/Russian/English. The flight was less than an hour so no need for any in-flight entertainment but an interesting multi-lingual airline magazine was provided along with a choice of some newspapers in various languages. Airline has some codeshares with other carriers in the region and provides a good connection to other Scandinavian/Baltic destinations.

### Estonian Air customer review
CPH-TLL-CPH. Cabin Crew both ways showed no emotion or enthusiasm. A very clever metal rod has been inserted in each seat which makes it extremely uncomfortable to sit in. No complimentary products on these flights coffee purchased tasted poor creamer had no effect. On the plus side checked baggage was delivered fast on both flights. In the future will look for other alternatives.

### Estonian Air customer review
TLL-CPH. Very comfortable and clean Embraer 170 used on the short flight from Tallinn to Copenhagen. Good leg room staff friendly and courteous and a small snack and hot drink offered. Efficient check-in at Tallinn. Would definitely recommend as they are a great introduction/farewell to a very beautiful country.

AMS-TLL-SVO-TLL-AMS. Estonian Air still had a reasonable fare for this route. Nice modern CRJ900 planes on AMS-TLL and a bit tired and worn Boeing 737 from TLL to SVO and back. I had a very short connection time in TLL onwards just 30 min but had no problems because Tallinn Airport is actually very small. Food and beverage service pretty basic just soft drinks and rye-bread sandwiches. No comments regarding the luggage since I was travelling just with a cabin bag.

### Estonian Air customer review
London Gatwick-Tallinn return in Economy class in a Boeing 737. The queue for check in/bag drop at London Gatwick was lengthy and slow moving for what turned out to be a full flight. However the flight boarded on time and departure was only slightly late due to a busy afternoon at the airport. We had selected the exit row in economy which had two instead of 3 seats on each side and more legroom. These were sufficiently roomy and comfortable for the flight. We had also pre-ordered a hot meal and wine and these were brought to us before the cabin crew started the sandwich and drink service to other passengers. Both the food and drinks were good value good quality and helped pass the time on the flight. The cabin crew were professional polite and friendly. The return flight was much the same on time and trouble free. Tallinn airport had a much quicker check in than Gatwick and no security queue. All in all a decent service and pleasant experience.

### Estonian Air customer review
ARN-TLL (Tallinn) brand new CRJ-900. Short 50 minute flight but on-time and very friendly attendants. Plane was spacious clean and comfortable. On-board prices reasonable for BOB; only disappointment is as the flight is so short they don't sell duty-free so I couldn't buy something I wanted from the catalog. Tallinn airport is clean small and very easy to be in the centre of town in 10-15 minutes. OW fare was US $90 and a good deal.

### Estonian Air customer review
Business class between Copenhagen and Talinn in Estonia - even though this was a 1 hour 30 min the flight served no food and I could not even get a packet of peanuts. The flight had cost £650 for a return and was a sorry experience.

### Estonian Air customer review
Estonian Air is becoming a disaster! Having flown with the airline for many years I cannot recall it being worse. Stockholm-Tallinn flight Friday 19th of November - five hours late. Vilnius - Stockholm flight same day six hours late. London - Tallinn flight a week ago more arrived in Tallinn more than six hours late. And all the time without accurate information - probably to avoid rebooking on other airlines.

### Estonian Air customer review
Tallinn to Stockholm. Cheap flight bought online. Check in TLL very quick nice small airport. Flight delayed an hour. Saab 340 small but comfortable. FA served non-alcoholic drinks and cupcake for free.

### Estonian Air customer review
ATH-TLL-ATH nothing exciting about them but nothing to complain. The flight with an old B737-300 a nice complimentary sandwich with beverage or water. We had ordered and prepaid warm meal we had to prove that we had paid to give us the meal even though the trays had our names printed on them. The younger stewards/hostesses were nice and pleasant the older ones were living in the communist era of transportation. Excellent airport of Tallin new clean friendly convenient but underused. Too bad only few airlines are using it.

### Estonian Air customer review
I have used this airline a few times (Dublin-Tallinn return). This year my experience was a total disaster. My outgoing flight was brought an hour forward and my return flight was cancelled. I got no notification - no explanation or an apology for the stress and hassle they caused me. I sent about 10 e-mails looking for some explanation - no reply!

### Estonian Air customer review
Estonian Air round-trip ARN-TLL first leg on Estonian Air Regional Saab 340 and back on Boeing 737-5. They don't qualify as a budget airline in my book (at least not at the level of AirBaltic) because the prices charged are only competitive with other carriers; they certainly don't undercut by much. Customer service is excellent particularly at Tallinn Airport. The ARN-TLL leg had free food as well. The integrated check-in counters (with SAS) are very handy and they were on time in both cases. In general they are unspectacular but deliver very solid service.

### Estonian Air customer review
Tallinn-LGW. If you think of it as a low cost airline you won't be too disappointed. Even on a 3 hour flight food and drink had to be paid for although the prices were lower than some other airlines - eg. 3 euros for a beer. The only real issues were that the seat pitch was very tight and the interior needed some maintenance (eg. some seat covers were torn).

### Estonian Air customer review
Tallinn-Kiev-Tallinn. Using Estonian Air is like using a scheduled bus service in best case. They will get you from A to B without any amenities. Estonian uses B 737-500. Seat pitch is average. Both flights were on time. Luggage arrived as well. On board service has to be paid extra. For a flight of about 2 hours this is not much. I use them because it is the only direct link between Tallinn and Kiev but if there was any quality airline I would prefer them.

### Estonian Air customer review
Excellent low-cost airline to a popular destination. The staff at Gatwick moved heaven and earth to get us out despite a long delay due to snow at Tallinn and a storm over Stockholm. Although we flew out in the middle of the night we got there in the end. On the way back everything went smoothly. Would have given them 5 stars except the food and drink on board is pricey and this was not obvious at the time otherwise on the way out I would have taken some £s out of the ATM rather than spending them all at Gatwick. Coming back I managed to buy a cake and some coffee (having already eaten in Tallinn before the flight) for 45 krooni not bad as the cake was huge. Would fly with them again when visiting Estonia rather than take a slightly more expensive connecting flight via Amsterdam.

### Estonian Air customer review
I have been a frequent flyer with Estonian Air since the start of the airline. Up until the day when SAS (Scandinavian Airlines) became one of the owners Estonian Air did fine. Since then I have seen a continious increase in delays and poorer service. Late is now the rule (½ to 3 hours in general) and despite that some of the staff do their best I am looking for an alternative. Obviously there is a lack of professional management and poor understanding of what running a commercial airline is all about. The best they could do now is to get rid of SAS and start on their own.

### Estonian Air customer review
LGW-TLL-LGW. Check in at Gatwick easy and fast. The aircraft was a very old looking B737. It still had the ashtrays in the seat arms! The crew were ok but very dour. The flight leaving Tallinn was again late by about 30 minutes. Tallinn airport was very nice and looked new. The all male crew on the way back were more cheerful and helpful. We had a meal and a juice each and it was about EEK220 or GBP11. I think for what we paid it was very good value for money. This is a small airline trying to follow a low cost model. All in all I was pleasantly surprised.

### Estonian Air customer review
TLL-MXP First experience with Estonian Air. Good flight even if the plane seems old (Boeing 737-500) and not so confortable. They've introduced e-tickets only several months ago. Staff polite and present. Prices seems quite high.

### Estonian Air customer review
ARN-TLL in Economy. My first experience with Estonian Air was disappointing. What should have been a short 45min-hop ended in a 5-hour-delay: no proper explanation given no offer of rerouting via Copenhagen the only compensation I got was a meal voucher worth 10 euro. Legroom on the B737-300 was standard economy class but seats looked pretty worn-out. Cabin crew was polite but hardly smiling. To apologize for the delay soft drinks and coffee/tea were offered for free but it is the first time ever I am being served coffee in a plastic glass!

### Estonian Air customer review
CPH-TLL return. Flights were delayed both ways. No meals served and inflight service horrible due to staff. FA onboard generally seem careless and are simply unable to smile.

### Estonian Air customer review
FRA-TLL-FRA. Meal was really poor and they did not offer a choice. Cabin staff service also very poor.

### Estonian Air customer review
Staff need to go to charm school. OK so their natural temperament may be reserved but these people are working in an international setting where they will by definition be meeting customers from many different cultures. They should be trained in basic courtesies such as smiling and not looking disdainful when asked for anything.

### Estonian Air customer review
Since the flight from London to Tallinn is 2 to 3 hours not being served a full meal is not such a big problem and you can buy on board snacks at reasonable prices. For what you pay you get pretty good value for money.

### Estonian Air customer review
I've been Estonian Air customer for many years and until recently I had considered it to be a reasonably fine airline. However my last 3 flights were a total disaster so something must have changed with the company. All 3 of my last flights were late by between 2 to 9 hours and 1 flight was cancelled. The flight cancellation was totally mismanaged by Estonian Air's Tallinn staff. There were about 100 passengers queing in line to get redirected at a desk serviced by 2 ladies who appeared to be totally clueless on how to manage it. It took us (4 adults & 2 kids) 90 minutes to get rerouted via Riga. At the end a flight which intended to last some 1 h 30 min ended up being a 9 hours flight. No apologies or compensation was offered - a total mess! When we were boarding our plane to Riga 1 and 1/2 hours after our scheduled departure time to Moscow there were still quite a few people waiting in line to get served. The management should definitely do something to make the airline more efficient and more professional.

Never in my life have I been on a plane with such an appalling lack of legroom. I'm a 5'7" tall woman but my knees were jammed into the back of the seat in front and it really was a very uncomfortable 3 hours to Tallinn. I don't know how men or taller people manage but it was shockingly cramped. On the way back I asked for an aisle seat so that at least one of my legs wasn't in danger of getting DVT. Another thing which I found ridiculous in this day and age was that you can't get electronic tickets by e-mail with Estonian Air. I had to pay £15 to have my old-fashioned paper tickets sent by courier because I had booked at short notice. Apart from that the staff were quite friendly and the check-in procedure very efficient. The perfect airline for short people and technophobes

Arrived at Gatwick on July 29th 2006 having pre booked with Thomas Cook. Mix up between Estonian Air and Thomas Cook meant that we had been issued with electronic tickets whereas Estonian Air Agents only let you on board with paper tickets. The Estonian Air ticket Agent's desk (Aviance) looked like the last helicopter out of Saigon with people milling around trying to exchange electronic tickets for paper tickets. Far from helping us and despite the fact that they had two seats booked in our names that we showed them full booking details that we could demonstrate our identity and that the Thomas Cook Agent even came along personally to vouch for us the Estonian Air Agents would not issue us with paper tickets so we missed our flight. BAA should insist that these small airlines employ at least one person at the airport who can help genuine customers not prevent them from flying. We had prepaid valid bookings but couldn't get on the flight.

LGW-TLL return. Flexible economy ticket - £300 allows passengers to sit in the business class cabin which was worth it as no complimentary catering in the Y cabin. Food okay - served on china tableware. Metal cutlery. Poor selection of drinks though with white wine very lukewarm. Overall a decent product at a very decent price for a 2.5-3 hour flight. Estonian are the only airline to fly direct LGW-TLL and for that alone I'd recommend them.
