### "review your ticketing policies"
I'm writing to express my disappointment with the check-in experience for my flight from Kathmandu to Dubai today. Despite booking my ticket in advance, I was asked to wait at check-in, citing that my ticket was booked on the same day. However, another passenger who arrived after me was allowed to check in after a brief conversation with the staff. When I spoke to the in-charge, he was unhelpful, stating that he had the authority to make decisions but he wouldn't allow me to check in. I urge you to review your ticketing policies and ensure that staff are trained to handle situations fairly and professionally. Overselling tickets can cause significant inconvenience, especially for those traveling for emergencies or with limited financial resources. Fortunately, I went to another staff member assisted me politely and 1 person got offloaded, then after 2hour 45 minutes waiting I got boarding pass.

### “I urge Nepal Airlines to take responsibility”
I am a passenger on Nepal Airlines Flight RA-225 from Kathmandu to Bangalore on February 27. I am writing to formally express my frustration and disappointment with the way my flight cancellation was handled. Firstly, my flight was canceled without any prior notice via email or phone, either to me or my travel agency. Upon arriving at the airport, I found that several managers were present, yet none of them seemed to know what to do. When I informed them that my family and I needed to reach Bangalore urgently for our New Year celebrations the next day, they showed little concern or willingness to assist. After repeatedly going back and forth between different offices and waiting for answers, I was finally told that Nepal Airlines could only fly us to Mumbai, and from there, we would have to arrange our own travel to Bangalore. This was shocking and unacceptable, but since we had no other option, we had to agree. Upon arriving in Mumbai, I learned that Nepal Airlines had arranged connecting flights for some U.S. passengers from Mumbai to Bangalore, while leaving most of us stranded without any support. I attempted to contact Nepal Airlines but my calls were ignored. I also sent messages via WhatsApp, which were seen but not responded to. When I finally managed to speak to someone, I was blamed for going to Mumbai, and was told that because of this, the airline would not book us a connecting flight. This response was shocking and completely unacceptable. Due to Nepal Airlines’ failure to provide proper assistance, I had to book my own flight from Mumbai to Bangalore at a high cost, with no compensation or refund. I urge Nepal Airlines to take responsibility for this situation and provide a refund for my additional expenses, as well as an explanation for the poor handling of this issue.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified | Avoid this airline at all cost. I was overweight on my luggage and happy to pay, however, they don’t take cards and did not have change to take cash, making me wait for almost half an hour. Management were terribly rude in the process. I travel a lot, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this.

### "Seat arrangement was disaster"
Not Verified |  I never expect flying in business class also need to suffer from these issues - checking in for economy and business class at the same counter so need to wait like hell. Seat arrangement was disaster. I was assigned near the door while the back seat was empty and next to my seat was occupied by the staff seems a higher position. I request to change my seat but back seat was taken by someone else not sure from where she appear. Lounge food was okay not really impressed but staff was really nice and polite also the guidance was helpful. Also the lounge should be after security check so while I wait for boarding I can relax there. But hats off to the gentleman (crew member) good service and polite. Seems he is the only one serving business class .

### "poorest customer service"
Worst airlines with poorest customer service. They cancelled my flight at last moment without any proper prior notice leaving all of the passengers stranded at the airport with no alternatives. They staff were quite useless and didn't provide proper support for rescheduling. It has been over 2 weeks and I am still waiting for my refund. Similar issue happened on my return trip as well. The flight got delayed by over 4 hours causing me to miss my connection flight. Due to the irresponsibility of Nepal airlines I lost almost 500dollars on booking new flight, missed hotel reservations, connection flights and buses. Never book from Nepal Airlines again.

### "Flight was quite good"
We took flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. The aircraft was Airbus. Flight was quite good and on time. Food that was given during flight was good and well presented. cabin crew was so friendly and humble.

### "worst experience ever for me"
Not Verified |  Its my first time using Nepal Airlines from Dubai to Kathmandu and this is the worst experience ever for me because of flight delays. Its already been 5 hrs but still they didn’t give us any specific reason why the flight got delayed or cancelled and when we asked one of the employee from Nepal airlines he said no idea.

### "flight has been delayed for 7 hrs"
Not Verified | Disappointed! Booked the plane ticket 1 week before. On the day of check in at night they informed that the flight has been delayed for 7 hrs. I have to go for my duty on the same day but without any information they just said they will take me to a hotel take all the responsibility. They should have informed us 3/4 hrs before about the delay so that we could do something. Worst service. Will never travel with this airline.

### "cabin crew were professional"
Nepal Airlines is a cheap option for direct flights from Nepal with good service. Nepal Airlines improved its service over time. The cabin crew were professional and meal served was good.

### "meal provided during flight is delicious"
We took Flight from Kathmandu to Bangkok by Nepal airlines for our Holiday trip. Flight was on time, meal provided during flight is delicious and have veg and non veg options. Staff of airline were well behaved and professional. I will use service of Nepal in future as well. Highly recommended.

### "good idea to try Nepal Airlines"
Flight was on time, food provided is very good and warm. They did provide us window seat while boarding. It’s good idea to try Nepal Airlines for onward journey if you are traveling from/to Nepal.

### "Cabin crew were professional"
We travelled from Bangkok to Kathmandu on 10th Feb. 2023 the flight was on time. They served hot meal during 3 hrs flight. Cabin crew were professional. Airplane used during our flight was narrowbody so no entertainment was available.

### "little to complain about"
Pleasantly surprised with my 1 1/2 hour trip from New Dehli to Katmandu. No issues, Left just a few mins late. Would have arrived on time, but thunderstorms in Kathmandu forced us to hold for 20 mins in the air. Staff were pleasant and a full meal was served. Decent value, with little to complain about. Would use again.

### "Hospitality was great from your staff"
I had heard lots about this airline. Somehow they were able to justify their services. Sanitation and cleanliness were lacking, they need to bring this matter to their attention. Hospitality was great from your staff.

### "overall it was great"
Not Verified |  Hong Kong to Kathmandu. The food of Nepal Airlines was the best. The entertainment was average and even the seat, but overall it was great! There was no delays which was great.

### "regret to opt for this airline"
Kathmandu to Delhi. I regret to opt for this airline as the cost was cheap but they have a pathetic customer service. My flight got delayed and nobody from Nepal airlines told me about my delay. I called the Cs team and she told me she did not call me as there was no local number? Why would a person who doesn't live in Nepal carry a local number while booking the flight? She later had a defence that she did not even have my email! I wonder how did she email me the tickets without having an email. All in all, i am wasting 6 hours at the airport because the airlines could not afford a international call. Your choice now.

### "delayed by over 5 hours"
Kathmandu to Hong Kong. The flight is constantly delayed and is over price. The flight is 3-5 hours late. The previous time I took the flight which was delayed by over 5 hours and did not provide any good reason for it. The same this time, but the situation is  worse because we had to get to airport before 8 and the flight was supposedly should fly at 11:30, which did not happen. I wouldn’t mind if they gave a valid reason for why they are late, but yet again they give no reason to why they were delayed or even if they were aware of it.

### "usually never on time"
Bangalore to Kathmandu. One of the worst airlines if you consider on time performance. They are usually never on time. On time is word which is not in their dictionary. They do not provide information about the delay on their website and surprisingly other flight tracking websites also do not reflect the actual time of this airline. Prepare to get delayed by 2-3 hours under normal circumstances. I have traveled Nepal Airlines more than 30 times and maybe once it was on time (yes I was surprised).

### " treatment absolutely shameless"
Kathmandu to Mumbai. Terrible management. We were travelling with two senior citizens (80 and 77 years old) and they refused refused to provide us with two wheelchairs. They insisted that it was only a “2 minute” walk from the checkin counter till the boarding gate and that the 77 year old should attempt to walk it herself. This treatment was absolutely shameless. We would not recommend this flight to anyone. We are just completely appalled.

### "I am waiting past 5 hours"
Worst management by  Nepal Airline. I am very upset. I am waiting past 5 hours at the Airport. Scheduled flight was of 8 am. Jet airways and other flight scheduled after it already departed. They themselves are not aware of flight. They told us flight will get delayed by 3 hours, but its still 5 hours and I am still waiting. Plus the canteen at the international is overly priced. Airport is overly crowded. Moreover, I have to take off from my office today. I can understand how others might have wasted their important time too. Worst management ever!

### "Pleasantly surprised."
Bengaluru to Kathmandu. The plane was a new A320 in mint condition. No entertainment system but it was a short flight around 2 hours and 45 minutes. We did take off about an hour late, and arrived 45 minutes late. The crew apologized for the delay. They served drinks during the flight, and later a dinner of a vegetarian curry, which was decently tasty for an airline meal. The toddler sitting near me received a special order child meal. Flight attendants were friendly and courteous. The seats were pretty basic, but had a small net storage pouch for items like the safety magazine or glasses case/headphones. Pleasantly surprised.

### "delayed the flight 4 times"
Delhi to Kathmandu. Never ever opt for this airline. Such a pathetic service. They delayed the flight 4 times by a total to almost 7-8 hours. Harrassing behaviour of the airline and no compensation. No sorry.

### "my worst experience"
Kathmandu to Bangkok. I don’t recommend to fly with Nepal airlines. After my worst experience with traveling aboard, I advise you against Nepal airlines. I bought my first flight of return in Nepal airlines. It was a flight from Kathmandu to Bangkok, where I was going to take my second flight. First, I received that the flight had been delayed from 11 am to 4 pm by e-mail with only 12 hours I’m advance. As soon I received the e-mail, I call Nepal airlines office in airport because with the new schedule I would miss my second flight. In every call a different phone-extension was given. After my seventh call, I was advised to go to the airport because they could resolve my problem personally. In the airport, I was told to wait for someone, that had never appeared. I went to the police, that put me in (in Nepal airport, you have to have a ticket to get in). There, I was received with rudeness and unprofessionally by every Nepal airlines employees. For instance, I was told that I wasn’t allowed to be there and I was going to be kick out of the airport. Once again, I was told to be in the airport in the next morning because it was their responsibility to resolve my problem. Next morning, I was once again received with rudeness and unprofessionally. No one ever apologized for the inconvenience neither assumed the responsibility. Instead they only gave us one option going to the hotel. After getting upset, they started giving me other options, such us other companies flights and get into city center office. However, everything was fake. Never had been a option of flying with other company when I questioned them. Never had been a option to go to Kathmandu when I confronted them. At the end, I fly with Nepal airlines not even in 4 pm, but 7pm and I missed my connection flight. It was outrageous how an international airlines have dealt with their customers. Their were rude, impolite, unserious, liars and made fun of us. Therefore, I advise every traveler against flying with Nepal airlines.

### "Overall the flight was good"
I had a Nepal Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. The flight was 8 am but suddenly changed its time to 11 am and no one informed about that. Was surprised that on that day they were using A330. It was a new bird. So after sitting in the flight we waited there 1 hr due to traffic - so more delay. But the cabin was really good. They had entertainment System that was really good. Good selection of movies. They had veg and non veg food option - I choose the veg option and the food needs to get improvement.They also served soft drink. Overall the flight was good except the food needs improvement.

### "no entertainment system"
Kathmandu to Mumbai. Flight time was 13.55 in ticket. To confirm I called in office and the informed that time has been changed and been 4.30 but it got half an hour delay. Thats fine. Flights boarding finished just in 15 minutes. And We were in air in 5.30 pm. While talking about the legroom It was very good. A320 was new and cabin looked good. They served beer or cold drinks with the dinner. Food was good. Never expected that from Nepal airlines. It needs more improvement. There was no entertainment system just screen above our head that showed flight status. I took my own entertainment system. Otherwise flight was smooth.

### "do not travel with Nepal Airlines"
Doha to Kathmandu, the flight departure timing was scheduled for 0305 and on the same day when we reached at airport, we came to know that flight timing has been postponed to 1655 it means almost 14 hours delayed. We meet the staff of Nepal airlines and asked him for the solution. He suggests us to go back to the room or wait in airport waiting lounge. He also said that, "I will give you 35 riyal food voucher". How cheap is that? After a long time discussion (around 1-2 hours) they are agreed to pay the taxi fare and advised us to return back to our own accommodation. As we don't have any option so we agreed and returned back to our own accommodation. On the same day at afternoon: we came again in airport, and everything was going smoothly. But again we faced the issue over luggage. As per the ticket, it was mentioned 40kg luggage allowance. And again they were saying that, they reduced the luggage allowance and now it is only 35kg allowable. Afterwards, we paid 110QAR and proceed for immigration. On Board cabin crew behavior makes us totally disappointed. T I asked for water and they gave in small cup, when I again asked for another glass of water then she says, "Please wait until I finish to serve others. Return From Kathmandu to Doha we faced the same issue while returning, Our actual flight timing was for 11:20PM but when I called to their representative 01 day before, they informed us that, flight is scheduled for 08:00AM it means around 15 hours early. We went to their office and informed them that, we cannot travel 15 hours early and requested them to provide the ticket after that timing. Again they started arguing with us. After 1 hour discussion, they provided us connection flight (Jet Airways) via Mumbai. There was no any information regarding reschedule of flight and luggage allowance. I suggest that you do not travel with Nepal Airlines.

### "what a fantastic airline it turned out to be"
Kathmandu to Delhi. I flew Nepal Airlines as the national flag carrier of Nepal. Was a bit apprehensive choosing this airline but what a fantastic airline it turned out to be, flights were punctual, priority boarding at all sectors, attentive and smiling and also the in-flight food was very tasty. Apart from the security checks at TIA and Immigration, everything else was as good if not better comparing to some other 5* airlines I have flown. Give this airline a try and you will be pleasantly surprised.

### "friendly welcome from flight attendants"
Flew Nepal Airlines from Delhi to Kathmandu on 16 May - 10.30am departure to allow for a full afternoon in Kathmandu. Friendly check-in agent gave my friend and I a full row to ourselves. Typical long lines at Delhi immigration but was able to use the lounge as my friend is an Amex Centurion member. Food and drink were available but nothing special. Flight boarded on-time to one of their newer A320's, friendly welcome from flight attendants and I liked the aircraft interior - the bulkhead had pictures of Mt Everest on it. Business class seats looked nice but that section was empty. Coach was pretty full but a few open rows in the front. Coach flight attendants were friendly and served drinks and a good meal once in flight for the 1 hour 15 minutes in the air. The toilets were busy so some people went to business class toilet and were literally chased out by the business class flight attendant. She was horrible - she was just sitting up there doing nothing - not even helping the coach attendants do their drink runs. It was nothing to let people use that front toilet. Landed on time with some nice views of the area as the cloud layer broke as we decended. Bags came off quickly and thru immigration. Overall a good flight.

### "a good flying experience"
Kathmandu to Delhi. I traveled in Nepal Airlines, in Boeing plane named Gandaki. Flight was good, as compared to many international flights, specially flying in and out of India and China. The ground staff were friendly, onboard staff were good too. The plane was old, and seats were less comfortable, and no entertainment on board. But the meals and drink were good, and fresh. The take off and landing were very smooth. Flight information were less than I expected. Overall, it was a good flying experience.

### "would highly recommend "
Myself and my fiancee flew business class from Dubai to Kathmandu return for a last minute trip to Kathmandu. At the time of booking i knew very little about the airline, but from the minute we got to the check in desk, if you are business you are ushered to the front of the queue and well looked after. The business class was comfortable for the price we paid, no in flight entertainment but the meals are served with china plates and  really tasty, breakfast served was an omlette. On the return, Kathmandu business lounge was the best thing about this airport, it is luxury compared to the rest of the airport. The country is beautiful and I would highly recommend anyone to go and fly with Nepal Airlines, they were great!

### "smiling inflight service"
Mumbai to Kathmandu with Nepal Airlines. The flight was on time, great food but could be improved. Smiling inflight service, pilots are great. There is no entertainment but overall for a 2.5 hour flight it is comfortable and looking forward to flying again with Nepal Airlines.

### "a less than decent experience"
Delhi to Kathmandu with Nepal Airlines. Tried this airline again after a very long time. I thought after introduction of their brand new A320 they would providing smooth customer service on their new routes. I was wrong. The staff took about half an hour to check us in, which is ridiculous. Inflight, there are no IFE systems, which was expected, but there were overhead moniters that came out of the overhead compartments, albeit only showing flight status and route duration. The food served was absolutely tasteless. Peas, mashed potatoes, paneer sticks, apple pie (terrible) and drinks were served. Even though I flew economy, my friend flying in their business class complained of the same food dilemma. The airlines magazine was decent. The aircraft interior was very good being a brand new aircraft. The seat was semi-comfortable. All over, it was a less than decent experience and I wouldn't fly with them again. I'd rather choose Air India, Jet or Himalayan Airlines on the DEL-BOM route.

### "food served was not upto standard"
Boeing 757, "Karnali" from Bangalore to Kathmandu with Nepal Airlines. The staff at the Bangalore were OK. The check in was smooth. The flight was delayed by about 45 min. The plane Boeing 757 operated by our national carrier Nepal Airlines is probably 24 years old. It looked old, and the cabin was reflecting it's age. There were nothing for entertainment except for newspaper, not even the airline magazine. The food served was not upto the standard specially considering it was an international route. The flight though was very smooth and landing was good.

### "staff nice and polite"
Bangalore to Kathmandu with Nepal Airlines. Food service was good. Staff nice and polite. There was no inflight entertainment but flight was on time. Aircraft was clean. Food better than Air India and Jet Airways.

### "journey was quite good"
Kathmandu to Bengaluru with Nepal Airlines. Despite unavailability of in-flight entertainment, the journey was quite good. Friendly staff, no delays, hot food and beverages and satisfactory ground crew makes Nepal Airlines value for money flight. Cabin neat and clean equipped with enough leg space.

### "service was okay"
Bangalore to Kathmandu. The ground staff was not friendly but inflight, the crew and service was okay. The food and the drink was excellent with the good cabin crew hospitality. There was no entertainment for the 3 hours flight. I didn't like the attitude of the ground service.

### "impressive hot lunch"
Hadn't flown Nepal Airlines in years. Very impressed. Friendly check-in, on-time departure, comfortable seats with winged headrests on the new A320. Legroom was better than on the Jet Airways Boeing 737 of the outbound flight. Impressive hot lunch served on a 1 hour 10 minute flight (better than what Jet Airways serves on the same route).

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Bangkok to Kathmandu, I loved the Nepal Airlines A320 aircraft. The cabin service was efficent and good, and cabin crew were friendly. The food was good, and the seats are comfortable even though legroom is not adequate.

### Nepal Airlines customer review
New plane but limited legroom between seats. Flight departs right on time. For 1hr 30 mins flight refreshing tissues, full meal/drinks served quick and with efficiency. Cabin crew were mostly friendly but the options of meal given was Veg or Non veg which is not up to the standard of any national flag carrier, the least they could do was mention the food being served.

### Nepal Airlines customer review
Nice and clean aircraft, staff were friendly. There was limited leg room between the seats.
