### "Absolutely useless airline"
Absolutely useless airline. Cancelled tickets without notification due to aircraft maintenance. No refunds to speak of and promised to refund airfares but the refund has been postponed indefinitely. Lost money on this due to accommodation deposits lost. Do not ever use this airline! Use reputable airlines.

### "make abuse of the Coronavirus"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Windhoek. They make abuse of the Coronavirus. Because we cannot go to Namibia at the moment we have to change the dates of our holiday. Air Namibia will charge the normal fee (45 usd per person!) to change the dates! Really unbelievable! KLM already did it for free!

### "never fly with this airline again"
Johannesburg to Windhoek. We never got on the airplane. Air Namibia sold us the ticket after the gates were closed for boarding. We missed the flight and I've been trying to get our money back since August 2019. They admitted the were wrong, which I've got in writing. They then payed just over half the amount due, now saying we need to pay penalties. If the mistake was with the airline, as admitted, why are the passengers paying for it? It's R2000.00 in penalties. I will never fly with this airline again, as this is not our first bad experience with them. My parents have property in Namibia, so we fly there often. I will rather pay more and avoid this airline at all cost.

### "won’t recommend it to anyone"
Windhoek to Johannesburg. When checking in at 15H23 for our scheduled flight at 17H30, the assistant at the counter informed me that the flight is delayed. Couldn’t give a departure time, just that the flight from JHB hasn’t left JHB yet, due to a technical problem. And so our waiting of 5 hours 30 minutes started. And the staff wasn’t very informative or helpful. Lounge area disappointing! Plugs don’t work. Totally not up to standard. Our business class experience: seats 2d & 2c The leg/foot rests didn’t work. The food offered was revolting. The flight detail on the onscreen monitor was a joke. I took a photo to show people that we actually flew back in time! current time 22:05, Estimated Arrival time 20:53”  We’ll never make use of this airline again and won’t recommend it to anyone.

### "happy with the overall experience"
Windhoek to Frankfurt. After having read reviews I was prepared for bad service and problems during the flight, but luckily everything was fine and I am quite happy with the overall experience. The aircraft is spacious and clean, seats are comfortable and have a pillow and a blanket for each passenger. The crew was 50% very friendly and 50% not so ("good cop, bad cop"). The food was quite good; however, it might have been better, maybe a dessert could be added. Big selection of drinks but only one type of juice (orange). On the long overnight flight, dinner and breakfast have been offered. During the flight, the crew also offered water. The entertainment system is still not working; it seems to be a persistent problem that the airline is not willing to solve.

### "not business class standard"
It was the first time I flew Air Namibia in June 19 in Business Class: thinking it was/would be a good and short flight from Cape Town via Windhoek to Frankfurt in business, but what I then experienced, was definitely not cool. Ok, the total cost/fare I paid was less than other comparable airlines at that point in time: but the fact that first of all my connection flight, from Cape Town to Windhoek, which was originally scheduled to only need about 1 hour for transit, was actually then cancelled. Hence I was advised - just a few days before departure then - to use a flight from Cape Town to Windhoek much earlier, leading to a like a 4 hour stopover on Windhoek. Not what I wanted, and also why I did not take another airline into consideration - then I could already have chosen Ethiopian or Turkish etc with a similar stopover time. Anyhow: so: the lounge in Windhoek is not a business lounge-like anywhere else in the world. It is so bad: no proper food, not adequate seats, no service - nothing, not even adequate toilets. Ok, the beer is ok - if that is what you need to survive. Now back to the plane: The service is more than just reasonable - nothing special - but for sure not business class standard. The seats are worn out - but I must admit flat seat at least. But that is basically all I can say positively. All the rest is not business class-related and feeling old. Food, just ok, hardly any selection of drinks and the worst thing: I do not know what really happened to my luggage: it arrived - ok - but in such bad condition. I hardly have ever seen before. So I must assume and believe that happened during the long transfer/transit in Windhoek as described above (as I travel a lot from and to Cape Town) but this trip definitely did wear out my luggage.

### "excellent from start to finish"
Not Verified |  We travelled on Air Namibia after our travel company arranged substitute flights to Victoria Falls due to our Virgin Atlantic plane being delayed from London resulting in us missing our connection. Virgin were very unhelpful offering a new flight 2 days later! The trip with Air Namibia was excellent from start to finish. The crew were very friendly on board, the food was nice. When we landed at Windhoek the ground staff were very helpful ensuring our bags continued the journey and we were kept informed.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with and their customer service is even worse. Less than 24 hours before I was due to fly I received an email from them informing me that these time of my flight would be changing and would now be 3 hours later. This would mean that I would miss my connecting flight, which they were well away of. I spent the rest of the day trying to sort it out, even going to the Air Namibia offices in Windhoek but everyone I spoke to promised to call me back and never did. Eventually, less than 12 hours before my flight I got a reply to tell me they couldn't do anything. I had to spend a night in Johannesburg, booking into a hotel, at my own expense and arrived at my destination a day late. I have since written to Air Namibia on a number of occasions, and not received one reply. This company is appalling, apparently I have since heard that they have a reputation for this sort of thing.

### "incredibly inefficient"
Cape Town to Windhoek. I am in total shock and horror. The communication channels for Air Namibia are incredibly inefficient. I have tried to call 8 numbers to try re-route a ticket, and there has been no connectivity or no answer from Cape Town offices, Johannesburg offices and even Namibia's offices (including head office). This is unbelievably unacceptable? I was on hold at the call centre for 30 mins, ad the website's refund policies do not load. An empty box appears, making it very difficult for us to invest in a ticket change without certainty. I have never flown with Air Namibia before, but I have had countless flights in my life, and changed tickets and routes many times - and it has never proven to be so long, tedious and inefficient. Please could you work on making sure your communication channels are more efficient to ensure a seamless customer experience.

### "a very pleasant flight experience"
Cape Town to Windhoek. Overall it was a very pleasant flight experience. The staff at the check-in counter were very helpful to change us to our desired seats because we had to check-in at the webpage of another airline (codeshare). The seats were comfortable with an average seat-pitch. On board were three options of meal: Chicken, Beef and Fish. We had forgotten to order a vegetarian meal. But the staff prepared us a vegetarian mean from the sides of the other meals. In generall al staff of Air Namibia, with whom we were in contact were very friendly and helpful.

### "crew were friendly and helpful"
Windhoek to Frankfurt with Air Namibia. The ground staff were helpful to assign us the desired seats. The plane was quite new and provided a modern entertainment system (unfortunately with a smaller selection of movies compared to other airlines). The seats were comfortable with a usual seat pitch. The crew were friendly and helpful. During the flight were three choices of food offered (Chicken, Beef and Fish).

### "Never fly with Air Namibia"
Cape Town to Windhoek. Never fly with Air Namibia, flew back to Frankfurt via Windhoek on 17.02.2019 after a four-week holiday in Cape Town. The problem actually started when checking in in Cape Town. We have never experienced such unfriendly and unwilling groundworkers who refuse work. The highlight of the outrage was, however, that for my golf baggage that the approved dimensions exceeded by as much as 6cm, a transport fee of 2 322, - Rand (about € 150, -) was charged. The checking-in employee put on his tape measure until he really came to the 6 cm. Of course we did not agree and tried by all means to avoid this arbitrary charge. Unfortunately, we have come to the wrong address with the two colleagues. Neither Ziupad nor Sean (Supervisor) were in any way willing to compromise. They shone through ignorance and unimaginable stubbornness, combined with a rudeness that is second to none. Even my objection that the luggage on the way in Franfkfurt in any way appreciated and simply waved, the situation did not improve. After much discussion in the course of which I wanted to speak to the supervisor, they even did not shy away from letting the police come to the counter. We paid a total of € 4423.16 for the flight. And then this very nice holiday was completely messed up by this action. That was just the beginning of a flight full of mishaps. On the connecting flight to Frankfurt, I can only confirm what the travelers from France (N Ranelle) from 29.10.2018 had experienced before me. Very unfriendly crew. The two business class toilets were blocked for hours by the crew. Entertainment System failed in more than half of Business Class. No magazines. Seats only mediocre. Drink service during the night not available. The top, however, was the Business Lounge in Windhoek. Ripped sofas, makeshift louvered ceilings. Dirty carpeting, plastic cutlery and dishes. I have attached pictures. Unfortunately, I also have to say that the airline does not manage to keep any aircraft or building in order. Everything is used until it falls apart. In the future, we will fly to South Africa only Arab or Asian airlines, even if we will be traveling longer. For a stay of more than four weeks, this is not so significant and is more than offset by the friendly and perfect service, the modern airplanes and business lounges with smaller money. Leider auch bei uns: Nie mehr mit Air Namibia fliegen, wir sind am 17.02.2019 nach einem vier-wöchigen Urlaub in Kapstadt zurück nach Frankfurt über Windhoek geflogen. Das Problem ging eigentlich schon beim Einchecken in Kapstadt los. So ein unfreundliches und unwilliges, arbeitsverweigerndes Bodenpersonal haben wir noch nicht erlebt. Der Höhepunkt der Unverschämtheiten war aber der, dass mir für mein Golfgepäck, dass die zugelassenen Maße um sage und schreibe 6cm übertraf, eine Beförderungsgebühr von 2.322,-- Rand (ca. € 150,--) in Rechnung gestellt wurde. Der eincheckende Mitarbeiter legte sein Maßband so oft an, bis er wirklich auf die 6 cm kam. Natürlich waren wir damit nicht einverstanden und versuchten mit allen Mitteln, diese willkürliche Gebühr zu vermeiden. Doch leider sind wir bei den beiden Kollegen an die falsche Adresse geraten. Weder Ziupad noch Sean (Supervisor) zeigten sich in irgendeiner Weise kompromißbereit. Sie glänzten durch Ignoranz und unvorstellbarer Sturheit, verbunden mit einer Unfreundlichkeit, die ihresgleichen sucht. Auch mein Einwand, dass das Gepäck auf dem Hinflug in Franfkfurt in keiner Weise gewürdigt und einfach durchgewinkt wurde, verbesserte die Situation nicht. Nach heftiger Diskussion in deren Verlauf ich dne Vorgesetzten sprechen wollte, scheuten sie sich sogar nicht, die Polizei zum Schalter kommen zu lassen. Wir haben für den Flug insgesamt € 4423,16 bezahlt. Und dann wurde uns dieser sehr schöne Urlaub durch diese Aktion komplett versaut. Das war nur der Anfang eines Fluges voller Pannen. Bei dem Anschlußflug nach Frankfurt kann ich nur bestätigen, was die Reisenden aus Frankreich (N Ranelle) vom 29.10.2018 vor mir erlebt hatten. Sehr unfreundliche Crew. Die beiden Business Class Toilietten wurden stundenlang von der Crew blockiert. Entertainment System bei mehr als der Hälfte der Business Class ausgefallen. Keine Zeitschriften. Sitze auch nur mittelmäßig. Getränkeservice während der Nacht nicht vorhanden. Die Spitze war allerdings die Business Lounge in Windhoek. Zerfetzte Sofas, notdürftig mit Decken kaschiert. Dreckiger Teppichboden, Plastik-Besteck und Geschirr. Ich habe Bilder beigefügt. Leider muß ich auch hier feststellen, dass es die Airline nicht schafft, weder Flugzeuge noch Gebäude in Stand zuhalten. Es wird alles so lange benutzt, bis es auseinander fällt. Wir werden in Zukunft nach Südafrika nur noch arabischen oder asiatischen Airlines fliegen, auch wenn wir dadurch länger unterwegs sein werden. Bei einem Aufenthalt von mehr als vier Wochen fällt dies aber nicht so ins Gewicht und wird durch den freundlichen und perfekten Service, die modernen Flugzeuge und Business Lounges bei kleinerem Geld mehr als wett gemacht.

### "never fly again with Air Namibia"
We were traveling from Frankfurt to Windhoek in the business class. A night flight. Several screens were not working in the business class. Others could not been switched off. 4 air hostesses, 3 woman (the oldest one was friendly I have to say) and 1 man. Unbelievable behavior of the crew (never seen in any other company) in some way imperious, telling clients to do things, without any courtesy and politeness. No friendly responses to questions either. My daughter politely asked for a second bread roll and there were a prompt and harsh answer without any smile: "no you have to wait that I have given one to everybody! It was embarrassing. I had the impression that she was angry about her work and everybody in business class. Not willing to do her job and not willing to make people feel comfortable. The man was also very unpolite, he stood in front of passengers with a plastic bag open (to collect blankets), just waiting that you put your blanket by yourself in this collecting bag which is not a problem, but no word, no "please could you" no "thank you" or something polite. It was highly unprofessional. They were all ungracious except the older lady. We arrived at around 7h00 at Windhoek. At around 12h00 we realized that we have had forgotten our computer in the overhead compartment. Aircraft was still in the airport. I called lost and found and a very bored lady said, the cleaner have given nothing to me and I cannot do anything. Later at the airport, ground staff also told me how can you proof that you have forgotten the computer there! Cleaner from the aircraft said that he had found nothing and that maybe the crew took the computer because they do first check to collect forgotten items. At the day of arrival, Air Namibia ground staff was not willing to do any effort or investigation to get the item back. The day after customer care contact told me maybe passengers took it. Just to make things clear: In the business class, the overhead compartment is quite personal. Two seats have their own large overhead compartement. We were sitting completely in front of the aircraft. While leaving the aircraft, no passenger were passing after us and even the computer could not have been seen by other passengers. The overhead compartments are placed very high in the Air Namibia aircraft, computer was not in a bag. Our overhead compartment looked empty, thats why we forgot the computer. We will never fly again with Air Namibia.

### "entertainment not working"
Frankfurt to Windhoek. Unfriendly crew and more than 50% of the entertainment systems not working. Air Namibia knows about the problem because there are reviews from moths ago describing the same problem. Obviously they do nothing against it.

### "certainly a step above SAA"
Windhoek to Jahannesburg. Excellent service, food excellent, great crew, comfortable seats and certainly a step above SAA. I travel 10 times a year to Namibia, and unfortunately I’m driven by frequent flyer programme loyalty, but as the said carrier continues to shrink its network, it’s going to be air Namibia for my future trips

### "customer service is non-existent"
Paris to Windhoek via Frankfurt. We have flown Air Namibia a few times. Their inflight service and on-time arrivals were quite good. The way they handled connecting flights for us however was incompetent and the general customer service which was needed as a result, was incredibly poor. We booked our 13 year old son to Paris on Air Namibia. While the connection via Frankfurt (connection flight on Lufthansa) was o.k. on the way back Air Namibia booked him on an Air France flight from Paris to Frankfurt, with onward connection to Windhoek on Air Namibia. In Paris he was denied boarding on the grounds that Air France – unlike Lufthansa - has a minimum age requirement for alone travelling juniors of 14 years. (Lufthansa's minimum age is 12). Air France check-in staff said that he should have never been booked that way by Air Namibia as the age of the traveler is obviously known when the booking is made. When he was denied boarding we rushed to the Windhoek Airport asking Air Namibia staff for help and to re-book our son on LH connecting flight for the next day. We were surprised that while admitting their mistake they charged us for the re-booking (LH instead of AF) and said we should contact Customer Service for a refund. Apart from a holding reply after 2 days we have not heard back from them in more than 3 months. Reminders were ignored. Not only a very incompetent booking system but also a customer service which is non-existent. Sad for an airline which otherwise tries hard to compete. We might fly them again for any easy non-stop flights, but certainly not for any trip that requires a connecting flight.

### "never fly Air Namibia again"
Frankfurt to Windhoek. I try to keep it short, to summarize our experience with Air Namibia, based on a booked holiday, originally starting 24th of October. Original Flight Frankfurt to Windhoek on 24th of October cancelled with short notice we had to rebook to fly a day earlier, leading to additional costs for room and expense - Taxi etc. Confirmed booking for seats was lost Asian Vegetarian food booking not fulfilled - 1 poor spare replacements for 2 guests evening food, Breakfast cancelled totally, as no vegetarian food available Flight Windhoek - Victoria Falls confirmed booking for seats was lost Flight Victoria Falls - Windhoek Plane broken - announcement of 2 hour delay Plane left Victoria Falls late by 4 hours late. Plane was not going back to Windhoek directly, as redirected to Harare to pick up waiting passenger and save flight costs from there, additional 2 hours flight time we had to leave the plane in Harare to redo the emigration and security process from scratch, nor did your crew have a clue that this will happen - additional 45 minutes of chaos and confusion. Crew had no clue what about the overall situation of passengers, neither their arrangements to be hit. Arrival Time Windhoek 23:30 - approx 6 hours late - Luckily we did not have a flight booked back to Frankfurt as 6 passengers this night, as that flight was missed. No possibility to pick up booked rental car, as all companies closed already. Additional costs for Taxi and delivery by rentals company next morning to hotel. Flight Windhoek- Frankfurt Confirmed booking for seats gone - new seats arranged by friendly ground crew, just to find out that the entertainment program for these seats were broken, as it was for other passengers on the flight 2 weeks before, so no wonder that theses seats were free. Poor quality control. As a summary, the ground staff and flight crews were friendly and helpful (mostly), the decisions made by called management are not just questionable, they will lead to damage for the name of the company. We will never fly Air Namibia again, better booking via South African Airways. 2 Stars for parts of the crews and groundstaff only. Not to mention, customer service post flight seems to ignore direct communication.

### "First leg was cancelled"
I have 3 flights with Air Namibia in December. First Johannesburg to Walvis Bay, via Windhoek : First leg was cancelled. A few days later I get noticed that my sons ticket from Walvis Bay to Cape Town also was cancelled. Now I worry for my last Air Namibia ticket from Walvis Bay to Windhoek. Is something up or are they just cancelling 2 of 3 flights to and From Walvis Bay?

### "what a pleasant surprise"
First time with Air Namibia flying from Johannesburg to Windhoek. What a pleasant surprise. Excellent cabin crew, a complete meal served on a 1hr40 min flight, and on time. Henceforth I'll make Air Namibia my carrier of choice whenever I travel to Windhoek. Keep up the good work.

### "attendants were friendly "
Windhoek to Cape Town. The food was plenty, attendants were friendly and firm in their instruction. A delay in boarding at Windhoek and no announcement that that was what was happening. Jerking and shaking as the aircraft took off, when I asked one of the staff he said "it was the wind, strong wind.

### "plenty of food and drinks"
I was happy with the four Air Namibia flights of this trip (Frankfurt-Windhoek, Windhoek-Cape Town and back). Plenty of food and drinks, only one minor delay, everyone was nice and the price was great. However, at Cape Town Airport the check-in for the flight back opened way too late. There wasn't enough time to pass all the necessary security check and passport control queues. When we had to ask for airport employee help at the passport control queue, they were rude and said it wasn't their problem, but the airline's. This caused delays at both Cape Town and Windhoek and we almost missed the connection. Frequent travellers said this was a common problem on Fridays, should have been addressed by now. Also, the website doesn't have a filter for visas required to enter the destination.

### "various bad experiences"
Durban to Windhoek via Gabarone. Various bad experiences on Air Namibia starting from purchasing the tickets. Such a rude agent in the office in Windhoek assisted me. After much unnecessary attitude and lack of willingness to help I got to purchase my tickets. The trip from Windhoek to Durban was absolutely fine, plane was late, but the trip was fine, however the trip back was a nightmare. We did a little holiday shopping and we knew one of our bags was going to be overweight, we asked to be checked in together, they said no, my bag was 20kgs, boyfriends bag was 28kgs. We said its fine we will pay the excess, they refused and said we had to take items out of our bags. We took our toiletries out, some boots and a heavy wrapped gift we received from the family we visited. Thereafter I had to wait until they could confirm if there was still a seat available for me on the plane. I finally got checked into the flight after almost 3 hours, we got to security and turns out heavy gift was a vintage bottle of alcohol in a vintage case, so we could not take it through. We had to then go buy a bag to place all items back in, and try to get the bag checked into luggage again. Back at check in counter we get informed that we now have to pay excess for this bag if we are to check it in. So suddenly they can allow excess payments but earlier in the morning when we originally wanted to pay the overweight charges we were refused. By some small miracle a lady at the counter assisted us and we could check the bag in at the 'Large parcels' desk. The flight was also about 30mins late, after which we all boarded but could not take off because there were 4 infants on the plane but the incompetent persons at check in did not check the passengers with infants into the correct seats, (seats with 3 oxygen masks) it was then another 20mins of begging people to switch seats with these mommies and babies. Be warned fellow frequent flyers, if you wish to ever reach your destinations on time Air Namibia is not the airline to fly with.

### "most luggage left behind"
Cape Town to Walvis Bay a week ago. Most luggage left behind in CPT with excuse that more fuel was needed. Flew back from Walvis Bay to Cape Town and not one piece on luggage of all the passengers arrived. Same fuel story given. No one can once again advise on when our luggage will arrive. Air Namibia is takung us for fools. No compensation offered when we arrived in Walvis Bay and stayed without luggage till the following night.

### "rest of the flight was good"
Frankfurt to Windhoek operated by Air Namibia A330. In general the flight went well. The A330 is a modern aircraft and the cabin was modern and the seats comfortable. During this flight we had two meals which were good but no more. On this flight there is no wifi and the inflight entertainment was really bad - a little choice of films only available in two languages. For me the worst thing on this flight is the cabin staff. There are not pro-active and not friendly and helpful. We were forbidden to stay in the back galley and we had to return to sit as soon as we had finished drinking and eating. I don't recommend this airline for that, but all the rest of the flight was good.

### "overall a nice flight"
Frankfurt to Windhoek with Air Namibia. Overall a nice flight, friendliness of staff above average. Food / drinks above average. Selection from 3 different meals, quick service, drinks (also with alcohol) before and after the meals. Age of the aircrafts under 3 years - means almost new. Entertainment system with high-res 10" adjustable screen and some new movies at every seat. Seat legroom average. Newspapers / magazines only for business class.

### "not a care in the world"
Lusaka to Cape Town via Windhoek. I booked this ticket on line, about 4 weeks before the departure date. I had to phone the Air Namibia call center after booking as I received a confirmation email but not the e-ticket. The night before the departure, around 20:00, I received a call from Air Namibia informing me the flight had been cancelled due to an operational issue (most likely not enough booked passengers) I was given the option of being re-booked on any of the daily flights on South African Airways to Johannesburg and then Air Namibia to Windhoek. I chose the 13:25 flight and was told to pop into their office at the airport to collect my new ticket as it would be waiting for me. Unfortunately it wasn't and it took three hours of sitting around and a final mad rush to board (ever walked onto a plane where everyone has been sitting waiting to see what idiot has held up the flight?) Anyway, to cut it short, a journey that should have been 4 hours (check in and flight time) ended up being 11 hours. Air Namibia, not a care in the world.

### "if I was offloading myself"
On 8 September I flew to Windhoek. I departed Johannesburg on SW722 at 06h40 and was due to return on SW729 at 1735 the same day. The tickets cost me ZAR 4,854.94 in total. My meeting was very short, so I decided to return to Johannesburg earlier. I went online and changed the time of my flight to 14h55. At this time, there was no option to change anything other than the time since the website showed that all economy seats were sold out and that there were only two Business Class seats free. It cost me ZAR 1,230.95 to change the ticket. When I arrived at the airport, I went to collect my ticket and received my boarding pass without incident. My seat was now 11A. I got to the aircraft and found that I was now directed to an Economy Class Seat. I queried this with the cabin staff and they told me that I chose to pay R 1,230.95 and to convert my seat to economy. I asked how this was possible - they were unable to answer. They even checked my printed ticket that I still had with me and agreed that I had initially booked a Business Class ticket. I then also noticed that there were in fact about 8 open Business Class seats and about 20 open Economy Class seats! In the end, they crew was so adamant not to allow me the benefit of sitting in those "special seats" that they delayed the flight by over 20 minutes and made everyone wait. I made it clear several times that I will not delay other passengers over this and suggested that I be refunded and that I have my later Business Class ticket returned. The staff eventually asked me if I was "offloading myself" and told me that - if I get off, they could not guarantee that I would have the seat I paid for, on the later flight! In the end I was forced to sit in Seat 11A and told that I could fly home and that I could contact Air Namibia for a refund later.

### "very good airline for the budget"
Frankfurt to Windhoek. I was surprised by Air Namibia. The airline offered a super service and you could watch many movies, the service of the cabin crew was great, the stewardesses have skilful English and German which helped. Generally a very good airline for the budget.

### "no reason communicated to passengers"
Johannesburg to Windhoek. After one and a half hour delay no indication given of the actual time the flight will depart. No reason communicated to passengers. All consecutive plans made had to be rescheduled. Quite unprofessional considering the amount paid for this flight.

### "told we have been bumped from flight"
Luanda to Cape Town via Windhoek. Connecting flight cancelled so we had to overnight in Windhoek. Total chaos at the check in the next morning with one queue for Luanda, one for Johannesburg and many for other destinations. Although we arrived well in time, the queue moved slowly and there were lots of people. Then the booking clerks start shouting out for passengers for Cape Town and many rush forward. Chaos ensues and because we are travelling with children we cannot move as fast as others. When we are served we are told we have been bumped from the flight (it was over booked). Passengers behind us in the original queue make the flight. We have to overnight a second night in Windhoek (where we still are). Air Namibia are totally disorganized and have no regard for children.

### "an incredible service"
During this Air Namibia flight, I received exceptional service from a flight steward on SWO714 between Cape Town and Walvisbay on 7th December 2015. He went the extra mile to help out with a difficult situation. I noticed on the steps to the aeroplane that I had left one of my hand luggage items in the restaurant in the departure lounge. This was a tragedy for me because the item was a very large framed photograph (shown below) I had taken of my son-in-law, and was meant to be his Christmas present. The steward immediately offered to find out whether it could be retrieved but there was too little time left before take-off. Later on he gave me a cell phone number to enquire with assurance that something could be done. When I phoned that number the following morning, I had little hope of any success but to my surprise the steward himself answered the phone, told me that the picture had been found and will be kept safely until my return from Namibia on 27th December. I ask him if there was any chance of getting the photograph to Walvisbay, seeing that it is a special Christmas present? He said he will see what he can do and will let me know. That very afternoon, I could pick up the picture from the Walvisbay airport – what an incredible service.

### "still a dull experience"
Air Namibia flight from Cape Town to Windhoek in economy class. I lowered my expectation before flying with them but it was still a dull experience. Fortunately, it was only 2 hour flight. The FAs seemed really not interested in doing their jobs. Only good thing was they were not rude. The food was abysmal. I don't even remember what I had. The cleanliness of the plane was below average. Despite this, Namibia is a fascinating place, so don't let the airline discourage you to come.

### "has improved a lot"
In the last past years Air Namibia has improved a lot the service and it's a very affordable and worthy airline. I flew from Windhoek to Cape Town several times this year and the service was very good. Staff were friendly and food quite good as well drinks. Since 2013, Air Namibia has improved and I strongly recommend.

### "would happily fly with Air Namibia again"
Flew Air Namibia from Johannesburg to Windhoek. The staff were very polite and accommodating, there was a large group of us and they were all very helpful and understanding. We were only on the plane for a few hours, but food was served fast and the boarding and unboarding of the plane was quick and painless. I would happily fly with Air Namibia again.

### "very good service"
Air Namibia from Frankfurt to Windhoek return. Very good service, new A330 with good comfort and entertainment, 80cm between seats.

### Air Namibia customer review
Flew business class with my wife and 20 month old toddler to from Windhoek to Cape Town and back. Both flights left on time and boarding was pretty quick even though the flights were pretty full. Onboard service was extremely good. The flight attendants were very friendly and helped with the little one where they could and made the flights a very relaxing experience. They are using relatively new Airbus A319 which were clean and comfortable. Food was good but this usually is the case with Air Namibia on all their flights. No on board entertainment on the flight but for 1hr 50 minutes this was not a problem.

### Air Namibia customer review
SW286 in economy in mid December 2014. I've taken this flight a number of times over the past 10 years this ranked as one of the better experiences by far. First and most important Air Namibia is now using a pair of relatively new leased Airbus 330-200s on this route. The difference between this and the old Airbus Boeing 747s and MD8s are striking. The passenger cabin is clean relatively modern and well lit. The seats have seat-back entertainment systems. I travel with an iPad pre-loaded with movies I want to watch so I can't speak to the entertainment menu itself. The food was relatively bland - simple but edible. They serve a "breakfast" close to landing but it's not up to much. Seat comfort - I was in 20H on the aisle adjacent to the bathrooms. Seat doesn't recline but there is no electrical box under the seat in front of you in row H. Flight departed FRA on time and arrived Windhoek 15 minutes early. The flight attendants were for the most part polite efficient and attentive without being fussy or cloying. This works fine for me but not for everyone. The flight is quite rigorously structured - drinks with a hot meal are served relatively soon after takeoff. The cabin lights are then turned off completely for the bulk of the flight (at least 6 hours). The cabin lights don't come back on until 2 hours before landing. All in all good value for the money and much more comfortable than I remember in the past. I remember this flight being more of an endurance ordeal than anything else I've flown SW286 on and off since 2000 and these new planes make all the difference.

### Air Namibia customer review
Windhoek-Cape Town return in May. The flying product of Air Namibia is very good indeed. New Airbus A319 with good seat comfort. Cheerful cabin crew and ok food. Inflight entertainment on the boring side but no problem for such a short flight. I did like it. What lets them down is the awful administration it takes ages to reach someone by phone and their so called call centre puts you on a loop whenever you are calling. So for me it was thumbs up for the flight and thumbs down for the admin.

### Air Namibia customer review
WDH-JNB. Flight departed on time food was good and service very professional. Seat comfort for a short-haul flight excellent! Boarding in Windhoek could be better. There was no priority counter. As with SAA passengers from Eco should not be allowed to use the toilet in Business class. The flight attendants should see to this.

### Air Namibia customer review
FRA-WDH (Windhoek)-WVB (Walvis Bay): First of all bear in mind that this in an airline that only operates 10 aircraft's in total (out of which only 2 are wide body) so just do not expect them to have the same kind of resources of competitors with much higher economics of scale. Brand new A330-200 (delivered 2013) serving Frankfurt - Windhoek route with relatively simple business seats (2 setting only meal/upright and lie flat) any other position in between could be adjusted by pressing continuously either one of these 2 functions. Leg part is for thigh support only as an extension for calf an ottoman is provided where shoes could be stored underneath. Simple and tidy without confusing buttons. Meals are served in very basic cutlery (on plastic tray) but the taste is surprisingly good (choices between meat/chicken and fish/seafood plus entree and dessert). Crew efficient and friendly without being pretentious. Luggage handling excellent with priority collection for business. Overall an Airline product that well represents Namibia: relax neat and tidy. Definitely recommended if your final destination is Namibia.

Windhoek-Cape Town Business. Good boarding perfectly on time. New A 319 with extremely comfortable Business- seats (2-2 configuration new seats with plenty of rooms). Breakfast was good flight attendants very attentive and checking on the passengers. On time arrival. Can't get better than this flight and price was reasonable.

### Air Namibia customer review
Had a very pleasant experience on my flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg via Windhoek on the new A330-200. Check-in swift and friendly staff. Boarding easy. Departed on time and arrived 30 min ahead of schedule in Windhoek with a 1 hour layover going to Johannesburg. The new A330 is very pleasant seats are very comfortable and was able to sleep for most of the time. Will be using Air Namibia on my future trips.

### Air Namibia customer review
FRA-WDH. Business Class. Separate check-in was efficient. Access to Cathy Pacific lounge. Flight took off on time landed on time. Three course meal + breakfast. Appetizer (smoked salmon) and desert (cheese plate) were good. Wine selection was solid. Main course was below average. Seats were circa 12 years ago. No AVOD but several channels to choose from. My video worked. My colleague in another row was not so lucky. When she brought this up our flight attendant mentioned how the staff was looking forward to the new A330s. Simple touches would have refined my overall view menu cards a little more attention to make up for the sub-par seats etc but overall it was a good flight.

### Air Namibia customer review
WDH-CPT. Business Class Flight departed on time/landed on time. Loads of leg room in both economy and business. I would argue too much leg room in business class (I'm short) but it was more than normal. Business class has in- seat video systems but was not available on shorter routes. Service went like this: welcome drink newspapers coffee/tea breakfast (food was very good). I went to the back cabin during the flight to stretch my legs it was “Economy Plus” seating throughout. At airport I did noticed the business class luggage came out last. Overall a good product new airplane.

### Air Namibia customer review
Frequent Flyer with Air Namibia part of their Rewards programme. Live in Cape Town but work in Namibia every 6 weeks for a week. Use to fly Economy but because of their old planes I moved over to Business. They have however moved to new planes which is fantastic. Still fly Business though. Leg room is great but don't like the harder leather seats (still need to be warn in). On-board attention is good enough (even in business). Its only a 2hr flight to Windhoek so there's only so much attention that I ask for. Only problem I have is the coffee on-board (Business Class). It really is disgusting. However all in all a great airline.

### Air Namibia customer review
Business Cabin was very old. It was impossible to sleep because of the old seat. The entertainment was not working. The wine was very bad I couldn't eat the food. Cabin stuff ignored the PAX (it was a better crew on the way back). FRA-WDH trip - not worth the money. I will avoid Air Namibia!

### Air Namibia customer review
Frankfurt to Windhoek and continuing onto Cape Town three days later - economy. Easy check in at Frankfurt and smooth boarding. Old plane but comfortable seating and pleasant food. No individual entertainment system - just the overhead screen. All staff very helpful and pleasant. Had special deal to upgrade on Windhoek to Cape Town flight for only $600 Namibian dollars. new plane with plenty of leg room and comfortable seat. Great service again. Pleasantly surprised all round and flights left on time arriving early in both cases. Recommended.

### Air Namibia customer review
My wife and I flew SW709 Windhoek - Cape Town on 3 June 2013 in Y/C. Brand new and spacious Airbus A319. Our flight can only be described as excellent! Extremely friendly and attentive crew full of fun and humour with passengers. Full service Dinner was a choice of 4 heated meals! Beef-Chicken-Fish or Vegetarian - very tasty. Flight attendants kept the wine freely flowing! Suggestions to their Cabin Services would be to change their brand of coffee (awful) and to issue disposable earphones to watch the in-flight drop-down movies instead of routing it through the PA system. All in all a great airline and a great crew flying the Spirit of Namibia.

### Air Namibia customer review
Service on board is not so bad but everyday you must fight with cancellations delays and unbelievable situations. Sometimes I fly domestically and generally they are not so bad but awful when I flew long haul WDH-FRA. In FRA after we checked baggage they announced the flight to WDH was delayed until the next day it was no possible to get your luggage back. SW paid hotel and dinner in a good hotel but airline service was very bad.

### Air Namibia customer review
I flew on 18/05/2013 from Cape Town to Windhoek and back on 26/05/2013. Was very surprised with the excellent service and overall great flying experience. The food was very good and although the tickets are a bit expensive for a 2 hour flight I still feel I got value for my money. The only thing Air Namibia should improve on is their in-flight entertainment.

### Air Namibia customer review
Flew Frankfurt to Windhoek on 1.11.12 and return on 11.11.12. Outward journey a little delayed due to mandatory inspection return journey on time. Big comfortable Airbus 340 food quite pleasant and flight attendants efficient if a little unsmiling. Entertainment not much good but no problem on a night flight.

### Air Namibia customer review
A319 WDH-JNB. Friendly cabin crew flying time just 1hr 35min yet a 4 course meal served with drinks and 3 choices of main course was served - however food of dubious quality with bland taste. Captain kept passengers informed about storms en route - all in all not a bad experience.

### Air Namibia customer review
I have flown this airline three times in the last three months. The flight was delayed every time. In total I have been in the air with this airline for six hours and delayed for 7 hours. Those who fly regularly from Windhoek know that this airline is unreliable. I do not recommend this airline to anyone who has connecting flights scheduled commitments or who do not have the mental stamina to endure wasted time or being treated with disregard. The ratings are deceiving because even though the general services are fair I would forego food and drink to been time.

### Air Namibia customer review
I flew from Victoria Falls to Windhoek and from Windhoek to Gaborone. Both flights were on ERJ135 planes. Actually it turned out to be the same plane and piloted by the same woman pilot. Both flights were on time and were only half-full. The single cabin crew served a small meal during the short 1.5 hour flights. All very relaxed and very adequate.

### Air Namibia customer review
Windhoek-Cape Town. Brand new 319. Excellent seats. Very friendly staff at check-in. Confusion at boarding when the sign at the gate showed wrong departure but all in all a great experience.

### Air Namibia customer review
Windhoek to Cape Town (just under 2 hours) and were quite surprised. Check-in was quick and efficient although the lounge at Windhoek is so-so (staff friendliness could be much better). Warmly welcomed onboard by the purser and were surprised to see business class seats with such a large pitch! Flight departed on time breakfast served was excellent and service throughout always with a smile.

### Air Namibia customer review
CPT-WHK and WHK-CPT. Brand new A319 with plenty of legroom. Comfortable seats and friendly FA's. Seats were comfortable and the cabin layout good.

### Air Namibia customer review
JNB-LUN. Flight left on time old plane but comfortable food was insipid flight attendants friendly but too much chatter amongst themselves. All in all an average flight. My problems started when I wanted to reschedule my return flight. Air Namibia office at Joburg airport could not help eventually had to purchase a return ticket on SAA to get back to Joburg in July and 5 months later I am still struggling to rebook my return to Joburg on the valid return leg I still hold with Air Namibia.

### Air Namibia customer review
I travel between CPT and WHK and haven't been on a single flight that's departed on time. The interior is old fashioned but quite comfortable and the FA's pleasant but without much effort at service. I will continue to fly Air Namibia between Cape Town and Windhoek.

### Air Namibia customer review
I fly with Air Namibia quite a lot and must say that usually I'm very happy with all. That's the reason I decided to comment here is yes sometimes there are delays but show me any airline that doesn't have that problem. Flew from Johannesburg-Windhoek. Flight wasn't that full and boarding went quickly and the flight left on time. Plane was an older B737-200 but looked in top condition and also the interior of the plane was really good. The on flight service was very good and I need to mention that the food served on Air Namibia is usually quite good compared to other mayor airlines. The plane doesn't have onboard entertainment but with a good monthly on flight magazine the 2 hrs flight is over in a breeze.

### Air Namibia customer review
Windhoek-Frankfurt-Windhoek. Service ok but FA's disappeared after dinner service. Even pressing the call button did nothing. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was embarrassing. A dry bun with a piece of ham and lettuce or tuna mayo and yoghurt. All around you saw people eating a few bites and leaving the rest. Seat was okay but IFE was a joke. For a 10 hour flight I would think you would have more of a choice than 1 movie played on 3 small screens in economy class. I sat in row 22 which was 4 rows from the screen and even by squinting I still could not see it clearly. Must be a nightmare for families travelling with smaller kids. I could have paid the same for a Lufthansa flight from J'burg with an additional R3000 for a return flight between Windhoek and J'Burg. Will do that next time.

### Air Namibia customer review
Checking in at 06:00 in Cape Town along with my husband and 20 month old baby for our flight back to Whk at 0800 we were casually informed that our plane was "inserviceble" and would hopefully be ready for departure at 10:00. Needless to say that did not happen and we departed at 1800 that evening without much of an explanation or apology. My husband dared his next venture with Air Namibia on 21 March and was casually informed 5hours before his flight that it was cancelled but had been re-booked on a SAL flight to be booked in within 2 hours (which turned out not to be true after confirming the booking with SAL ourselves). We live 500km away from Whk and cannot be on standby to be ready for their flight changes as it suits them! We have always been regular travelers with Air Namibia but unfortunately it seems not to be safe anymore to rely on their "unserviceable" planes or their inconsiderate service.

### Air Namibia customer review
FRA-WDH-FRA business class. Found service ok but nothing special especially because these are night flights and FAs tend to disappear after meal service - nonchalant and indifferent service. Meal was acceptable portions relatively small but no effort to serve anything interesting or local flavors. Seat is old-style cradle seat but good room between rows and sufficient recline if you sleep sideways. Plane dates from the mid-90's but in OK shape. Be prepared to walk to/from terminal upon arrival and departure from Windhoek. Boarding in WDH is chaotic. Overall fares too high for the product/service they provide and would opt for BA instead via JNB.

### Air Namibia customer review
JNB-Windhoek - although plane not full it did seem cramped. Short flight but the crew worked to get round to everyone some of the crew friendly others less so. Main concern was on taking off several items within the cabin fell off - cover for an emergency exit 2 overhead storage cabins opened and the crew seemed to think this was normal and just refixed the items and carried on. Food was good though and seemed very cheap compared to SAA.

### Air Namibia customer review
FRA-WDH-JHB return. The main reason for choosing Air Namibia was their low price and (for us) convenient flight dates. Online check in worked pretty good and we could choose our seat for the intercontinental flights. Planes were in good condition seats a bit old and not too comfortable. Entertainment was pretty bad just a few screens for all passengers with horrible quality and uninteresting videos. Cabin crew was okay some of them more friendly and helpful than others. Same with the food nothing special but nothing wrong with it either. Overall my experience was quite good. You get what you pay for they don't excel at anything but nothing is very bad either.

### Air Namibia customer review
FRA-WDH. Service is not great they are just doing their job that's it. The seats are of the old angle lie type still in good condition but nowhere near to the newest generation. The video system is a shame as not on demand and very limited choice. They started the movie before the meal was served my screen was out of order. I mentioned it but they could not or did not try anything to fix it.We chose Air Namibia only because of the direct flight. If you do not mind having connections fly with South African.

### Air Namibia customer review
Air Namibia canceled our fight from Johannesburg to Accra on 1/24/2010 but the agents at Johannesburg didn't show sympathy or apology towards passages who were turned away. With a toddler our family had stayed at the airport most of the day to catch the flight home however the agents didn't issue any overnight stay voucher or arrange a transportation for everyone until 10 pm. The next day when we were switched to another carrier our child whom we had purchased a full-fare Air Namibia ticket didn't get a ticket for the switch. I had to march into Air Namibia office and request it. It was way too much for us who will avoid Air Namibia as much as possible.

### Air Namibia customer review
CPT-WVB-WDH-FRA Business class. Check-In at CPT was a total chaos. Air Namibia ground handling agents didn't bother to put airline logo destination etc on the screens above the counters - we had to ask if they had a dedicated Business Class check-in-counter and which one it was. Queuing up there didn't save us plenty of time though since they worked almost in slow- motion. Aircraft on Cape Town-Windhoek flight was a B737-200 built in the early 70s but in relatively good condition. Huge old-fashioned business class seats. Service very friendly and attentive - for Air Namibia standards even excellent. Our flight to Windhoek wasn't nonstop but landed in the beautiful desert airport of Walvisbay where they let some passengers get off and others get on the plane for the last remaining 30 minutes of the flight to Windhoek. This stopover lasted no longer than 25 mins. We had left Cape town with half an hour delay but managed to arrive in Windhoek only 15 minutes behind schedule. Lounge in Windhoek is small packed with passengers waiting for the Frankfurt flight. WDH-FRA their last remaining intercontinental route is flown with A340-300 (bought from Lufthansa). Business class is comparable to LH or BA of 15 years ago. Old style cradle seats no lie-flats. IFE in armrest as personal TV but only a small selection of movies. Food edible (dinner had 3 main course options breakfast either hot omelette or cold cuts) wines were delicious. Toilets clean small amenity kit was provided. I had 3-4 hours sleep. Their business class can't compare with major airlines but Air Namibia does the job. Their prices are reasonable.

### Air Namibia customer review
Frankfurt-Windhoek-Cape Town return. The flights were on time and check-in boarding etc. was professional. The price was reasonable compared to other airlines at time of booking. First impression well maintained A340-300 exterior wise with a slightly run down cabin interior. Old and uncomfortable seats good leg room. A340 only had "old fashioned" television sets above the middle section of the cabin. One projector screen at the front of the cabin section and 2 television sets for the rest of the cabin. One criticism of the IFE is that the main feature starts well in to the flight when most people would like to sleep. The meals were average to poor there were no heated rolls and main course did not taste of anything. Cold breakfast only. Their bar service closed after the duty free service "due to customs regulations" something which sounds like a cover for cost cutting. They could have at least offered drinks for sale. This was though not the worst issue with Air Namibia. I would say their flight attendants have a long way to go if they would like to compare themselves to professional airlines. The flight attendants FRA-WDH were grumpy to the point where I would say downright rude. They did not attend to passenger needs in any ways and seemed to want to get over and done with the job. I was personally accused of credit card fraud when I purchased duty free products on-board as my signature apparently did not correspond. (I understand the problem of fraud on many African flights but she had my passport and a credit card with a picture of me in her hand. What else do Air Namibia need?) The way she expressed this was also very accusing. The crew never smiled once and we just felt we were in the way for them. The other three flights were slightly better but I wouldn´t go as far as to say they have attended a smiling or service course. I would say fly Air Namibia only if you´re actually going to Windhoek and want to fly direct or their offer is really good compared to the alternatives. I will gladly pay more for another airline next time.

### Air Namibia customer review
I had booked a return trip from LGW to WHK - about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from Gatwick I stumbled across information (by chance!) on the internet that Air Namibia had axed all its flights from Gatwick. They never informed me of it at all (later I found out it was because I had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent. People who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently). So I phoned their representatives (who were still active in London). The agent who took my call was very helpful though - she rescheduled my flight without issues with BA via Frankfurt. She had also assured me that I could check my bags straight through from Heathrow to Windhoek. Of course this ended up not being the case. The lady at the BA counter at Heathrow knew of no such cooperation with Air Namibia. She said I had to re-check the bags in at Frankfurt. I didn't mind though. Otherwise my flights were on time and I got to Windhoek without any other hassle. The return journey was flawless - bags checked through all the way to Heathrow from Windhoek via Frankfurt. I would fly them again.

### Air Namibia customer review
The flight from Cape Town South Africa to Windhoek Namibia in itself was pleasant. What was shocking was the bad service delivered at Cape Town airport when attempting to buy a ticket. I arrived at the airport to find that the Air Namibia office was closed within were the staff busy sorting things out. There was no sign indicating their hours so after having looked through the window I sat down on a bench outside the office. I must have sat there for about 15 minutes before some rude employee (I think she was the manager) opened the window and looked at me. Seeing as though she opened the window and was looking at me I proceeded to stand in front of her. She asked me very rudely "What? Is there an emergency or something? It is our lunch break and you are bothering me. I was well prepared to sit and wait for who knows how long as there was no sign indicating that they were indeed on a lunch break. I wanted to tell her to stick her ticket but it was the best one at the time. I have never experienced such bad service in my life.

### Air Namibia customer review
WDH-FRA with my wife. Big mess to reconfirm the flights in WDH (computer breakdown) incompetent employees not willing to help. Checkin OK and quick very lousy lounge at WDH no priority boarding chaotic "rush" to the aircraft. Aircraft standing there the whole day and no traffic but able to depart 30 mins late. Worst cabin service ever experienced no meal choice available slow and incompetent staff. My wife went to the galley to ask gently for something to drink together with the meal the chief FA came to our seats and scold us "you have to be patient we have other things to do". Were treated like disobedient pupils no need to say after meal there was no more service and entertainment system at my seat was defective. Rude wake-up in the middle of the night 2.5 hours before landing for what they call a breakfast. Incredible and a great pity for the wonderful and friendly country of Namibia next time we fly again SAA despite of having to fly via JNB. We traveled last time in 2006 with Air Namibia and things have turned from good average to lousy.

### Air Namibia customer review
The nightmare of travelling with Air Namibia for our once-in-a-lifetime trip to Africa really overshadowed our holiday. They changed our return flight details approximately 7 times and our much planned for 10 hour direct flight from Windhoek to London (because I'm 6 months pregnant) turned into a 36 hour ordeal with no customer service to speak of certainly no apologies no alternatives offered not a care in the world from any representative we spoke to. And we certainly weren't the only ones affected. Not only had they dropped all their direct flights from London (which we had been informed of 3 weeks prior to departure) Air Namibia had also conveniently 'forgotten' their annual servicing so an entire week's worth of flights were 'rescheduled' (a kind description) which we first found out half an hour before leaving our house for the airport. Which meant our 10 days in beautiful Namibia were marred by trying to communicate with Air Namibia regarding our return flights. The whole thing was a disaster and when we finally got our BA flight home from Frankfurt the check in staff commented that this was all too usual with Air Namibia who were a well known nightmare to deal with and with whom they had no wish whatsoever to be associated. I heard since that people in the know will travel to Namibia via South Africa so as to avoid Air Namibia and use another airline. That travel tip I endorse!

### Air Namibia customer review
Cape Town to Walvis Bay [Namibia] return in business class B737-500. This was flying as it used to be good service hot meal on a 2 hour flight and large comfortable seats. Admittedly the outbound trip was 2 hours delayed and communication was poor but this is Africa and they did their utmost to turn it around when it did arrive. No doubt my holiday spirit affected my reaction to this if you had commitments it would have been a problem. I would use them again and would do the LGW to Namibia route with them. Safe professional and customer focussed.

### Air Namibia customer review
LGW-WDH return Business Class. Small busy lounge at Gatwick (multi-airline) much smaller and even busier lounge Windhoek (multi-airline). Seating 2x2x2 with PTV monitors but with which two attendants seemed unfamiliar - so wasted time fiddling and missed the beginning of the set. Food so/so both flights with alcohol ceasing to be served immediately after main food service. Economy passengers repeatedly used Business Class lavatories and attendants were unconcerned that we were waiting in line something I pay an extra amount to avoid! E- mailed Air Namibia upon my return. It took three months to respond despite my repeated reminders. Received seven paragraphs about the horrors of blood alcohol content and unruly drunk passengers. Such a patronising attitude towards experienced worldwide travellers will achieve no awards. I think Air Namibia is just plain mean with every aspect of its service.

### Air Namibia customer review
LHR - WDH and back during Nov 2008. Much better than expected. The food was very good and cabin crew were friendly & attentive. Plenty of water offered. My only gripe was the seat was very uncomfortable - OK once I fixed up extra cushioning for my lower back.

### Air Namibia customer review
WDH-CPT in Economy. B737-500 of unknown provenance but inside OK. The crew were pleasant and efficient the captain informative and a hot meal which was edible and fine. Timekeeping spot on too so a high mark. I have not experienced their single long-haul A-340 and its service but short-haul  perfectly OK.

### Air Namibia customer review
Air Namibia Jo-burg to Windhoek return. Both were excellent flights on time and with service from very good cabin crew - including meals that we used to expect but now no longer receive from major airlines including BA and Iberia. No hesitation in thanking Air Namibia commending them for the flights or recommending them to others.

### Air Namibia customer review
LGW to Windhoek return. Flight on time outbound and return with efficient boarding at LGW although free for all at Windhoek; however crew curt to the point of being rude except for one female cabin attendant on return leg. Food barely edible especially going out. Seats have plenty of leg room but are uncomfortable as the lumber bars do not work. Some problems with the heating - cold going out and excessively hot on return. IFE very basic largely with third rate films. Business lounge in Windhoek too small as a number of largish flights to CPT and JNB all going at at same time as LGW flight. I appreciate that Air Namibia is a cheap option and a direct route from London but would think twice before using them again.

### Air Namibia customer review
Frankfurt to Windhoek return Economy. Check in no problem. Flights on time. Seats ok. Food reasonable. Outward leg was the first time I have ever been cold at the back of an Airbus. In flight service disappointing. Crew did the minimum they could get away with. On occasions were actually rude. Uncaring and ignored requests for assistance. Main screen entertainment only with non functioning headphones. I do not recommend air Namibia but they have little competition to push standards up. German 'um pah' music during boarding and disembarking amused the Germans as well as the Brits!

### Air Namibia customer review
Just got back from a fantastic trip to Namibia but Air Namibia provided a disappointing end to the trip. They cunningly changed the time of the flight bringing it forward by an hour and a half so instead of getting to the airport almost 3 hours before departure it turned out to be leaving in an hour! Clearly no-one else had been told either as the queue was out the door - and to cap it all they only had one check-in desk open - I couldn't believe it! We eventually checked in about 2 minutes before it was due to take off and eventually left almost an hour late. A real shambles and what annoys me is that they clearly have all my contact details and could have contacted me via email or mobile to inform of the changes - I guess that would be too much to ask. I have traveled around the world and never re-confirmed a flight but would strongly recommend that you do with Air Namibia - it seems that the airline can't match the service and customer experience that the rest of Namibia offers.

### Air Namibia customer review
WDH-CPT. The plane seemed to be an old Air France 737 as I noticed "Air France" on the seat belts and "Sortie" for exit. Although an old aircraft it was clean and the crew were professional. I also quite enjoyed the hot meal that was served. Much better than I expected!
