### "avoid this airline"
Flair Airlines cancelled my flight just a few hours before departure. At the airport, the check-in counter staff assured me that my out-of-pocket expenses would be reimbursed if I submitted them to the claims department using the email they provided. After I submitted the claim, I heard nothing for over two months. When I finally followed up, I received a generic response stating: "Under the Air Passenger Protection Regulation (rppa-appr.ca), passengers are entitled to compensation if the cause of the interruption is within the carrier’s control and not required for safety. The root cause of your delay was required for safety and is not eligible for compensation. If you didn't board the rebooked flight, we're unable to issue the reimbursement. This is completely unacceptable. I did board a flight the following day with another airline, one that Flair themselves referred me to, because their next available flight was six days later. Waiting almost a week wasn’t a realistic option. Despite explaining this and following up twice after their response, I received no further communication. This experience has been infuriating, unprofessional, and deeply dishonest. Flair Airlines failed to take accountability, misled me about reimbursement, and ignored my attempts to resolve the issue. This was my first and absolutely my last time flying with Flair Airlines. I would strongly urge others to avoid this airline at all costs.

### "seating costs are just a rip off"
Not Verified |  When booking in it split up my wife and I in seating and then proceeded to offer seats together for different prices. At the check in at the airport we were told it was because there were a lot of children. Once we were seated on the flight we could see that there isn’t a single seat on the plane that is any better than another so no reason to be charging different prices for seats. It also turned out that not only was there a vacant seat next to my wife but one next to me as well. In just the front of the plane alone there were 6 vacant seats. Flair seating costs are just a rip off and way to get more money off of you. They also charge you for carry on as well and make the personal item allowance a super small amount to try and force it into the carry on category. They don’t even offer free water.

### "don't give you water for free"
Not Verified |  My ticket said I could bring a personal item I made sure my item was within the size and weight limit required but they charged me for it a whopping $69. She didn't even measure my item. I contacted customer service and they said they would not refund me. Plus they don't even give you water for free - $4 for water. I recommend you do not fly Flair

### "upset with the service provided"
Not Verified |  Our gate was changed and they announced it over the PA system which could hardly be heard in a very busy and noisy airport in Orlando. When we realized that the gate had been changed, 15 minutes before departure, we went to the changed gate and while we were going there our names were paged. We got to the new gate 5 minutes before departure time and 2 minutes after our names were called. We were told the plane had left and we said they had just called our names. They told us they were allowed to leave 15 minutes before departure. They said the next plane was leaving 5 1/2 hours later. They told us we had to book it ourselves and they didn't offer any help with phone numbers or contacts. The new price was 5 times the old price. I was extremely upset with the service provided.

### "no way to treat customers"
The desk people in Vancouver were extremely rude. Even though our personal item (a bag) was revised and approved as a personal item at the desk before security, when we were about to board they made us try it again in the measuring device in a condescending tone saying we tricked them before and it won’t fit now. They made us pay for the upgrade to carry on. We said it was unfair but the staff started speaking in a very loud tone. We put our phones out to record an audio. They were obviously concerned that there was evidence of how rude they were. They took my phone and erased the audio and said we couldn’t board unless we apologized and thanked them for “getting up at 3am to assist the early flight”? If we had violated some official rule that prevented us from boarding I would have complied but that was just their ego wanting to humiliate us by apologizing and thanking them. After several minutes of back and forth arguing, we apologized and thanked them for doing their job. We kept saying “we are sorry, we just want to go home, please accept our apologies” It was very humiliating, no way to treat customers.

### "Flair Airlines is not worth it"
Flair Airlines might seem like the most economical option at first glance, especially for domestic flights within Canada or trips to the U.S. but don’t be fooled. Once you book, the hidden fees start piling up fast. You pay for absolutely everything. No water is offered on board without an extra charge. The seating is unbelievably cramped—rows and there is no reclining feature on the seats. It’s uncomfortable, borderline claustrophobic, and makes even a short flight feel endless. We’re not new to travel we fly frequently. In fact, just between the month of March and the first week of April, we booked eight airline tickets with Flair. So this isn’t based on one bad flight it’s a repeated pattern of poor service and frustration. Their pricing system is so poorly designed that even their own check-in staff can’t explain it properly. On our most recent trip, we were told there was a discrepancy in a name. They said calling customer service would allow us to fix it for free, but of course, we were checking in for a flight leaving shortly. With no real choice, we paid the $78 to fix it. Then, for the return flight, we called ahead—and still got charged again. Flair is unprofessional, disorganized, and unreliable. What you pay upfront to book your ticket is not what you’ll end up paying. When all the hidden costs and nonsense are added up, you could’ve flown with WestJet, Air Canada, or pretty much any other airline for the same or even less. Do yourself a favor—spend a little more upfront and avoid the headache. Flair Airlines is not worth it!

### Flair Airlines customer review
I flew light on my recent trip from Calgary to Cancun. All I needed was 5kg of my essential items in tiny 20L backpack. After the arrival at the Calgary airport, I went to finish my online booking at the counter as instructed. The person who finished my check-in looked at my backpack and asked me to slide it into the measuring cage. My backpack didn't fit in thanks to the width. I tried to rearrange the content, but after a few minutes a couple of people behind the counter shouting at me that I'll have to pay the higher fee in the departure hall, I resignated and paid $80. I then proceeded with the custom and all that to finally find my gate. As I'm sitting there, I'm noticing people with bags as big as or even bigger than mine, but they had a purple sticker on it saying it's a small personal item which is for free. I waited in the line to board my plane to talk to someone about it. When my turn came up I asked a person behind the counter how come a good half of people have a bigger backpacks than me and didn't have to pay extra fee. To which she answered: "what people? I told her, most of them already boarded, but there was definitely a family of 5 that was before me. This family already proceeded through the boarding/passport control, they were on their way to the plane. That woman went and brought the whole family back behind the counter, next to the measuring cage, next to me. She told a man to put his bag into the cage (the smallest bags of them all), that I complained about their luggage. The family obviously upset because they were already processed and didn't understand what was happening. The man was struggling to squeeze his backpack there, taking a few items out, handing them over to his people. I'm standing there embarrassed as hell because everyone passing by to the aircraft was watching this ridiculous scene. The front desk woman turned back to me asked if I was happy now, letting the family go. I was so shocked about this whole situation because I've never experienced a such awful customer service. I didn't come at her with an attitude, I was genuinely curious how come I have to pay a hefty $80 fee, whilst others don't. Just asking for fairness. This person was giving me an attitude from the start. Like how come I dared to have a question. I figured the reason why they charged me was the fact I paid for no luggage, so at least they could rip me off on my personal item. Not to mention that my 5+ hours flight had zero free refreshments, zero entertainment.

### "$82 last name & first name interchanged"
$82 last name & first name interchanged that was sad, of all the info provided in the ID is not good enough to prove your identity.

### "didn’t look like his passport photo"
Flair check in counter worker denied my partner boarding because he didn’t look like his passport photo (7 year old passport and without beard). He supplied 2 additional pieces of photo ID, licence and Ohip card and was still refused boarding. She consulted someone on the phone who told her to allow him on and she still said no. We were attending a motorcycle event in Daytona beach. She literally refused him with a smile on her face!! We could do nothing (but cry, in my case). We were forced to drive to Toronto and purchase new tickets to Orlando that night, which we had no problems using and clearing customs. This was a disgusting abuse of power on her part that ruined one whole day of our 4 day vacation and cost me over $1300 between 2 new flights and a hotel airport in Orlando as our storage locker was locked for the night on arrival. Absolutely disgusted with this airline. I will never travel with a private airline again. They need to seriously screen their employees.

### "80$ for a name change?"
80$ for a name change? I fly with you guys all the time. Ridiculous to get someone for $80 for an honest mistake. Especially in these uncertain times.. Will have to reconsider my loyalty to flair

### "No refund or compensation"
Not Verified |  Our flight home was canceled twice leaving us stranded for six extra days. We all had to take an extra week off work, which was a huge problem. They refused to compensate or refund. Refused to book or assign another airline. Charged me each new flight for baggage and seat assignment despite flights being cancelled. Cost us thousands of extra dollars. No refund or compensation. I spent hours at a time on hold trying to get them to rebook-book with a sooner flight or use another airline. Only received—someone will call you back. No one ever did.

### "worst experience of price gouging"
Not Verified |  I have flown flair airlines multiple times a year for over 5 years and this past trip was by far the worst experience of price gouging that I’ve experienced from any airlines. It’s a discount airline, which is why people accept the extremely inconvenient departure dates and times and the uncomfortable old seating, but flair has recently become very aggressive with the baggage fees. I’ve always travelled with a small backpack with three changes of clothes and never had an issue, usually they just ask to see my bag and as long as it’s close to the dimensions the staff have never had an issue. This past trip they didn’t email my boarding pass after the online check-in and when I went to the counter at the airport to get the pass they were making every single passenger wait in line and measure their baggage in a rack. People were literally taking clothes out of their bags and putting them on and strangers were helping each other strong-arm backpacks down by force because the bags weren’t perfectly flush with the measuring rack. Some of the staff were nice and patient while passengers tried to make their bags fit but others were outright and completely inflexible when bags were just slightly larger than the rack. Additionally, those who had a cross body bag were forced to use that as their personal items and then pay for a carry-on for any other baggage they had. And all of this wouldn’t be so outrageous if the fee for a carry-on wasn’t nearly the same price as my round trip. Next time I’ll pay the extra hundred dollars that they wanted for my backpack and buy a ticket for a flight that includes a backpack and isn’t scheduled for an 11:30pm departure.

### "unprofessional and harassment agents2
Extremely rude, unprofessional and harassment agents, abusing their power and threatening passengers, refusing to provide their name for a formal complaint and threatening to take a passenger off the flight for professionally asking to formally complain. The cabin is messy and dirty too. Rip off for the check in, baggage, seat selection and even a cup of coffee overrides any price savings on the fare.

### "They are the worst!"
First time I tried this airline. Booked the trip to Toronto from Fort Lauderdale and back. On the way to Toronto, two delays, first due to weather then mechanical issues. Original flight time was a little after 7 pm. We left after 11 pm, cannot recall the exact time. As a result, missed our rental car, since we arrived at about 3 am. Had to spend money on the uber to our airbnb and back the next day to get the car. On the way from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale, Feb 8, 2025, the snow storm was supposed to start after 5pm. The flight was supposed to be at 3:20 pm. Flair advises to go to the airport 3 hours before. At 12:20 pm on the dot, get the announcement of a 4 hour delay due to mechanical problems. Really? They had to wait 3 hours before, when you just arrive at the airport and leave your airbnb and drop off your car rental to tell you? And of course the flight would have been cancelled due to the weather after that, which it was. I booked another flight with United to Fort Lauderdale for 3pm and flew out without any issues. In the meantime, my original Flair flight has still not left after multiple cancellations and delays, as I am writing this on Feb 9, 2025 at 1pm. They are the worst! Not to mention, when I approached the desk for assistance, they did not even know that the flight was delayed. When I told them that the flight will be cancelled due to the weather, she casually said, "I dont see any snow now".

### "recommended I rent a car"
Not Verified | Flair recommended I rent a car through their online booking system. The partner company is called America Car Rental. This company demanded just under $5,000 Canadian currency once I got to the car rental location to get the car. It was dirty when I received it with only a quarter tank of gas. I returned the car after having it professionally cleaned as well as left almost half a tank. They have since decided to keep my deposit. This is all out fraud and now I'm fighting with Visa to get it returned while paying 22% interest.

### "asked me to make payment again"
I was flying with my Husband from Vancouver to Winnipeg. I made payment for $82.95 for luggage bag on 28th October. Which has been processed on my credit card. But at the time of check in at airport they asked me to make payment again and said she is not able to see that payment for luggage I showed her payment i have made through my visa card and also the agent I spoke over phone on 29th told me I don’t need to pay for my luggage same luggage will be moved to my October 31.2024 flight as I am already paying cancellation fees for my flight for October 29 2024 and fare difference. Agent who was at counter was so rude and said she can’t do anything about it. I should call flair or I can leave my 23 kg luggage bag and fly without baggage. When I ask her why she is doing like this its so rude with passengers and just ripping money from them at airport at last moment of the flight she said just pay for luggage or I am going to cancel your boarding if I question her again. I did call help line number 2 of the agents hang up my call when I tell them the reason I am calling for finally after 20 mins 3rd agent who answer my call said he can’t do anything at this moment you will need to make payment for luggage right now but I will gave you support email and said I should add my payment screenshot in email [email protected] and send it to support team they will get back to me within 24 hours and will refund me for the payment which I am going to make it at airport. I ended up paying another $93.45. I have sent email to support fly flair from October 31 2024 and its January 22 2025, its been months and I am still waiting for their response within 24 hours. Worse experience with flair they are just becoming greedy nowadays and ripping people money at last minute at airport where they don’t have any other choices left.

### "disastrous travel experience"
Not Verified |  Our family of four recently endured a disastrous travel experience with Flair Airlines on flights from Toronto to Orlando and back. The initial flight from Toronto was delayed by two hours, but this was overshadowed by the truly abysmal service from ground staff. Despite online check-in, we faced multiple queues and cumbersome luggage handling procedures which took almost one and half hour to complete. Flight attendants were unhelpful and displayed a lack of training and professionalism. Finding the Flair terminal at Orlando Airport was a challenge. Flair wasn’t in the airline list of MCO. The return flight was delayed multiple times over six hours, with no water or snacks provided. The flight was oversold, requiring passengers to be involuntarily bumped. After 6 hours of delay the alternative flight has arrived, but there were 14 oversold seats that need to be off-board to operate the flight. After around 45 minutes of figuring out those off-boarding passengers, onboarding started and we got to the plane. Waiting for an hour that onboarding was completed, and then they have announced that the flight is cancelled and off-board all the passengers. Flair ground staff were absent at the airport. Flair has no official representative at MCO. Passengers were left stranded with no information, assistance, or apologies. The situation escalated with confused and frustrated passengers encountering unhelpful and even the passengers got threatening by ground staff. We were forced to book a hotel, transportation and food at our own expense. The following day's flight was also delayed again. Unresolved Claims: We have submitted claims for our expenses and compensation for cancelled flights, but have received no response as today Jan 19th. This experience with Flair Airlines was utterly unacceptable. It severely impacted our family vacation and highlighted a complete disregard for passenger rights and well-being.

### "the bag’s almost in"
I have been using the same carry on bag for almost 2 years on multiple airline. Now suddenly the bag has become too big. They charged me $100 because the tires could not fit in. I have attached pictures where the bag’s almost in, but the airline has become too greedy and ruined my day.

### "I still haven’t seen a penny"
I flew from Calgary to Toronto in July, and after I landed, my bag was nowhere to be found. Flair had no idea where it was. Luckily, I had the foresight to put an Apple AirTag in my bag. I tracked it myself, discovered it was still in Calgary, and watched it make its slow journey to Toronto. When I contacted Flair’s team at Toronto airport, they were utterly clueless. They couldn’t tell me where it was, and I had to track it down by myself, using the app to locate a locked room in the airport. The real kicker? I asked a Flair agent to open the door to retrieve my bag, and she was shocked I had managed to find it. It was clear that they had no idea what was going on. They promised me a baggage fee refund for the trouble, but here we are six months later, and I still haven’t seen a penny. Every time I follow up, I get the same response: “It will be another 30-60 days.” They think because I'm from Australia, I'll just forget about it. Well, I haven’t, and I’m now pursuing legal action. To make matters worse, Flair Airlines doesn't just fail to deliver on promises—they charge you at every opportunity. I paid an extra fee for my hand luggage at check-in because the staff claimed it was too big. But when I boarded the plane, a completely different staff member told me that my bag actually fit within the free luggage allowance. I was never refunded that money, and I'm still waiting for any form of reimbursement. This level of incompetence and dishonesty is inexcusable.

### "entire airline is a mess"
We had nothing but issues from the day we had to leave. Their system was glitching my daughters name was incorrect and no-one could fix this apparently, 0 resolution. When speaking to a manager he also could do nothing and some how out of this he split my reservation from my families. We went to the airport hours early to try and have this issue corrected and again NO resolution, the attendants weren't even there. Go to check in prior to our boarding and the front counter girl tells us we have 3 different bookings for my daughter now and to email as we have been double charged flights. Days later we are waiting for a reply on a refund for the double charges and now having issues checking in online for our flights home. This entire airline is a mess we are frequent flyers and will never book flair again.

### "Do not trust this airline"
Not Verified | Do not trust this airline. They changed my flight 24 hours later and offered me a refund via my payment method. Then took it upon themselves after I said not to do this, to switch it to travel credits stating issues with my card. Bank confirmed instantly no issues. This company is literally getting away with fraud. They take your money, cancel your flights with no no options provided, then lie and tell you they are refunding the money but turn it to travel credits you can never use. DO NOT BOOK.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had"
The ground staff at YVR were extremely rude and unprofessional. Although I had completed online check-in, I was asked to have my documents verified by the airport staff. It’s perfectly normal to verify travel documents before boarding, but the way their staff handled it was unacceptable. For some reason, the staff member was unable to verify my children’s passports and green cards directly. Instead, he took photos of the documents — apparently using his personal phone and sent them via email, all without asking for my consent. My carry-on luggage met all size and weight requirements, but the staff’s approach to inspecting it was unnecessarily rude. I can confidently say this was the worst experience I’ve ever had.

### "never seen anything like this"
Flight was scheduled to depart at 715am. It was delayed until 815am, then 845, then 1145, then 130pm, then 4pm, and finally 7pm. There was utter chaos at Gate 7 continuously. People shouting about missed connecting flights. I chose to not spend my time at the gate and was checking out the stores for gifts for my grandchildren. I also went outside numerous times for fresh air. (I went through security 5 times). When I returned one time with lunch for my husband he told me that I had missed a big commotion. When it finally came time to board I saw 3 Police Officers come into Gate 7 area. They went to an elderly lady (like myself) travelling with her young granddaughter and took her aside. She came back with a look of shock on her face and then I noticed the Police came towards me next. They also pulled me aside and said I would not be allowed to board the plane as I had been in an altercation with Police earlier? I asked if that were true why I wasn't removed earlier? I asked for the proof of whatever they say I was involved with on video as I know there are cameras. No proof, No reason given ... I was allowed to object to nothing. They hurriedly boarded the plane and people all around me were shocked. One passenger told me to look up "Refusal to allow boarding" on government website as no one could believe this was happening. They left so quickly that they did not even announce last call for boarding and one man we met up with was left behind. They took his luggage with them to Toronto, did not even look for him at the gate nor call his name and left without him. We had to book another flight home, they gave me an eggroll fortune sized paper with customer service numbers on it . When I called them they had no notes at all on what had happened and were so very rude and not helpful it was obvious that I had absolutely no rights whatsoever as far as they were concerned. We received no credit for luggage fees nor seat selections nor flight. This was the first time we had travelled on Flair (usually fly Air Canada) and it will certainly be the last. I have never seen anything like this.

### "has zero customer service"
Checked in online the night before. The online checkin did not provide a boarding pass. It had to be issued upon arrival at the airport desk. No surprise but our flight was delayed from 7:40pm to 8:25pm. I have nexus so I arrived at the airport at 7:15pm. We waited in a long line while the Flair staff measured peoples bags to see if they were the proper size or if they need to pay more money. I waited patiently until it was my turn. When I got to the front of the line, they mentioned that they could no longer print a boarding pass because I was passed the 1hr mark before the flight. They said there is nothing they can do and told me to call customer service in the morning. I missed my flight as a result and had to book an expensive last minute flight with another airline.. Flair has zero customer service. Flair takes zero accountability. Never flying with Flair again. It's simply not worth the slightly 'cheaper' ticket.

### "ridiculous carry-on size checker"
This was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. They have this ridiculous carry-on size checker, and even though I had the smallest backpack and carry-on, the staff forced me to put them through it. The process not only damaged my backpack and carry-on but also caused unnecessary stress. To make it worse, the staff was extremely rude and dismissive. I will never fly with them again. Save yourself the trouble and avoid Flair at all costs!

### "Avoid them at all costs"
Worst airline, to be avoided at all costs. I've traveled with a lot of airlines in my life, but this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. On my flight from Toronto to Guadalajara, after boarding the plane, a text message warned us that our flight had been delayed by 1.5 hours. The pilot then takes the microphone to explain that his co-pilot has suddenly fallen ill and they have to find another. During these 1h30 of waiting, you are not allowed to leave the plane, no bottle of water is offered, nor any compensation. Flair airline is a company that doesn't give a damn about you. Avoid them at all costs.

### “Horrible experience”
Horrible experience. Booked with Apple Pay and was denied boarding pass after confirming reservation the night before because Flair was unable to verify card used because purchase was completed through Apple Pay. Was told by customer service that no refund would be issued because it’s not their policy. They also would not rebook me on the same flight because I had already checked in.

### "show up 3 hours prior to flying"
I would avoid this airline. They wont issue you a boarding pass unless you buy a luggage package, that means you have to show up 3 hours prior to flying, what a waste of time. Go Air Canada or others.

### "I will never fly Flair again"
Not Verified |  I was warned not to fly Flair Airlines. I did not listen and now I am out a lot of money. First, I booked through a trusted and reputable 3rd party as we bundled flight and hotel. During the booking process, you had to choose/not to baggage there and back. We did baggage for one of us. Upon arriving at the airport, they proceeded to tell us that we booked for both people on the way back. I said there had to be a system error because I was the one who booked, went over their baggage rules very carefully, and chose the package that worked for use. Well an additional $165 later, as they would not budge, they gave me the customer service number to call, which was an hour of my time. In talking to the agent, she could see that we purchased luggage for each leg of our flights, but something was changed on their end. She ended up putting us on hold and came back and changed her story. We purchased only on the way back! I sent my receipt to her and it was different from the original booking. This went on for an hour and she then put my info to the refund department as she could not issue one. I received the email from Cristy in refunds in the afternoon as they were "busier than normal" and apologized that it was not within the hour time frame they said the email would come in. So I restated everything that happened. A week and a half later and no correspondence. I even continued to email to see if she could forward me to anyone else. That takes us to today. I had the 'pleasure' of talking to another agent. I am using this term lightly as she was very rude, disrespectful and condescending. I tried to communicate what had transpired and she cut me off constantly. Even saying I have been doing my job for 3 years (at this point I didn't truly get a word in edge was) Did I get short with her, yes due to being cut off and not listened to. As she would not let me speak, even asking her as I listened to her, I ended up telling her I would then call who I needed to as this was the worst customer service I had ever dealt with, which again I was cut off multiple times before I could even finish my sentence. I had to hang up as I did not want to be disrespectful or rude. Flair, you have to do better. Have better people manning your customer service. I will never fly Flair again! I will also ensure friends, family, and coworkers do the same.

### "I saved a lot of money"
Not Verified |  I booked a roundtrip ticket with Flair during the Christmas holiday and everything went smoothly (Montréal-Cancun). The reason why is very simple, when I made the booking on their website, I took the time to read what was on the screen. It is clearly stated what is included and what isn't, and the price for each add-on is in bold letters. Yes everything has a price (checked bag, carry-on, check-in at airport, seats) but overall, I saved a lot of money compared to other airlines. I paid 10$ to be able to change my flight if necessary, which I did, and it was a pretty easy process. The option was added to my new ticket, I didn't need it so I called them and they refunded me in the same week, it was easy to speak with someone and get the refund. The service was basic on the plane, but it's a ULCC so it was expected. I had a great experience overall and I booked with them again for Christmas 2024-25. The most important thing to note is to take time to read everything when booking. Everything is there in bold letters with explanations. They have packages included bags, seats, etc. They also have an option to take everything À LA CARTE.

### "website is terrible"
Not Verified | By far the worst airline I have ever experienced. These guys actually make Air Canada look good, which I thought was impossible. Their website is terrible - plenty of noticeable bugs/errors that make you wonder if they are even a legitimate business. When I checked in, I received an error and was not assigned a seat or boarding pass, which meant that my wife could not book a seat next to me. When we arrived at the airport, they basically said that the website error was irrelevant and tried to charge BOTH of us a fee to sit together. They didn't offer any explanations or apologies for the website problems, nor did they offer to waive any other fees as compensation. The staff customer service, if you can call it that, is awful. You can tell that they genuinely don't give a hoot about you or the issues you're having. They'll calmly refer you to their customer support line with a smug grin on their face that makes you want to physically hurt them. If you're booking with Flair because you think you're getting a good deal/price, think again. EVERYTHING is upcharged. They charge more for carry-on bags than other airlines charge for checked luggage. And the price for checking a bag is VARIABLE, which they claim is based on "availability". That means if the person in front of you in line checks a bag, the price to check your own bag will now be higher because there's now "less space" on the plane. They are literally looking for every possible way to charge you more. During the flight, they reminded us several times that trading seats with someone else is not allowed unless you pay for it. Even basic necessities like drinking water aren't free. That's right, you have to pay to drink their water. I wish I could give a rating of less than 1/10. I will never use this airline again, and I will happily pay more to fly with an airline that doesn't make me feel so terrible that I have to go online to leave a review like this. Never again.

### "Bravo on the greed!"
One hell of a way to milk every last penny out of your customers! I already paid for the tickets—not cheap, by the way—and then you dare to charge me $300 just to bring a couple of bags? Are you serious? Why stop there? Why not charge $3,000 per person if you're so hell-bent on squeezing every dime out of us? Here’s a thought: people who book economy do so because that’s what they can afford. What on earth makes you think we can shell out extra for seats, bags, and food? Oh wait, let me guess. You probably want us to pay for oxygen on the plane next! This is ridiculous. If this is how you treat paying customers, don't be surprised when people start flying elsewhere—or just stay home. Bravo on the greed!

### "stole a day of my life"
Not Verified | Let me tell you how Flair Airlines stole a day of my life and decided it wasn't even necessary to apologize for it. I booked a flight for October 9, Fort Lauderdale to Montreal, departure scheduled for 11:30 a.m. After spending too much time listening to the Flair staff at the counters about "inch-by-inch" baggage standards, I made my way to the gate. To my surprise, we boarded early. The plane is preparing to take off. In full swing, back pressed against our seats, the pilot applies emergency braking for "light on the dashboard" (that's what he tells us). We were all shaken. The captain then speaks to explain to us that there is a problem with the plane and that they will try to resolve the problem but that we must return to the boarding gate. We stayed on the plane for several hours (in Florida, without air conditioning, you can imagine the temperature inside the plane). Finally, the pilot, after more than an hour, told us that the problem was more serious than expected and that he was going to have to ask us to get out of the plane. Having disembarked from the plane, several passengers took turns asking the Flair employee present (more often on his phone than answering our questions) if he had more information. The crew leaves the plane with the pilot. They take our luggage out. When I present myself in front of the employee, she tells me "don't worry, we will solve the problem, we will take your luggage out to access the technical panel (or how to say anything when you take people for idiots) Finally, after 4 p.m., someone told us that the flight was canceled and that we would be able to collect our luggage. We asked if they were planning to put us on another flight. The employee said “probably, except that. tomorrow's flight is full so I don't know what what they plan to do". We wait for our luggage for 2 hours (hours during which a first part of the luggage comes out, then the conveyor stops for 2 hours). When we ask the employee where our luggage is, she ends up telling us that she doesn't know (???). Finally, someone tells us that we will receive an email with more information and then nothing until 7 p.m., where I receive a check-in confirmation for a flight the next day. NO COMPENSATION (oh sorry, a $7 voucher for Starbucks, the coffee cost $7 and 12 cents, just kidding), NO OTHER INFORMATION. In the meantime, I had taken a 7 p.m. flight with another company because I had no other information (or time to waste) and the other flights of the day had already taken off. Arrival the next day, I send an email to claim the expected compensation of $1000 for a delay of more than 9 hours, as indicated on their site. I paid over $300 for the ticket with the other airline at the last minute. I receive a stupid email where I am told that compensation is not possible because it is "a decision adopted for the safety of passengers which is not the responsibility of Flair". They refunded me the first ticket I paid 100 dollars. Or how to be fooled by a lousy company that doesn't even honor its own rules. If others recognize themselves in this situation, do not hesitate to contact me on this platform, I will not let them do so. | Laissez-moi vous raconter comment Flair Airlines m'a volé une journée de ma vie et a décidé qu'il n'était même pas nécessaire de s'en excuser. J'ai réservé un vol pour le 9 octobre, Fort Lauderdale à Montréal, décollage prévu à 11h30. Après avoir passé trop de temps à écouter le personnel Flair aux guichets sur les normes " au centimètre près " des bagages, je me suis rendue à la porte d'embarquement. A ma surprise, on embarque en avance. L'avion se prépare à décoller. En plein élan, dos plaqué contre nos sièges, le pilote effectue un freinage d'urgence pour " voyant allumé sur le tableau de bord " (c'est ce qu'il nous annonce). Nous étions tous secoués. Le commandant prend ensuite la parole pour nous expliquer qu'il y a un problème avec l'appareil et qu'ils vont essayer de résoudre le problème mais que nous devons retourner à la porte d'embarquement. Nous sommes restés plusieurs heures dans l'avion (en Floride, sans climatisation, je vous laisse imaginer la température à l'intérieur de l'appareil). Finalement, le pilote, après plus d'une heure, nous annonce que le problème est plus grave que prévu et qu'il va devoir nous demander de sortir de l'avion. Débarqués de l'avion, plusieurs passagers vont demander à tour de rôle à l'employé Flair présent (plus souvent sur son téléphone qu'à répondre à nos questions) s'il détient plus d'informations. L'équipage quitte l'avion avec le pilote. Ils font sortir nos bagages. Quand je me présente devant l'employé, elle me dit " ne vous inquiétez pas, nous allons résoudre le problème, on sort vos bagages pour accéder au panneau technique (ou comment dire n'importe quoi quand on prend les gens pour des idiots). Finalement, après 16H, quelqu'un nous annonce que le vol est annulé et que nous allons pouvoir récupérer nos bagages. On demande s'ils planifient de nous mettre sur un autre vol. L'employé nous dit " probablement, sauf que le vol de demain est plein donc je ne sais pas ce qu'ils prévoient de faire ". Nous attendons nos bagages pendant 2H (heures pendant lesquelles une première partie des bagages sortent, puis le tapis s'arrête pendant 2h). Quand on demande à l'employé ou sont nos bagages, elle finit par nous dire qu'elle ne sait pas ( ? ??). Finalement, quelqu'un nous dit qu'on recevra un e-mail avec plus d'informations puis plus rien jusque 19H, ou je reçois une confirmation d'enregistrement pour un vol le lendemain. AUCUNE COMPENSATION (ah si pardon, un voucher de 7$ pour le starbucks, le café coutait 7$ et 12 centimes, la blague), AUCUNE AUTRE INFORMATION. J'avais pris entre temps un vol pour 19H avec une autre compagnie car je n'avais aucune autre information (ni de temps à perdre) et les autres vols de la journée avaient déjà décollés. Arrivée le lendemain, j'envoie un mail pour de réclamation pour la compensation prévue de 1000$ pour un retard de plus de 9H, comme indiqué sur leur site. J'ai payé plus de 300 dollars pour le billet avec l'autre compagnie aérienne en dernière minute. Je reçois un mail idiot ou on me dit que la compensation n'est pas possible car il s'agit " d'une décision adoptée pour la sécurité des passagers qui n'est pas de la responsabilité de Flair ". Ils me remboursent le premier billet que j'ai payé 100 dollars. Ou comment se faire rouler dans la farine par une minable compagnie qui n'honore même pas son propre règlement. Si d'autres se reconnaissent dans cette situation, n'hésitez pas à me contacter sur cette plateforme, je ne les laisserais pas faire.

### "an absolute nightmare"
It's an absolute nightmare from the time you purchase your ticket till you get to your destination, the major problem is with all the extra fees they're gonna charge you here and there it's not even cheaper than other airlines! I had to spend $80 just for a regular check-in bag and you also have to pay around $50 for your carry separately the price of luggage is not fixed and it increases with time the closer you get to the flight the more expensive you get! I am a musician and I always take my musical instrument with me with no extra cost and issue to other flights, but this time I couldn't take it cause with flair you don't have this option at all. The only way is to pay another $80 and check it in. I found it out after two hours of discussion with customer service trying to tell them my instrument is so expensive and delicate and I don't want to check it in. I want to have it as a carry-on and I mind paying for it as long as it is with me, but they didn't accept it. A People deserve better treatment when they pay this much money

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service at Calgary airport for flair Airline. Staff is so rude including supervisors, no one knows how to do their job. I had flight from Calgary to Abbotsford at 7:00 AM on 4th November 2024. I arrived at airport around 5:00 AM and waited in line for almost 1:30hr to get my boarding pass with my personal bag. It was huge line at check in counter. I was keep telling check in agent that i had flight at 7:00 AM please issue me boarding pass, she kept saying you will receive boarding pass shortly. I received my boarding pass at 6:32 Am and run towards my gate after security. I arrived at my gate at 6:50 and they said they won’t let me board because gate was closed at 6:45 AM. There was 10-12 passengers left at gate without boarding and no one from Calgary airport flair staff answer us properly and the supervisor was so rude, she don’t even listen to us and i felt harassed by her. It was not my fault that Calgary airport flair staff have bad management and don’t know how to do their job and misbehaving with us if we asked them any questions and don’t even reply us. Worst experience ever.

### "told the gate was closed"
Not Verified |  I will never take this airline again. I got to the airport at 5:10am to board a flight for 6am. I did not have any bags or carry on. I tried to get get my boarding pass but I was told the gate was closed and I can’t get a pass. I have to forfeit the flight and had to book with WestJet. I was not happy with because there’s been many occasions where Flair cancel or reschedule flight and I had to miss my work and even today, I don’t even think I can make it to work because of this poor service. I contacted the customer service but they all could I anything. I will never and never recommend this airline to anybody

### "really disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Just had a really disappointing experience with Flair Airlines. The staff was rude and unhelpful, and they seemed more focused on pushing extra fees than providing decent service. And for a so-called “low-cost” airline, prices were way higher than expected with all the hidden charges. Also, the website was a nightmare to navigate—confusing layout, lack of clear info, and generally not user-friendly. Definitely expected better.

### “staff dismissive and unapproachable”
Not Verified | Flying with this airline is nothing but stress and a blatant disregard for customers. To start, on international flights, they allow only a tiny, thin backpack that barely fits a few essentials, like underwear. Bringing a regular-sized backpack costs extra, which is incredibly unethical—on an international flight, it should be the bare minimum to let passengers carry their basic necessities. Another outrageous point: they don’t allow a laptop to be carried separately, which violates common travel standards and causes significant inconvenience. On top of that, they refused to provide a cup of water during a long 5-6 hour flight to Mexico! This is completely unacceptable. Passengers are forced to buy bottled water just to stay hydrated. The in-flight service also leaves much to be desired; you’re treated as if you’re a second-class citizen, with the staff being dismissive and unapproachable. Flair Airlines must be taught to respect their passengers!

### “terrible service, terrible support line”
Not Verified | My girlfriend and I had tickets from Vancouver to LA on October 20, 2024 for 7am. Due to a delay at customs, we missed the flight and had to take a 10am ticket and fly on a different airline. And everything would have been fine, but arrived in Los Angeles for 3 hours later than we had to, we started looking for our suitcases, which before that we handed over to the employees of Fair Airlines. To our surprise no employee of this company was at the airport, all we could do was to call the hotline, to which we were told that we can not help, leave a request online and wait And even the fact that in these bags all our belongings, no one cared, we literally had nothing to even change into. Not the next day we arrived in the morning at the airport to talk to airport staff, but heard only the same story that leave a request online. So no phone calls or face to face conversations helped nothing, we just needed our suitcases. We left a request and 2 days later we got a notification that they found our suitcases. After that a week passed, maybe a little more, but we never saw our suitcases. We called, wrote letters, but no one gave us any information, all just answered that they have no business and that's all. As a result, thanks to this company 2 people in a completely foreign city, without acquaintances and relatives were left without the only things they had, we were planning to move to Los Angeles, and in these suitcases were all our things. Don't use this airline if you don't want to get terrible service, terrible support line, and a spiteful attitude towards your belongings and yourself.

### “they were the WORST”
Not Verified | I ended up not being able to take the flight after I got to the airport and realized that my greencard had somehow gotten lost out of my passport. The attendant at the airport offered to place a note in my account to allow me to rebook....surprise surprise, she never did. I called customer service that same night and they were the WORST! Now they are asking me to check in to my return flight, now if I wasn't on the flight to Toronto, how would I be on the flight back?! Spoke to a "so called" supervisor who said I can't help you because the attendant didn't place a note. You have to contact us via email..I did. Another surprise, it's been two weeks and they are yet to answer. Now they're telling me it's within 48hrs of my return flight so cancelation would mean they get to keep my money. Remember I called two weeks ago when I didn't get on the first flight?

### “Staff are very rude and impolite”
Not Verified | The worst airline you could’ve ever have a flight with. Staff are very rude and impolite, they literally don’t care about you or your money and treat you like they’re doing you a favour or you got into the flight for free. Additionally you need to pay for vey basic services such as printing boarding pass or getting a glass of water which is Ridiculous!! The seats uncomfortable and annoying. Lesson learned and I will never in my life fly again with this cheap airline!

### "Not a single thing is complimentary"
Not Verified | I will never be flying with this airline again. My sister and I travelled for the first time with flair this past weekend. We had a carry on each & checked 3 bags, the total was over 400$ one way. Not a single thing is complimentary, not even water on the aircraft. They don't care if their passengers are comfortable or not. There was two elders that sat in front of us that wanted water but refused to pay the $3.89 for a bottle of water, as did we. They claim to have wifi but there was none once we got on the plane. The flight attendants were pleasant during the flight but minutes after we got off the plane I approached one of them to ask a simple question she became completely rude & dismissive stating to me that she was "off the clock". On top of it all they lost our checked bags. Please save your money & don't ever trust this airline. I was beyond disappointed & will never be supporting them again.

### “the worst airline we've ever dealt with”
Not Verified | Here’s a reformulated version: This morning, my 17-year-old traveled with this airline. He's a student in Toronto and was entitled to bring a carry-on item. He had a standard Samsonite carry-on, which has accompanied me all over the world (I’m a former airline captain). However, at the check-in counter, they determined that this bag, which has always qualified as carry-on, was too large for their overly small measuring gauge. They forced him to pay $90 CAD to avoid being denied boarding. This is hands down the worst airline we've ever dealt with. It's not our first bad experience with them, but it will certainly be our last.

### "will never fly Flair again"
We missed our flight because of long lines at check in and security even though we were there 2+ hours in advance but our luggage went to Toronto without us, none of the employees were willing to help us with new tickets for the next flight so we lost our Flair flight and connecting flight. We called customer service and its people in India that answer the phone , Flair employees are trained to place the blame on the customer and so they wash their hands of everything. They have lost our luggage and claim that they will contact us in 24 hours with news but the news never comes. Don't fly with Flair, check out the reviews and that says it all. We will never fly Flair again since we are out $3000.

### "claims for compensation were declined"
My experience last weekend traveling from YUL to YYC was riddled with issues that I can barely summarize. First, we were denied boarding passes until we paid an additional $23. We still have no idea what this charge was for—neither the gate staff nor customer service could provide clarity. The situation felt almost absurd: "Pay or no boarding pass! After a delayed departure, we encountered a medical emergency, resulting in an unscheduled stop in Toronto. Although the situation was quickly managed, we ended up sitting on the plane for hours. Eventually, we were moved inside to the gate until 3 AM when we were informed that we would receive hotel vouchers until our flight was rescheduled for 1 PM. However, the email we received was misleading and contradicted their promises. To top it all off, our claims for compensation for the inconvenience were declined. Some passengers reportedly struggled to find accommodations for as much as $500 per room. This all points to a lack of staffing and an unwillingness by management to allocate necessary resources, with a focus on saving costs over providing adequate service. While I won’t be spending any more money with them, my heart goes out to their staff. Don't fall for their low upfront fares; it’s not worth the hassle!

### “This is COMPLETELY unacceptable”
Not Verified | On September 26 we had an early morning flight to New York. We paid $85 for a checked bag to bring on board. Once we got to our gate (5 minutes after) they let us know that we were not able to bring the bag on board and would have to check the bag in. We then returned to the counter (10 minutes later) and were told we then had to pay an additional $90 to now check the bag. How is this even allowed? They refused to return the original payment or even just charge us the difference. We had to pay in full and were told to contact customer support. Upon returning to Toronto, I contacted customer support, who in turn told me to send an email to the refunds department. In a matter of minutes I received a response telling me that the charge was valid and they would not be returning any charges. I then asked the representative to please contact me via telephone as I felt they were not understanding why I was asking for a refund. They proceeded to not call me, but instead direct me back to customer support. The same department who directed me to the refund department. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable. I should not be charged twice for the same bag. I have zero issues with one charge, however paying $200 for one small checked bag is just highway robbery. This is the worst airline with the worst customer support. I have tried to call, email with zero help from anyone. If I could give ZERO below I would!

### "staff on board were not friendly"
The seats were really tight not much leg room. The airplane was so hot that multiple passengers were asking To have it cool down. Then on my return flight from Calgary to Kitchener waterloo. The plane was cooler. The staff on board were not friendly. And upon landing when my daughter got up out of her seat The whole cushion of her seat lifted up with her.

### “absurd policies and lack of transparency”
I recently had one of the worst travel experiences of my life with Flair Airlines, and I feel compelled to share my story to steer others away from this disgraceful company. If you value your time, money, and sanity, DO NOT book with them! Firstly, let’s talk about the ticket purchasing process. Flair Airlines lures you in with attractive prices and flashy promotions, making it seem like you're getting an incredible deal. However, that’s where the positivity ends. I bought my ticket online, only to discover that their absurd policies and lack of transparency left me stranded at the airport. They are nothing short of fraudulent! The nightmare truly began at check-in. They insist that passengers check in online for a smoother experience, but guess what? I couldn't even obtain my boarding pass after completing the online check-in process! Their website doesn’t mention any issues or restrictions that might prevent you from getting your boarding pass—an absolute lack of transparency that borders on deceit. When I arrived at the airport, I was met with blank stares and vague responses from the staff. After much confusion, I was ultimately denied boarding. They had my money, but when it came time to step on the plane, they seemed more interested in adding another notch to their cancellation statistics than providing actual service. And if you think about contacting customer service for a refund or any support, good luck with that! Their response time is excruciatingly slow, and when they do respond, it’s often unhelpful boilerplate messages that don't address your specific concerns. In summary, Flair Airlines is a prime example of a company that prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction. Their misleading practices and incompetent operations resulted in a chaotic and frustrating experience that could have been easily avoided. If you want a smooth, hassle-free travel experience, steer clear of Flair Airlines—they don’t deserve your business!

### "more appealing to just drive"
My first, and hopefully last, trip with Flair. Delayed out by more than 2 hours for spilling fuel, slack efforts to clean it up, and additional maintenance issues. Honestly, it's starting to be more appealing to just drive.

### "Avoid this airline"
Avoid this airline. They get you where you need to go, but only after nickel and diming you. They actually enforce the bag sizers, even if your personal item fits under the seat, if they think it looks too big, they will charge you for a carry on. Their customer service is dismissive and condescending. They lost my bag on the way there, a direct flight, and I received no information about the paper claim for 3 days, despite being told I would have the bag the next day. When I went to check, they hadn't even created a file number for me, so I had to create an online claim too, just so I could see the progress of the bag. Finally on day 5, someone contacted me asking for the shipping address via text and email. Again, I was promised the bag the next day. I didn't receive it for another two days. The bag had about $5000 of personal and business owned field equipment that I needed to do my job. I had to purchase all new items in order to work and according to company policy, I didn't qualify for claiming incidentals because it was a domestic flight. Are you kidding? If the person is away from home, they should be getting incidentals. When I finally got my bag back 7 days later, I find out there was a power bank removed from the bag, which fair enough, I forgot it in there, so that's on me. When I tried to claim the item back however, there was nobody at the baggage claim desk to help for almost an hour after the flight arrived. I phoned the number at the desk, and didn't get an answer till I started calling repeatedly. A woman answered and told me to go to security to ask, despite being explicitly told on the slip to contact the airline, saying "we wouldn't have anything like that at the office". So I wander upstairs with 120lbs of suitcases to get told that security releases the items immediately to the airline. I go back down and phone again repeatedly, no answer. Finally someone comes to the desk, I hand them the slip with all of the information and ask for my power bank back. They go back to look and come back a couple of times to ask for a description of the power bank, I tell them, another woman comes out holding bags of unlabelled power banks, asking again for a description. I give her brand, size, colour, plus all the info on the slip again. They come back out saying they don't have it. I am certain that they have it but just can't locate it because they have made no effort to keep track of what came from where! I again received a bunch of dismissive redirections to contact security, which again, will direct you to contact the airline. At this point I give up because the $50 power bank is no longer worth the almost 2 hours I have spent trying to get it back after a long travel day. This wasn't an isolated incident either, when I was filing my lost bag claim, another lady lost her power bank to security as well, they came back after a perfunctory look, which delayed me as well because there was only one baggage services person working, and told her they didn't have it. If you value your stuff, having clothes while travelling, or your sanity, don't fly Flair.

### "my luggage was not there"
I was making a road trip all over the west of Canada this last summer. As a tourist, I didn't know that Flair Airlines was one of the worse airlines in the world! I booked a ticket for a one way Calgary to Victoria for the price of 300 dollars. A short flight of less than one hour. I made my bagage checking at the airport of Calgary. All my belongings were inside for a trip of 3 weeks! At the arrival, my luggage was not there! 6 others passagers were in the same case! I was waiting 3 days at the hotel for my luggage, they never delivered it! I had to go back to Europe with nothing! I lost everything and they ruined my holidays! It's more than 2 month's now that they never send me back my luggage. A shame for this country to let companies like Flair Airlines operate freely.

### “very very unreasonable”
Not Verified | Two hand carry bags that fitted under the seats and one 36lb case cost me $240? Robbery, what type of charge is that, very very unreasonable, and should be not allowed.

### "Nice staff, good flight overall"
Tons of negative feedbacks in here so yes, if you did not pay for your personal item then they will charge you, yes if you did not pay for your carry on then they will charge you. Yes they will check your bag, anytime prior departure you want though. Do you have a problem when you are following their luggage policy? Absolutely no. Nice staff, good flight overall from Calgary to Van (120 $ including personal item and carry on).

### "charged me for my personal item"
Not Verified |   Terrible service! Check in guy was absolutely rude and charged me for my personal item. He was incredibly short with me when I was trying to ask questions and snapped at my friend telling her “you better not take anything out or put it back in” when he was talking to her. The service was horrendous and he talked down to me as we spoke. He charged me almost triple the amount for my personal item as a carry on and any other airline would’ve considered my backpack a personal item. The service and the policy has made it incredibly clear your money is absolutely not worth spending here, you would save so much more with westjet or air Canada. First and last time I ever fly flair.

### "customer service is a nightmare"
I booked a flight from Calgary to Winnipeg months ago to make sure I had everything prepared as I had an important wedding to attend August 10. My flight was booked for August 9th at 630pm. A day before my flight was to leave, I received a notification that my flight would be delayed from 6:30pm to 1am. It then was delayed to 2:50am and then 3:30am. I booked my flight through Hopper. I called them to ask about the insurance I had purchased for delayed or canceled flights. I was told on the phone that I would be reimbursed for the flight to Winnipeg as it was delayed less than 24hours before departure. In my compensation email, I was told that I would not be reimbursed even though I purchased the insurance for such an issue to happen. I arrived in Winnipeg only to find my luggage had been lost. My flight from Calgary to Winnipeg was a direct flight so I was surprised it wasn’t there. Somehow my luggage ended up in London, Ontario. Luckily I have an AirTag in my bag so I can see where it is. I had called the support line of (1-833-711-2333) They ask for a reference number and once you give it, they keep asking for it in a loop. Making it impossible to speak to anyone. I have medication in my luggage I take daily. I did not think to pack it on my carry on as it was a direct flight and I never thought they would be as incompetent as to send it to a completely different destination. Especially at 1am with no other airlines being used. I have tried countless times to get a hold of anyone and nobody has been able to help me. I was told I would hear from someone in 24hours and it is over 48hours now. I tried online chats and emails. Nobody could help or cared enough to go above and beyond to help me get my medical stuff. The customer service is a nightmare and they do not care about you, your time, your money or your belongings.

### “left me frustrated and feeling misled”
Not Verified | It was 0/5 stars. It was a very disappointing experience I had ever with any airline. I recently had a disappointing experience with Flair Airlines. I was charged extra for my personal item bag, which I expected to be included in the base fare. This unexpected fee left me frustrated and feeling misled. I hope they improve their transparency regarding additional charges in the future.

### "I'm extremely disappointed"
Disappointing Experience. Yesterday, my flight with Flair Airlines was a complete letdown. Their baggage checking system is subpar and feels like a third-class experience. The restrictive size constraints and lack of flexibility are unacceptable. Forcing passengers to fit their personal belongings into a tiny stand is unreasonable. As a passenger, I fully understand and agree with the weight limit of 7kg for personal items, but requiring them to meet exact dimensions is excessive. If your bag doesn't fit, be prepared for extra charges. This nickel-and-dime approach is frustrating and unfair. Moreover the Manager at Edmonton airport was completely unhelpful and unprofessional. It was clear that she was not trained to provide basic customer service. The lack of consideration for customers' needs and comfort was evident. I'm extremely disappointed and will never fly with Flair Airlines again! !

### "I call them Stress Airlines"
Not Verified | I would now call them Stress Airlines because first off I made a mistake booking a flight online they wouldn't help fix so had to pay for new flights because of auto -fill mistake. They couldn't even sell the empty seat that was now going to be on the flight I was on. Then when I went to book flight was sold out had to book on a next day flight which is now delayed almost 8 hours. I see bankrupt in the near future!

### "agent agreed about how bad the service was"
Arrive at the gate with about 15 to 20 mins to departure time was told the flight had already finished boarding and has left cue the old lady sitting in a wheel chair beside me waiting right beside me for assistance to board for the same flight that apparently has already departed and was allowed to board yet I was refused boarding even though the gate agents lied about the planes departure. They refused to do anything to help but give me a number to call that I end up sitting on for over an hour to be told there was nothing that could be done. The worse part of it all is that the agent on the phone even agreed with me about how bad the service was during the phone call.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. Worst flight attendants. Long delays, there were tons of personal belongings above and the flight attendant singled me out. This was by far the worst experience ever!

### "horrible to deal with"
Not Verified |   Flair is horrible to deal with, difficult to get someone on the phone. Baggage check-in is too expensive. Their flight was delayed 2 hours which made me miss my bus transfer to the hotel. I had to rent a car to get to the hotel. In the end it wasn't much cheaper than more reliable air lines like AC. This was my first and last experience with Flair. Also, could you not provide at least water in flight for free? ?

### "forcing me to pay for my personal item"
Flair Airlines customer service is an absolute travesty. On my return flight from YEG, Kaur perpetrated a blatant scam, forcing me to pay for my personal item as carry-on luggage after other employee allowed the same personal item on the initial flight without issue. This is a clear case of extortion, taking advantage of passengers when they're most vulnerable. Flair's duplicitous practices, falsely advertising low fares only to fleece customers with additional fees for legitimate personal items, are unacceptable. This predatory conduct will no longer be tolerated, and Flair must be held to account for their blatant disregard for customer rights and trust.

### "Horrible from start to finish"
Horrible from start to finish. So many mistakes each one costing us valuable time and money. I'm not going to go into every specific infraction. Reading most of the other reviews can help you with this. I just want to say that out of the dozens of airlines, both domestic and international, that I have flown, Flair Airlines takes first place for the absolute worse by a wide margin. My review is that Flair Airlines is Horrible and to them the customer's needs are a far second to thier own needs. Just embarrassingly incompetent and rude from start to finish. We will never fly Flair again and I will tell as many people as possible how terrible the airline is.

### "staff are courteous, helpful and friendly"
Not Verified |   We took this flight from Toronto to Victoria BC. The staff in Toronto were excellent, we got boarded early and the flight landed half an hour early. The staff were friendly, the airplane was clean. From Victoria to Toronto the staff were wonderful again and the plane clean. We arrived 45 minutes early. I have no complaints about this airline. Yes they checked our personal items, but they didn't make a big deal, in fact they laughed when I shoved mine into the bin they provide. I see complaints online about this and if your bag is too big then that is your problem not theirs. They even stowed our personal items in the bins above, we didn't have to put them under our seats. I would certainly fly this airline again and recommend it to anyone. The staff are courteous, helpful and friendly.

### "worst customer service experience"
The worst airline and customer service experience ever. Their advertising is false and they mislead their clients. They pose as the cheapest rate but then charge you for personal bags and carry on. I travel a lot and this flight cost me more at the end than with a reputable larger airline. I will never fly with this company

### "imposing strict dimensions for bags"
First time in my whole travelling experience that personal bags are checked with precise dimensions. I usually travel with just my backpack as a personal bag but this time, this airline are imposing strict dimensions for bags. My bag are a bit long but it would definitely fit under the seat. Their dimensions are too small compared with the space under the seat. This is just plain scam to be honest. Never flying with this airline again.

### "unprofessional check in staff"
Not Verified |   Worst experience ever. Most unprofessional check in staff in Winnipeg, I asked their names and they refused to give me their names to complain. If I could rate this airline a 0 I would gladly do that. The Supervisor was the most unexperienced rude woman. We were trying to explain our issue and she didnt care listening is the first thing you should do to handle any issue. Never ever again.

### "harassed about the size of the personal item"
Not Verified |   Flair showed the cheapest flight, but I felt harassed at the boarding gate about the size of the personal item and potentially charged extra to make it a carry-on. At Boarding pass desk, the lady harassed me to give my credit card only then she gave me boarding pass. I saw her doing same to other passenger.

### "Don’t cheat regular passengers"
Not Verified |   The flight was delayed for 2h as usual like every other time. Got an email about a voucher for food with an amount of $7.00 stating the boarding pass was loaded with the amount. There isn’t any money loaded in the boarding pass and not sure you are able to do this. You need a separate voucher with a QR code to use. Don’t cheat regular passengers. I would suggest you to work little harder to maintain proper time. It’s affecting all who is taking your flight for various reasons. Please be respectful!

### “my last time travelling with them”
Not Verified | Worst experience that I have ever had with any airline after so many times that I travelled in my life. I got attitude from staff, I overpaid for the services, they overbook flights and blame it on us. If you ask them for help, example, if you only have one arm, my case, they didn’t help me. Charged me for check in and then forced me to carry the luggage as carry on. After booking your flight, be careful, you will have to pay extra at last minute including your seat and their mistakes. With Flair Airlines, they even used my credit card without asking me and showing me the total, and after swiping it, I was not given the privilege to use the services that was deducted from my credit card. I have to say that was my last time travelling with them.

### "squeeze out as many charges as possible"
Before this ridiculous experience with flair, my family was a victim of the West Jet Strike in June 2024 which eventually led us to be booked for a flair flight as a part of one of our newly rebooked connecting flights on our way to Australia. We lost thousands already due to the strike and it was a pleasant surprise to receive a message from flair stating that they cannot take checked luggage on our flight due to a maintenance issue. We received this message less than 2 HOURS before boarding time and of course we had already paid extra money for a checked bag so hearing this was a major upset. Unfortunately that was not all because upon arriving at the boarding gate and having already figured out a solution for our luggage, they were already pestering other flight passengers for the size of their carry on (which they had to pay for) and their personal items. Thank god we paid for carry on and we had our items fit in the unreasonably small carry on check. As I’m writing this my father was checked a second  time for the size of his backpack even though he already received a check tag for it. The attendant claimed it looked “puffier”. I’m curious regarding how much these people are getting paid to use so much effort to squeeze out as many charges as possible.

### "never choose this airline again"
I had a deeply frustrating experience with Flair Airlines that I feel compelled to share. Although the check-in desk accepted my luggage, a light, small-sized notebook case and a suit cover, as one item, I faced a nasty surprise at the gate. At the last minute, they demanded an extra $75 CAD, stating it wasn't considered one item. This can be considered a kind of fraud. Flair Airlines may appear cheaper at first glance, but their last-minute charges make them far more expensive than other options. This deceptive approach is unacceptable and only serves to lose passengers. I will never choose this airline again.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |   Do not fly with this airline. Pay the extra and travel stress free. Whatever bad reviews have been posted about this airline are all true. Today they didn't tag my personal items bag saying it was too big when it clearly fitted between the gaps. Finally the woman with the tags took it personal when I argued with her and started picking on other things, like you can't carry plastic bags and etc. It is by far the worst airline and I will never travel with them again.

### "prefer money over customer satisfaction"
They offer cheap flights but you will pay double the ticket price at airport counter for bags, for even personal carry on (7kg). It use to be way more convenient, but now all they prefer is money over customer satisfaction. My flight got delayed by almost 8 hours and I have to sacrifice my other plans just because of them. I met a lady at airport counter who said I will be entitled for a refund of up to $800, when I submit the request they clearly denied for it by giving so and so reasons. I repeat, do not fall for their worst baggage policies. Thanks

### "0 in every section"
Worst airline I have ever seen in my entire life! 0 in every section. Staff in the check in counter are very bad, charge for personal items. Actually it’s a trap. Their personal item size is too small!

### "by far the worst airline"
Worst airline ever, plane got switched last minute, flight delayed for an hour so far at the time of this review. I paid for seats in row 5 for my family to sit near each other and they had to reassign seats for the new plane and ended up putting my wife and kids in row 21 which the airline than proceed to reassign row 21 to 3 other groups. Flair airlines staff are incompetent and the airline is by far the worst airline I've ever had the displeasure to deal with. Pay the extra money and avoid flair all all costs when you can

### "never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   Worst airline ever, I recently travelled from Toronto to Calgary with Flair airlines and it was my first and last time flying with this cheap and greedy airline. The ground staff asked me for extra 90 dollars even though I had already paid 99 dollars for the basic bundle which includes 23 kg suitcase and one carry on bag. I checked in online and at airport one of ground staff forced me to put my personal item into suitcase as my suitcase was underweight, and he told me that if i will not put more items in my suitcase then he will charge me for my personal stuff even though it was free. We are allowed to get one personal item. When I put around one kg in my bag then he told me that you have to give 90 dollars for extra weight and If i will not give him extra money then he will not let me go and I will miss my flight. That man wasted our one hour. Then my husband just gave them 90 dollars. The cabin staff talk very rudely with passengers. I paid 600 dollars for two people’s flight just from Toronto to Calgary which only includes one bag. They don’t even offer water in flights and charge around 5 dollars for just small water bottle. Another thing is that this airline is very late , my flight was at 10:20 pm and they delayed the flight by 4 hours . Boarding started at 2 AM in the morning. Nobody should travel with this cheap quality and greedy airline. I will never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "charge extra for carry ons"
This airline not only scams but are rude and charge you extra for carry ons over $100. i wouldn’t advise anyone to fly with them, they’re unprofessional, when you book your ticket you have to pay another 25 fee. and my friends brought big luggage with them and payed 257 for each. They do not have good service

### "never flying Flair again"
Not Verified |   This is my first and last time flying a no name budget airline. When I checked in the employees were all new, in training, and waiting for manager instructions. Long lines and slow check in. The ridiculous small sized bag check, created this huge queue of angry people trying to board. The airplane seats cannot recline and is small and you will feel like a sardine. Was it worth the little savings? No. Worst decision ever. I’m never flying Flair again.

### "Worst flight experience"
Not Verified |   Worst flight experience I’ve ever had in my life. Been to lowcosts all over europe and asia and never saw anything like Flair. They will make whatever takes to try to charge you extra, without caring if you’re having a comfortable flight. One of the staff asked me to put my backpack (which is a bit bulky at the bottom), and when I asked her to organize my stuff before measuring it she said I couldn’t do it. We had more than 1 hour ahead for the departure so it’s not that I was holding the line - She was just being mean. She got distracted, I walked away and was able to rearrange my clothes inside my backpack and didn’t have any other issues. Once boarded, I noticed that the plane was half empty. Even though, they wouldn’t allow people to put their backpack in the overhead bins (there was a lot of space) and they kept repeating that they would only allow people changing seats if they paid an extra fee. I would rather pay more and fly with another airline than having this horrible treatment again. My return flight was delayed for 3 hours, this was definitely the cherry on the top.

### "Never fly Flair"
Not Verified |   This has been a first time booking and last. I booked two tickets from Kelowna to Toronto. My mother was in ICU on life support. My daughter was devastated and did not want to come with me. Reasonably so it was traumatic. I called to cancel her flight, couldn’t, I called to see if i could change the passenger name to my sister in laws, couldn’t not! Called to see if there could be a credit applied, could not! A loss of nearly $600! Now return flight home- My brother and i are returning form Toronto to Kelowna. in the airport there is zero seating by our gate, so we sit drown the rows further. Tickets said boarding at 830PM. Do not hear our flight is boarding, do not hear any PA announcement for us as we are already checked in to catch our flight! Icing on the cake is when we talk to the attendant and she is so rude and says “How is it you comment see 173 passengers boarding a plane”. Try to call about my luggage and the toll free number has no one answers phones on weekends so i have to call airport security in Kelowna regarding my lost luggage! Nearly $1000 lost money with Flair, had to pay West Jet 2100 to get home and 465 for a room! Never fly Flair

### “One of the worst airline to travel”
I have a simple laptop bag with me but they charged extra 90 cad for it. One of the worst airline to travel. They are robbing people in daylight. There is around 10 people ahead of me and 6 of them got charged extra for laptop bag.

### "makes you pay for a carry on"
The carry on sizer is not industry standard. I have a carry on bag that I have been using since years and never have I ever been rejected for its size and had to check it in. They also charged a lot for its difference and I have never come across an airline that makes you pay for a carry on. By the time I ended up paying all these fees  they so called “affordable fares” were not so affordable anymore. I could’ve used west jet or porter with half the price if it weren’t for these additional Fees

### "Worst luggage policy"
Worst luggage policy. My personal item weighed 5 kilos while permitted is 7 kilos. They have a size restriction of 13” x 17” x 6” and my bag is structured in a way that it’s 11” x 17” x 7”. They did not allow it. It was a mere inch. The same bag was allowed on Flair airways from Toronto to Calgary. But the Calgary airport charged me 88 CAD for this!!! I was not the only one. There were plenty of other passengers with the same problem.It’s daylight robbery!! They say it’s not about the weight but about the size. Their size specifications are way off from standard bag sizes. I saw plenty of cabin size suitcases being charged as check-in once the passenger is at the boarding counter. All this after paying 450 CAD for the round trip. The worst airline experience ever.

### "I will never fly with Flair again"
Not Verified |   I flew with Flair on May 18, 2024 from Puerto Vallarta to Toronto. My bag did not arrive in Toronto on that flight, and I didn’t get it until the night of May 23, 2024. When I finally received the bag it was zip tied through the zippers. I opened it to find that several items had been stolen from the bag. I have spent dozens of hours working with upwards of 12 different agents, 3 different departments and nobody cared. I spent 4 hours filling out a claim on their website with attached receipts and prices of every single stolen item only to be told that there was nowhere in my claim that said anything about stolen items. The agents have been condescending, rude, and unhelpful in every aspect. They have come to a “settlement” to reimburse me less than half of what I am owed for the stolen items, not including the $103.00 I paid to check the bag, all of the purchases I had to make while my bag was lost, and all of the time and energy I have wasted on this matter. I was a flight attendant, I have taken hundreds- if not thousands of flights in my life and I have never come across such a garbage airline. I am ashamed that a Canadian airline could be so negligent. I will never fly with Flair again and I am urging everyone else to avoid it at all costs.

### "ask to pay $ 93.45 each"
Not Verified |   I bought the ticket from flight hub and other way to Toronto to Calgary allowed carry on luggage. My self and my wife both allowed carryon and personal item and WestJet is the flight. Same ticket on return flair air flight did not allow both of us carry on and ask to pay $ 93.45 each. The reason they told carryon not included or size of the bag not fitting. Size of bag we always use for travelling and size is right. If carry on not allowed should tell at the booking the flight at flight hub. Or charge at the same time. Then we should select return flight with WestJet. We saw most of passengers struggling to fix it to boxes at airport. For me it is giving more tension to most of passages and trying to rob from them. The staff is rude too.

### "this is lowest possible tier"
I flew quite a lot in my life , as well with a lowcost airlines . Compared to any other European lowcost this is lowest possible tier. One thing that makes me mad the most - the space inside the airplane itself is relatively spacious, there are more than enough space for a legs and for a full size carry-on luggage as well. However, the staff at check counter really opened a hunt on the passengers with a bags, which might be a slightly bigger, than a measurement stand. In the same time the rules says that your cabin bag have to be small enough to fit under the front seat. After you survived at check in counter, the same team gonna check your bag again at the gate to make sure that no one pass with a bag one centimeter bigger than required. Staff enforced the pregnant woman to remove the small , but thick, backpack and make it flat by pushing it hard . This is the worst experience I've ever seen during the boarding. It came very clearly to me that the purpose of the staff not to provide the fast and efficient boarding service, but to rip off the passengers as much as possible. I paid double price for a flight to Toronto, compared to price advertised on the website - for 20 liters small back pack. The staff is not welcome and has a negative attitude, not smiling.

### "Just a big money grab"
We had to pay 20.00 to book out seat online. Another $60.00 or a bit more for our carryon luggage. They then made you fit both your carryon and purse/ backpack into this metal thing. If it fit except it was a bit chubby, they charge you another $48.00. This is ridiculous as there is plenty of room for your chubby carryon to fit in the overhead compartment. Just a big money grab. They should at least give you a free glass of water. You have to pay for this as well. Staff on the plane were friendly though. Flair is only cheap if you do not have any, I repeat any luggage. A big money grab. I would not use them again.

### "They charge you for everything"
Worst airline ever. They charge you for everything. My purse was considered my personal item and I paid $77 for the bag that met their personal item requirement. It would have been cheaper to fly a reputable airline like West Jet or Porter. Never again will I fly flair.

### "hidden fees and additional charges"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying with Flair Airlines, and I can confidently say it was one of the worst airline experiences I've ever had. From the moment I arrived at the check-in counter, the ordeal began. The ground staff were incredibly rude and unprofessional. They seemed more interested in denying every traveler that there bags aren't eligible for personal bag. Even if the bags fitted into the bag measure available at check-in, they just told every traveler not to even touch there bags or adjust there bags asper the space. Ground staff was only interested in pushing everyone to purchase extra luggage. Simple questions were met with eye-rolls and curt, unhelpful responses. This set a very negative tone for the entire journey. Flair Airlines markets itself as a budget airline, but in reality, it's more of a trap airline. The advertised low fares are misleading; hidden fees and additional charges quickly add up, making the final cost far from economical. The overall experience is not worth the so-called savings. Save yourself the frustration and extra costs; invest in a reputable airline that values its customers and offers genuine value for money. Flair Airlines is one trap I won’t be falling into again.

### "Hidden fees galore"
Not Verified |   Charge you for absolutely everything. You pay the same as any other flight if not more. Hidden fees galore. I will never be flying with this company again.

### "charged $74 for carry on bag"
I bought online return ticket from Las Vegas to Toronto. It never mentioned that check in will be free if it is done online otherwise there is a fee. The day I had flight I got message for online check in. I tried but they marked all seats booked, only seats with money were available for check in, so I couldn’t do check in online. Then they say carry on baggage fee is between $29 to $59 for 7 kg weight. But at the airport they charged $74 for carry on bag and I was told it is standard fee for carry on bag. They also charged $25 for check in fee, so total extra charges were $99. It is just all cheating.

### "not received any information"
Not Verified |   My son flew to Abbotsford this past weekend for a hockey tryout. We paid 200$ to check his hockey bag and sticks and it never arrived. My son didn't get to try out for the team (the sole purpose of the trip) and we wasted probably about 1500$ between hotel, Ubers, food, flights (we paid for a buddy to go along for company) and the hockey bag. I was on hold with Flair air about 4 times throughout the weekend (totalling over 6 hours on hold!) trying to track it down the huge hockey bag and hockey sticks. Still have not received any information! How much you wanna bet, it arrives in Abbotsford tonight as my son arrives back home in Calgary. Terrible.

### “my flight was great”
There are many negative reviews here for Flair Airlines but my flight was great: on time leaving, on time arriving, checked bag arrived quickly. I was able to get a cheap flight a few days in advance and didn't need frills. And no nasty surprises.

### "not even giving me a refund"
Not Verified |   I canceled a flight within 24 hours if booking, they did not give me a full refund, their cancellation fee was higher than the ticket fee. Then they made me pay for my personal item that only weighed 3 kgs and they allowed the same bag with same stuff in it when I traveled 5 days ago to Ykf. The lineup was so long and I had to wait for 1.5 hrs to get the boarding pass. Then after the security check I was at the gate at 8:43 and the departure was at 8:55 still they didn’t let me go in. They made me suffer for their own mistake even thought I was at the airport 3 hours before. My place wasn’t departed yet, it was right in front of my eyes and was there more than 10 minutes before the departure. It was really urgent for me to fly, these people are heartless and they not care about anyone’s helplessness or emotions. And now they are not even giving me a refund even though made me pay 83$ for a bag that just had 3.8 kgs in it and didn’t let me fly.

### "there were no agents at the counter"
Not Verified |   I don't see a point in having online check in for them anymore. In the past they would email/text the boarding passes but no longer. What's the point of online check in if I've already checked off all boxes and complete ld online check in them have to go into the airport and have to go to the counter for them to check everything and print my boarding pass. I had to run from domestics to international then back and almost missed my flight because there were no agents at the counter. Then the agents wouldn't print my boarding pass. Luckily there was a flair supervisor there or I would've missed my flight.

### "price was higher than the other airlines"
Not Verified |   My 16 year old son flew with friends using this company. They charged him a carry on fee for his bag. Despite leaving items behind on the way back to meet weight restrictions better; they charged him again after ripping his bag that had a personal item tag on it from the check in counter. He chose to use this flight service to keep costs low as he is a minor. But after all the extra charges; the price was higher than the other airlines. So in the end he paid more for a ripped bag and extra hassles. No thanks Flair.

### "should have arrived 2 hours earlier"
I have read that Flair Airline is the worst airline here in Canada . I did not believe that until I myself and my family experienced it. In fairness , our flight from Winnipeg to Toronto is smooth. But on our return from Toronto to Winnipeg is the worst experience ever. Our flight is 5 pm , usually we receive an email that we can check in already and we did not receive any email. So we are trying to check in in the morning but we cannot get thru on line. So I message the Flight hub were we booked our flight , they told us that if we are returning from a flight we don't need to check in anymore. We arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes before our flight. And the staff told us that they cannot check us in anymore because we are late already. I told her that we still have 1 hour & 15 mins and we cannot check in. So she told us that if we cannot check in on line we should have arrived 2 hours earlier. But I heard her that she is talking to her supervisor that she cannot check us in because they are fully booked already and the gate is already closed. And the supervisor ask , who closed the gate ? She said I don't know. So she came back to us and told us that she cannot check us in anymore and there's nothing that she can do for us. But I told her even if we came in 2 hours before you still cannot booked us because you're already fully booked. And she said , at least we can still do something about it. But you're already late. Hello we are not late. We have 1 hour and 15 mins more. And they did not rebook us. So I hope others can be help by this review. Yes they are cheap flight but you'll spend a lot later. because we need to booked for our return flight again. So we won't fly Flair airline anymore.

### "made us pay for another flight"
Not Verified |   I had a return flight on May 20, 2024, but they didn't do the boarding pass because there were no staff at the desk. A security guard called one lady while she was walking around for the help but she didn't help us. Our flight was at 10:30 am and when we called the customer service for the help, they made us pay for another flight for May 21st, 2024 for the same time by charging us $737.56 even before our flight took off. They made us book another ticket in between 9:30-10:30 am in the same day when we had the flight at 10:30 am. We already paid $1219.10 for our flight. I want compensation for extra expenses that I had to pay. Today, May 21, 2024, I saw the same lady in the counter desk who didn't help us yesterday. Why did she do that? Karma should bite her for doing to us.

### "worst airline I've ever taken"
The Flair Airline bound for YVR on May 20, 2024. If there is 0 star for the review, I'll give it to this company. This is the worst airline I've ever taken. My most current experience is as follows: You won't receive any check in notice email at all and then they will charge you $25 for each person. You can only have one carry-on no matter how small it is. Don't expect this company to allow one tiny hand bag and one back pack. (WestJet or Air Canada is better). I was told by the check in lady that they are not a big company so they will surely charge more more on anything including check in luggage, carry-on,... Etc. The attitude of the staff is not friendly as other airlines. It may be because they can't see the future of this company. Not many people know this company So it took me a long time to find out where to check in. First trouble is the hotel shuttle bus driver didn't know where to drop me off. Even LAX police or airport staff have to ask someone else to give me the direction.. You need to pay extra to sit together and the check in staff won't let you know that so you can pay until I was boarding. This is so wrong to give your customers no options when checking in. There no app. They still give you a paper boarding pass which is easy to get lost. The stewardesses didn't even bother asking each passenger if drinks or snacks are needed. It ended up they finished the job faster. (about 15 to 20 minutes) I can feel the anger from the passengers because almost no passengers stopped them for a drink or snacks. No one even purchased. There is no way to charge your devices at your seat. The announcement is too loud. The seat back is so thin that I can always feel my back is pushed by the passenger behind me during the 3 hour trip. There is no extra head part on the seat back for tall passengers to adjusted the head rest part. 13. The dirtiest washroom I have ever seen. I won't take this airliner ever again. I later found out during the flight that my wife has an vacant seat by the window beside her. So the check in lady did this on purpose. What a terrible company training. I truly believe the staff wants to make the passengers angry so the company can go out of business sooner.

### "Definitely not recommended"
Not Verified |   I recently flew with Flair that had a few hiccups. They ran out of snacks, and we had to wait a bit longer than expected to take off. Also, they charge for everything, even for bringing your backpack on board. The staff could have been nicer, too. By the end of the trip, with all the extra fees at the airport, I kind of wished I’d paid a bit more for a different airline. Definitely not recommended.

### "customer service was horrible"
Flair is the worst airline. The customer service was horrible. They have untrained staff. The people sitting on the check in counter are very rude and make you realize that they are doing good to you by sitting there. These guys are getting paid to be there. They are not doing charity to the customer. They market themselves as low cost airline but they charge the same as air Canada. Nothing is free on the plane, even water is to be bought from them. This was my first and last time flying with them. People please fly with air Canada it costs the same. At least you will be treated nicely.

### "Seat was comfortable"
I used Flair Airlines to travel from Waterloo, Canada to Vancouver, Canada. Check-in was smooth doing it online via my phone. I did have to buy a "carry-on" since by personal item was larger than Flairs measurements for a personal item. The boarding was uneventful although we had to walk on the tarmac. Went straight to my seat as I was one of the last to board. Seat was comfortable. I sleep most of the way, so I don't know how the snack/drink service was.

### "couldn’t change or cancel anything"
I didn’t fly with them but the reviews look awful, I booked through Expedia 7 months in advance and couldn’t change or cancel anything without paying more than I paid for the trip itself. Even when I thought I was purchasing a travel insurance I found out quickly it would be impossible to use. I will never use Expedia or Flair Airlines for anything again.

### "everything turned out to be fine"
Booked for less than half the price of either Porter or Air Canada with one carry-on and one personal item. Flight left on time, arrived on time and was smooth. Nearly full, but luckily ended up with a gap seat beside me. With all of the bankruptcy talk, I was worried everything turned out to be fine!

### "the worst experience"
It was a really horrible experience. We are a family (me, my wife and a little kid). Our kid is a year and needs attention. The lady gave us completely different tickets at different rows. She saw and she's been told that we have a small kid. But she gave us completely different rows tickets and different seats. My daughter was in shock. And I had to stand behind her almost all the time. So most of the time I spent just standing behind her. They gave us last rows seats. So my wife and my daughter were seating behind the washroom. My wife could not neither feed my daughter nor even give her some water (infants and little kids have to take some water while taking off and landing). We've traveled a lot. We have much experience using different airlines. But it was unfortunately the worst experience we've been ever through.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Will never fly with them again. If you pay for a carry on a few day in advance $45. If you pay at check in $61. If you pay at the airport $81. I saw many people going through with bags larger than mine and not getting forced to pay the up charge. They are very Inconsistent on enforcement. They even charge for water on the plane. Save the aggravation and fly with another airline. In fairness their staff were pleasant and helpful as much as they could be while enforcing the junk fee policies.

### "rejected to check me in"
Worst customer service and Check-in service ever. I cannot check-in online (no idea why) happened so many times already. I came to the airport 50 minutes before the flight but the counter rejected to check me in. Because I was late! ! But so many times the delayed there flight for hours but now because of 10 minutes they don't want to check me in! Worst customer service ever!

### “cheapest service and pathetic experience”
Not Verified | Pathetic they have less measurement bucket and make you pay for your luggage, which is perfectly personal size luggage as per their rules mentioned on their website. Don’t fall for false rates, it’s most expensive rates with cheapest service and pathetic experience.

### "flight time was changed"
Not Verified |   Our flight was for 8:30 pm so we got to the airport around 5pm. When we got there and tried to check in we had to wait an extra 2 hours because the flight time was changed to 10 pm - no email, no call, nothing. The staff are the worst, they are no help and they have no idea what they are doing.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. I personally did 6 international and around 10 domestic trips so far, tried most of airlines but never ever had such a poor experience which I had yesterday with flair Firstly they delayed flight for 1 hour then it got delayed for another 2 hours and finally flight took off after 4 hours of scheduled departure time. First I thought it must be an technical issue as they announced then I digged on to it and found out that 80% of all flights in this route are delayed and all of them were close to 3 hours. Their customer service is very poor when I asked at check in counter about that 3 hour rule regarding refund. Firstly she was not interested to answer my question then reluctantly she handed me one customer service number so I asked her if you are a flair employee then why can't you just answer my question instead of directing me to some other authorities than she got aggressive and was asking for my name and details I provided that and during boarding which happened after 4 hours she hold me on line and boarded me last because I saw her unnecessary aggression.

### "Absolutely disgusting"
Not Verified | We arrived at the Cancun airport 3 hours early and were met with a massive lineup to checkin, we get to the front of the checkin line only to find out that we have to pay for our checked bags to the tune of $327.12 CDN. This was included in our expedia travel booking and I was given extreme attitude and rude service when I expressed my frustration. After finally paying the ridiculous fee we got to the security line which was very long and took over an hour. We finally got thorough and raced down to the terminal only to find out that the gate had changed and this took us several minutes to find where the gate had been changed to. NO text message of the change, NO email of the change and zero announcements were made to notify us of where the new gate was located. After asking several people where the new gate was we arrived with 25 minutes remaining before the flight would be departing. The young man that was at the kiosk was very rude and had a smug look on his face like he was going to stick it to us.He informed us that the door had been closed and that we would NOT be getting on the plane as the 20 minute time had passed. I showed him my watch and explained that we still had 25 minutes before takeoff and he shrugged and smiled and said NOPE, its closed. The plane sat at the gate for another hour and there was more than enough time for us to get on the plane. This is by far the worst experience that I have ever had with any airline and I travel a lot for my job. I found out from friends that were on the flight that our seats had been given to stand by people and that they had zero intentions of ever letting us on that plane. Absolutely disgusting that the customer service reps would treat people who spent thousands of dollars to vacation this way. My hotel for the night was $400 USD and my flights home cost me $3400 CDN.

### "nothing short of a nightmare"
I recently traveled with Flair Airlines in April 2024 and was left completely dissatisfied with their service. The airline promised a free early check-in if done online, but their system was non-functional, forcing me and my group of 14 to pay a $25 fee at the airport. Despite the flight attendant acknowledging that this was a widespread issue due to a problem with their website, they refused to waive the fee. To make matters worse, three members of our group had their flights canceled without notice, and Flair Airlines had the audacity to charge additional fees for rebooking. The lack of communication and transparency is unacceptable. Furthermore, seat assignments were a chaotic mess. Despite booking as couples, we were unable to view our seats beforehand and were asked to pay extra to select seats. As a result, we were scattered throughout the plane, separated from our travel companions. Lastly, the airline's policy to charge for both checked and carry-on luggage feels like a blatant cash grab, especially when the service provided is subpar. There was chewed gum on the seat infront of me and no barf bags in my row. This experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I urge travelers to steer clear of Flair Airlines if they value a stress-free journey.

### "Absolute disgrace of an airline"
Not Verified |   Absolute disgrace of an airline. They cancelled my return flight and then moved it to four days later. One would expect some compensation for the additional four days in a hotel. No. One would expect to be offered a flight with another airline on the same date. No. One would expect to be able to refunded. No, technical difficulties. Truly a shocking display for a company. Don’t even bother booking with them as they will let you down. Budget airlines in Europe at least have some decency to cover their own incompetence.

### "worst customer service"
I booked flights on Flair’s website. There was a glitch of some sort and my name was added twice instead of one ticket for me and one for my partner. I noticed this when I did my online check-in. I called customer service and they would not change the name even though it was a website error. They could not do anything in fact. That is what I was told. I had to book a new flight I also spoke to the agent and manager at the airport and they would do nothing. The worst customer service I’ve ever had. I have filed complaints with everyone I can find including flair asking for a refund.

### “We felt deceived and mistreated”
Not Verified | There was no fight on the booked date neither the cancellation was notified prior. My wife and I had a big trouble to spend for 2 more days in Mexico. On our flight they assigned far apart seats for my wife and I - only to charge seat selection fees if we wanted to seat side by side. We felt deceived and mistreated and will never buy anything from Flair Airlines again. Beware! Your damage can be a lot more than savings from the budget price.

### "The flight was perfect"
The flight was perfect. The Chat facility also worked - I needed this because the manage booking facility did not work. It was good that they checked baggage compliance at the check in desk - it's annoying when there is no room for full-paying passengers who comply with requirements, when other passengers are blatantly taking oversize baggage into the cabin. The check-in staff could have been more sympathetic to the fact that their system was at fault because my flight was not on their system. They called their seniors who admitted that it was their system error but the staff offered no apology for their behaviour. Other than this problem, I could not fault Flair.

### "not save money with this airline"
On top of my first flight getting canceled, I got swindled an extra $100 to check in a bag even though I already purchased their $30 carry on option because my small personal bag is not small enough. Beware you are risking getting your flight cancelled and you will not save money with this airline.

### "Humiliated us and abused us"
Worst check in ever! That from a seasoned traveler. I check my husband and me online. Electronic boarding pass says Terminal 4. Flair turns out to fly from Terminal 3. We walk with luggage. We are checked with prepaid seats with extra legroom. We are in line only to drop off the bag, also prepaid online. Staff member starts checking us in again and tells me: ”You have purchased the same seat twice!” I say this cannot be, show printouts, attempt to show electronic boarding pass, which she refuses to look at as ‘it does not concern her’. Ignorant, aggressive and incompetent. She proceeds to assign me another seat and charge me for it. I refuse to pay as I already have paid. She tells me to call customer service, to move aside so that she can continue checking others. She is holding my passport and my checked in bag. The lineup is long. She suggests out loud that someone come to translate from French for me! I speak 4 languages, French being one of them, English being my first. I have not uttered a single word in French to anyone. At this point I am being insulted by Flair's Customer service. The manager shows up and offers to resolve. After I show her my electronic pass, she dismisses me and says I have to have a receipt with $$ on it that I paid for this seat. If I want to make my flight, I have no choice but to pay $30 for another seat. Staff member tells me that whenever she is ready and feels like it she will give me a receipt for the charge. We wait. People swarm around us. Situation is aggressive and antagonistic, she fumbles around and in a few minutes she finally gives me the receipt. We get printed boarding passes and leave realizing she DID NOT put our bag on the belt. We come back and observe her check in other people and at the end putting their bags on the belt, but not ours! We approach and inquire. We are informed that it is at her pleasure if and when she would place our bag on the belt. We wait, she ignores us, we ask for manager, who is unavailable. We ask again, we inquire as to the reason for this treatment. She refuses to talk to us. Tells me to ‘get out of her face’. We go back, 20 min past the time if our check-in and 40 min before boarding time, our bag is still not on the belt, she tells us that if we want the manager, we need to go through security as she is at the gate and see if we would be able to come back. She is blatantly mocking us. We try to block her way so that she cannot check-in others and she has to finish our check in, which is to place our bag in the belt. The staff member, who is rather bulky physically pushes me aside. We leave to go through security without having seen bag on the belt. Flair staff left us no choice. Humiliated us and abused us. We travel a lot, and enjoy it. All 5 continents on about 26 airlines over 30 years. Never experienced anything like this. I have been serviced better in the depths of China by Air China personnel using google translator! I love to enjoy my trips and I don't deserve this treatment from folks who are either not trained, or are antagonistic by nature ...or are paid min wage by a low cost airline. If you respect yourself, don't fly Flair. Your peace is worth more.

### "at a loss to know what to do"
Not Verified |  Booked a one way ticket for April 21, 2024. There is mention of the departure terminal in ft Lauderdale. There are 4 terminals there. I have tried everything to find out. Flair chatbot gave me an irrelevant answer then an agent joined the chat. He had no idea which terminal to go to. He suggested I call the ft Lauderdale airport. They have a system where you enter the first 4 letters of the airline name. The system says it has no listings for flair. I am at a loss to know what to do.

### "Staff at the airport super rude"
Not Verified | I had the worst experience that I ever had. They charge you for everything, check in, bags, seats, water. The size of the bags are smaller than any other company. Staff at the airport was super rude.

### "lost my luggage for 10 days"
Not Verified | The worst flight I have ever taken. They lost my luggage for 10 days, had no one to call directly. Dealing with them only through email when they decided to email me back. luggage had the clothes for my husband and i and our daughter. Bought necessities for us for 11 days and they only wanted to reinburse me $200. how would $200 buy us anything for 3 people on a 11 day trip?

### "I will never fly with them again"
No self-service at the airport and insufficient employee at the check in, many many delays. Not acceptable at all. The pilot said that the delays was related to a security issues. That was completely wrong. I will never fly with them again.

### "make sure to check flight status"
Not Verified |  Flew from Toronto to Cancun and back. Flight was on time. Seats were not too roomy, but not that uncomfortable either. Perfectly fine for a 3.5hrs flight. Crew was pleasant. Took off and landed on time. Online check-in process was fine as well. What didn't go well was I changed by return flight and the website charged me 3 times for it. The site kept indicating there was a problem with the payment and asked me to recheck payment card number and try again. I tried 3 times and error kept repeating. When I checked my bank account, I saw 3 charges. When I tried to check my booking, Flair site now kept saying the booking could not be found. Imagine being in another country and not knowing if your return flight got screwed up. Flair support was/is non-existent. Waited on phone for an hour. Waited on chat multiple times to no avail. Finally was able to trick the virtual chat agent into taking me to my booking page and saw that return flight had actually gotten updated (even though I still could not access the booking from their website link). It was nerve-wracking and no support to help. After returning, I've tried 3 times to call and wait on-hold to dispute the multiple charges and still can't get through to support (phone and chat). Very disappointing. If you want cheap tickets without any frills and don't expect any changes, then Flair might work. Just make sure to check flight status close to the date to ensure it is still scheduled. If you need to contact their support (while outside or back in Canada) for any reason, then God help you!

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Missed our flight because they said we hadn't paid for our carry ons and wouldn't take our receipt as proof. They then claimed we no showed to the flight and in turn refused to refund our flights. Customer service refused to look into the problem at all and just talked in circles. I am a pretty calm person and stayed calm throughout the entire ordeal. We're sitting in the airport as I write this and had to buy two new flights totaling over $1k, I will never use them again. Regarding the one flight we did take. The plane was very uncomfortable and none of the seats reclined. Gin was $7 that I liked. Bathroom was covered in urine, probably not the airlines fault but it wasn't ideal. Staff on the plane was very friendly and we arrived and landed on time. No entertainment, wifi or power ports. We chose this airline to save some money, next time I will choose a more reliable airline with reputable customer service. You have to give at least one star on this app or I would be giving the ground service zero

### “Stay far far away from this airline”
This was the worst flying experience I've ever had. 24 hours before the flight we checked in to discover the tickets we bought didn't include a seat on the plane. We had to pay extra. We also had to pay an extra 65 dollars for our carry-on luggage. My "personal item" was a small back pack they forced me to stuff through a 6-7 inch metal slot, if I didn't forcefully jam it through they were going to bill me 85 dollars. Total bill was 300 dollars above what we already paid. On the plane I immediately felt sick to my stomach when I saw the state of the aircraft, most of the seat trays were taped shut and broken. (I was terrified about the state of the rest of the plane and it's maintenance). None of the seats reclined and were extremely uncomfortable. They won't even give you a sip of water without billing your visa. They were selling Mr noodles for like 5 bucks and it stunk up the plane up bad for most of the trip. After doing a bit of research I learned they owe 65 million in unpaid taxes. How is this airline allowed to operate in Canada? Stay far far away from this airline. You have been warned.

### “Low cost, that's a joke”
Not Verified |  We got ripped off! Low cost, that's a joke. I travelled with my wife and 4 kids, I booked with this company because I thought I was going to save money. They sat my wife and my 4 kids separately, half of the seats were empty but charged us $25 dollars for each to sit together. Be aware seats DO NOT recline, no charging ports, attendants - were friendly but they don’t even offer complimentary water, we paid for 3 suitcases $240. I would STRONGLY recommend using any other airline besides Flair. First and last time flying with this airline.

### "absolutely dreadful experience"
Not Verified | "I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Flair Airlines' customer service. Their representatives were unresponsive, unhelpful, and seemed disinterested in resolving my issue. It's incredibly disappointing to receive such poor treatment as a paying customer. I will definitely be avoiding Flair Airlines in the future and will not recommend them to anyone.

### "Low cost, that's a joke"
Not Verified | Low cost, that's a joke. Who travels international with only a personal item? I booked with this company because i thought I was going to save money. Do the math yourself and see how expensive carry on is. I ended up paying the same price as other good companies when paying 150$ more for a carry on round trip. Other companies would have given me a better experience and comfort for the same price. You might save money if you travel with no carry on at all. Plus you have like 80% chances that your flight will be delayed for up to 5 hours. It did happen to me.

### "Loved my experience"
Loved my experience! I was surprised by the comfort level for a low-cost flight. We took other flights after (other companies) and had less leg room in regular airlines. The staff was super kind and helpful. I would definitely recommend. Obviously, this is a low-cost option: one should not expect the same level of service as a flag carrier like Air Canada, but you are paying a lot less too. To me, it makes sense. I would definitely fly with Flair again!

### "gouge customers for everything"
Booked flight and resort thru Expedia. First flight on Feb 6 was to depart at 2 pm was delayed until 730 that night I paid extra for leg room seating and was told original plane had issue so the seats I paid for were not available. I was out of luck. Main flight attendant was very arrogant. Was supposed to originally arrive at resort at 7 pm for dinner. Didn't arrive until 130 pm all restaurants closed in resort and went to bed hungry. Week at resort was excellent 5 star. Time to fly back home 8pm departure. We get message it has been changed until 1230 pm . Another major delay I had to inform my employer I wouldn't make it in as flight wouldn't arrive in Toronto until approximately 630 am. We did get our paid seating on this flight but extra leg room seating had my knees against the wall also had to put my carryon luggage on floor as there was no overhead room that I paid extra for. This airline shouldn't be in business. They gouge customers for everything.

### “Avoid this airline at all costs”
Not Verified | Avoid this airline at all costs. They find ways to charge more money at every chance they get. My wife and I travelled together, yet our seats were assigned at opposite ends of the airplane. We tried to switch the seats as there were MANY to choose from, but they wanted an additional 50$ plus another check-in charge for the baggage. Even though we already paid the bagged check-in fee, which is $190 by the way. Canada Airline is $65 and for military it is free. Definitely going with them next time. One- Why would you separate a couple travelling together? We just got married too. Two- My wife has ASD and a major social anxiety disorder, and was placed between two complete strangers. There were two free seats next to me. This is completely unacceptable and slimy. What a disappointment.

### "everything went pretty smooth"
Big shout out to the crew on Flair air flight f8 661 from Toronto to Abbotsford, it was the first time I traveled round trip with this airline. I was a bit nervous, overall everything went pretty smooth without any major hiccups, on the way back the flight was delayed a bit, it’s frustrating and inconvenience, not only for the customers but also for the crew who have family and home to get back too. Overall not a big deal. I spent a few minutes chatting with Lerenzo and Sharlene after they did the on flight service, they were so down to earth, sweet and genuine, they told me a bit about how the airline evolved over the years, and a bit about what it is like to be in their line of work and flight crew, I have nothing but respect, gratitude, and admiration for them, hard working people, they are on the front line, the face of the company, doing difficult work, that most of us could never do, and being professional, helpful, kind and down to earth! Sure there will always be problems and hiccups and traveling is generally not fun but I feel a lot of things do go right and it’s because some people are amazing, strong, intelligent and inspiring.

### “paid $80 to bring my laptop on board”
They charged me $80 for my backpack because it was not the right size for a personal item. However, my 17-inch laptop only fits in that backpack. In other words, I paid $80 only to bring my laptop on board.

### "Very unimpressed"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled twice while waiting at the gate both times after 4 hour delays both times. Not cool. Other airlines cancelled with enough time to keep the entire fill planefull of people from wasting a full day. Also they charge for a personal item over 6 inches wide even though the actual space under the seat is 10 inches. Very unimpressed and will never fly with them again.

### "worst airline I ever flew"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airline I ever flew. HQ insisted that we pack our CPAP machine in checked bagage as we will not be allowed to take it in cabin even when the machine is approved by TSA. We payed $180 for our checked baggage and once at the airport, we were informed that we were not allowed the breathing (CPAP) machine in checked baggage and should be carrying it in cabin with us. After approx spending 20 minutes of showing the emails exchange with HQ and the agent speaking with the HQ we were asked to take the machine out and carry it as personal item. Same experience both sides from Abbotsford to Toronto and back. We did not need checked baggage at all. Secondly they charged two different prices for same checked bag. While going $80 and while returning $ 100. The leg room is very minimal and the seats had torn out covers with sponge peeking out.

### “just fly with someone else”
Fresh review! From my seat, I’m writing this! Stuck on the ground at Montreal airport, waiting for a repair on engine #2, 3 hours already and no update from the cockpit. You can be sure that I will ask for a compensation from Flair. No water offered, and the ambient temperature in the airplane is way too hot! With all the bad reviews here, just fly with someone else.

### "too early for attitude"
Not Verified |  It is too early for attitude in 4am in the Morning (writing this in the airport). Both check in staff were snappy and needs constant validation. Please retrain to get a good grasp of their responsibilities. They could just redirect people to the correct line, even then there was nobody in front of the line. We were informed that we were too early. We obviously went out the line. As we were moving on staff screamed: “you're welcome!” Seriously? It is 4am, get a grip woman. It is part of their responsibility to inform passengers of the boarding time. But why she would scream as if asking for attention this early in the morning is in bad taste.

### "Overall a good airline"
Not Verified | Not the best, but still good. It's always going to cost more money if you're paying as low as $5 per ticket. No power outlets, but thankfully my flight was short (2:30hrs). Cabin crew was nice. Overall a good airline, and helps many Canadians travel for cheap. I think flights usually have wifi but my flight from Toronto to Halifax didn't.

### “disappointing there is no consistency”
This airline is horrible and inconsistent. I flew from Abbotsford to Toronto with a 4 hour delay. At that time no one asked me to put a tag on my carry on or personal item. Not was I told it was too big. In Abbotsford despite the delay things were ok. Coming back we were asked to come to the desk and have our bags tagged at which time I was told my personal item was too big despite the fact that it fits under the seat without sticking out and I have travelled with this bag onboard many times no incident..as well, my carry on was too big as well and I had to check it in or not fly. I did not have any extra items. I was going back home with what I came with and when I explained this to the lady, she kept saying “This is Toronto, this is Toronto”. I had to pay extra to have it checked it. It’s very disappointing that there is no consistency and the customer service is appalling to say the least. From the airport to the aircraft I feel the staff are rude and miserable with their jobs and create a hostile environment. I will never fly Flair again. First time and last time.

### “They will let you down”
I have flown a lot. I am from Australia, I flew to boarding school several times a year as a teenager and I have travelled pretty extensively by plane in my own country and in Europe, Asia, South America and North America. Traveling economy isn't glamorous, I am very aware. But Flair takes the cake for terrible. It has left us stranded with last minute (like last MINUTE, same day) flight changes that have left us stranded at the midway airport because the first flight suddenly was arriving hours after the second was departing. They gave us ONE food voucher each and we were abandoned to pay for our way home that day. In high season. A thousand dollars. The injustice of it is staggering. I took a chance on them again recently, for the first leg of a flight. They wildly changed the departure time so I have just found out again that I will arrive after my second departing flight has left. Again I am spending money on a separate flight so I can make the connection. I can't trust this airline anymore. I was initially lured by the cheap flights but honestly you are risking paying through the nose. They will let you down. You will find yourself unsupported and having to pay $$$ to just get to where (you thought) you had already paid to go. Newsflash it is physically impossible to make a connecting flight when there a wild schedule changes pushing original flight times back by hours. But screw is, right? We just pay for literally nothing but spit in our face. Just awful.

### "ridiculously strict baggage rules"
Terrible airline with ridiculously strict baggage rules, even for a budget airline. Passive aggressive and staff on a power trip and lacking empathy. My flight from Toronto to Vancouver was delayed 16 hours! Then flight back was delayed for 2 hours. I have flown many times with budget airlines in Europe and Asia and none of them are this bad. No amount of money is worth it. Fly with someone else.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. I was refused to enter the plane because I got my id stolen right before boarding, therefore they asked me to obtain a police report (which I ran and did under 5 min and got back in time to still board the plane) and when I arrived and showed the police report she said she can no longer accept that, and that we are unable to enter the plane, I showed her medical cards, credit cards school ID everything I had with my name I also had a photo of my id as well along with the police report. She still denied me and just ignored me while I was frantically crying and scared to miss my flight, I’m in a city I’m not familiar with, 19 years old, and stayed super respectful the entire time. They simply refused me to enter the plane after providing everything they asked. Then laughed in my face and were very unprofessional. After calling customer service they are ignoring my concerns and saying refunds are not possible and never given. I do not recommend flair at all, although the prices are tempting, save yourself the awful experience and pay the extra 50-100$ for friendly and respectful service.

### "stuck on that airplane for 10 hours"
Not Verified |  My experience with them was a nightmare. When I pulled into the airport I got checked in and it didn’t take that long maybe 10 minutes. But after I got through security, and found out my flight was delayed. It was only one hour so not that bad, and lots of airlines usually get delayed. I hung out for a while, and it got delayed again, and again. Apparently the snow was bad in Vancouver. So instead of taking off at 7:30 I took off at 10:30. The flight wasn’t that long only about 3 hours. And then when we landed we started taxiing, and then stopped. We waited for about 30 minutes and I started to get confused. An announcement came on and said we would need to wait for a minute because all the gates were closed. Apparently the snow in Vancouver was causing problems. So I waited for the next hour on the taxi way and still nothing. Then another hour, and another, and other. Only then did they offer us water and biscuits. After another 3 hours they said they eventually found us a gate so we went there and there was another 30 minute delay so they could defrost the jetway. So over all I was stuck on that airplane for 10 hours, and hadn’t been at my house or my hotel for 15 hours. It wasn’t totally Flairs fault but instead of taking off they could have waited more or even canceled the flight, even that would have better than having to fly with Flair. So overall flair is a trash airline although the seats weren’t that uncomfortable, and the check in was fast, but basically everything else was horrible. To their service and their performance.

### "This airline is horrible"
This airline is horrible. This was the second time I booked a flight with Flair. The first time luckily they cancelled my flight a couple of weeks before so at least I could make a new plan. This time, Jan 6th LAX to YVR my family showed up at the airport to find out that the flight was cancelled. No notification, no explanation. I looked into it and the plane that was supposed to come from YVR to LAX in the morning was also cancelled meaning there was no plane to fly back to YVR. After many hours on hold I spoke with a Flair rep who told me that they would cover the cost of a hotel and food for the night so we stayed and re-booked on the flight the next morning. We arrived home the next day and I immediately sent an email to [email protected] as they said to do during the phone call. I received a response within 30 minutes saying that our cancellation was due to weather and therefore was out of the control of the airline despite the weather being beautiful in both YVR and LAX on Jan 6th (look it up and you can see the weather history). I told them that the weather was not a problem and I don't understand this excuse and received no further response. Also I found it very suspect that they were able to book all of the Jan 6th passengers that were cancelled onto the Jan 7th flight and the row behind us was still empty, probably 10-12 seats not filled. We saved about $400 by using this low cost airline and then paid about $500 to stay the extra night. My advice to anyone is avoid Flair Airlines. Even if it's more money up front to book with a reliable airline you will be glad you did. Don't let them fool you into ruining your family vacation.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, flight was delayed because pilot didn’t have enough off time between flights, flight attendants were rude, they double booked seats on the plane and were shuffling people around on the plane for atleast 1/2 an hour before we could take off,no potable water on the plane to wash hands after using the bathroom, there was not one good thing I could possibly say about the flight experience.

### "extremely unprofessional and rude"
Our Scheduled flight was supposed to leave 10:55 pm mnt on December 19, Only to be greeted by a 1 hour and a half line waiting to check in even though a majority of passengers already checked in online due to lack of staff working as well having to pay for our bags which were already prepaid. Once arrived to the gate it took again over an hour just to get passengers on the plane. We left the airport at 12:55 AM! I was not emailed about a delay until 11:18 pm, (We arrived at 7:30 pm, The only reason for delay was lack of staff and incompetent staff! The flight crew from Calgary to Cancun was extremely unprofessional and rude, it was my partners and mine anniversary, we were not even seated together which is what called into to Flair. Paid for and requested, numerous passengers on the flight had the same issue - the crew did nothing to help. After the delay, we were stuck at the airport for over an hour waiting for a scheduled ride because Flair was 3 hours late getting us to our destination. And our ride left! Never received travel voucher for either of these delayed flights. Departure Date - December 26- at 7:35 pm was DELAYED an entire day to 10:55am December 27 the next day which we had to pay for a hotel and food! We were stuck in Cancun for an extra day with limited places to stay and little warning, we left our hotel at 7:45 am to catch our new scheduled flight time at 10:55 am, which we found out after check in and after our flight was scheduled to leave continued to get delayed by 10 minutes to an hour each time and did not leave the airport until 8:35pm! We were stuck in an airport for an entire day with no Flair representative advising us of anything, just constant delayed emails and misinformation on each one, spending money we should not have had to, there was no Flair representative to help communicate anything to anyone! Once we finally got on a flight we were told that each passenger got a complimentary beverage which turned out to be only juice or pop or water. So we had to pay for our own alcoholic beverage plus the cup we used, (which is pathetic that we had to pay for and were told the cups would not be charged! We also had to pay for a cab because our scheduled FREE ride from Calgary was no longer available since we arrived at 1am in the morning! My partner and I both missed 2 days of work because of this as well! After submitting our compensation claim we were denied claiming mechanical errors when multiple flights left back to Canada due to full flights. Our flight was not full and had continued passengers arriving at different times showing our flight left delayed because it was not full.

### "customer service is poor"
My flight F82916 on Dec 27 2023, from London, ON to Cancun was delayed 1h40 in the departure, most of this time due to the pilot to be waiting a passenger that should be boarding. So disrespectful, mainly because the plane was packed and so unfair that all others passengers need to be inside the plane waiting for one individual to board! Additionally, when we landed in Cancun we needed to wait about 1h30 inside the airplane because there was no equipment to attach the aircraft to the platform(where passengers could safely access the airport). I understand this is a time of the year with a high demand for flights but keeping people stranded in an aircraft, thirsty and starving, is not acceptable. Moreover, after all these setbacks, no formal apologies were made to the clients (no email sent for example). To me shows some lack of respect not even serving water to people while waiting in the "limbo". Similar situation happened in the flight back from Cancun to London: flight was transferred for 12 hours later and, after that, departed with more 2 hours delay! Overall, Flair is extremely disorganized and customer service is poor. I'll certainly never fly with you again!

### "measure your personal items or carry on"
Trip with airfare is going to cost you more money than flying with other airlines. If you check online you are going to gates, at gates they waiting for you with some metal things to measure your personal items or carry on. My personal item was my bag what I hold on my shoulder. Of course it couldn’t fit in that metal mould and they considered its carry on, because on their acknowledgment It can’t fit under seats. I'm flying with that bag forever under my seat. If can’t fit in small it’s considered carry on and they charge you directly on boarding 68$. If you pay online check in and doesn’t fit in check in they make you pay like travel bag. On the end fighting with people at 5 am, the fight was canceled. We been told we will receive mail with instructions what next (what is never happening). We waited on airport 2 hours, call them being on line with them forever. They issued a money or sent you on next day flight. I never received 68$ for my carry on. No emails at all, but I will wait and call back again.

### “steer clear from this airline
Customers choosing to fly Flair Airlines, beware. Regarding both my departing and returning flights, there were multiple delays due to "unanticipated maintenance". I think not. If the maintenance was as serious as the claims made from their staff, who are not to blame, the flight altogether would have been canceled due to a faulty or damaged aircraft. The flight itself seemed rather small, so it was painstakingly obvious the airline was holding off departing to try and pack more people onto the flight. Not only is it inconvenient to all guests flying this poorly ran line, it's just not right. Nevemind the added baggage fees that are thrown at people before boarding with extra bags that have already paid for them apparently, their idea of compensation is a $10 dollar voucher for food/drink. Instead of this meek gesture and attempt to satisfy all the disappointed patrons flying, how about a full refund and some transparency. Last time flying Flair for me. Hopefully others can find this and steer clear from this airline.

### "unanticipated charge for carry-on baggage"
Not Verified |  My experience with Flair airline was regrettable, and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Despite the ostensibly affordable nature of the flight, I faced significant issues with customer care, notably an unanticipated charge for round-trip carry-on baggage. The airline's practice of checking luggage during boarding imposed undue pressure on passengers, with limited avenues for resolution. It appeared that the airline prioritized financial gains over passenger comfort, even extending charges to basic amenities like water. I genuinely hope that Flair Airlines conducts a thorough reassessment of its customer service policies to cultivate a more positive, transparent, and passenger-centric experience for travelers.

### "Never again"
Plane was delayed for more than 3 hours and I needed to get to Waterloo before midnight,due to Air Traffic Control issues. I went to the Westfet counter and bought a ticket to YYZ and was back in Waterloo before Flair left FLL .My return flight fromWaterloo to Fort Lauderdale on Dec 30 was cancelled so I had my son in law drive my wife and I to Toronto and on the way purchased tickets on line with American air to Fort Lauderdale . We never did get on one of their planes due to delays and cancellation. Never again

### "do not recommend Flair anymore"
I have used flair a few times before. Last time there was weather issues which is understandable. My flight to edmonton had no issues. The return flight was delayed 4 times then cancelled. I was then put on the "next available flight" which was 3 days later. That flight was then delayed twice and cancelled 15 minutes before the flight was supposed to leave. All they offered was a $60 food voucher and a hotel room for the night. I was traveling to visit my mother for Christmas who lives 5 hours away from Edmonton, but Edmonton is the closest airport. It made me miss 2+ days of work and a day of sitting at the airport. I do not recommend Flair anymore. It's a waste of time. Let's hope theres some compensation for this trip now that its cost me 4x what it did originally.

### "canceled our flight"
This recent flight is the second time they have canceled our flight and left us on our own. As a special gift to my mentally disabled brother in Red Deer, Alberta we bought a ticket on Flair from Edmonton to Las Vegas to meet family for Christmas. I had organized the trip and all went well until he got to the airport and found out the flight would be delayed 16 hours! With no where to go to wait we rented a hotel room for him at the airport. At 4:00pm he got a text that the flight was canceled and there was no other way to get there on Christmas day! He would now spend the holidays alone and miss everything that was planned for him. This was devastating for him and a financial loss for us. Although we have had good experiences flying in Canada I feel we will never be able to fly with an airline that is so unreliable. One usually gets what one pays for so beware as the stories of people's lost vacations are plentiful.

### “dirt cheap services”
Not Verified | I am writing this review on behalf of a close friend of mine. He came to Canada 3 months ago and decided to spend charismas here. He came on the 24th of December with his mom and brother but on the 27th when he was supposed to leave for a flight at 7pm they kept delaying his flight until the latest news we just received that the flight was rescheduled from the 27th to the 31st of December. Yes they pushed back the flight of a 40 year old woman and her two sons who desperately need to find a way back home. I'm so fed up with how my friend and his family are being treated because all previous plans have all been destroyed because an airline feels it has enough power to delay a flight for "4 whole days without a solid reason as to why". So if you want a dirt cheap airline with dirt cheap services that have no regard for your time and or schedule then this is the perfect airline for you. Hopefully this review was able to make you rethink flying with flair because next time i would rather fly a more expensive airline that actually values it's customers than ever put myself and family through something that could be as painful as this.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience. They damaged my luggage to the point that it needs to be replaced cannot be repaired, there are missing items from my luggage and they busted the zipper and tsa lock. There’s no baggage agents in the baggage area to report to and you have to exit the baggage area and go upstairs to report it. Then they give you an email to write to claim. Once you get in contact with them they make you pay to get the estimate and even after they get the estimate they only want to give you 200$ for your bag and only after you buy the replacement and send receipt. If your bag cost more than that which mine did you suffer the loss. I was also told to fill out some additional forms and that they would not cover the cost of items that were lost or stolen when whoever in their company broke the lock off. It’s really unfair that at their negligence your luggage gets busted up and items lost or stolen and they don’t even replace them. Don’t fly with this airline cheaper isn’t always better.

### "worst airline experience ever"
The worst airline experience ever. Stay away from the budget airline. I travel quite often and this is the final straw. My plane got delayed because they realized they over worked their pilots. Anyways, I’m done with them and you couldn’t even give me a free trip on this airline. Zero customer service, and zero sense of organization. It’s easy, x amount of planes and x amount of pilots. At least this airline is consistent in providing terrible flight experience.

### "one of the most horrible experiences"
Not Verified |  Easily one of the most horrible experiences I have ever gone through. Got to the airport early to check-in without concern. Flight was delayed inside the gate for 2 hours on top of the already 3 hours we had waited. Finally boarded the plane 2 hours later, to find out that we had been delayed another 2 hours inside the plane. We find out while we were in the plane that the airline was unable to clear customs at the U.S. side. After this, they decided to cancel the flight and offload all passengers. All we wanted was to share a nice family trip with my wife's side. Flair had other plans! Disgusting experience, with no apology given. Stay away at all costs, what you see isn't what you get! !

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. We had a flight booked for 4pm on Christmas Eve. Around 8am we started getting messages saying there was delays so we arranged for a car to take us to the airport later. once there we checked our two bags and proceeded to eat before going through security. At that point we got the text that the flight was cancelled with NO CONTEXT. We panicked, as we are a family of 5 and wanted to be home for Christmas. We booked a redeye 13 hour trip to get back to Toronto, but we needed to get our luggage that we checked. There was no flair desk anymore, and no flair staff could be found at the airport for over half an hour. Finally they opened one desk and obviously people were lined up. They offered a free hotel room for the night and a food voucher which we were not interested in. We asked the man at the desk how we can go about getting our bags back as we had a flight to catch in ONE HOUR, he completely ignored us and was very rude, to us and many other people in the line. Finally we were able to locate another flair employee who helped as get our bags to allow us to catch our flight. This experience was horrible and very disappointing. On our flight to the airport was had a good time and there was no delays but after this experience we will no fly flair again. The worst part was that we were not informed of the circumstances of why the flight was canceled, and it turns out it was because the pilot walked out. Thank god for air Canada and the great staff that was at the airport and on the plane. We have always flown out of Kitchener because it is affordable and saves us from going to Pearson, but we will not anymore because the airlines that they choose to have there are not good, and don’t care about their customers. If you are thinking about taking flair or flying out of Kitchener consider our experience and rethink going to Pearson to have a better experience.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Okay so it’s Christmas Day. Flight delayed by 8 hours. Oversold flight, crying passengers offering 200$ for an oversold flight if you stay behind. Terrible call center, the chat doesn’t, work they give you a 40$ food voucher for two people, but neglect to tell you it’s not for food on the plane. I will never fly this airline again.

### "delayed for around 2 hours"
Not Verified |  Flair Airlines is the worst airline I 've ever seen. The flight was delayed for around 2 hours, 2 hours passed and the staff were still trying to make sure personal bags were the right size and asked everyone to put their bags to see if they fit in. The total delay time was almost the flight length which was 3 hours. It was the first and last time I flew this line.

### “the worst airline in every respect”
Not Verified |  Flair is the worst airline in every respect. They trick you: your luggage must be smaller than average to be acceptable for their solitary standards, you must buy water on the flight. Who doesn’t give you complimentary water on an international flight? The seats don’t recline and the ground staff doesn’t give a hoot about passengers: they might as well be robots. I expect they will be soon. Ground staff is particularly horrible. Spend an extra couple of hundred and take another airline. We didn’t crash so one stay for that. Would I recommend this airline? No.

### "Staff is not cooperative at all"
My experience with airline was terrible. Staff is not cooperative at all. They charge a lot of money even for a single carry on bag. Flight delays are quite common. Overall, travelling with flair is waste of money and time.

### “staff appeared disinterested and unresponsive”
Not Verified |  I am writing to express my profound disappointment with the level of service I recently experienced during my travels with Flair Airlines. As a frequent flyer, I have come to expect a certain standard of service from airlines, and unfortunately, Flair Airlines fell far short of meeting these expectations. First and foremost, the overall customer service could have been much better. The staff appeared disinterested and unresponsive to passengers' needs, creating an atmosphere that was far from welcoming. Seeing such a lack of professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction is disheartening. Moreover, the in-flight experience left much to be desired. The seating arrangements were cramped, and the condition of the seats was visibly worn. Passengers deserve to feel comfortable during their journey, and unfortunately, the conditions on your airline failed to provide even a basic level of comfort. The in-flight amenities were also subpar. The limited entertainment options left passengers with little to do during the flight, and the quality of the provided refreshments could have been better. An airline needs to ensure that the in-flight experience is as enjoyable as possible, and in this regard, Flair Airlines fell short of industry standards. Additionally, communication from the airline needed to be improved. Some delays were not adequately communicated to passengers, leading to frustration and inconvenience. Transparency and timely updates are crucial in maintaining customer trust, and Flair Airlines failed to deliver in this regard. I understand that challenges may arise in the airline industry. Still, the airline's responsible for handling these situations professionally and ensuring that passengers are informed and treated with respect. Unfortunately, my recent experience with Flair Airlines has left me with disillusionment and a solid reluctance to consider your airline for future travels.

### "my card was overcharged"
Not Verified |  Book flight from Toronto to Kingston Jamaica and my credit card was charged 3 times for the same return flight. Upon noticing that my card was overcharged, I contacted Flair and they were unable to verify the cost of tickets versus the total cost charged to my credit card. When requested to speak to a manager the representative abruptly disconnected the call. My return fair total was $772.70 and my card was charged $979.13.

### "$150 for a small carry on luggage"
The first time I had to pay for my carry on luggage because of it’s size. I've been to so many countries, states and provinces and never had this encounter with my luggage, then they suddenly charge me $150 for a small carry on luggage.

### “service was horrible to say the least”
Not Verified | The service was horrible to say the least. First, the lady who checked us in did NOT know how to do her job and confused our baggage with others and almost made us pay an extra $120. Once our go light landed it took almost an hour to receive our luggage.

### "disregard for customer satisfaction"
I can't even begin to express my anger and frustration over my experience flying to Las Vegas in March 2023. Not only did my luggage arrive completely damaged, but the airline's initial assurances of a hassle-free replacement turned out to be nothing more than empty promises. What followed were a grueling nine months of sheer madness as I constantly found myself going in circles with their inept customer service. Every time I reached out for an update, I was met with the same excuse: my claim had mysteriously vanished into thin air within their system. And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, they had the audacity to inform me recently that my claim has been outright declined! I am beyond livid. After months of being strung along, believing that my case was being handled, they casually drop this bombshell on me. The utter lack of accountability and indifference displayed by the airline is absolutely outrageous. Oh, they may be a cheap airline, but this level of unprofessionalism and disregard for customer satisfaction is downright unacceptable. My anger towards them knows no bounds.

### "128 CAD $ for 2 small luggage"
Not Verified |  First we was not informed that we will need to pay on return with Flair carry in luggage. We did not pay going to Punta Cana via Air Canada but way back we had Flair airlines that charged us 128 CAD $ for 2 small luggage. Service not included as we was not offered with nothing at least glass of water. Flight was delayed and instead of flying at 20:20 we had fly almost at 23:00. It was our first and last time to fly with Flair Airlines.

### “They charge for every single thing”
Not Verified | No customer service and no humanity. I never see any flight who charge for water, we always get coffee at least. On Flair we had a 5 hrs flight and there was no water. You pay by card or cash and have water, no payment, no water. Nothing is free, never recommend this flight. If any one has to give extra $100 or more to another flight that’s worth it than to pick Flair. This is an international flight and they are not giving a carry-on bag. They charge for every single thing.

### "they ruined our vacation"
The flight itself was fine but Flair lost our luggage (this can happen which we accept). We had 1 large check bag for myself, my wife and my 5 Month old, our first flight as a family of 3. As they charge for hand luggage we did not bring any. They found and gave us back our luggage on check in of our return flight then charged us extra for a second bag as we had to purchase clothes while on vacation. We were told by the customer reps at the Airport to purchase what we needed while on vacation and submit the receipts on our return, as we landed with our stroller and the clothes on our backs. We were missing all our baby bottles, diapers, baby clothes and all our clothes swim stuff. So after arriving at our Hotel it was a dash off to Walmart to purchase the stuff we needed asap to feed and cloth the baby, back again the next day to try get some clothes for the next few days. A whole days vacation wasted. When we returned and submitted our receipts customer support messed us around for over a month and in the end after submitting nearly 600$US in receipts they finally settled and gave us 200$ CAD back. They ruined our vacation and cost us a fortune in new purchases and then stuck the knife in by fighting us and refusing to be anyway reasonable with our requests for reimbursement. I never leave reviews but they had my wife in tears on a couple of occasions over the last 2 months, I never knew my anger for a company could be this strong, please do not support this atrocity of a company.

### "Will never fly with Flair again"
Delayed flight due to staffing issues and lie to passengers it was due to weather, when weather and Air Canada had no delays coming from Vancouver. I couldn't make the new flight time due to forces out of my control and was offered zero refund. Will never fly with Flair again. They make you pay for carry on luggage on top of the checked bags. Not a good look.

### "charge for carry one is $84"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experience I have had with an airline. Dont fall for their cheap flights, it will end the same as the other flights, but with worse customer service and on boarding experience. I matched the dimensions of my personal item but apparently it’s too big and had to pay for a carry on. That is okay, but to be told because I didn't do the check in when you enter the terminal. Its now double the price for the carry-one, because your at the gate. The flight was $220. And charge for carry one is $84. The purpose of online check in so you dont have to wait for check in at the terminal. But if you do, you end up paying for the time saved.

### "It is the worst experience"
Absolutely worst customer service, never flying with flair again. Worst customer service at front desk and even at gate. Even after checking in online and with 2 person bags, we were asked to pay at front desk double the amount by a rude lady and then they let us go by adding the charges which we had to deal with at the gate, even more than what it was said at the front desk. When asked they said simply, it’s costlier when you’re at the gate. Their baggage boxes are ridiculous and so are their policies. Sworn on never flying on flair again. And it doesn’t end here, me and my husband were on our honeymoon and they gave us separate seats and even before 24 hours they would not let us choose the seats in online check-ins without charging. It is the worst experience flying on flair.

### "The worst airline"
Not Verified |   The worst airline and service ever! I'm sorry I didn't read any comments earlier. We flew from Los Angeles to Vancouver and during this short flight, our luggage was lost and never returned! The communication with the lost department of Flair airline is tragic and outrageous. The customer service employees hardly speak English. Very bad communication skills, I will never again use Flair airline and I don't recommend it to anybody.

### "absolute hell from start to finish"
Not Verified |  I will never use this airline again. It was absolute hell from start to finish. They have massive lines to check in, with everyone who gets up to the desk being asked to re-pack their bags right there. So everyone's really stressed with all their belongings out all over the place right from the get go. When you finally get up to the desk, they threaten to charge you for checking in, and say you can avoid this by using their check-in app. So you have to stand off to the side and struggle with this app that absolutely does not work. They charge $80 to check a bag, and they also charge you for your carry on bags, which they invariably make you unpack and re-pack so they can fit into these ridiculously small test compartments. I had a flight with a layover in Vancouver, and they made me pay that $80 twice because it was a long layover. At the gate, it's the same story. Everyone stressed out, being forced to pay extra fees, unpacking and repacking. On the flight, you don't even get water.

### "non-existent customer service"
Not Verified |  This is the worse airline you could ever fly with. I had already pre-paid for the carry-on add-on for both flights. When I returned, I had a bottle of tequila in my carry-on bag and declared it and was told I would have to check my bag. I said no problem but what about the carry-on charge I paid? I am told no refunds. I come back home, call their customer service center and I am redirected to send an email to their refund department, which hits me with email templates refusing to reimburse me the carry-on add-on charge. This is an airline that will prioritize holding on to $60 over holding on to their customer. It is not even about the amount for me, just the principle of being charged for something that I did not end up using. Absolutely non-existent customer service and will never fly with them again.

### "notorious for delayed flights"
My flight from Toronto ON to Thunder Bay ON, which is only a 1.5h flight, was delayed over 16 hours. There was no other option of another flight leaving that day from the airport. When at the airport I asked to speak to someone in customer service in person and was told that there is no one who works in customer service for Flair Airlines that is available in person. I was just given a customer service number to call. After being on hold for over 30 minutes I finally got through to someone on that number. I was put on with a manager, or someone claiming to be a manager, and proceeded to have a conversation about options which I was told included a monetary compensation of $500 for the over 9 hour delay. When speaking with the manager I ask many times for confirmation of this monetary payment and that it was guaranteed as long as I followed the steps that were laid out to me. I was also told by the "manager" I spoke to that a note was made in my file under the reservation number that we had spoken, I was told about the compensation I was being given and that I had the instructions on how to submit that claim. I proceeded to submit my claim right away. Weeks go by before I hear anything. Upon following up over phone call I was told that my claim had actually not been submitted, which prompted me to have to resubmit the claim form. After getting confirmation that the claim went through I received an email from their compensation department that my claim had been approved and added to their list to go through the online payment process which would take up to 30-days. After waiting the 30-days and still not hearing anything I went through a series of phone calls with the customer service department over a 2 week period trying to figure out why my payment had not been processed. I continued to be told that my account would be flagged as urgent so the payment would go through. Today I got through with another "manager" and was finally told that I actually was not owed any compensation due to the delay being caused by "mechanical error". On top of that I was told that on my file under the same reservation number there was no record or note of a phone call with a manager the day my flight was delayed and no record that I was given confirmation of compensation. Therefore, Flair Airlines either allows people who are not actually managers to state that they are in order to get customers to fall for what they are being told, or they are liars. They also lie about any notes being made in your file so that they don't have to fulfil any promises they make to you. After 2 months of dealing with this I have now be told I will be receiving nothing for this delay and was met with a very rude attitude by the "manager" I was speaking with this time insinuating that I made up the fact that I had spoken to a manager originally and that I was told I would get compensation. I have heard from multiple other people that Flair Airlines is notorious for delayed flights, poor customer service and a lack of accountability and I understand why.

### "nickel and dimed to death"
In an age where the consumer has less and less power, people are becoming more agitated more reactive - you would think that companies might take a different approach to business - like offering excellent customer service For the 40$ savings between WestJet, air Canada and flair. Please just do yourself a favor and just pay the extra 40-50$ for the ease it provides to be nickel and dimed to death - which I understand is their biz model - is aggravating and does nothing to mitigate the tension travellers have to endure when flying these days. It’s just not the same world. No one cares to do their job well - and we wonder why so many folks are aggravated these days. Never again.

### "comforted me and supported me"
For the flight, all the crew was friendly. But no water was included. I’m quite unhappy as I have 2 kids. They need water. If I knew about that earlier, I did buy my own water in advance. On the way back to YYZ from CUN, I lost my checked luggage (not sure if it was left in CUN). While I was not knowing what to do and who to contact as all service ladies at check-in counters had gone, Ieisha appeared with her warm attitude asking on my problem and helped me fill the lost property form and even extended her help to check at the arrival once again if my luggage was there. Unfortunately she couldn’t find it but I was not disappointed at all as I just loved the way she comforted me and supported me by all her heart. Highly appreciated it.

### "Book with WestJet!"
Booking with Flair Airlines was painstakingly long. It is a very difficult site to use compared to other airlines. Everything costs extra. The emails about making sure your bags were the right size kept coming. When boarding the plane there was so many bags that were way bigger than the allowed size and nothing was done! Book with WestJet! So much easier

### "luggage rules and fees are ridiculous"
Worst airline ever, their boarding process is the dumbest I have ever seen. And their luggage rules and fees are ridiculous. I will never fly with them again if I can avoid it.

### "$83.62 each for those same backpacks"
We flew from Toronto to Winnipeg with Flair on Saturday November 4, 2023. Flight number is F8641 departing at 17:30. We had a terrible experience with their staff at the gate and how their staff checked the size of the bags at the boarding gate. My friend and I had flown from Winnipeg to Toronto on October 28th with our backpacks and they fitted the space under the seat in front of us, and we were not charged for carry-ons. However, on our flight back to Winnipeg from Toronto, the staff at the boarding gate charged us $83.62 each for those same backpacks as they decided our backpacks were carry-on luggage. Flair has a sizing gizmo at the gate to check the size of every bag that did not pay for carry on. The thing is that sizing gizmo is a lot smaller compared to the actual space under the seat inside the airplane. A backpack may not fit the sizing gizmo but when you put it under the seat in front of you inside the airplane, it totally fits. We would be happy to pay for carry-on luggage if our backpacks were too big to fit the space under the seat in front of us. However, our backpacks were not big and indeed perfectly fitted the space under the seat. When one of their staff decided our backpacks were carry-ons and directed us to a different line where there was a lady standing there with a POS machine. When we approached the lady, she was quite surprised to see us. She even asked us why we were in this line and asked if there was anyone that directed us to her because she also thought our backpacks were not too big. But the other staff who had directed us to her yelled and told the lady to charge us for carry-ons. That was very rude and unprofessional because the staff treated their customers without respect. We were very disappointed with Flair service. That was my first time flying with Flair and probably the last. Why charge a client carry-on luggage when their backpack perfectly fits the seat in front of them? Why yell at your customers when there are millions of ways of communication that are more respectful. Your revenue might increase by $166 in total, but your brand lost customers. Build a brand where customers feel satisfied with your service and respected by your staff because in the long run, customer satisfaction is the key to keep a business stay in the industry.

### "They do not value our time"
Not Verified |  I had this airlines for 2 times. First time it was delayed for 30 minutes. Second time it was delayed for more than one hour. They do not value our time. And charge extra for carry on bag. Worst service / flight. It is delayed every time.

### "not happy with their service"
I am really not happy with their service. They charge you for carry on baggage, they charge you for check in, if you are travelling with someone they will not give you seats together purposely and if you request them to arrange seats they will charge you for that too. Their crew members are very rude, seats are so uncomfortable.

### "for leisure travel, it's perfect"
Not Verified |  People only write a review when they are not happy. They rarely write a review when everything goes as planned. Flight both ways was as expected. A little late on the return. Personal bag was good enough for me. Some customers didn't read the rules about size and weight and had to pay extra. I had zero issues. I wouldn't take this airline if I had a connecting flight or a important meeting but for leisure travel, it's perfect

### "Very poor service"
Not Verified |  Very poor service, rude flight attendants, lack of customer service training, no apologies for long delay in departure, damaged seat (after paying $25 for seat), bad check in process etc etc. The airline should be grounded for all of the above.

### "most shady and greedy airline"
Not Verified |  Flair has to be the most shady and greedy airline I have encountered. Never have i had to pay for a personal item to bring on the plane, I was about to board when they asked if I had a green tag for my bag. I didn't, so i reluctantly paid 80$ for one, I  figured that would get me back too. But no, Flairs policy says you have to pay 80$ one way to bring a personal carry on bag onto the plane. The staff are rude and snide, its as if they've had to shake down hundreds of passengers before and have grown jaded by the fact that they are treating people unfairly and in return being treated poorly. Flair Airlines can't even afford to give out a free cup of water to passengers. I will always denounce your company so long as even the word flight is mentioned, this was the worst airline experience of my life and I will never fly with them again.

### "Don't fly with them"
Worst company ever. Don't fly with them. They are totally disappointed. Trust all the reviews that people are writing. Stay away guys, you won't regret it.

### "still waiting for my refund"
Not Verified |  There was an error with my name and it cost me $100 to make the name changed so i called and they told me to repurchase the ticket under the correct name and they would refund me the first ticket after 30 days. It has been 8 months. Ive called them a dozen times, and they still insist that it has been issued. My bank has confirmed that there was no deposit nor has any been held. I am still waiting for my refund.

### "has been the biggest disappointment"
Not Verified |  Was forced to pay for my backpack as a carry on because they judged my tiny crossbody wallet as a personal item. Lady was extremely rude and threaten to charge my friend as well if I kept talking to her (my friend was holding a leftover from a fast-food we got at the airport). Flair has been the biggest disappointment I’ve ever encounter when flying. Never again.

### "forced to pay additional $82.50 to check the bag"
Not Verified |  Baggage Scam. Looks like a routine money maker for Flair. Paid in advance $51.45 for a carry on bag. Size was under that required on their website. Showed up at the gate and their sizer used is for smaller for personal items so mine wouldn't fit. Was forced to pay additional $82.50 to check the bag and was told they could not reverse the charge already paid at the gate and to call customer service for a refund. Contact customer service and they refuse to refund anything saying I must have had a second bag and ignoring the fact their sizer is not proper? I had only one properly sized carry on bag and they ended up charging me $134.40 to transport it on a half full plane. Took a chance on a cheap fair with Flair. My mistake. Will never make that mistake again. Should have followed the online overwhelmingly poor reviews of this airline.

### "really disappointing and frustrating"
I flew from Vegas to Vancouver yesterday and I was forced to pay for my personal item at the gate when boarding the plane. Surprisingly, I have been travelling with flair quite a few times now with the same carryon bag and was never charged. The ground staff charged at the gate and I paid for at that time because I wanted to get back home however, I showed the air hostess my personal item (which i paid for) which fit perfectly under the seat and she also agreed to it but she asked me to contact customer support at that time as the flight was ready to take off. As proof I took a picture of my bag under the seat so that i can reach out to customer support as the air hostess told me to do. This makes no sense when a personal item which fits under the seat I would need to pay for. I specifically bought the bag to carry on cheap flights. Perhaps, there were a lot of people who were allowed to take their backpack (big backpacks) without paying. This is really disappointing and frustrating this time and if this is the case then there is no sense to book with flair because ultimately i will have to end up paying $74 for carry-on for even carrying personal items. I would just book with Air Canada or WestJet where I can take a carry-on for free.

### "pay $88 at the gate to check it in"
Inconsistent and scammy luggage policies that keeps making you pay more. Will never fly Flair again nor recommend it to anyone. The online payment system doesn't work, the online check-in page is half working and confusing, lots of hidden costs depending on which airport you fly out of, and the staff are rude and unhelpful. In Vancouver airport they brought out a luggage measuring cage and made everyone put their luggage in. Even if your luggage meets the online size requirements, if it's slightly off and won't fit in nicely, they'll make you pay $88 at the gate to check it in, despite having paid for the carry-on luggage already. Boarding was slow and painful as many had to remove contents just so their bags fit. For me, I had a hard case luggage so it doesn't squish in so I had to pay again. The same suit case was fine as a carry-on on a previous Flair flight only 2 weeks ago. Food is low quality and expensive, as expected of a budget airline, but what's worse is they don't even serve water on board. You'll have to buy a bottle.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Flair has the worst customer service I have experienced of any airline. I was charged for a checked bag and a carry on bag which are already expensive at $50 and $100 a piece. Upon check in I was given a carry on tag and the attendant approved my bag for the airline. When boarding the attendant did not let me bring my carry on and said it was too big even though it had been approved by another attendant. They then charged me an additional $85 to check the bag and did not refund the $50 for the carry on bag.

### "missed my flight"
Not Verified |  Flair used to be OK, lots of departures, cheap fares, but in the last two months they have  crumbled in the allowable carry on (different size measuring cages from one airport to another). No credit for premium seat purchases if a flight needs to be changed - they do offer a cheap 10.50 flex fare that allows you to change a flight, but you will lose your seat purchase, who's is simply gouging. I've twice booked trips and paid, but the boarding pass comes out with different dates and times. (happened twice). Today, a very aggressive gate agent stopped me from boarding because I said my carry on fit in the Vancouver cafe, but why not in Edmonton. So I missed my flight...that, started out as 265.00 return, to 491.00 return with all the seat fees and baggage fees...in fact, the back pack, if I'd been allowed on, was going to cost an additional 77.00.

### "scammy practices leave a sour taste"
I am disappointed with a round trip flight starting in Ottawa, but more so on the return portion from Vancouver. The start of the negative sentiments occurred when I noticed that the departure time for the Ottawa departing flight changed when attempting to check in. No notification of the time change at all. I checked my junk mail to be sure I didn't just miss it. As a result, I had to shift many plans last minute and could not get my money back for the first night of the AirBNB that I booked. I understand that things happen and schedules can shift, but notification of any kind should've occurred. Then came the return flight... I double-checked my baggage for weight and dimensions prior to leaving for the airport. Upon arrival at our gate, one of the attendants was using a makeshift dimensional gauge to check the baggage size for carry-on and personal item luggage. I could not fit my carry-on on backpack into this gage and was forced to check-in my carry-on bag and pay a hefty price tag of roughly $80. The same plane model was used to fly to Vancouver a week earlier, and I had no issues with fitting my backpack under the seat at that time with lots of clearance. This practice is a huge scam, and does not affect the cost of the flight. Weight is one thing, but volume is not, provided it fits under the seat with clearance. This also contributed to the flight being delayed, as many people found themselves in the same boat. On the positive side (to be fair), the flights were comfortable and met expectations between takeoff and landing. I would not recommend this airline in the future, unless you plan to travel light and leave yourself lots of room for your baggage dimensions beyond the claimed size limits. Their operational issues and scammy practices leave a sour taste in the mouth at the end of the day. Unnacceptable.

### "Overpriced for everything"
Overpriced for everything from pre seat, luggage including charge for carry on that gets measured before boarding. Now we're 30 minutes late while they continue loading while we sit on the plane. Pay for water even though they cause delay. Terrible service.

### "had to pay $77 Canadian for 1 small backpack"
The flight was delayed and when I got to gate and was told to measure my backpack. It was good for the carry on but not fit into their tiny personal size. They also delayed flight without apologizing and made passengers line up at check in and made us all measure our bags. I had to pay $77 Canadian for 1 small backpack and when I came inside the backpack could be under the seat nicely without paying to put on the top compartment. Also, the flight was not full, we flew with rows of empty seats. Shame on them to treat customers like garbage.

### "one of our bags was declined"
I was aware of the additional charges for carry on baggage, which is why we packed lightly. On our flight to Kelowna we had zero issues, as all our bags fit under the seats as personal items. On our flight home to Edmonton, same bags and same content, one of our bags was declined. I mentioned that the exact bag and contents was fine on our first flight but was told I could pay $77, leave my bag or find another airline. I paid and have attached a photo of the bag in question, with several inches wiggle room between the top and sides of the under seat area. The flight isn't half full. Maybe if they had some form of customer service people would recommend this airline to others.

### "cost me $150 for two bags"
I’ve never seen such a gong show like the October 7th flight to Vancouver from Edmonton which was supposed to depart at 11:10 and didn’t leave until 1:15 or later. Bags had to go through the metal hoops, people were upset, one guy was thrown off, cost me $150 for two bags which were deemed carry on as we had 2 other small bags. We checked, paid for the green tag then they didn’t separate the green tagged bags from the unchecked ones and the lineup for boarding was brutal. This is unacceptable, especially Thanksgiving, first time flying, last time flying Flair.

### "charged $77 CAD for carry on"
I sized my bag according to requirements in the website and they say small backpacks are allowed within certain size lengths but then because my bag had things in the front pocket and couldn’t be shoved into their box sizer completely and they charged $77 CAD at the gate for carry on fee. This is the equivalent cost of the flight and this is how Flair will mislead you and rip you off.

### "attendants were so caring and professional"
Not Verified |  I fell ill about 1/2 hr before touchdown and the flight attendants were so caring and professional. They called to have the paramedics come onboard to help me off the plane as soon as the plane landed. At the airport everyone was very caring too and I went to the hospital for care.

### "Stay away from Flair"
Not Verified |  Don't book with Flair. By the time you pay for your baggage and all other fees, you will pay more for lousy service. Why would any airline book you in separate seats 20 rows apart, even though you booked together? Stay away from Flair.

### "double booking their aircrew"
Flair is a decent airline if you have everything planned out perfectly to a tee. Until they give you a random delay by double booking their aircrew members and that'll completely through out your plans by giving you a huge delay. And the issue with the delay is they never know how long it is and will not inform you. The worst thing is if you buy a ticket by accident for travel in Canada, they will not refund you within 24 hours of booking. They're one of the only airlines to do this and it's terrible.

### "Impolite ground crew"
For the first time in my life, I had to pay for a small backpack to bring on the plane. $77 CAD. Also, this was the first time I’ve flown a flight with seats that don’t recline at all. Impolite ground crew. That was my last ever flight with Flair. Life’s good.

### "needed to pay for our 2 personal bags"
Ground crew was extremely disrespectful. We flew this airline a week ago and had no issues on an evening flight but their day staff was a complete 180. I will never be flying with them again and I will not recommend them to family or friends. Ground staff accepted personal bag size before security an we pre paid for 1 carry on item. Upon boarding the plane and after speaking with the same staff at security they stated we needed to pay for our 2 personal bags (suit and personal bag). When asked to speak to a manager or anyone else from the airline the women stated there is nobody else here that’s management or able to help us. She then proceeded to tell us that unless we paid for these 2 bags (both fit the bag size chart) we would be denied boarding. Had she initiated the conversation politely instead of giving attitude from the start I would have been happy to pay for the additional bag or go through the sizing again.

### "Had a very bad experience"
Not Verified |  The ground staff was very rude. Not at all cooperative. Was asked to add tag for a shopping bag. Even when asked for water in the flight, was provided none and was asked to purchase bottled water on the flight. Had a very bad experience

### "Had a good experience flying Flair"
Not Verified |  Had a good experience flying Flair. Was worried because of all the bad reviews that something would go wrong. Flight was on time and boarding process was simple. I just logged into my phone within 24hr of boarding to complete the sign in process. Flight check in was easy and boarding was quick. They were very lenient with baggage size. Took a round trip flight to visit a long time friend, and it was really affordable (around $117 for the round trip). Recommend flair to my friends and family. Just wish that they offered more flight options and extend it later in the year.

### "changed the flight dates 3 times"
Not Verified |  I booked my flights with Flair 7 months ago and the trip is less than a month away and they have changed the flight dates 3 times. I have submitted multiple vacation requests that I continually have to change at work, I’ve had to call Flair multiple times just to hear unreliable responses from their staff and cannot compensate me for the extreme inconveniences. I had work scheduled for certain days that now the flights are falling on. Not only that, but Flair doesn’t even notify you of the flight change! Thank goodness I was checking my flight times on my profile or I wouldn’t have even known so we can add poor communication to the issues as well. I was excited about the affordable flights but travelling with Flair, even with the extreme inflation happening in our world, is not worth it. I would rather pay several hundred extra dollars for a reliable company than to ever have to deal with Flair’s lack of reliability again.

### "I will never fly with Flair again"
I was not able to check in without purchasing a seat ... not so bad, at least I got to choose where I sat for just over 20 bucks (but I had 3 flights to check in for so just over $60 with a few extra dollars for taxes). Then came preboarding - they announced zone 3 to board first, then turned everyone away telling them that only zone 1 could board ... everyone also had to size their personal and carry on items. My personal item was a fabric brief case that I have been using on flights for years, which easily fits under the seat in front of me. I do not travel with any other items - just my brief case (no purse, no bag). I could only fit this in the metal sizer by removing my laptop and was told that I would have to pay $78 and change because it didn't fit. I told them I had already been on 2 Flair flights and was allowed to board with no problem, and that it easily fits under the seat in front of me, so I was eventually allowed to board without paying. Unfortunately for many, like a teenage boy with a very small backpack (again, smaller than my brief case, and easily would fit under the seat) he was told he needed to pay to have this checked in as carry-on. He didn't have the money, and left the line .. no idea what happened to the poor kid. He asked if he could take out some of the clothes and wear them instead and was told that once it was sized once that was final. Eventually everyone was boarded and once in the air two staff opened the over head compartments one by one and pulled out any items without tags - they found the owners by shouting "Who's bag is this?! There's no tag on this, you didn't pay for space in the overhead area so you have to put it under your seat!". One staff member also included "Welcome to the new age of travel people!". The final, straw was when two mothers of crying infants were told to keep their babies quiet. It was quite a vicious attack on two separate women who were clearly trying their best. At one point when one mother was pleading for some understanding and compassion that she was trying to soothe her infant and encourage her other child to sleep, the other mother tried to come to her defense and was yelled at by a stewardess and told "We are not doing this! Turn around and walk away right now!". It was unbelievable to see how uncompassionate the staff were and very ironic to hear their announcements about how they are here to make our flight enjoyable, so please let us know if there is anything we can do for you. Luckily for them, this Momma Bear was trapped in a window seat ... not a wise choice to stir up a plane full of parents. I will never fly with Flair again and encourage anyone reading this to look elsewhere for your travel needs. Also the inflight entertainment was not available for the 3 hour flight, my seat could not recline and did not have the ability to bend the head rest to lean on,  but on the upside, I did have a window to look out of.

### "I think it’s worth flying Flair"
I was very nervous to fly Flair because of the reviews. I expected delays or even a cancellation, issues with my baggage, unfriendly customer service etc. However my Edmonton to Montreal flight last night went very smoothly, except for the fact that I had to pay for a carryon, I would not have been able to tell it was a budget airline. The staff was friendly at bag check, at the gate, and on the plane. The flight attendants were especially joyful. The seats were typical for coach, but no in flight entertainment. The flight was shorter than expected with a smooth descent. I wanted to write this review so that potential customers won’t be as scared as I was reading all these negative reviews! There are plenty of satisfied customers out there! I think it’s worth flying Flair and taking the gamble to save a few hundred bucks. I will be doing so again.

### 2worst airline I've flown with"
Possibly the worst airline I've flown with. The flight was delayed 5 hours beforehand, and they only gave a $10 compensation for food which pays for about half a meal at Calgary Airport! I was at Calgary Airport for 8 hours due to how late Flair told me about the delayed flight. Flair refused to give me a locker or any additional food. They leave you high and dry! Getting in contact with them after took forever. They do not care about their passengers! Don't get roped in by the cheap deals.

### "ended up costing us more"
Not Verified |  My husband and I booked a return trip with Flair to Quebec City from Edmonton in June 2023 to leave in September. The confirmation email was sent and easy to read. We were very pleased with the flight to Quebec City as it was on time, and all was good. But the nightmare started when we got to the airport and there wasn't a Flair counter. We were perplexed and another airline employee said Flair wasn't even on the flight list. We found out it had been cancelled and we were supposed to just know this! No refund had been given, no notice at all. An email in July had stated "We’d like to inform you that we have made changes to our schedule and as a result, your upcoming flight has been delayed. We felt that it was no biggie and we'd deal with it at the time of flight which was still almost 2 months away. It had an attachment showing 2 legs of flight and the charges. This email said nothing about cancelling. There were no texts. We had noticed we weren't allowed to check in to our flight online, and it had said to go to the counter! But there was no counter! Something was messed with their system. We knew another person who had booked that flight who was telling us his was cancelled, but we thought he had gotten an email saying that. We should have listened better maybe? There wasn't even another flight leaving to Edmonton in 2023! We were forced to book a very expensive flight through Air Canada. We phoned Flair the next day and the employee said we could get money back or get the next flight! There is no next flight until maybe next year? I'd have to say it's awesome that the prices are so low but it's not going to work to take this kind of airline if you have hotels etc booked at your destination. Good thing this was on our way home but this ended up costing us more.

### "airline has lousy service"
Not Verified | Beware! This airline has lousy service, they charge you a fee for absolutely everything, and their very poor and confrontational customer service is not only grievously bad, but your flight will end up costing more than a flight with a major carrier. Unless you have no luggage, take a middle seat which they put you in on purpose so you'll pay for an upgrade, you'll even be charged to check in, no matter how you do it. Their 'customer service' phone number is just another way to blow you off or deny owed refunds. Avoid this airline. They are rated bottom three in the world for complaints per 100 flights. It's easy to see why.

### "Be aware of Flair Air scams"
Not Verified | Be aware of Flair Air scams on their website. They ask you to check in online to avoid $25 dollars fee at the airport. When you go on their website to check in they show you all these free ($0) seats to pick from. If you even touch an option you won't be able to reverse it and remove the seat from your name and they force you to pay $20 or $30 for the seat. They deliberately made their website like this to force you pay more. Their customer service is beyond horrible too and they can't do anything when things like this happens. $20 is nothing but since they use nasty tactics to get our money.

### "not worth the few dollars you might save"
Not Verified |  I'm a retired pilot and I cannot remember a worse experience, certainly not worth the few dollars you might save. Flair comes within a few dollars of the reputable airlines, so save yourself money in the long run and avoid the aggravation and angst. Flair canceled our daytime flight and replaced it with a red-eye overnight (no refund), after four of their aircraft had been repossessed for nonpayment of lease. We did get our baggage and arrived exhausted but intact. The real issue was the return flight. We arrived at the gate a few minutes before boarding closed but the gate agent closed boarding early because she had given the manifest to the pilot and didn't want to change it, so we were denied boarding. Then she lied to us and told us we were late, lied about their boarding policy though it was printed clearly on our boarding pass. It was the first of many lies she told us. One after another. (No refund.) Our baggage, including my CPAP, however went to Vancouver without us. We filled out the lost baggage form but it did nothing, went to no one. All the airline's customer service is window dressing, nobody has authority to help you and there is no way to contact anyone with the power to help. Spent an entire day on the phone trying to get our baggage returned. Phone center was in the Philippines and they did nothing, apparently had no authority to help us. None of the airline employees could talk to each other, so no way to find our baggage. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you hope you can get on with minimal baggage, and can allow least 24 hours for layovers, don't mind traveling at night, can somehow fit into a coach seat with 27" of pitch, you will still have to deal with cancellations, rudeness, lost luggage, lying staff, zero customer service, nobody who cares or can help, even in a medical emergency. We went to the Flair ticket counter after arriving back in Vancouver, and an agent went to look for our bags. But this time we didn't settle for their word, we contacted the airport's public relations concierge and they followed the agent to make sure he did his job. We were relieved to find our bags, left in an empty room, despite earlier Flair staff promises the bags would be returned to Kitchener on the next available flight. Another example of repeated lies. The best way to describe our experience is a traumatic nightmare. Fly with any other airline and consider the small difference in fare to be travel insurance. The peace of mind will be well worth it.

### "disappointed with the penny-pinching tactics"
I am utterly disappointed with the penny-pinching tactics they've resorted to since the announcement of the upcoming closure of their competitor, Swoop. It's almost as if they are trying to squeeze every last penny out of their customers before the inevitable. Firstly, the whole ordeal with personal item and carry-on luggage sizing at the gate is beyond annoying. It's clear that they are using this as an opportunity to force passengers into paying for an upgrade. Having to stuff your personal items into that unforgiving sizing device before boarding feels like a slap in the face, and it puts your personal belongings at risk of being damaged. It's a shame that they've stooped so low as to exploit this situation for their own gain. Flair Airlines seems to have adopted a new strategy of deliberately seating people on the same reservation at opposite ends of the plane. This underhanded move is clearly an attempt to entice passengers into paying extra for seats that are actually sitting together. It's not just petty; it's deceptive and disrespectful to their customers. . They also have a troubling history of being frequently delayed by three hours or more. It's almost as if they have no regard for their passengers' time and schedules. The inconvenience of these lengthy delays cannot be understated. It disrupts travel plans, causes missed connections, and adds unnecessary stress to what should be a straightforward journey. While I understand that delays can happen due to unforeseen circumstances, it seems that Flair Airlines has a consistent track record of poor punctuality. Flair Airlines' chronic delays, combined with their recent questionable practices, make it clear that they are not living up to the standards one would expect from a reputable airline. I would caution anyone considering flying with them to be prepared for the possibility of substantial delays and to have a backup plan in place. It's quite evident that Flair Airlines is going downhill fast, and not in a good way. Even for a budget airline, their recent behavior is inexcusable.

### "So many hidden costs"
This is the worst airline ever…ground staff is rude and unhelpful. So many hidden costs. I will never fly with them again! Stay away. Avoid at all cost.

### "Not recommended at all"
Not Verified |  Disappointed, the customer service is not at all professional and give false hopes to their customers. They told me that they will refund my money within a week for one of my rescheduled flight. Now it’s been almost three weeks and still no response from them. These people keep on Laing excuses and keep on transferring you to other departments. There are other good airlines I would recommend to book your flight tickets from them rather than these airlines. Not recommended at all. Also if I don’t get my money back within this week I will file a complaint for these airlines.

### "will never recommend this airline"
Worst customer service I have ever received from an airline. They don’t know the definition of customer service. Firstly, they rescheduled our flight five hours prior without any consent then they again delayed it and the employees were so rude to talk with customers who were standing at the gates for boarding, even though they were not ready to listen anything. They just wanted to argue. I will never ever fly again with Flair - will never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Delayed flight. No compensation. No other flight options unless 2:45 am for the day of or next day same time, but will probably delay. Horrible customer service. Will never support again. Everyone I know told me horrible things about flair but I chose to give them one more chance. Never will I again. I hope they go out of business.

### "alarming lack of professionalism"
I had an absolutely terrible experience with Flair Airlines that I simply cannot overlook. Let me break down the reasons why this airline is, in my opinion, the worst option out there: Appalling Customer Service: My encounter with Flair Airlines' customer service was nothing short of a nightmare. I reached out for assistance, and they rudely hung up on me. This level of disrespect and unprofessionalism is utterly unacceptable. Flight Cancellation Chaos: Imagine arriving at the airport, excited about your upcoming trip, only to find out that your flight has been canceled without any prior notice or explanation. Flair Airlines managed to do just that. Not only did they cancel my flight, but they also offered no help or alternative solutions. I was left stranded and forced to book with another airline, incurring additional expenses. Marooned in Montreal: The horror continued when I spent a gruelling 24 hours stranded at the Montreal airport with my girlfriend. We had no money, no support, and absolutely no assistance from Flair Airlines. It's an understatement to say that this was an absolutely nightmarish ordeal. Consistent Delays: My past experiences with Flair Airlines have been equally disastrous. Delay after delay has become a common theme with this airline. They seem incapable of adhering to any sort of schedule, leaving passengers frustrated and exhausted. In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone considering Flair Airlines to think twice. This airline has demonstrated an alarming lack of professionalism, reliability, and customer care. Flair Airlines has left me scarred from my travel experiences, and I implore others to steer clear to avoid going through the same ordeal.

### "been on hold for a half hour"
Not Verified | I booked a flight and the credit card was charged but the booking was not confirmed and now I am trying to get hold of someone and have been on hold for a half hour.

### "such non-acceptable services"
Not Verified |  Flair Airlines damaged my hard case of expensive baggage on the flight. After 4 months of more than 50 back-and-forth emails and lots of required documents, they said they'd reimburse a maximum 170$ and now even after 2.5 months of the submitted requests, each time they say there was a glitch in our system and it'll take another 30 days for a new submission. Just be patient with us! Worst airline ever and someone should be accountable for such non-acceptable services and abuse the system for their own benefit.

### "Was delayed twice"
Not Verified |  Never flying Flair again. Was sent an email at 00.30 for our flight at 07.25. Was delayed twice until 17.15. That lost us a whole day in Vancouver. Was only given a $40 meal voucher for our troubles.

### "delayed my flight without any compensation"
Not Verified |  They delayed my flight without providing any compensation for the hotel. It's impossible to speak with a supervisor or manager. They delay flights just to add more passengers without any advance notification via text or email. Avoid if you don't want to experience added stress.

### "Never again will I fly with Flair"
Flair Airlines is posing as an affordable option with a catch. What you will find is strict targeting of passengers who opted to not pay for checked or carry-on bags. You will find yourself being asked to jam your bag into the cubic sizing template, I stated I had breakable items but was still forced to make the attempt to prove what reasonable eyes could see, my bag fit. Skip forward to the gate and again these bag police stop us, again asking to fit bags into template, again shifting items, pointing out this poorly conceived business model to staff only agitated the head bag bouncer. Anyway, people travel with round bags, not boxes. Never again will I fly with Flair.

### "never had such a bad experience"
My luggage arrived broken. When I complained by phone, still at the Airport I was told to go to one of their counters. Well the problem was that I arrived at Terminal 4, and their counters were all the way at Terminal 1. After flying who wants to drag their luggage that far to file a complaint for luggage that you had to pay ($135) because even the carry on it's not included with your ticket price, although you have to take it with you. You also have to pay for drinks (water, coffee, tea) which other airlines serves for free. No entertainment during flight, and no pockets on the seat to hold your stuff. This airline is very expensive, it's all about money. I never heard about them before and I don't even know how I end up with them. I purchased my round ticket on Hotwire and I thought I was flying with Delta as I did on my way to Toronto. I've never had such a bad experience and on top of everything end up with broken luggage? I will not fly with this company again.

### "should be ashamed of their performance"
I've traveled extensively for years, approx 50 countries, many numerous times. Flair is easily the worst airline I have ever experienced. Flair Airlines takes the trophy for not only being the worst airline but the worst by far. They will abandon an entire packed airplane full of customers. Re-book and confirm booking, without your consent, 5 days later, 1,600 kms from departure location. Never arriving, stealing 18 hours of your time, no compensation, more than a month later waiting on a refund. Penny wise, pound foolish". Never again. If I could give them 0/10 I unequivocally would. This company should be ashamed of their performance.

### "unfriendly and non cooperative"
The staff at check in is so unfriendly and non cooperative. They made us wait for 2 hours and didn’t let us board without paying extra money. They just very rude.

### "I will not use Flair again"
Not Verified |  I have used Flair on 4 previous occasions (Ottawa to Victoria return) and it was simple and efficient. The past trip from Ottawa to Halifax return was totally screwed up from check-in at Ottawa to disembarking on the return leg. At Ottawa check-in the 1A&1B seats I had paid the seating premium was not available. The excuse was "They changed the aircraft and the configuration". What difference the tail number would make when the plane is a Boeing 737-800 with 189 seats for every flight? No offer of a refund was forthcoming. The return trip was worse. There was a 2.5 hours delay because the entire boarding was screwed up. Even after paying an additional fee for luggage and seat premiums we still did not get the seats we paid for. At this point, it was futile to argue because Flair could totally refuse to board us. Flair generously offered a "free glass of inflight water" as compensation. All in all this economy flight cost me another $250.00 over the original fare when the flights were originally booked. I will not use Flair again. Being a senior who always needs a companion to fly with this means it is two seats lost for every trip.

### "has been 3 months, nothing paid"
Not Verified |  My luggage was 100% damaged. Wheels disappeared, luggage broken and they accepted to reimburse me 170 cad as they wrote in the email. It has been 3 months, nothing paid. I emailed more than 20 times, called approximately 10 times. They first said 30 days, then to give them another 10 days, again extra 10 days. Now 3 months, nothing!

### "Very unreliable and unpredictable"
They delayed my flight without paying any compensation for hotel. Weather is sunny and clear but they keep delaying flight just to add more passengers in flight. Every time they delayed they add safety issue so people can't file compensation claims. Very unreliable and unpredictable Airline.

### "not consistent with their rules"
Flight attendants are good. However the staff at boarding/pre-boarding lack good customer service and not consistent with their rules when it comes to personal items. Zero stars for their staff at boarding.

### "lack of customer service"
Would give them 0-stars if that was possible. They would even split your family when planning seating to make you pay for seats that are on the same row. Massive delays, poor communication and basically lack of customer service as this cannot be reached for over 30 mins of waiting time. We flew from Calgary to Toronto and Flair claimed the 5h delay is due to the thunderstorm the previous night, though in reality they have gambled to save on personnel and when it panned out that the storm didn't pass as fast as they expected they didn't have a crew to staff the plane any more. Then they used the plane to fly another route so that the aircraft does not fly empty. Of course they told us about that about 2 hours before our 6 am flight. Many thanks! !

### "Such a bad airline"
Such a bad airline I have ever seen. They have no respect and value to customer. Don’t fly with them. They even not taking care about your lost items. We are waiting for my lost item till now and no response from their baggage claim team. Also flights are always running in late. Very bad customer service and front desk as well.

### "Would not recommend this airline"
Will never fly with this airline again. Flew YVR to YYC, me and my friend arrived with one backpack each, we were able to fit them into the sizing slots after rearranging. Gate staff saw us rearranging items and asked for our name to make a note to check the size of our luggage again even though another agent approved it the first time. Eventually I get called to the front before boarding to check my luggage again this is around the 3rd time having our personal item size checked. It fit into the slot again but gate staff were not happy with it. Boarding started and me and my friend scanned our boarding passes. Mind you we bought seats weeks in advanced to sit in the front of the plane. Once my boarding pass gets scanned I’m told that the seat that I payed for was sold to another customer and I will have to sit elsewhere. I asked if I could have a refund since it was expensive and I will not be getting the seat I payed for. The gate attendant was very rude through this whole process. Would not recommend this airline.

### "Will never fly with Flair again"
Took flight from Calgary to Ottawa with flair. Calgary no problem wasn’t charged for carry on bags at all. Ottawa was different VERY RUDE STAFF and was told needed to now pay for carry on Ottawa to Halifax. When I asked staff why they became very rude and said we just had to. Understandable if we had changed airplanes. Cheap flights, but nail you on baggage wherever they can with no explanation given. Will never fly with Flair again.

### "half developed and convoluted support"
Disgusting behaviour from Flair during the state of emergency occurring in Kelowna right now. People have been evacuated from their homes and while airlines like WestJet and Air Canada have been extremely cautious and graceful about the situation by cancelling flights (with a lot of notice) for the safety of their passengers, Flair has continued to push flights to fill their pockets. My flight was originally supposed to be during the day in the no-fly period (9am-6pm) but has been pushed 6 hours just so they can avoid a cancellation for what will no doubt be an empty plane. At this point, they’ve offered half developed and convoluted support, but only if you’re lucky to get through to the customer support line or their rebooking site that constantly crashes. Will never be flying with them again.

### "for the price I paid I was happy"
Was okay for a budget carrier, wasn't expecting anything special. Do not pay extra for carry on bag as they don't seem to be checking or charging for them at the gate. Very cheap. No option to pick seat unless you pay and the seats didn't recline but for the price I paid I was happy.

### "left stranded at Calgary airport"
Not Verified |  Flair refused to accept the valid Canadian government health card renewal paper and would not allow my 70 year old Canadian disabled husband to board the flight from one Canadian province to another. My husband and I, both seniors, were left stranded at Calgary airport unable to fly home.

### "probably the worst service"
Not Verified |  Honestly, probably the worst service I’ve received from an airline. The checkin was rude, made the woman in front of me pay for a toddlers backpack as a carryon because she said it was too big as a personal item as well as myself for my diaper bag, which is meant to be free. The flight was then delayed three times. We were given food vouchers only, which expired the same night and all of the restaurants in the Ottawa airport were closed. We were sent an app to rebook, and it links to a site that’s been down for three days. I waited 40 minutes on hold to talk to an employee who wouldn’t refund a bag for my uncle who I was traveling with despite him no longer needing it because I am no longer traveling with him, and didn’t even pick the seats, despite having already paid an additional fee for having done so. I would not recommend this airline.

### "30 days with no compensation"
The first flight was not bad, but my return flight was first delayed 4 hours, and then last minute they delayed it another 4 hours. Had to cancel and hire a driver for my moving truck for $700, so I applied for compensation and oh man do they drag their feet and go to great lengths to not pay this back. Follow up with customer support and they can't help you, they said to email the right address and good luck getting a response from them. It's been 30 days with no compensation and no response from Flair about it. Will not be using this airline again, cheap flights and the service to match.

### "worst type of employee"
Flight booked for Thursday August 17th. Received an email while walking in the airport, flight cancelled. Went to the Flair counter to speak to an agent to see my options for flights. Remember we are Thursday, they offered me Tuesday the following week. I asked if she can cancel and request a reimbursement or how it works. She laughed at me while looking at the other agent and screamed next! She was so cocky and no respect for people. Just rude and the worst type of employee.

### "will most likely cancel the flight"
Our flight has been delayed twice now for "maintenance issues" . First departure time was 8 pm. A reasonable time to fly. Thats why we booked it. Then it was delayed to 11:50 pm. Now its delayed to 1:10 am. Were flying with kids. Not an ideal flight time anymore. Have cars rented and hotels booked in Victoria we are now scrambling to reschedule. Whats the point of heading to the airport even if they will most likely cancel the flight? How are we 100 years into commercial aviation and this still happens?! No accountability except a $40 food voucher. We all know how far $40 goes at the airport.

### "150 dollars just to change the name"
Not Verified |  I will never book with flair again. The site kept kicking me out mid booking and it finally went through even though I didn’t finish, because of that one of the passengers info was wrong now when I went to get them to deal with it they charged me 150 dollars just to change the last name and then ended up switching the gender on me as well. Wasted 6 hours of my day dealing with this and charged me 150 dollars just to change the name. It has been ridiculous and I will never be dealing with them again. If I could give 0 stars I would

### "rescheduled 7 days from original departure date"
Our flight to Vancouver was originally scheduled at 7:05pm of August 12 but Flair Airlines decided to reschedule it to 12:40am of August 13.m due to change in flight plan. We arrived at the airport at 11:00pm and the check-in was taking so long because there's only ONE agent at the counter. Just 2 minutes after we passed through the security check, the airline announced that our flight is cancelled. There were no other info given to us at the airport, no assistance to reschedule, no info on when the next flight would be, nothing. We also learned at the airport that this is already their 3rd cancelled flight this week. After a few hours after we got home, Flair emailed us that they already arranged our flight but no details were given on the email about the new schedule. I had to find out the schedule online and we are rescheduled for August 19, 2023. That is 7 days from the original departure date

### "Flair is peddling lies"
Our flight was delayed from 7pm to 12:40am. We were told the plane was waiting in Vancouver and hesitant to take off due to weather conditions in Saskatoon. The conditions were clear and dry, 5 hours removed from any rain. Other reviews from the people in Vancouver headed to Saskatoon were told they could not depart due to issues with the plane already in Saskatoon. This is a lie because there was no plane at the Saskatoon airport. A couple families let out cries when this flight was cancelled. Evidently they had been waiting since Thursday to fly back to Vancouver and this was their second cancellation with zero compensation. The big board showed a vast majority of flights taking off without issue. Adding fuel to the theory that Flair is peddling lies with their reasons for delay/cancellation. Is a negative star review possible?

### "recommend not flying through them"
Not Verified |  I was taking my flight home on Aug 12th and before I left the island (Nanaimo) to catch my ferry I received an email that my flight was 5 hours delayed and when I called to explain my situation and the guy on the other end told me I'm not enable to be compensated for their delay. I then proceeded to become the worst KAREN ever and then all of a sudden I was eligible for compensation for the 5 hour delay. Once me and my 2 daughters sat in the Vancouver Airport for a total of 9 hours for our flight at 2050 and arranged hotels and cars for the next day in Sasaktoon. We boarded the plane at the next delayed time which was 9110 which is not 6 hours so the air line knows they don't need to accommodate us before 6 hours. Once we boarded we sat on the plane for about 30-45 min again. The pilot was telling us he was waiting to hear from the air craft in Saskatoon before we can start to fly. We then were told to exit the plane and they will let us know when we will be able to get back on the plane. Not even 10 min later the announced the flight was canceled and they weren't not going to help anyone with hotels or vouchers and keep in mind there's little babies on the flight. I percent recommend not flying through them.

### "would not recommend this airline to anyone"
I would not recommend this airline to anyone who is travelling for the first time to Canada, even the people in Canada should avoid. Not only did they delay the flight by 8hrs but they justified it by lying straight to my face that I had been informed about the delay the day before the flight so that they cannot pay the fine for delaying my flight. I received no such mail or message regarding the matter.

### "Excellent experience"
Not Verified |  I've flown with Flair many times both pre- and post- covid. I've always found their cabin crews to be polite and friendly which was not always the case when I used to fly Air Canada years ago. Flair's prices are reasonable and I love the fact that they now fly out of Kitchener Waterloo so I can avoid Toronto entirely. My most recent flight was from Winnipeg to KW this past July. Excellent experience - flight arrived early. Captain Emily knows how to put her foot on the gas!

### "not recommend this airline"
Delayed multiple times. If I had known this I’d pay a little more for WestJet or Air Canada. This is a waste of time and money. Will not recommend this airline to anyone. Pay a little more for another airline.

### "zero interest in assisting"
Huge Caution to travellers thinking about booking with Flair Airlines. When you first Google it and research flights the prices seem reasonable. You know its a budget airline so that comes with some understanding before proceeding. Then every step of the way they will nickel, dime and dollar you out of your travel budget. In the end, my trip was $56 cheaper than Air Canada. I flew Kitchener-Waterloo to Vancouver and return. The return has been a nightmare. Granted the first mistake was mine. They had zero, and when I say zero I am being generous, zero interest in assisting me. From the moment I had an issue they either used the words "against our policy", Sorry Mr. Soucie", "We can't help you". In each step of the customer service process they wanted to charge me more despite my pre-purchase of their Flex Pack to allow for contingencies. So my caution to travellers considering Flair Airlines. Just know before you hit confirm that if, in your travels, you need help, that is not the business model they follow. Their business model is cash extraction at every turn and provide little to no value for any of that payment. They have lost a customer for life and anyone I can convince. I have flown a lot for business and pleasure in my lifetime. I have had many hiccups along the way, this is the only airline of any I have flown that simply chooses not to assist its patrons in a manner that befits its competition or industry. Flair Airlines is a poor choice. Choose another airline, Flair is not a partner in your travel plans.

### "You have to pay for carry"
Missing our flight because they left early. We did not try and ask for any compensation. However, we asked if we could switch our flight. Returning home a day early and wanted to charged $560. After being disrespected and talked to like a child we did not follow through. At the end of the day, this airline is complete garbage, they are no cheaper than other airlines. You have to pay for carry on plus luggage The seats are smaller and the service is a complete joke.

### "Affordable, on-time travel"
Affordable, on-time travel. Flair has helped me travel to see family I couldn’t see before. I have not experienced any significant delays while travelling with flair. I am not expecting much when I travel with them. I print my boarding pass online, I show up with just my personal item, use my nexus to pass through security and then I am boarding the flight in under 30 mins from showing up to the airport. Seats are fine, service is pleasant. Haven’t tried out their inflight app much but from what I can tell it’s something for you to use. I also like the lack of complimentary service on the flight as I’d rather just buy a bottle of coke at the airport before instead of a two sip glass from legacy carriers. Thanks for the cheap flights flair!

### "this was the last straw"
I've had bad experiences with this company but this was the last straw. I purchased the TravelFlex option so I could switch the flight if need be. I was in Ontario for a family emergency and wanted to stay 2 more days. The TravelFlex option wasn't appearing in the app or when I signed in. They told me it wasn't a problem. Well it was. Couldn't get through to the airline and ended up just staying with my booked flight because of that. Then I was told that my backpack had to be checked as carry on for close to $70. I had flown to Toronto with Flair the week before and it wasn't a problem on the original flight. The attendant was rude and mumbled she was only doing her job. I told her that the Flair agent in Vancouver told me the backpack was fine the week prior and I had nothing else in it. She ignored that completely. I've had problems with them in the past but this was the last time I will ever fly with Flair. They sent a thing wanting a review of my trip so I filled it out. I have heard nothing. Terrible airline.

### "I highly recommend Flair Airlines"
I had an incredible experience with Flair Airlines. The ticket price was fair, making it a budget-friendly choice. The crew was exceptionally nice and helpful, especially when my daughter was suffering from pressure in her ears during landing. Their service was fantastic, and they took great care of her. The plane was clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall pleasant journey. I highly recommend Flair Airlines for their excellent service and customer care.

### "feel robbed by this airline"
Here we go again. I think a 3 star overall is high. They charged me 78$ as personal item for a 2kg gift that I bought at the airport. It’s not about the money, but I feel robbed by this airline once again.

### "stating he needs an ETA visa to enter Canada"
We traveled from Waterloo to Mexico prepaid and checked in prior to departure to Cancun, no issues with boarding on 7/22/23. On 7/29/23 we arrive at Cancun airport 4 hours prior to our flight departing to Waterloo (3 US citizens,1 permanent US resident). We completed online check in, paid for our baggage fee $185 Canadian and obtained our boarding passes. We were the 10th people in line. They denied my husband entry on the aircraft stating he needs an ETA visa to enter Canada. I checked the Canadian ETA website and clearly states he does not need an ETA to travel to Canada by air. The Flair supervisor refused to acknowledge what the website stated. I completed the ETA online and received an email stating he does not need an ETA and issued a refund to my credit card. The staff refused to look at the email. Told me he didn't care how we were getting home with 2 children. We were forced to by new tickets from another airline to get home the following day. We arrived home on 7/30/23 at 10pm and had to drive to Waterloo from Buffalo NY to pick my vehicle with my husband. He entered Canada with his permanent residence card no problem. The Canadian border patrol agent told us that he did not need an ETA to fly into Canada and to dispute it, we arrive home at 4am. On 7/31/23 o call flair airlines customer service. I was told they cannot compensate me because we were marked as a no show for the flight. After sending all my proof that we were not a no show they said my husband didn't have proper documentation to board which was false. I sent them his documents to review and their response was he needed an ETA. They refused to see the response I received after applying for the ETA. The rep refused to let me talk to a supervisor after 45 minutes on the phone arguing she finally put me to a supervisor who did nothing.

### "Pathetic service, overly rude staff"
Pathetic service, overly rude staff. Ridiculous rules and even if the rules are followed to the T the overly extra vigilant staff who try to find a loop hole in the customers preparation to make money out of them. I hope Flair does not set bonuses depending on the money squeezed out of customers during boarding and check-in as the staff behaved that way.

### "flight crew was amazing"
Not Verified |  I was worried at first when I read the reviews but took the chance. The flight time was perfect and non stop from Nashville to Toronto. Price was reasonable enough to afford an upgrade to tue seat. I took a carry on only so checking in and boarding was super easy. Flight departed on time, flight crew was amazing, and arrived a little ahead of schedule. I will definitely try Flair Airlines again.

### "Overpriced and under-serviced"
Not Verified | Other than the fact the pilots were great as they safely flew and landed us. Thank you! Still an unbelievable price for a less than 3 hour flight with no screens/entertainment, (inflight wifi not connecting ) and above all very unprofessional stewardess’ with poor work ETHICS, poor manners, no respect for paying customers and seriously bad attitudes. Cared way more about how they look rather than focusing on the customers. Particularly the head stewardess. Was told would be offered complimentary snacks-nope. Thank goodness I could bring the $20 slices of pizza for my kids on board. Both had terrible attitudes and spent most of the flight behind the curtain socializing and gabbing with each other. Trying to close off access to the bathroom for the guests by constantly closing the curtain and staying behind it to just talk and not be attentive. What are you thinking? My kids even noticed “the stewardesses didn’t check our seat belts Mommy”. Yeah…. (We fly a lot) first time with Flair. Never again. What exactly am I paying almost $1000 per ticket for from TO to WPG? And to then deal with rude holier-than-though girls treating customers like this. And this was supposed to be a “cheap” flight? Only thing that was cheap was the caddy service and the airline offerings itself. Do your job for goodness sake. Pushing a cart for 2 minutes, reapplying your dripping lip gloss doesn’t encompass the entirety of your position. You chose this job. We didn’t choose you as our “customer service provider” for $1000. Have some respect, and act professional. Attitude & manners school would be of good use and upgrade. Overpriced and under-serviced.

### "one of the worst airlines out there"
This is one of the worst airlines out there. I booked flight from Toronto to Calgary, departure was with Delta and return was with Flair. Booking was done at the same time with both airlines from a third party website. Delta wrote it boldly that flight canelation comes with a fee. There was nothing during the booking process that suggested non-refundable on Flair even when I took my time to look out for it. I never book non-refundable flights. I had to cancel the flight because I found out I was supposed to book the flight to Edmonton and not Calgary. I canceled within one hour. Delta refunded my money without any charges. Flair  refused to issue a refund. I flew Flair airlines to Edmonton and it was a very terrible experience and they charged for every. They are scam. I or anyone I know will never fly this airline.

### "I didn't make it to the flight"
I booked at 6:30 PM for a flight at 7:55PM, with the idea to get to the airport in 30 mins and do check in online. Didn't expect the check in online was broken and not working, contacted them on my way and the chat representative kept saying they could check me in at the airport and there system was down. I explained might be too late to do it in person. So it was when I got to the airport there was none in the counter. Of course I didn't make it to the flight. I called this morning and explained everything to the rep, and that they shouldnt sell flight tickets that were impossible to check in, and she even start screaming at me that was my fault for booking a flight with such a short time, and that not being at the airport 3 hours before the flight as my fault. They are the most sketchy airline ever. Please avoid at all costs.

### "Disgusting customer service"
Don't get duped, even if the ticket is cheap, they are not really a low-cost company. We took the flight from Ottawa to Calgary with no problem with bags, but the same bag with less stuff inside were refused on the way back from Calgary. I paid even tho my baggage was ok just because an inch didn't fit. Other agents let people with the same bag as myself in without paying. Disgusting customer service - they don't even have a smile on their face.

### "Flair representative addressed all concerns"
Not Verified | Our flight was delayed but the Saskatoon airport Flair representative addressed all our concerns was attentive and was very friendly.

### "will never fly Flair again"
Not Verified |  Worse airline I have ever flown with. Charge for baggage checked ( expected but not $70.00) charge for carry-on $62, $5.00 for a warm bottle of water. Sold the seat I paid for to someone else, had to be moved. Flight attendants giggled and laughed through entire flight, like 10 year olds. Absolutely pathetic, will never fly Flair again.

### "more expensive than other airlines"
Terrible service! They may advertise their ticket slightly cheaper but rest assure they are going to charge you later at every single step from your carry on to the seat. To the point that it is going to be more expensive than other airlines. In addition the customer service is terrible, everyone I’ve dealt with was rude and helpless. I flew to Toronto with Swoop and not only it was cheaper than the original price for my return flight with flair, they did not charge any extra fees and the staff were nice unlike flair. This was my second experience as a visitor to canada with flair and every time I get more disappointed. If you respect your money and time DO NOT travel with this airline! Will never buy ticket from this airline ever again.

### "I will not recommend this airline"
On July 14, from Ottawa to Montreal, two passengers boarded the plane with 2 backpacks and a small handbag at no extra cost and without any problem but today July 23, returning to Ottawa from Winnipeg , the same two passengers with the same items (2 backpack and 1 handbag), I was charged $62 for the same items! Now 2 problems 1) Canada is a bilingual country. I can't speak English well and amazing French speaking person among Flair employees in Winnipeg. It's catastrophic. 2) why the same airline, but different rules in different cities. So why no fees on the way and yes on the way back?? And when I tried to explain in English about why no fee in Ottawa but $62 fee in Winnipeg with the same items, the manager threatened me if I keep arguing, she will charge me more!! It is a fraud to compensate for the cost of empty seats on the plane because half of the plane is without passengers and I ask you for the reimbursement of $62 that I paid for nothing! I am not happy at all with Flair and it was my first experience and I will not recommend this airline to my other friends! Le 14 juillet , de Ottawa à Montréal, deux passagers on est embarqué l’avion avec 2 sac à dos et un petit sac à main sans aucun frais supplémentaire et sans aucun problème mais aujourd’hui le 23 juillet, en revenant à Ottawa de Winnipeg, les mêmes deux passagers avec les mêmes items ( 2sac à dos et 1 sac à main) , on m’a chargé 62$ pour les mêmes items! Maintenant 2 problèmes 1) Canada , c’est un pays bilingue. Je peux pas bien parler anglais et étonnant personne francophone parmi les employés de Flair à Winnipeg!!! C’est catastrophique. 2) pourquoi le même airline , mais les différentes règles dans les différentes villes. Alors pourquoi pas de frais en allant et oui en revenant? Et quand j’ai essayé d’expliquer en anglais concernant pourquoi pas de frais à Ottawa mais 62$ de frais à Winnipeg avec les mêmes articles , la manager m’a menacé si je continue à disputer , elle va me recharger de plus ! ! C’est une fraude pour compenser le frais des sièges vides dans l’avion parce que la moitié de l’avion , c’est sans passagers et je vous demande le remboursement de 62$ que j’ai payé pour rien ! Je suis pas contente du tout avec Flair et c’était ma première expérience et je vais pas recommander cet airline à mes autres amis.

### "we had to sleep at the airport"
Not Verified | They charge me $60 for a very small suitcase it was smaller and lighter than backpack and one backpack is allowed but just because it had wheels they charged me for that and they charged me $15 to give a seat next to my daughter otherwise we had to seat separate (they do this to couples as well) and then we had 10 hours delay and we had to sleep at the airport because they issued the boarding pass and we couldn’t leave the airport and they compensated this nonsense by $10 voucher. I'll never ever fly with this stupid airline.

### "Really absurd and cunning people"
Not Verified | One of the worst airlines I have been. They pre-poned our afternoon 2:45pm ticket to early morning 6:30am without giving any intimation. They send only a web check-in link which doesn’t had any info of the updated flight timing. We woke up that day to find out that our flight departed early morning. When we contacted the customer care, they were initially reluctant to change and asked to contact GotoGate customer care. Really? Are they operating the flights or GotoGate? After a lot of chit-chat, they finally rebooked us for the same flight at 2:45pm which we originally booked for. Don’t even know the reason why they moved us from the flight. Clearly, they were trying to get people at higher rates at last min by cutting off some people. We did the web check-in with the latest booking but after all these, we were still confused if our latest boarding pass was valid and decided to check again at the airport. One executive told, the flight is delayed and otherwise its good. We checked with one more and she said it is on time, and the boarding pass is good. We checked with a third person and we insisted on scanning and confirming the seat no. to make sure. He was happy to scan the pass and check the seat no., and found out that we haven't checked in!! The he spent around 15 mins and helped us check-in and confirm all our seats. In the flight, when I asked for a cup of water, they said they sell only bottled items and don’t provide cups of water! Really absurd and cunning people trying to make money every way. And it was raining in Vancouver by the time we landed and we could see water drops entering through the window. No proper seating and poor aircraft! Be prepared to be vouched for each and everything for taking a flight ticket at a low price if you want to book Flair airlines! Only giving a 3 star because of the third executive as he really helped us.

### "never book with Flair in the future"
Not Verified |  
Booked our flights to Halifax two weeks in advance. Major storm in Nova Scotia caused severe flooding, power outages, roads washed out. Major disruption in around Halifax. Flight was still active however, you could go nowhere as a result of the storm. What personal risks would you be taking? Did not seem to matter one bit to the Flair Agent. Had to surrender 80% of the flight costs and receive a voucher for the balance to be used within 24 months. This disaster was not our fault however, Flair was only concerned with retaining our funds. Obviously the Federal Government continues to avoid adequate airline legislation to protect passengers. The voucher to the 20% will evaporate as we will never book with Flair in the future.

### "Poor customer service"
Poor customer service. They are eager to make money and not focused on guest relations. Almost trick you to pay for extra luggage, seat and etc. Rude agents and not helpful at all.

### "Horrible nightmare to deal with"
Not Verified |  Horrible nightmare to deal with. The flight F8857 on Sunday was canceled last minute and automatically re-booked to the next Friday, no way I could wait another 5 days so I was forced to book with westjet the same night for 5x the price. The email from flair says if this change doesn't work please re-book or cancel with a link provided, the correct reference number doesn't work and they said it has already been re-booked, which I know because it was done automatically. I'm directed to a useless chat bot. The support line cue is full and they just drop the call. Waited 3 hours with the online booking agent, they initiate a refund process still waiting days later. Flair still shows online the booking as active, it gives an option to cancel but would charge me more money to cancel than the tickets cost. Worst airline, full stop. You are not getting a deal, you are gambling.

### "a horrible experience all together"
Not Verified |  They get you with their cheap ticket prices but then you have to pay for any and every thing else you might need! And for a way higher rate than any other airlines. Our flight was late 40 mins also! If your personal item or carry on bag is even 1/2 " too big, they make you pay for it at the gate! Just a horrible experience all together.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service, they told me to get a cabin bag as a personal item bag, but I had a doubt and got a duffel bag which didn’t fit in their scale but it was less than 7kgs, and that’s what customer service team told me, that it doesn’t matter what kind of a bag you get but it should be upto 7 kgs which I made sure and my bag’s weight was 5.5kgs. At the time of check in they charged me $80 by saying that my duffel bag will be considered as a carry on bag, this is so frustrating that’s I had to pay for my personal item. And also at the time of check in the guy from flair airlines told me that you should check it online instead on calling at the customer service, why the hell you would even have a customer service if they can’t give me any kind of services.

### "they are absolutely horrible at customer service"
Not Verified |  Never ever fly Flair! Their tickets may be cheap but they are absolutely horrible at customer service! My mom came to visit, and as she is older with medical issues, she booked wheelchair assistance both ways. It took them 2 hours to get her from the plane to the baggage area when she arrived! And she ended walking part of the way because she was tired of waiting for the assistance! She was in the airport longer than she was in the air! Then going back, she checked in online, made it to check her bag in the appropriate time frame, but because again Flair did not take care of her wheelchair assistance properly, she actually missed her flight. Do you think they would even apologize or offer a rebook? Nope! But they sent her luggage on the plane! So after no help from any Flair/Pearson employee, we were able to get her on a later flight that day with Air Canada, who were absolutely amazing. She flew out from Billy Bishop and what a wonderful experience it was for her! Now Flair doesn't know where her luggage is and she has to wait until Thursday to get any help from them. I can't believe they were so rude and harsh to a 75yr old woman! I don't care about the price difference, I will only fly Air Canada out of Billy Bishop Airport! Flair Airlines and Pearson Airport are the most unaccommodating, rude and ignorant group I have ever heard of. All they do is blame the passengers or each other and do not take responsibility for their own actions!

### "2 out of 4 times they changed my prepaid seat"
I have been flying with Flair Air in the last months, on 2 out of 4 times they have changed my prepaid seat without any advice. I have a medical condition and even if I wouldn’t have it, they need to respect the seat that you paid for and no change for another of lowest price without a logic reason.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed, trying to get home to a family emergency but all three of us have to pay 160 dollars just to change our time. What's the point in having insurance if you can't use it for emergencies.

### "use Flair as the very very last resort"
I flew from Halifax to Montreal and then back 10 days later. The ticket price was ok but not super cheap as I had a carry-on and a checked bag (comparable with Porter). I had booked Flair because the timing of the flights was perfectly suited to my plans.The flight up was actually fine, so I was relieved. Sadly the trip back, on July 1, Canada day weekend, was a disaster. The flight was supposed to be Sat. at 7:10 pm. It was delayed to 8:00 pm then 9:00 pm then 12:25. I misunderstood the 12:25 to be just after midnight, then around 10pm I realized that it meant noon the next day. I didn't actually stay at the departure gate but was checking in periodically, I never saw a Flair employee nor was there an announcement, although I gather that somebody showed up briefly and announced the cancellation, then vanished. I had to ask Air Canada staff for help a couple of times- they did their best, but, of course, they didn't know what Flair was up to. I tried to find a hotel but there were no rooms anywhere, literally (called about 20), so I slept on the airport floor. I had also tried to get a seat on another airline but nothing was available. The next day, the flight was delayed again to 2:00 pm then 2:20 but we did finally get to Halifax. Saturday evening, when I needed information, no SMS updates came, for some reason they did start again on Sunday. Overall, though the staff is nice enough, though not very competent, and the planes are ok, I would only ever use Flair as the very very last resort (no buses or trains or real airlines available, for example.

### "Very happy with everything"
Very good. Very happy with everything. The app is easy to use for checking. Honestly, I was worried because of the reviews I read online but everything went very well.

### "the low price is a scam"
Not Verified |  I was going to Edmonton on an emergency to help my daughter who is sick and needed help. The Flair gate attendant for Flight F6437 departing 12.35 on July 7th, 2023 asked for carry-on baggage payment while on my itinerary there was no indication that a payment was required. Then she said I will call my supervisor but she didn't and left me at the gate until the plane took off. Then she came back said I can take you to my Supervisor now. I followed her to the check-in but the "Supervisor" told her she can leave before the issue gets more complicated. I warn you seriously the low price is a scam. Don't trust your lives with Flair Airline.

### "good experience"
Seats were okay, flight was fast, departed on time, if not early, and arrived early. Flight attendants were nice, and landing was okay. Overall good experience. Didn’t let me check in on my phone, but was able to be checked in on a computer in my home.

### "offered no explanation or solutions"
Absolute worst experience with traveling in my life. Flight was delayed for hours however, they had us on the tarmac for 3 hours not being able to take off. There was no air-conditioning and we were not offered water as they were out of reusable cups. We boarded and deplaned twice before eventually canceling the flight. There were no representatives anywhere to give instructions. We were on our own. No food vouchers, no hotel accommodations, no nothing. We literally were stranded at JFK airport, until a rescheduled flight at 2 pm the following day! Don't even mention that their customer service is based out of the Philippines. Long wait to speak to someone. They offered no explanation or solutions. It was a terrible ordeal and they have since offered no apology or compensation.

### "it's services sucks"
Not Verified |  Please don't book this flight ever. It's look cheap as compare to other flights but it's services sucks. We were coming from Toronto to Saskatoon and because of bad weather they landed in Winnipeg. Now they decided to going back to Toronto. I hate it.

### "happy with the overall experience"
I was happy with the overall experience. We left on time on the departure and return, the staff were very nice, the price was reasonable and both flights were smooth. There was no in flight entertainment but I didn’t care about that. It is so nice to have a direct flight out of London!

### "it turns out to be very expensive"
Worst flight experience of my life. From the service at the airport to the boarding, you are angry. The airline sells cheaper tickets but manages to charge 90% of passengers for luggage. They even complain about the size of a personal document bag. They measure and weigh your bag at check-in and at the boarding gate, they walk around looking at backpacks and handbags and barring several passengers who are forced to pay for the bag to board. I've never seen that anywhere and on any company I've flown. When I went to check in online I had a problem because my reservation contained 2 passengers, but when adding hand luggage (charged) the system only allowed me to add one and not one per passenger. So when I arrived at the airport, I explained the situation to the counter attendant and she super arrogantly told me that the system is very simple and clear and that she monitors all its operation, making it understood that I did not have the capacity to do what I needed. In the end it turns out to be very expensive.

### "by far the worst company"
We went to the airport on time. We then were notified there was a delay of 2 hours, which is expected, so we waited. Then it was 2 more hours, then 2 more on and on until it was 13 hours later we were boarded, to a completely different plane due to a missing fuel cap of some sort. First off, we weren't notified of this issue previous to our arrival, or had we been told there was going to be a 13 hour delay, we would have gone home and come back. But Flair decided to take us and everyone on the plane on a roller coaster, where a few people lost temper and started yelling and screaming. We were given some vouchers, which not worked, so we had to spend out of pocket to sustain us. After getting to our destination, we tried following through as the Canadian standards demands airlines to honour a compensation. We were told this delay wasn't applicable although it was within the airlines control but a "safety matter. We have since followed up with CTA. I can easily say Flair Airlines is by far the worst company we have ever had to deal with.

### "worst service in my life"
Not Verified |  Flair airline was the worst service in my life, the customer service inside airplane and front desk unprofessional and not respecting passenger, I have to pay additional $35 to seating next to my wife, even was empty seat, they charge a glass water to take my medicine, they charge for everything.

### "cheap but poor service"
For the first time I’ve used the Flair to travel to Vancouver from Calgary, and from Vancouver to Calgary, and from Calgary to Kitchener and Kitchener to Calgary. I never had this experience before in my life the worst experience ever I got. We were travelling for 4 hours they didn’t even offer us a glass of water all you need to buy and expensive too. The customer service was very worse and the flight attendant had no manner. At the Kitchener airport I was very disappointed of the customer service’s behaviour. All I want to say is to travel with Flair is not a good idea. It’s cheap but poor service. Not happy at all.

### "flight left 50 min"
Not Verified | The flight left 50 min. Early and I now have to pay for another ticket home. Absolutely absurd. Avoid this airline at all cost. As I called home to inform my status the departure time still hadn't arrived and the plane was in the air. Unbelievable. Not a trustworthy company

### "Not a relaxing flight"
Flight attendants in the back were very obnoxious, talking very loud and laughing the whole entire flight. Even heard them using inappropriate language, very immature and unprofessional. Not a relaxing flight when you’re tired

### "quite disappointed in the plane"
I was unable to check in on-line and had to spend over 2 hours on a chat with a flair rep to try to resolve the problem, which was never resolved. The flight was supposed to take off at 235 pm, however before i left for the airport I checked the flair website which said the flight was on time, and i checked flightaware which showed that the flight was not leaving until 437 in the afternoon. My wife and i arrived at the airport and checked in with a very nice friendly and courteous young lady. During the check-in process i was asked to out each of my suitcases on the scale and then take them back because the luggage had to be brought by us to a special luggage drop area at the far end of the terminal. All of sudden we hear a man yelling at us to put our suitcases on the scale. The agent explained that we had already done that, but the man who identified himself as the Manager stated that he had not personally seen us put the luggage on the scale. I asked the man his name and position but he refused to allow me to see his ID. I asked the agent if the plane was going to be on time and she double checked all of her sources and she assured me the plane was on time. After over an hour waiting in the customs line, it was already 155pm so we were able to board the plane immediately. before i boarded i asked the gate agent if the plane was on time. She insisted the plane was leaving on time. I check the flair website and it still said on time and the flightaware website still said the plane was not leaving for another 2 hours and 37 minutes. The plane left the gate just a few minutes late, but then sat on the taxiway over 2 hours before takeoff. When we landed after 7PM, I received a text message from Flair that was sent at 411 PM stating that there would be a delay in the flight. I was quite disappointed in the plane itself, as on our first flight from FLL to YYZ there was a lot of advertising about the wifi and entertainment system. Unfortunately, on the first flight the wifi and entertainment system was broken, but in this return flight there was no system at all. Once on the plane, my wife was in the window seat of an exit row. There was a man directly opposite my wife at the window seat. It seems that the behavior of my wife and this man were very similar, but the flight attendant kept coming over to my wife to correct her behavior, but ignored the man who was doing the exact same thing. My wife's crime was using the tray table during the 2 hour period we sat on the plane before it took off, and for not wearing her sweater properly (storing it around her waist).

### "They charge for carry on"
They charge for carry on. Their staff in YVR do not know what customer service is. In flight entertainment doesn’t work. If you think you’re getting the cheapest flight, you’re not. Westjet and Air Canada aren’t the best but at least they have common decency and don’t charge for the most basic things. Make sure to at least check in in advance. When I arrived to the airport, their lines were insane. I can’t event imagine having to wait in them if I didn’t check in in advance. I am excited to see this airline crash and burn to the ground. If I could give this airline a 0, I would.

### "You're better off walking to your destination"
Horrible airline/experience. I flew from Halifax to Toronto in mid-June 2023. I booked this ticket on May 3, 2023. I selected my seats (which you have to pay to do), and paid a stupid amount of money for checked bags even though I only brought a carry on, as that was the only real option available. Flight was originally booked for morning but they told me a week in advance that it moved to evening. Fine. Then on the day of my flight, they emailed to give me 3 hours notice that my flight had been moved from 10.45pm to 11am. I was able to rebook thankfully, as that last minute change would have impacted other plans (tickets purchased) for events that day and I wouldn't have been able to even make it to the airport in time. Then later on the day of my flight, they delayed it 5 times for "controllable issues". I had to rebook my seats, and then on the plane, Flair had booked 3 other passengers to my same seat but we paid for this? I was originally supposed to fly out on June 19 at 10.45pm, and ended up flying out on June 20 at 03.05am. I was scheduled to work June 20 but had to use/waste a sick day due to this last minute delay. I had to (last minute) extend the pet care we hired. I had to rebook the taxi arrangements from the airport to my home. No real context for delay, just had to keep checking my email for yet another delay message. And then upon landing, we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for 30 mins because they "weren't ready for us".... why? They had nearly 5 hours to prepare. Here's a $10 food voucher for the troubles" but you're getting to the airport at 1am so nothing is open to redeem it at. Would be a 0/10 if possible. You're better off walking to your destination.

### "Choose a different airline"
Luckily WestJet had a flight the same night so I could get to my destination. The online system was unavailable, the agent could not speak English very well at the airport and no one would answer a phone call for help. Choose a different airline if your time is valuable and you don't want to miss a day catching another flight.

### "First and last time"
Worst experience ever! Paid for upgraded seats and discovered that 3 other people had paid for and been assigned the same seats. On our return we were booked to leave Halifax at 4 p.m. A friend happened to call us at 9 a.m. to say they had received an email saying that our flight had changed to 11 a.m. We had a mad dash back home, grabbed our suitcases and flew way above the speed limit to get to the airport on time. Also had to return a rental car and then run to the gate. Too much for a 68 yr old! Imagine too, not even a coffee, tea or water was offered, except for sale. Never fly Flair again! First and last time.

### "First and last time flying Flair"
Needed to change the birthdate on a reservation. According to the flair website, this is free. Call the flair reservation number to make the change and they demand 400 dollars to issue a new ticket. Then hang up on me. Call back, ask why it’s 400 dollars when the website lists a new flight for only 28 dollars, and am told now it’s 800 dollars or I won’t be allowed to board. After reading off the applicable section of the tariff, the agent asks for all of my booking information to be sent to a gmail account (not Flair? ), and after asking why there isn’t at least an official flair email address, the agent hangs up again. I could of course change the birthdate myself using the online system, but it’s down (not pulling up the page where you can edit things yourself). First and last time flying Flair.

### "do not attempt to fly with Flair!"
Zero customer service. I attempted to book a flight for 2 online, but the seat selection step was charging me $80 per person even when I selected the no-charge option. I tried multiple times and even started over, and each time got the same result. I also couldn't add the baggage bundle for just 1 passenger for some reason. So I called Flair to make the reservation. The person who booked my flight did an ok job, and emailed my reservation document to me. When I reviewed it, I saw that she only added the baggage bundle for 1 way of my return flight. I also noticed that there was a "call centre" fee for calling to book. Sorry, I wasn't calling because I couldn't be bothered to book for myself - the website was not functioning properly. On the reservation document, there was no indication of how/where to pay for the flights, and no indication that the reservation would expire at any time. I emailed 3 days ago asking for a link or some instruction on where I can pay for my flights, but no response thus far. So this morning I went online and used the chat option on their website. This is when I discovered that my reservation was cancelled for "delay in payment". What delay? There was no indication anywhere (and I have gone through my reservation document with a keen eye) of any kind of payment deadline or that the reservation would be cancelled at some point in time. Now my only option is to re-book, and the price has more than doubled. I can't believe they operate in this way - do not attempt to fly with Flair!

### "a farce of an airline"
This airline is such a scam! They charge for carry on luggage and the check I fee is far more than other airlines. They charged me $85 to check in my average, low weight luggage than AFTER I pay the agreed amount, I got an email receipt for much higher than the bill. They added on a $35.00 "AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT" fee with out my approval or consent. There was ZERO service on the flight, not even water because they claim the wifi was down. They don't even have seat pockets to hold your belongings. Ive been on hundreds of flights and this experience was by far the WORST! What a farce of an airline.

### "Customer service isn't there"
The condition of their aircraft is embarrassing. Trim falling out, seats stained and absolutely filthy, cracked windows, the list goes on. If they think these conditions are acceptable even for an ULCC (it's not btw) then I'm worried what corners they cut behind the scenes. Secondly, their staff is terrible. As many have noted before they'll charge you $25 per person to check-in at the airport, no problem for most, but an unfair policy that makes them a good penny I'm sure. I had asked one of the agents at the entry of check-in, where I was to be going if I have already checked-in online, she proceeded to tell me to go in the same line with everyone else to get a tag put on my carry-on. Nice scam to get me a $25 fee. After I refused, she finally pointed to the security entry. But again at the gate while waiting to board another agent walks up to me and asks me to go up to the counter, I asked why for to which she told me for my carry-on, but this time they wanted me to check my bag as the flight is full. I'm sorry? Don't they sell carry-on's as an add-on? Shouldn't they know if they'll have room in the plane? Again another sign of greed, and poor management. The agent very rudely asked to see my boarding pass, as I wanted to keep my carry-on with me, if I wanted to check my baggage then I would've, obviously. I was given my green tag for my carry-on in the end, a useless policy, in which btw on my trip from Calgary to Toronto also on Flair, nobody gave me a green tag for my carry-on, so this was all a surprise for me coming home. I wish it ended there but unfortunately Flair does actually suck as bad as many say. They double booked my seat, how that's possible is beyond me, clearly an actual agent messed up, because I paid for my ticket which included my seat selection May 28th, and flew June 11th I had paid for seat 2F (1st row on the Max-8) but yet sure enough another passenger had seat 2F but instead of it being handled properly I got yelled at and told I wouldn't be flying today if I didn't move, whoever that gate agent was needs to be fired, they mess up and treat the passengers like that? I had my email proof showing I had paid for my seat well before check-in and yet they told me to move back to 14F. I refused to which point the pilot got involved after the flight attendants got him because of the gate agents behavior towards me. Once I showed my proof of purchase showing my name on seat 2F he told the other passenger to please move back to the other seat, which she did because after 10 minutes we all just wanted to get home. Customer service isn't there, cleanliness isn't there, urgency isn't there, do not fly with Flair. It's not worth the pennies you end up saving after you pay for the upgrades. Soon they'll charge you for the seatbelt.

### "not worth the savings"
Avoid this airline. It is not worth the "savings" because they will make it back off of you by scamming you out of money with a huge amount of hidden costs. How do you ask? Well first, you must check in online or you will be charged $25 per person to check in at the airport. Their website does not allow you to check in online. We tried to pay for seats ahead of time at a cost of $17 per person. Again the website did not allow us to check in and pay for seats at the same time. We were able to check in online but the system assigned us seats at the opposite sides of the plane. We were unable to select seats online after checking in on their terrible website (option to do so was literally grayed out). We called the Flair call centre to choose seats and they tried to charge us a service fee of $35 per person plus $25 per person to choose a seat ahead of time because we were not selecting seats online. Despite informing the customer service agent that the website would not allow us to change seats, he refused to waive the fee. One "personal item" is free to bring on the plane but a "carry on" is ~$75. A personal item is about the size of a laptop. The service on the plane is terrible. They will try to sell you any sort of refreshments and when you ask for water they will give you a water bottle and tell you it costs $4. You have to ask for a cup of water and good luck getting a refill. The seats on the plane do not recline at all and there is no seat pocket to store your phone or wallet. There are no charging points on the plane so good luck trying to get work done. You need to use their app for onboard entertainment and the selection is terrible so you are left twiddling your thumbs and staring at the seat in front of you questioning why you spent money with this terrible airline, allowing them to continue to spread their misery to other people.

### "extremely disappointed"
I have had nothing but issues trying this airline for the first time. When I check in we had to purchase 2 carryon bags for the trip and was only able to do one at check-in and the other at the airport. Secondly with the aircraft less than 1/2 full it split out group of three up in different rows only to force us to purchase more expensive seats to sit together. This is ethically wrong. If there are seats together the system should have placed us together. This is nothing more than a forced money extortion. Even at the terminal the were so many seat available for my wife and I to sit together and at the end the personal refused to help us with out charging us further. I am extremely disappointed with the overall service.

### "never choose this airline again"
Not Verified |  This is my first time review for an airline company after my terrible experience with their customer service. Flair Airline refused my request to refund my money when I had mistake checking online. I’m only have 1 check in bag and they were showing up my total amount $82 need to pay but I don’t know why after I check out with my credit card, I saw they charged me 2 check in bag and when I asked for refund they refused to do that. They told me that they cannot refund my money for the second one. I’m okay with that only few dollars but I felt so terrible with the answer. I will never choose this airline again. Cheap price but bad service. Thanks

### "I was not given my seat"
Not Verified |  I tried to check in and the system charged me but didn’t reserve my seat or record my carry on luggage. The person in chat had me send a copy of the charge from my credit card company and then told me it wasn’t proof they charged me? After wasting another hour on the phone I still had to call the next day to finalize it I paid again for myself and my daughter and as I sit in the flight I was not given my seat nor  my daughter. I paid three times for something I didn’t get and Flair disputing it.

### "upset, disappointed"
We were a family of 6 planning to travel from Abbotsford to Toronto - 2 adults, 1 infant, 1 kid and 2 seniors. We did an online check in and got a prompt that boarding passes will be sent via email. We assumed that the boarding passes will be sent to our emails as promised and proceeded to Airport. We took 2 cabs to airport, I along with kids and one senior were in one cab and my husband with another senior was in an other cab. Our can reached airport on time (We were 4 mins before the closing time). My husband reached 9 mins after. The staff at the check in counter said we made it on time and looked at our id’s and asked if we did an online check in and we said yes. She later just guided us to the boarding gate without providing a boarding pass. Since we had actually done our web check in and even when staff members verified us, we went to boarding gate. But the staff at boarding gate refused to allow us as we did not have boarding passes. We tried explaining that airlines did not give us any, they asked us to contact airline customer service. By the time we could reach the customer service and the verification process the gates were closed. We later demanded the ground staff at check in counter asking why she did not issue us a boarding pass, her answer was we did not ask them. What is the whole point of check in then? we stood in the line, gave her our id’s and went to boarding because she asked us to. Later customer service says that we did not get boarding passes from online check in because of technical error on there side. Now they say nothing can be done because we missed our flight. But we made it on time and did a web check in but still they refused to let us on the flight because of Airlines technical error and inefficiency of the ground staff who failed to give us boarding passes because we did web check in. People who came after us we’re allowed to go because there was no technical error and they got their boarding passes via email. Is Airlines technical error our mistake? why did they not allow us board the flight? we stood there confused not understanding what was happening around us. (Not to mention kids and seniors.) We lost money on 5 tickets and 2 extra baggage fee. We had pay for uber gain to return home and had to pay premium price for next flight to Toronto which is on next day. We are upset, disappointed, feels like we were played and cheated on.

### "fly with minimal luggage"
I recently flew with Flair from Edmonton to Toronto. I have flown with Flair 4 or 5 times now on similar routes across the country. If you can fly with minimal luggage, ie. smaller than a full size carryon bag and you value saving money over pretty much everything else in the air travel experience than Flair can be great. They offer budget flight costs and deliver reliable budget flight experiences. If you need to carry luggage and/or you want any amenities at all you are going to end up paying more or being disappointed. I would recommend shopping around as I have had flights with West Jet and Air Canada that were as cheap or close to a Flair flight. You'll get a much better travel experience with those airlines. That said I will fly Flair again when their fares are significantly lower than the major airline options. Staff has been friendly and professional - planes are clean - flights have been mostly on schedule - cheap fares Cabins are cramped and older styles - service/amenities are limited or absent - you'll pay for anything extra you want including a carry on bag

### "Flair airlines is a rip off"
Not Verified |  Flair airlines is a rip off. Carry on bags allowable are smaller than other airlines. So you show up with regulation and you are charged $69 dollars. You can still carry it on the plane but it’s for $69. Even if you ok for two people the computer doesn’t sit you together so you have to pay. The minimum is $10 dollars each with normal being around $35 each. So I could transfer next to my boyfriend we both had to pay. A discount airline is correct. They charge for everything. So you have to pay $3.50 for a pop the same for water and there is no bar service. The pop and water are room temperature no ice or glass. Basically this is a scam airline. We ended up with almost two hundred in extra charges. Fly westjet or another airline !

### "You get what you pay for"
You get what you pay for. The tickets were cheap but it was not worth the savings to be honest. Pre-paid seat selection did not work out and when I called for a refund they did not believe me. I am really unhappy. For those booking, note the seats don’t recline, nothing is included on the flight not even water.

### "They commonly cancel flights"
Not Verified |  I would not advise anyone with strict timelines to not book with Flair Airlines. They commonly cancel flights and their routes are very limited and they don't have any partnerships with other airlines so your option for re-booking when they do (and they often do) cancel a flight are never good. As an example, I was flying from Saskatoon to Toronto and they cancelled the flight an hour before it was meant to depart. The only option they gave me was to re-book on the same flight 7-days later. I couldn't wait the 7-days so I was forced to book a last-minute ticket with a different airline. If you don't have strict timelines and are willing to risk it to save a bit of money, you'll be fine. But if not, you should book with a larger, more reliable airline. Also, this airline doesn't really have a customer service function. If you email their INFO line they do not respond to you. And their desks at the airports do not have real processes for any kind of resolution you'd need. As an example, when my Saskatoon to Toronto flight was cancelled the Flair representative was taking people's names and contact info down on a piece of loose leaf paper.

### "seat option purchase limitations"
Not Verified |  I flew in on the 7:20pm from Calgary to Kelowna on May 26 2023. Crew and flight were fine. My issue is with Flair online seat option purchase limitations and the dangerous precedent it sets. I was seated in 1C and 1A was occupied. Just before take off a passenger entered and took 1B, the middle seat in the row I was seated at. This man was big. Very big. I am talking 6'3", at least 300lbs and very broad in the shoulders. I was forced to spent the entire flight, with my spine to my shoulder, entirely in the aisle runway. Even the flight crew could fathom how uncomfortable and dangerous this was. My neck was tilted and held at an S-curve angle the entire time, cart service would have been impossible, passengers had to shift sideways to use the front toilet. Plus sized customers need to be given the option to purchase a second seat online while they complete their booking. If they choose not to, and they don't meet the size requirements at the gate they are sent back to purchase their 2nd seat. This gentleman chose to pay an additional $40 for the front seat and could have bought a second seat anywhere else on the aircraft, costing him nothing more for the second seat. But he did not have an option to do so online and no motivation either. With people getting bigger and seats getting smaller this requirement is bound to happen. Flair might as well take credit and lead the way.

### "130 dollars for carry on baggage"
Horrible service, can’t believe how rude and Ignorant the lady was at gate A20 in Calgary. We paid for our tickets for round trip including baggage. We got charged another 130 dollars for carry on baggage again. We tried to show the lady our booking reference and she refused to listen and basically told us to shut up and pay or leave the carry on bags. I will never recommend flying with Flair airlines. It was first and will definitely be our last using this airlines. I can now see why there are so many negative reviews.

### "a stress free flight"
This airline was great for my return trip from Toronto to Edmonton in 2023. The flight left on time. The staff were helpful and friendly. There was no waiting on the tarmac to leave the place. I was allowed to board last cuz I’m a bit claustrophobic. Inexpensive ticket price. Staff were so nice! I bought a coffee for about $3 and it was fine! Thank you Flair for a stress free flight and on time.

### "Absolutely Terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely Terrible. On my way to Montreal I was not changed a carry on fee, but on the way back at the gate they charged me $85. When I said I wasn't changed on the way there the attendant rudely replied "Well if you don't pay you're not getting on". This is after I paid to upgrade. They seated me in-between two toddlers which the flight attendants allowed to run around the aircraft, knock on the pilots cabin door several times, also allowed them to climb all over me even though I asked both the parents and the flight attendants to please stop allowed them to run wild like this. It is an aircraft, not a daycare. I fly several times a year and usually go with United or Air Canada. This time I thought I'd try to "save" a couple dollars by flying this airline but when all was said and done with these stupid carry on bag fees, which I have never been charged for a backpack before for ANY other airline, it worked out to be the same as any other airline. Save the headache and go for a different airline. Also the app never works. Take some of the money form those bogus and predatory bag fees and use it to hire a competent app development company.

### "disappointed with the service"
Front counter staff was so rude and charged $88 each for mine and my mother’s personal bag. I flew with Lynx  from Vancouver to Winnipeg they didn’t charge me single penny for the same personal bag. I am very disappointed with the service never gonna fly with this airline.

### "very excellent service"
Thank you Sheena from Flair Airlines for assisting me and my mother in law during check in. Very friendly, accommodating and excellent service. I will definitely recommend Flair for the very excellent service.

### "Really rude staff"
Not Verified | Really rude staff, have no idea what they're doing. Demanded $150 for a bag I already paid for. Waste of time and energy. They have cheap tickets but they demand more money for bags and everything.

### "do not know what they are doing"
My parents were to fly around 8:45 to Vancouver from Calgary on a one hour flight. They were going along with my Aunt to a funeral. Only reason we booked them is due to a WestJet strike. All 3 in their 70's. Flair cancelled it and gave no hotel. Minimal for vouchers. Made them wait til 6 pm for another flight. Then again for 11:30 pm and then for 2:50 am. After the third cancellation, my parents and aunt ended up cancelling and we're lucky to get a flight thru WestJet. Their strike ended earlier in the day. Thank God. Avoid Flair. They do not know what they are doing.

### "only refunding me partial"
Not Verified |  Flair Airlines has cancelled on my trip 2 times now, completely made my plans a mess and when I went to get a refund because their most recent cancellation was both my flights for the same day, 45 mins apart from each other and for different cities. They are only refunding me partial. I couldn't get a straight answer from the rep on the phone so I asked to speak with manager, the told me they are busy. I continued to try and understand why wasn't being fully refunded for their cancellations and her answer kept being "its our policy" I told her I would wait for a manager and she told me she's "ending the call" and hung up on me. I am in complete shock on how flair handles their business and would never trust them ever again. This was a complete nightmare and their customer service is zero, they don't have any. I am being partially refunded for a flight that was cancelled by flair 2 times! Flair will not last long, they really don't know what they are doing.

### "behavior was so abrasive, rude and abusive"
Not Verified |  After being told that our 2 bags of chips and cashews would be fine to take on the plane by the first check in attendant, while trying to go through the last check in at the terminal, we were told that we would have to pay the carry on fee. My husband then proceeded to pack the snack items in his personal item and was yelled at and harassed in front of the remaining passengers telling him that was not acceptable to put the items in his personal bag when there was plenty of space for them. We left the snacks behind and made our way down the ramp when she then followed my husband yelling forcing him to apologize for his behavior in order for us to board. Her behavior was so abrasive, rude and abusive, I have never experienced that before in all my years of flying. She was so focused on our snacks, that she didn't check my husband's boarding pass and passport delaying take-off as they had to ensure he was on the plane. Great start to the morning!

### "I was little bit late"
I had to fly from Toronto to Winnipeg . It took so much time in security checking. I was ready to travel with my 2 years daughter. I reached to gate with my daughter and two bag packs. I was little bit late. One more person came to gate just few seconds before me. They allowed him to board in. But not us. They said only one person can go further. They checked his photo ID and let him to board to plane while we were also standing there. Staff was very rude. am not choosing it again. It was very bad experience .

### "Clearly they don't need customers"
I flew to Toronto form Montreal with Flair on March 10th 2023 and upon arrival in Toronto I realized that my suitcase did not arrive with me. I was told that it was left in Montreal and that I may receive it by March 12th. Now I was in town only form 10-13 for a Wedding. Obviously I did not receive my suitcase while I was in Toronto so I had to purchase new closes to wear to this wedding. My suitcase was only found and returned to me on Mar 23th. I was told to contact them if anything was missing from my suitcase as well as to be reimbursed for the clothes that I had to purchase. I emailed them on March 29th providing all the details of what happened as well as my receipts. They responded with a generic message asking me to describe what my suitcase looked liked (they clearly didn't even read my email since I already told them that I now had my suitcase). I have been emailing them back and forth since then and every time I do I get a new person asking me to describe what my suitcase looks like. I have yet to receive an email from someone who has any kind of customer service training or experience. It's been two weeks since they bothered to respond to my last email. Clearly they don't need any customers. I will never fly with Flair Airlines again even if it was for free.

### "We never use them again"
Not Verified |  This the issue for all small airlines. No customer service at all. Their prices are low but at the end will be same as expensive airlines since they are adding everything with cost. We had a flight at 6AM from Vancouver to Toronto. We purchased 2 checked bag for $170 and we arrived couple of minutes la the for check bag drop off and due to shuttle bus delay and waiting line. They told us we cannot go however my wife and my daughter could go since we still had time to board but they did not offer us and they did not even allow us to take the flight and send our luggage later. The staff did not know anything and they asked to talk with customer service which was close till 8AM. We asked to rebook and they said we should pay double of amount of original ticket and also pay again for luggage. That was insane. No help at all. We never use them again.

### "The customer service is awful"
Not Verified |  My luggage was lost for 4 days, no communication from airlines in spite of numerous emails. Finally got the damaged Bag and have had nothing but 2 to 3 months of automated replies asking for forms that they have already acknowledged receiving in previous emails and nothing else. The customer service is awful

### "until now, no refund"
They encouraged online check-in as they charge $25 for airport check-in. So I paid for baggage fees (check-in & carry on) and seat selection fees during online check-in on December 21, 2022 at 3:19 pm. I paid $134.40 for baggage & $21.00 for seat charges. I was charged through my credit card. Immediately upon payment through my credit card, they immediately issued me my boarding passes. But the flight was cancelled at 12:41am of December 22, 2022. It was scheduled at 7:00am. They refunded my $618.02 travel fare (which was paid on November 29, 2022) on December 23, 2022. But they never refunded the $155.40 baggage & seat selection charges. However, when I complaint to Better Business Bureau on January 2023 Flair Airlines promised to refund the $15540 to be paid on March 23, 2023. Previous to these, 2 agents had assured me that I would be refunded but I never was. I was never refunded as promised by and it's now 6 months after my cancelled flight. I have exchanged emails with about 2 dozen different agents saying so many different things in about 100 emails or more but until now, no refund. Flair Airlines is not only the worst airline, it scams and defrauds customers of their money.

### "don't care about their passengers' time"
I agree with one of the reviews. They don't care about their passengers' time. Our flight was delayed for more than 5 hours. They said it was for passengers' safety, they need to do maintenance. That's a lie, probably, there flight is not full so they moved it to a later time. We need to go to Toronto just for 3 days, that's why we got the latest flight so we'll get to Toronto by 1am the next day. Take a few hours rest then start our day. But because of this, our tight schedule is even tighter now. Their website said that you'll be compensated for the meal or hotel accommodations but when I try to fill out their compensation form, there's no option for it, just rebook or refund. I was hoping to atleast get a nice hotel room while waiting for more than 5 hours so we can rest comfortably and near the airport. Their checked baggage is so expensive as well as their hand carry.

### "asked to pay for a carry on luggage"
Not Verified |  Flair airline is a total rip off. There are way too many underlying and undisclosed cost. I have travelled to many countries around the world and this is the first time I have been asked to pay for a carry on luggage. On top of that, I had to pay an extra $10 just to be check into an economy seat. I will never recommend this airline to anyone ever and would suggest looking for an alternative airline for future flights.

### "hassle to their customers"
Extremely slow at response & will not answer when you need the most. Despite having purchased their travelflex, they did not allow me to modify my trip online & didn’t answer my 20+ calls. After which, unfortunately I had to abandon my flight and book a new one. I had to pay from my own pocket, although it was entirely their fault. Their phone lines were dead, messages not working, website not working - on the day I had to modify my booking. This was definitely not something which I paid for or was expecting. To add more dissatisfaction, when I raised a complaint afterwards, their response time is extremely slow and from last 12 days I’m trying to reach for the status on my complaint but nobody would care to update. All in all, poor service and hassle to their customers. Will not book again and suggest others strongly NOT TO BOOK.

### "Flair Airlines is the worst"
Not Verified |  Been on multiple types of planes/airlines and Flair Airlines is the worst one by far. Do not buy flair air tickets. Their customer service is nonexistent and the website said that flight was delayed until 9:30pm when the original time was 6:30pm and when confronted about it, they called it a glitch. Overall, worst airline I’ve been on in my whole life. Refused to let us on the plane.

### "We were a bit late"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight at 6:00 am and had checked-in online the day before. We were a bit late since several security lines were closed at the airport. Thus, we arrived at the boarding gate at 5:50 am and according to the tickets the gates were closed at 5:45 am. No one was at the gate and the door was locked. The customer service starts working at 7:00 am so we could not contact them! At 5:55 someone came out of the gate and the plane was backing 5 minutes sooner than the scheduled time. She was not helpful at all and asked us to check the website, etc. The customer service did not accept our argument and we forced to scheduled another flight late in the evening with double rate for the tickets into another airport in Ontario. It is funny because we see some passengers entered the plane even 15 minutes after the posted boarding deadline in the next two flights we had with Flair Airlines. So, they definitely have double standards and will be happy if you miss your flight. This was our first and the last flight with Flair Airlines. Don't waste your money flying with such airline.

### "prices posted are a big trap"
Not Verified |  The prices posted are a big trap. You will pay even more than WestJet & Air Canada. They will charge you carry on bags (from 30-60$) if you buy online. If you buy at counters, you will be charged 20$ more. They purposely block you login their website to buy carryon bags online at airport. They charge pretty much everything: you have to pay seat fees, drinking fees, etc. You would feel you are treated like a loser.

### "they don’t care for your time"
Not Verified |  Worst airline in the world, changed flight time 4 times in a day after even being checked in at the airport. The regular time is 21.20pm but up to 11.50 nobody informed us about the flight time. In the end at 1am they said the flight was cancelled. Came to the airport at 7pm and from that time to 1am, a total of 6 hours they don’t care for your time.

### "Worst airline ever"
I booked a seat by the exit door after being boarded i was approached & told i couldn't be there because i carried a cane in my overhead storage, they said i had to move. So they said they had a seat at the front with the extra leg room i moved there & the seating was so tight i was uncomfortable. Then they said they had a seat with 3 open spots that i could sit in which i was good with, they moved my stuff . The next thing i know the head flight attendant come & accused me of calling one of the attendants a name (which i said i never did) next thing she says i did & i was to leave the plane i was left stranded without my clothes, medication & no place to go no place to stay. I had to purchase another ticket to get home. Worst airline ever, will never use them again, and when i did get back i had to wait for over half an hr to get my luggage.

### "little chance for long-term success"
Not Verified |  I spent an hour trying to get a seat reservation, after I inadvertently only reserved one. I was unable to do it. When I asked that the $11.00 I paid for the one I had reserved to be refunded (I didn't need a seat reservation if my wife couldn't sit with me), I was told that the computer doesn't enable a cancellation of a seat. I also paid $78.00 for a carry-on, and during the conversation with the 'Ambassador' (customer service rep), was told that the cost for a carry-on was $57.00. So there is no consistency in charges. The online check-in site is very difficult to use, and if you make a mistake (as I did by only reserving one seat), after you pay, you can't go back to make any changes. Also, it seems that the 'Ambassadors' are dealing with several customers at the same time. There are long delays between the most simple of questions ("can I reserve a seat") and the response ("can I have your name, reservation number, date of birth and phone number'). I heard that Flair has sold some planes because the company is in a bad financial position. If a company can't provide its customers with the most basic services (reserving a seat) in a timely manner (less than an hour! ), there is little chance for long-term success.

### "The service is terrible"
We had a terrible experience with this airline on 1st of April, 2023. No doubt this is the worst airline on the planet. The service is terrible. The service girls at the gate were rude, cold, and providing no service at all. They apparently haven't got proper training for the job. The airline was just a joke. They didn't even try to provide any kind of service to help us out but simply told us to call the 833-711-2333 customer service number and we called but were listening to the music forever. We experienced the same poor service at the check-in counter. There were about 3 or 4 counters open at the time around 1-2 pm with service people sitting there chatting and laughing around. They provided no service but asked us to call their 833 customer service number that nobody answered. Poorest service! I will never think of flying with Flair Airline in the future. Their low fair is a trap. I definitely rank them the worst airline in the world.

### "don't waste your time"
Flight 2 hours delayed. Lost check baggage, no update, cannot even locate the bag. Customer service useless: on hold for 1h and got hung up, then another 1h on hold for an agent that barely speaks English and that cannot do anything about it. Overpriced overall between adding checked bag & carry-on bag and food (as well as very bad food selection). Doesn't even give you water. They charged me an extra $20 for a seat selection I never selected! (and end up in the middle seat, the worst one!). At the counter, they forgot to print my boarding pass and didn't give it to me, so I had to come back. The staff are not well trained, they didn't know anything about filing a report for missing luggage, and they barely understood English or French, making communication even ore difficult. Overall don't waste your time and fly with another company!

### "I'll never use Flair in future"
I was shopping for flight from Toronto to Calgary, Flair came up with a price that's $40 cheaper than air Canada Then the ripoff started on every step: * They charged $62 to check in my carry on, which is free with Air Canada. Then they charged another $62 for the same carry on for my return trip, that's a total of $62 for a small carry on bag. Then at the on line boarding, they charged another $16 to select the standard seat (just the standard one, the front seat is $50), and I ended up paying $120 more, and that was $80 more expensive than Air Canada. If I know about these additional rip offs with flair upfront, I would never have chosen it. I'll never use Flair in future.

### "customer service is abysmal"
Worst possible experience. It's not that the flight was delayed, I get that but it was delayed 7 hours overnight. They would not comp a hotel room, but worst of all I didn't even get any communications that it was delayed. Their customer service is abysmal. First time flying with this carrier. Will never fly with them again. Rather walk.

### "They delayed my flight 3 times"
Not Verified |  This is a horrible airline company. Not only do they delay flights by considerable hours last minute, they have the audacity to pretend they care by giving a $10 voucher, as if that helps in any way. They delayed my flight 3 times causing me to having to get a hotel room.

### "I will never use Flair again"
I cleared security, there was no flight posted so first I went on their website using free wifi to speak with an agent. They could not tell me the terminal or gate my flight was leaving on and told me to see a gate agent which I tried to attempt but flair has no agents at the airport. I was traveling with then as the flight was boarding I paid a bunch of roaming to call them to ask which terminal to go to and they said they didn't know. At this point i asked them how do you not know where your own plane is flying out and their customer service was less then helpful. Ended up talking to a Broward County sheriff who got on the radio found out it was terminal 3 then jogged from terminal 1 to terminal 3 to try and get on a flight that should be almost done boarding after a good run then clearing a different security ran through that terminal caught the flight as it was boarding the last few people only because it was delayed and still received snide remarks from the crew. These flights serve nothing of any sustenance and hoping to catch food at the layover in Ottawa I had 30 min to clear customs and reclear security, then run through another terminal to catch a flight. This was a very affordable flight but I will never use Flair again not only could their uninformed customer service have cost me a flight, they offer no help what so ever to their customers.

### "They are liars"
They are liars. Their flight was delayed over 12 hours. In order to go back to work on time, I purchased a last-minute flight ticket which was so pricy. Flair Airlines offered me $150 as a compensation, but they didn't pay at all. It has been already 5 months since then. I emailed them several times, but they keep telling me it would take time. They are just liars.

### "2 hours without someone answering"
Not Verified | This is a scam. A bunch of crooks. They gave me a rebooked flight and didn't even ask me if I am willing to take it. Called customer service and waited for 2 hours without someone answering my call at all. I paid for another flight and they still ask me to pay for a carry on bag. I'm never gonna take this airline ever again

### "Flight was delayed a whole day"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed a whole day and wasn't informed until day before. They told me March 23 delay leaving by 1 hr but returning didn’t tell me until day before. Had to scramble trying to add hotel and rental car. Went to customer service and they said they informed on 23rd but the email only states delay in departure not any issue with return. March 30 they tell me and show me new flight! What cost 300 for a flight now cost me 1000.00 due to hotel and car along with food.

### "their service is loaded with hidden fees"
Buyer Beware. Probably the biggest scam I've ever experienced. No willingness to assist a customer whatsoever. Was travelling to Thunder Bay to attend a friend's wedding. Flight came to approx $166. After payment, I checked my itinerary closer to flight date and noticed only my first name was listed as a passenger, however you could see my full name as the payer. I called customer service waited approx 45 minutes, spoke to a human finally as the chatbot was no help whatsoever. I asked the agent to add my full name to the traveller info. Agent told me that would cost me $226 and I would not be able to board the flight otherwise because the name wouldn't match my travel documents. He then proceeded to tell me if my last name was 3 characters or less they would be able to do it for no charge. I told them I wanted to cancel then and he said there was a fee for that as well. At this point I just laughed. In conclusion, my $166 flight turned into a $390 flight because I had to write my last name down. Customer service is trash, and after looking into them more their service is loaded with hidden fees meant to scam you. Air Canada was $409, I should have just gone with them like I usually do. This airline is proof that you get what you pay for. Big mistake won't be flying with Flair again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  I was traveling to Vancouver with my family for the first time and since we were traveling with a baby, I paid for two luggages. We were smart enough to put an Air Tag inside my baby’s luggage. When we arrived at the Vancouver airport the tag showed that one luggage was still in Toronto. There were no one from Flair Airlines at the baggage claim to answer the questions about delayed luggages. We had to go to the departure lounge to find someone to talk to. They filled out a form and promised they will get the luggage by the end of the night which meant the next flight. We kept checking the location of the Air Tag and it wasn’t shipped with the next flight. Finally the next morning the tag showed it was in Vancouver. No one had contacted us about the arrival of the luggage. We went to the airport to pick it up. We asked to talk to a supervisor on duty and the personnel laughed at us meaning they don’t have any supervisors! They couldn’t find the luggage in their storage room and claimed it didn’t arrive while we showed it to them that the tag shows it’s in Vancouver! The lady was trying to convince me that the luggage is lost or something while I had no more formula and clothes for my three month old baby. When she realized she can’t fool us with her story, she started crying. It was at that time she called her supervisor and asked for the luggage while crying. 10 minutes later there was another person walking around with our luggage. The luggage they claimed that didn’t arrive. The luggage had minor damage but my baby was hungry so I didn’t have time to fight over that. We stayed in Vancouver for two days and one day was wasted in the airport fighting over the luggage. Worst experience ever! Not flying anywhere else with this airline anymore. Rude personnel and irresponsible management. The staff kept saying we always have this issue with Toronto flight.

### "You get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  You get what you pay for. Like a 1$ slice of pizza, delays and technical issues on my flight where a plenty. Save yourself the hassle and go with an airline that's actually prepared. This being said, the staff are wonderful and if we are being honest deserve better.

### "charge you extra for carry-on baggage"
Not Verified |  They will charge you extra for carry-on baggage. Unpredictable baggage price, terrible customer service. Terrible website and terrible service at the check-in desk.

### "going to lose out big time"
I had booked a flight with Flair Airlines back in December from Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver on 29th April. Then 2 weeks ago I received a notification to say that the flight had changed to the 4th May. This obviously is not convenient being that it's a whole week later. I'm already in Mexico so it's not like I can just cancel my trip all together. There was no way to respond to them via the email so for the last 2 weeks I have been trying the online chat, Facebook and other email addresses that I have found for Flair but I'm getting no where. I need to be back in Canada by the 28th April so I'm looking to see if they can still provide the original flight (I have no idea why it changed). Or if they can ideally book me with another airline or provide a full refund. The annoying thing is also that I paid a fair price for this flight and now because the flight is just over a week away prices have tripled so if I have to book another flight I'm going to lose out big time.

### "Do not use Flair"
Do not use Flair. Booked a return flight from Kitchener to Orlando for four at a cost of over $1,300CAD. Received notification flight was re-routed a different date out of Toronto and the return flight cancelled. Called airline and waited over 8 hours to speak with an agent. I didn't dare hang up the phone. Agent provided full refund and emailed an updated itinerary showing the refund, but it's been two weeks and my credit card does not report the refund. During the time of April 6 call, I received information that leads me the airline may not honour the refund. This airline is in trouble. Buyer beware.

### "Will never fly Flair again"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible. Flight delayed day before. No food or beverage to buy. On way back the system crashes with me in the middle of upgrading our seats. Had to pay for extra seat. Having a terrible time getting refund and refund amounts are different. Charged one price online and another at the counter. Everyone had to use counter as systems were still down and people were unable to check in. Will never fly Flair again.

### "Terrible customer service"
Flair Airlines is dishonest. Reasons are generated by Flair Airlines for delays and cancellations. I received an initial reason "aircraft has been delayed in Ottawa (YOW) due to adverse weather conditions affecting flight schedule outside airline’s control. My flight was delayed 7 hours and the weather was just fine in both locations I contacted the Flair compensation department following the delay. From my experience, Flair Airlines fails to respond to emails in a timely manner, Flair Airlines denies compensation and generates alternative reasons for delays after delays have occurred. Terrible customer service.

### "Absolutely awful"
Not Verified |  Absolutely awful. Flight was cancelled when we tried to check in online. No notification or explanation and had to scramble to rebook, which we did on SWOOP. How can a company do this? Abandon passengers in a foreign country with no help whatsoever to get home. I’m appalled that they are even flying.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience with Flair. Booking was easy, but come closer to flight date they moved our flight to Toronto, then 6 days out they email that our return flight is now returning a week later than it was supposed to. My parents return flight was canceled all together but not the one to Orlando! Called, put in virtual que for days (no callback), went online to try and get a refund, that portal is under construction! Absolutely horrible business.

### "not worth it to book with them"
Not Verified |  We went to check in and found out our flight didn't exist. Called Flair and they claim they sent an email saying our flight was cancelled and rebook 3 weeks ago but we never got such an email. When I asked the agent to forward me this email that they sent or a screenshot of it they weren't able to do it - they lied. We live in Victoria and were on our way to Vancouver so had to rebook ferry, hotel, parking, etc. They also changed our flight back without notice so it throws everything off. It's tempting when you look at the price differences between Flair and the other airlines but unless you really have no plans or all the time in the world, it's not worth it to book with them. This is my 3rd experience with them. First one was horrible, second one was fine, this time another problem. Surprised there is not more accountability for airlines.

### "I would not use them again"
I booked a return ticket from Abbottsford to Calgary and back. The day prior to the first flight, I received a text message inviting me to check in online. I tried repeatedly to do so, but the website did not recognize my reservation number provided. After a day of fruitlessly attempting to reach customer service and waiting online for 2.5 hours for a representative who did not materialize, I gave up and decided to go to the airport early and sort it out. At some point during the night, an email was sent to me telling me that the flight was cancelled due to bird damage. (Does Flair Air have a bird magnet? I note that previous reviewers have given the same reason). This email included a revised itinerary with the information that they had rebooked me on the next available flight, which was 6 days later and not acceptable to me. Even more puzzling, my return flight remained the same, meaning that Flair Air must have invented time travel, as I would be returning three days before I went. I had booked through Expedia, but their rep told me that they did not handle cancellations made by the airline and that I would have to deal with Flair directly. Flair's online customer service is non existent and a phone number that I had been given by Expedia did not work. The email included an email address for rebooking or compensation. I sent an email to this number saying I wanted both flights cancelled and refund of my money. Today, which is the day my return flight was scheduled, I received an email saying they wouldn't look at my claim until the flights were completed but I could try again after that date. I am still receiving text messages inviting me to check into the return flight despite my attempts to cancel it. I flew Flair Air two years ago, and it was great at that time. After this experience, I would not use them again.

### "They canceled both my flights"
Not Verified |  I have booked twice with this airline and both times my flight was canceled. The first time was fine. They canceled both my flights and refunded me the money with in this week. This time they canceled my flight to Edmonton but rebooked my flight home with no notification. I only noticed because I was double checking my flight details. So I called them and waited hours for someone to contact me. Then was told I could get a refund but it takes up to 30 days to get it. Then when I asked why so long I was told that's just how long it takes. Not happy and will not try and book with them ever again. WestJet cost more but has way better customer service.

### "Don’t expect to ever talk to a human"
Not Verified |  How does an airline cancel a flight on the scheduled day of departure, and then reschedule you on another flight for a week later and think that is acceptable? Well, Flair Airlines has no problem with this level of customer service. Don’t expect to ever talk to a human with your questions or concerns, you’ll never reach anyone. We were on hold on the phone, and even with the chatbot for hours.

### "mixture of shambles and chaos"
Not Verified | Absolutely a shambles of an airline. Trust me no matter how low the price is not worth it. They should change their name to "Just Vibes Over Here". Booked a returning flight from BC for Sunday and they changed it to Monday without any notice or communication. Their excuse after being on hold for close to 7hrs was "operational issues, we were doing it for your safety". Please someone help me understand what that even means. Then my flight Monday was delayed and their online checking system was not working so we had to check in at the airport which was a mixture of shambles and chaos. Debit machines were not working at the airport. They excuse for the delay - "we hit a bird". C'mon man! It's like they are pleading for help to get out of business. Just vibes. No customer care at all. Trust me the low fares will cost you more. Help them out and don't fly with them.

### "Left me and other passengers stranded"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled. Rebooking option given was 5 days later - was I supposed to sleep at airport for 5 nights? Customer Service bot useless, customer Service Representative not much better. Would not let me talk to Supervisor or Manager. No compensation offered. No one to help at airport. Left me and other passengers stranded with no real options. Took over 8 hours to get a refund processed, then they say it may take up to 30 days? I have been on with their bot since 10:02 it is now 6:42 and it still says waiting to connect to Ambassador. Not cheaper than other Airlines when all costs are added in.

### "customer service can be so nonchalant"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight to Calgary AB from Ottawa ON for the 25th of June ‘23. I tried to cancel this flight within 24 hours of booking but it was impossible to get through to anyone. There were 385 callers ahead of me in the sequence so I was asked if I would prefer a callback. I agreed to the callback but the callback never came. I then put in a request for a booking cancellation via text messaging with the promise that my issue would be dealt with immediately. It wasn’t. I still have not received any type of correspondence or contact from this company. I’m not clear on how a business that should pride itself on exceptional customer service can be so nonchalant.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience I have had in my whole life. Customer service is below average, please don’t fall for the cheaper price ticket- the luggage bag price is higher than the international checked bag not only higher double than international checked bag. No any update for change of flights schedule had to run to catch a flight at last min. Will never ever recommend to anyone. I wish I had read the reviews before booking.

### "Trying to charge us extra fees"
Not Verified |  Flair Airlines have to be the worst when it comes to customer service in Vancouver location. They spend more time talking to each other. Trying to charge us extra fees for a shopping bag with food in it and fishing rods which we had no problem boarding the plane to Vancouver. But couldn't board the fight to Ottawa because we didn't want to pay for a shopping bag with my purse and food in it. So we missed our flight because of this.

### "ruined our honeymoon"
Not Verified |  Do not fly with Flair. They are by far the worst airline I have ever used. They changed our flights with no compensation will not answer calls will not respond to emails. They completely ruined our honeymoon - DO NOT FLY WITH FLAIR

### "I'm not able check-in online"
Flair Airlines is one of the most disgusting airlines I have experienced. I booked the flight online and I'm not able check-in online and I have to go to the customer service agent. Hundreds of people were lined up there, where I have to wait for more than two hours to get the boarding pass. The boarding pass they gave was after the time has already passed. The flight was on April 10 at 6 AM and they gave the boarding pass on 6:07 AM but faked as if they gave me on 5:15 AM which I noticed later. I asked them how it can be possible and they told me to just go to A16 telling me that they are still waiting for passengers. Finally when me and dozen of passengers arrived there, the flight has already departed I have been calling them for more three hours in case I can get my refund but no one is there to answer.

### "delayed 5 times then canceled"
Not Verified |  Had my flight booked 2 months in advance to go see my family and then was delayed 24 hours. The next day it was delayed 5 times then canceled! I had to pay $1500 to get a different flight so I could go home and see my family for Easter. Do not use Flair.

### "Customer service is awful"
Delayed four times then eventually cancelled. Flights “rebooked” a week later. No way of cancelling or getting a refund. Customer service is awful. I have been trying for 8 hours to get a hold of an actual human. Will never fly this airline again.

### "Worst experience ever"
How this airline has not been shut down is beyond me. Worst experience ever. Constant flight cancellations and delays. My flight got delayed over 7 hours. To contact their support team I was waiting “in line” over the phone for over an hour! Terrible customer service, terrible flights, absolute worst staffing. I was stranded at the airport for 7 hours with absolutely no assistance from anyone at flair.

### "received 5th delay notice"
This is the most pathetic example of incompetence I have ever experienced. I have flown many 3rd world airlines that put this clown act to shame. I just received the 5th delay notice. The 1st delay notice never arrived until after the hotel cancellation time past so I am paying for a room that I will never see considering we should be landing in a few minutes but have not departed yet. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BOOK ON THIS 'AIRLINE'. I will come back to this review if and when the flight ever leaves. Oh yes and they are offering a $10 food voucher for our inconvenience.

### "chatbot could do absolutely nothing"
Worst airline experience ever! They say, you get what you pay for. In this case, you actually get a lot less! Firstly, their website and online booking, check-in and flight status experience is atrocious and never works. Their customer service is non-existent, instead, you get the pleasure of using a chatbot that can basically help you with, well nothing. Got to the airport nice and early today, April 4th, 2023 for our 2:25 pm flight. Had no issues with getting to the gate, boarded the plane on time (at 1:40 pm), and got settled into our seats. As we were patiently waiting for the plane to taxi, our 2:25 pm takeoff time was far past. We received our first message from the pilot at around 2:45pm stating that there is an issue with the lights on the end of one of the wings and that maintenance was working on it and we'll be updated shortly. We continued to hear the same message in 1/2 hour increments until finally, after 4 pm (after sitting on this plane for over 2 1/2 hrs, the pilot told us to disembark so we can stretch our legs and get a meal with a $10 voucher that they were so kind to provide for this inconvenience. Now, this is where things really went downhill. Everyone gathered their items and herded back into the gate, grabbed a coffee and a muffin (because that's what $10 buys you in an airport). And then we waited, and waited, getting 15-20 min delays until finally after 6 pm, we are told the flight is canceled. No! Needless to say, many people were very angry and taking that anger out on the messenger - who, like the chatbot, could do and did absolutely nothing. They finally open the exit so we can grab our checked-in luggage and we were told that a "Flair representative" will be present to guide us to where we can find said luggage. So, after going through customs, of course, only to tell them that we never got off the ground let alone set foot in US territory, we get to the luggage pick-up area to find no Flair representative - what a surprise! I then get an email saying how sorry they are for this inconvenience, and I have the pleasure of (not actually) flying with them again on the next available flight - only 5 days from today LOL! Yup, they tried to re-book us for next Monday. What a joke! All I can say is never again. Let's see how long it takes to get a refund on this.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown. Website and online check in never works,  customer service is terrible 1 to 2 hour waits for service by phone, no international number to call. Chat is useless and tedious and then the agent cant really help. Extra leg room seat and the high cost seat are incredibly uncomfortable. Overthinking is an extra cost. I was woken up 3 times during the flight for them to provide beverage and snack service which is paid for but was never once acknowledge or offer anything. Was delayed for over 3 hours I never received one notification regarding the delays. Spent a total of 7 hours in the airport for a 5 hour flight because I couldn't check in on line so had to arrive early, then because I was not given notice of delays. I was 3 hours before the 3 hour period required to checkin.

### "most ridiculous thing I've ever seen"
They delayed my flight twice amd then completely cancelled it. I called them April 3rd at 4:00 pm and did not receive a call back until 9 am on April 4th. I had to rebook my own flights as they booked me on one 9 days later and then changed to 2 days later and gave 1 night of hotel It cost me 1300 to rebook (I could of got much cheaper if they would of answered and just told me they had no flights but couldn't get through on call or chat.) They refunded me 233 dollars, most ridiculous thing I've ever seen

### "good value for money"
95% full flight. Great service and staff, good value for money. My first time, not my last. 90 minute delay due to last minute staff cancellation. This has happened to me with other airlines as well.

### "Lesson learned, buyer beware"
Not Verified |  Initially we were saving about $250 flying with Flair vs. Air Canada. That lasted until we got to the ticket agent who charged us almost $350 for 2 luggage, and 2 carry-on. That would double bringing them back to Toronto. That didn't happen of course because, all though we were 75 minutes early to check-in the ticket desk closed off. The agent, "said you know you are supposed to be 3 hours early ... nothing we can do" leaving us stranded. This cost us thousands of dollars in a hotel and a flight back. Never again will we even consider a low end carrier. Lesson learned, buyer beware.

### "worst airline that I have experienced"
The worst airline that I have experienced! I haven't checked in online and I paid the extra $25 per person (ttl 3 people - 1 adult and 2 kids) check-in fee at the counter. However, they haven't given us boarding passes or told us how can we get the boarding passes. They just told us to bring our luggage to the oversize baggage and we do so. I realized I don't have the boarding passes when I went to security. I went back to the airline counter but they were closed. No airline staff to help us. Also, the customer services hotline and the chat box are useless and waste time. After that, the airport staff went to the gate to find the airline staff to print the boarding passes for us. We think that we should get on the plane just in time. But they told me the gate has been closed and the pilot had not allowed us to get on the plane. Finally, we missed the flight. I rented a car and spent extra 13 hours driving from Winnipeg to Calgary!

### "highest delay ever experienced"
The highest delay I have ever experienced. More that 4 hours. First it was two hours then they one more hour later in the airport they start boarding 40 minutes after the time that was supposed to be take off time.

### "Be careful with this company"
Not Verified |  The worst company. They did not mail the boarding pass after the online checking and supposing it was sent to my email when I went there they said: you will miss your flight I don't care. Then I missed the flight and they didn't let me board. Had to wait 24 hours for another plane. Be careful with this company.

### "worst flight I have ever taken"
Had I known prior to my own booking I wouldn't have wasted my time being led by this company to believe it was efficient, reliable, or cheap. while flair offers inexpensive seats, the extra fees is where they prey on their users. you pay extra for sitting with your family or small children, pay to bring a backpack as a carry on and if it's "too big". The allowed personal item can only be so thick and long. to fit under chair but they measure them to fit into a plastic slot and if it doesn't, 45$+ carryon fee. The seats are jammed in as tightly as possible, even the hall is below average width. They allege to offer on flight technology / an app so you can order a drink or a snack but that doesn't work, as the app crashes constantly, the 3 people in our group tried to use it and it was not functioning. In flight wifi was also a lie. The worst part was how uncomfortable, stuffy and cramped it was. a At the end of all the addons, we could have flied with WestJet or Air Canada and had better flight security, air blowers that work to make you feel like you aren't just breathing in stagnant air, both air Canada and WestJet have more legroom in their seating, as flair has clearly modified it to make it as packed as possible. I am not a very tall person but the rigid seating and lack of any movement was noted. Most other airlines flights, you can ask for water, someone even walks up the aisle to offer you a drink. This was the worst flight I have ever taken. The layover time was originally around 3 hours, due to delays of the plane reserved for our flight extra hours were added on. At 11am we left the airport to return for the new departure of 8pm, we returned to the airport for the flight and it was delayed again til 11pm, by the time they had it ready for our departure it was nearly 1am. Everything in the airport had closed so there was no food or drinks while they extended the flight time on and on, without so little as an apology or offering of something. we arrived at our destination around 3am, much later than anticipated.

### "a disgraceful airline"
There are 2 main reasons for a zero rating. Upon return from Calgary to Toronto. #1. Flight F8821 cancelled 2 hours before take off without notice. Upon contacting customer service they proceeded to change my return flight from Friday March 24 to Wednesday March 29. I would receive hotel and food voucher. How can I stay for 5 days in Calgary to go home. I have to go to work March 27, 2023. #2 Spoke with customer service. I asked if there was any other way to get home, maybe another airport. She said that she could try Waterloo. They were able to get my husband and myself on a flight for March 26 to Waterloo airport. We asked for transportation from Waterloo to Lester b Pearson, where our car is parked. She said she couldn’t provide transportation to Pearson. At that point I asked about the hotel and food voucher. I was told that because I changed my return date from March 29 to March 26, 2023 I wasn’t entitled to the vouchers. I am now extremely frustrated by this situation caused by Flair’s cancellation, that has me stranded in Calgary. Staff never advised of this removal of the food and hotel vouchers because I changed the flight. It is there policy not to offer hotel and food voucher if I try to make alternate flight arrangements than what they choose to give me. I wish that was the end of the story but it get worse. I ask for a manager several times, I’m told ‘I have all of the information I need and I don’t need to speak to a manager. If I don’t like it she can change me back to Wed Mar 29, 2023. At this point I explode and request a refund. I’m still located at the airport in Calgary, where one of my fellow passengers calls customer service, they get a direct flight from Calgary to YYZ on Sunday March 26 and gets hotel and food vouchers from his representative. This is a disgraceful airline.

### "The worst experience"
Not Verified |  The worst experience. First off their on line checking wasn't working, then we had to line up over 2 hours to check in at the airport, that also crashed, then they gave everyone a piece of paper and pen to write their name, the pen wasn't working. More delays at the gate, plane is very uncomfortable, tight seat, everyone jammed in like sardines an hour delay taking off .. just terrible.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Poor customer service. Showed up on time to be denied because they would accept my photo ID or government issued temporary license. Tried getting a refund and was told I was a "no show, unable to provide ID" which was not true. Never will I fly with flair again. Its extremely unfair that your customer is out 500 dollars even when all identification was provided.

### "The worst experience"
Not Verified |  The worst experience. When I arrived at the airport, after not being able to download a boarding pass, I was told that I did not pay for my Pet in cabin. I had to sift through my emails to prove to them that I had paid for it. Then they refused a carry-on. I was told to go to another line up. The wait was very long. The customer service representative was rude. She didn’t like the fact that was I was a little frustrated and upset. She made me go to the back of the line up and ignored me. After arriving at the airport 2 1/2 hours early I waited so long I got down to the last hour. She then refused to give me a boarding pass saying that it was too late to board the plane. I still had an hour left. I begged and pleaded with her, and she ignored me as if I wasn’t there. Needless to say I miss my flight and had to get a cab back to Barrie Ontario. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had.

### "not hesitate to book with Flair again"
My Uncle and I sadly had to make a last minute flight due to the passing of a beloved cousin. My Uncle is a tall, large man who also has a prosthetic left leg. We were very worried booking with Flair reading the reviews. We could not check in online, but that was fine. We went directly to the check in counter. They checked us in and did all they could to find a wheel chair. We missed the pre board, but the stewards and stewardess’ came and assisted both of us with over head; they had no problem to let my uncle move seats as he was booked on the wrong side of isle. They were constantly asking if we/he needed anything. They brought us water and upon landing they got our bags and had a wheelchair right at the plane when we got off. Yes, seats are close, they don’t sell things on flight. But bring your own? It is a NO FRILLS airline. I will not hesitate to book with Flair again.

### "All in all a fantastic flight"
Upon arrival to the Fort Lauderdale airport, the Flair employees were attentive and professional. Check in was super easy when I used the email Flair sent to 'check-in', very efficient. Only a carry-on with me I whisked through security and into the departures lounge. The passenger boarding on to the Flair plane was quick and we departed on time, landed 30 minutes early in Waterloo which was wonderful. Passing through customs was fast too. All in all a fantastic flight.

### "!respectfully decline your request"
They lost 4 planes this past weekend due to late payments. 2 of which were repossessed in Toronto. I was supposed to fly from Halifax to Toronto on Saturday, but that plane was repossessed. Your flight was delayed or cancelled for circumstances within the airline’s control. For that reason, you are entitled to further compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. You may file a claim by visiting flight disruption claimshttps://flyflair.com/travel-info/customer-service/compensation-request They lied and said it was "due to safety reasons". The plane was supposed to fly in from Toronto, leaving at 7 am that morning, but that plane was seized. They sent multiple emails claiming they would reimburse me for the new ticket since the soonest flight out was 5 days out; however, they declined when I went to ask. Option 1: Rebook your own travel (Fastest): Flair will reimburse you for the cost of your airfare. Please submit your receipt to [email protected] (subject line: 'OA Booking Receipt') and include your full name, reservation number and total requested. Your reimbursement request will be processed in one week. Option 2: Flair will rebook your travel: If you are unable to rebook, a Flair representative can rebook your travel with another airline. Please submit a request to [email protected] with the subject line 'OA Booking Request' and include reservation number, requested routes, date of travel, names and DOB of all passengers. Thank you for reaching out to Flair Airlines and inquiring about your recent travel experience with us. We have received your request for compensation with reference to the cancellation of F8149 on March 11, 2023, with service from YHZ to YYZ. Upon review, we have determined that this cancellation was due to reasons within Flair Airlines’ control and required for safety purposes {specifically based on our safety protocol or pilot in command} and is not eligible for the payment of compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We, therefore, respectfully decline your request.

### "never trust this airline again"
Not Verified |  Flair cancelled my flight while at the gate in Toronto. I was left stranded in another province with my daughter and dog and they did nothing to help with accommodations. They rebooked me for 1 week later. I ended up booking with another airline last minute and paid more than I had budgeted. I will never trust this airline again, especially with their lack of caring and empathy.

### "100% minimum service"
Not Verified | Cheap flights but 100% minimum service, seats recline very little, no pouch on the seat in front of you, no screens, no USB, EVERYTHING is extra $$. Attempted to book seat selection on line, successful for passenger 1 but no way for passenger 2. On line services are a joke, don’t waste time trying to call or chat. This outfit makes Rogers look great. Never again for us.

### "They lost my bag"
They lost my bag. I say 'lost' because I have an AirTag inside the bag so I can see its location in almost real time. In the 30 days after the flight, I have sent their 'baggage handling office' more than 20 emails to follow up (this office only communicates via email, and by communicate I mean they send a generic response once a week saying they are sorry and they are 'doing everything they can'). I also talked to consumer service on the phone at least 6 times, also a complete waste of time. I requested the bag to be delivered to SJD in Mexico which is where I went 2 days after landing in YVR. After ~2 weeks they finally shipped the bag from SFO to YVR, and then YVR to SJD. But they never contacted me to get the bag from SJD! Then they just sent the bag back to YVR, and basically went dark. I am back in the US (SFO) now and I can still see from the AirTag that the bag is just sitting there in YV. Their liability is limited to ~$2K CAD for a lost bag which doesn't make me whole. The bag and the horrible customer service aside: they charged me a seat selection fee but their horrible website did not allow me to select my seat. I submitted a refund request and of course I never got a response. Online check-in didn't work, the seats are worst than other ULLC airlines.

### "couldn’t complain about our trip"
Not Verified |  We couldn’t complain about our trip on Flair Airlines from Prince George to Tucson on Feb 17, returning on Feb. 24th. It was an Economy flight, so we didn’t expect any frills. It got us to Tucson and back safely and in a timely manner. Stewardess, Mary and her staff were friendly, respectful and efficient, doing what they could to accommodate my daughter and myself. I feel bad reading all the negative reports, fortunately we never experienced any of those. My flight the rest of the way home, on a different airline, was also delayed a few times. Unfortunately, beyond their control, the weather was not the best. They did whatever they had to, to keep us safe.

### "Very uncomfortable seating"
Not Verified | Very uncomfortable seating and horrible timing for check in bags. Our seats were so uncomfortable and did nothing fulfil any of our expectations as we felt super clustered. After the flight back to Vancouver from Flair airlines, we ended up standing around and waiting for a half hour just for our check-in bags to be received.

### "uncomfortable, delayed"
Not Verified | Please do yourself for and don't even check this airline. Never in my entire life I have been so uncomfortable, delayed and staff was rude, disrespectful and awful. It's supposed to be economic but ended up being expensive as hell.

### "Honestly exhausting"
Not Verified | Since I'm stuck on a tarmac in Ottawa for an hour and a half I have plenty of time to leave a review. Can't say I have much positive to say. My flight here last week had no online check in, insisted I didn't pay for my seat or carry on, made me come 3h early to get the ticket, then was 5h late. The flight apparently had to find all of their staff last minute and every one of the poor crew had to come in on their day off. The flight back I also couldn't check in on line, and they also lost my seat and check in that I paid for. We were fortunately in time, only to sit on the tarmac in Ottawa for an hour and a half because of a gate issue. Honestly exhausting. I feel for all of the folks who had to do this round trip with small children.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This has to be the worst airline ever, when trying to book two tickets from two locations the website kept on kicking one or the other off the site. So the final ticket priced was increased due to this website error. When trying to contact Flair they want $15 to speak with a specialist, an airline error and they want money to talk to them. The flight was a reasonable price however you have the base price, then an additional price to speak with an agent $15 per person. The company was not willing to adjust the increase in seat price due to their error. You have no choice and have to pay a fee to pick a seat on their airline. Pay a fee for a bag up to 23kg, and 7 kg for a purse, and carry-on 10 kg. The cost to have one suitcase flown was more than the seat ticket. And then of course taxes.

### "Never flying with Flair again"
Not Verified |  Never flying with Flair again. Cost us 430$ to check in our luggage. We are a family of 4 and we had 2 Cary-on, 3 suitcases, 2 sport equipment bags, 2 car seats + an additional 32$ for the plane seats. We arrive at the Airport and the flight was delayed 3 times. When the passengers boarded the plane they waited until everyone was seated to tell us that the we weren't flying out for another hour because they did not have any pilot. We ended up flying out 1 hour and a half later. There was no water, no food on this flight. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment. The plane was like a Sauna, it was so hot.

### "Absolutely pathetic service"
Terrible. At the last minute I received a notice of the flight cancellation. Automatically booked onto the next flight - four days later. Absolutely pathetic service. The main lesson: Only book with this airline if it is of zero importance that you arrive at your destination. Never mind getting there anywhere close to the date you have available!

### "not be using Flair Airlines again"
Be careful with this low cost airline. The initial fare is low just to get you to book with them. Then there are the up charges, such as payment for your hand luggage, payment for anything you want on board, water, coffee, snacks, etc, payment for seat selection online, payment to checkin with the counter clerks at the airport. Just about anything you need with this airline is a charge. At the end of the day, the total charges equals or exceed the charges of the other airlines To avoid this hassle, I will definitely not be using Flair Airlines again. It's a total exploitation and misleading advertising.

### "low cost, it’s a rip-off"
Not Verified | I tell you, they say it’s a low cost, it’s a rip-off! They charge you with carry on, hand carry and check-in in every single connecting flight! I spent more that $500 just 1 check in luggage and a hand carry from San Diego to Edmonton. 3 connecting flights and every connecting flight they make me pay and check my luggage in. They don’t send your luggage straight to your destination. Very sad. Learned my lesson.

### "I’ll never choose Flair again"
Horrible. Their price is slightly affordable and that's the only good thing about them. My flight got cancelled 2 hours before the departure and the website didn’t show any option for refund or anything. Because of that, I had to cancel all my other plans. Absolutely trash. Even if they do this service for free, I’ll never choose Flair again in my life

### "Absolutely Horrible"
Absolutely Horrible, pay extra and fly with a better airline. They first changed my flight to a later time so I was losing my first entire day of vacation (but I was thankfully able to leave 2 days before so I gained 2 extra days) but then they canceled my next flight home while on my way to airport Sunday and rebooked for the next Friday automatically (LIKE I can take an extra week off of work) they wanted to still charge me for seat assignments when I asked for isle seat since I was being inconvenienced (that didn't happen) so I'm still here and didn't get seat assignments and I'm missing work and have been offered nothing for inconvenience!

### "delayed twice and then cancelled"
Not Verified |  Worst Airline I have ever dealt with!! Cancelled flight from Toronto to Cancun 2 hours before we are suppose to get on the plane and then when you try to rebook for the next morning they want more money. How do they get away with that! Isn't that called extortion? Flight date was March 4, flight time was 1435, delayed twice and then cancelled.

### "they are never on time"
The flight attendant and the airplane pilot are really kind. The company is never on time. We only know the delay at the last minutes. The first fly was 1h30 of delay and the second was 2h. I have watch there fly for a couples of days and they are never on time. If they want to continue to have clients, they have to take care of there clients.

### "worst airline experience I’ve ever had"
Without question the single worst airline experience I’ve ever had. Never before in my life have I ever written a negative review for any service or experience I’ve ever had but after this trip I couldn’t go without warning anyone who’s considering using this airline. Believe the 1 star reviews, most of them exist because 0 isn’t an option. Save yourself and avoid having your own personal story of horrendous customer service and price gauging.

### "Worst airline ever"
I would give them a negative rating if I could. Worst airline ever. Delayed my flight twice in a day and found out when I got to the airport already and eventually cancels my flight entirely and gets shifted to the next day. The next day they postponed my flights twice again, not knowing if I’ll even be able to fly out at this point. Tried calling their customer service email, doesn’t work. Tried emailing them, their email is full. Tried online chat but it’s just a BOT! No one physical can talk to me regarding my options or refund options. I eventually just booked a new flight with another airline because Flair is the most unreliable and useless airline ever. Doesn’t matter how cheap it is, it is not worth it. It was my first and 100% my last time flying with them.

### "Will never book with them again"
Not Verified |  Cancelled flight, ruined trip. Will never book with them again. Couldn't rebook for 5 days leaving only 2 days left of my reservation at my destination. No one in airport to speak to. Would not recommend if you actually want to get to your destination.

### "flight delays and unresponsiveness"
One of my worst experiences in flight delays and unresponsiveness of the team. For a flight of 55 minutes (total), they emailed us with a notice of delay for more than 5 hours. In the email, they mentioned that if we want to book an alternative flight, we can email a certain email address. Upon emailing them, I received a delivery failure with the absured reason of "the mail box is full". Not sure how this is happening for an email mailbox. After waiting for an hour to chat with a slow and unresponsive online agent, they didn't offer any resolution (i.e. booking an alternative path) and just asked me to email their compensation team. I don't care about the compensation (especially if it is in form of credit; as I won't be using the same airline again), but this delay resulted us to lose a day of work (we were supposed to get home at midnight, and now we are getting home 5am and cannot go to work in 2 hours after that).

### "not a company worth supporting"
I'm reviewing in general the experience with booking with Flair Air. The flight itself hasn't been an issue for us but the booking process is a total nightmare. For the 3 times we try to book online within the last one year, we constantly ran into - technical issues including not being able to pay online - unethical interface design that secretly add bundles onto your total cost. Most recently, I couldn't even unchecked their "recommended bundle" due to some weird technical issue even though I clearly indicated 'no bundle' at the previous step. The chat support asked me to clear the cache - not a problem I'd expected to run into while booking a flight ticket. And I start to wonder for people who are less tech savvy, would they be led into paying couple hundreds more without even realizing it? Would they even know what a "cache" is? For every step in this process, Flair implemented design patterns that are clearly manipulative and unethical. As a designer myself, I question the business that encourages these UI practices. And after going through some hoops including changing 3 browsers, I finally got through to the payment - and same as last time, the payment could not go through online. And same as last time, I called the customer service line and was only told that even the support staff could not access to tool at the moment. I could tell how frustrated that staff was and I truly felt bad for them. From a consumer point of view, yes I love budget flights, but at what cost? The never-ending technical issue, the unethical interface design, the hours and emotional turmoil wasted dealing with these issues and also likely their own staff burnout. I ended up going with another budget airline, which is a bit more expensive but the whole process took me 2 mins and there was no guesswork or scares from mysterious add-ons. As much as I love saving money, sometimes it might worth spending a little more for that trust and reassurance. Unfortunately, Flair has proven themselves that they are not a company worth supporting.

### "charged me for my personal item."
They charged me for my personal item. I have this laptop bag which I have been using for my personal item for many years and it meets the requirements. It fits perfectly under the seat. I have taken some Geo Tag pictures as well. I asked about the name of the person who charged me they did not provide me with that information. Flair airline staff was very rude. When I call them they say that their system is upgrading and to call back in two hours. Flair advertises themselves to be a cheap and easy flight however this is not the first time my experience with Flair has been difficult and a headache. I am disappointed in the quality of service I have been provided both for the personal item and the rude customer service.

### "incredibly friendly and helpful"
Not Verified |  The check in staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and the crew onboard were accommodating and friendly as well. You may have to pay for your bags but at least they made it there the same time we did. We left on time and arrived early! 100% would fly with them again.

### "worthless and horrible service"
Not Verified | Most worthless and horrible service. Boarding completed on time. Waited in tarmac 30 minutes for pushback. Flying crew say they have timed out. Relief crew not arrived even after 2 hours. Still stuck in the plane on the tarmac. Not even allowed to deplane or stretch our legs. Hungry as hell as well. Pathetic service . How do es Flair operate with such thin margin for duty time out?

### "wait for 30 days for the refund"
I tried to cancel my flight less than 24 hours after booking. I still haven't received the refund. They are returning less than I paid for the flight. I had to stay on the phone for 1 hour, they changed the operator several times. Extremely rude. Today I called again, and again the operator was very rude. I'm going to have to wait for 30 days for the refund.

### "an amazing flight attendant"
Not Verified |  My sister and I have severe flying anxiety and its really affected our lives for a while now. We took this short flight from Toronto to Montreal to practice for a big trip we have coming up in a few weeks. Typically in the past we would cry, have severe anxiety and sometimes wouldn't be able to get on the plane. For the first time in almost 10 years, we got a flight, didn't cry, didn't take anti-anxiety medication and actually had a fun time. I attribute a big part of this to the amazing staff. On the flight to Montreal we had an amazing flight attendant named Szilvia. She was extremely helpful, taught us a lot about flying, turbulence and the sounds of the plane, checked on us multiple times, made us laugh and genuinely got to know us. The most helpful flight attendant ever. On the way back we had 2 amazing flight attendants named Kestha and Renita. Again, they were both extremely helpful, talked us through the flight, signaled us thumbs up at different sounds when we needed it and made us laugh a lot. They were the sweetest and funniest flight attendants i've ever met. Not to mention, one of them made hilarious comments on the tele-com and made the whole plane laugh. This is the best flying experience i've had since I was a kid and I can't thank the staff enough. Thank you times a million to the amazing flight attendants i met. This was life changing for me and my sister.

### "mistake of booking Flair Airlines"
I made a mistake of booking Flair Airlines (Flew on Feb 2023 Toronto To Montreal 5 hrs delay) without looking at their reviews. It may be cheap but they charge for everything, airline ticket, seat charge, if you have carry on there is a charge. I will never fly again with this airline.

### "clearly do not care about service"
Not Verified |  Service on board was horrid. Flair itself is horrid. Switched our seats twice going and returning even though we paid for it. They clearly do not care about service. I understand it’s cheap and supposed to be affordable however lacking in service is unacceptable. You pay for “larger seats” but they are the same price as regular seats. Contacted customer service after they switched our paid for seats and the response was we can’t see what you bought. I had to send an image of the receipt I had to support. Rip off!

### "they gave away our seats"
Not Verified |  Paid for extra leg room but upon getting to the airport they gave away our seats and also separated us to sit alone. Cheap flights but you pay for it with all the extras they charge.

### "impossible to get anyone to reply to you"
Not Verified |  Absolute shambles! The savings are not worth it if any single thing goes wrong. They lost our bag on a simple direct 2 hour flight, by putting the wrong passengers tag on it. After literally dozens of attempts to contact them, after one month a person from baggage finally replied to me asking if we had filled out a "property irregularity report" (We did, immediately at the airport when the bag didn't arrive) and to ask permission to "stop the search" that they literally had not even started. It is impossible to get anyone to reply to you. Every single person we talk to has the same line "we are sorry, we would be frustrated too, we understand your frustration, but we are not able to help as this is the baggage department. We will flag this and have baggage get back to you within 24-48 hours". Baggage will not get back to you in 24-48 hours. It will take weeks, and when they do it will be a person who clearly does not have access to any of the information you have sent them. What a terrible airline. Flight was whatever. We got there. I assume service crew was fine but they didn't interact with us at all because we didn't buy anything, and most of the flight gossiping with each other. The in-flight app didn't have much so I just did crossword puzzles.

### "absolute joke of a company"
What an absolute joke of a company. If you think about changing flights to a different day, don't even bother. They list prices and time frames for the cost of each flight transfer, and remain exceptionally untrue to their word. When told by the website that my transfer fee would be CAD $49, that is exactly what it should be. Yet somehow when I talk to the customer service representative, my cost suddenly skyrockets to $210, what is that? I asked for a reasoning as to why my cost was so expensive, despite being in the appropriate time frame for the cheaper fee, and the answer I received was "that is the cost" I'm horrified at the thought of this company charging gross amounts of money to unsuspecting customers and patrons of their airline. If I could get home any other way, I would NOT be taking this flight. I will NEVER use this airline again. What a disgrace, both to airlines, and this great nation of hard working people. There are no words to express my discontent farther than this.

### "Everything right from booking"
Not Verified |  Everything right from booking, reminders on text to checkin, boarding, in flight service was A1, especially for the price they charged.

### "Absolutely the worst airline"
Absolutely the worst airline I’ve ever been on. Disgusting, rude gate person. Staff is unfriendly and not helpful. First and last time flying with Flair Airline

### "Do not fall for their false advertising"
Do not fall for their false advertising, there have been many complaints about them to Canadian transportation agencies, they will be going out of business soon. They canceled my flight and by law, they have to provide you with a hotel and meal, they rescheduled me for 5 days but only gave me a hotel voucher for one day, they told me each day they were going to send me a new voucher, guess what that didn't happen and I ended up paying for the hotel out of my own pocket, they never reimbursed my money. I ended up spending way more money than I was planning to, honestly, in the end, the difference between them and Air Canada was less than, but it's so worth it when you get a reliable airline that takes care of you and their reputation is important for them.

### "Horrible service and airline"
Not Verified |  We boarded the plane only to sit there for a 45 min delay. After 45 min of waiting they pushed us out of the flight because the pilots have “ timed out”. Didn’t think a 45 min delay would cause a pilot to “time out”. The airline later said they would provide us hotel vouchers. We booked our hotel through the voucher portal. Once we arrived to the hotel they said they never received anything from flair. I called flair and they said they can’t control the situation and to just book a room myself and see if they can reimburse me at a later time. They later said they don’t know if they have a confirmed flight. Horrible service and airline.

### "will not use them again"
Flair pretends to be a cheaper alternative then once you get through security they hit you with hidden fees for your carry on that you are misled into thinking you can have which costs more than your actual ticket. $108 for the flight round trip and told I'll have to pay $60 both ways ($120) for a small duffle bag that I'm stuck with after gone through security. Worst Airline I've taken,

### "no wonder Air Canada is number 1"
This was the first and last time I ever travel with this airline. I got charged twice for my online checked in bag and when I called them they had me on hold for 45 mins to then tell me oh we can’t see if you only checked in one bag or two so basically saying I'm a liar and I could have checked in two bags but got charged twice and in two different transactions. This is bad no wonder Air Canada is number 1 in Canada

### "Customer service was on point"
Customer service was on point! I travel with just a backpack so this airline was the right fit for me. There was a bit more room in the seats than other big airlines. The seats are comfortable too.

### "Flair systems are poor"
Flair systems are poor. At best, they may work in a country with strong, secure, internet. If your not that lucky, good luck. You will be unable to get anything done as Flair is trying to to their entire "customer facing" via a web system, that is poorly written, not production ready, with no support. In my case, I tried to "get a boarding pass", got thru 90% on the system, I was able to pick a seat, but was unable to get a boarding pass. After 10 attempts I phoned their Edmonton call center. I was told, via a recording, not to worry go, to airport, the boarding fee would be waived. I got to airport, got a boarding pass, but not the seat I had paid for, I tried to explain to their staff, but little or no English was spoken. Once home I tried to contact Flair several times. Their official Answer is I missed the flight. Again poor system.

### "flight canceled without any reasonable alternative"
Not Verified |  My flight 334 has been canceled 10 mins before take-off without any reasonable alternative. I have been told that only my flight reservation will be refunded in (about 2 weeks) without taking in consideration the hotel and rental car I booked at my destination. Until now I am fighting with them to acknowledge and refund me my checked bag fees (89.27 $) because it was not part of my online reservation. I think they should be shut down so, they would stop deceiving/disappointing passengers.

### "I never received a follow-up"
Our original was canceled and we were rescheduled to the following day at 5 pm. I tried to call to speak to an agent to get on one of 5 flights leaving for the lower mainland earlier than my rescheduled flight. I was lied to by the agent that they could not move my arrival city from Abbotsford to Vancouver under some sort of federal regulation. Upon being pressed further about this, they hung up on me. I requested a call back immediately after being hung up on. They called me back the following morning before 7 am (Too early) and I saw then our flight had been delayed another 5 hours. I was told on the second call that had there been something available earlier (they made attempts to move me but the flight I was going to move to only had one seat). Had I been able to be properly assisted the day prior, I would have stood a much better chance of being moved to an earlier flight. We were issued two vouchers. Both could only be used one time each. One for $120 and one for $40. Good luck spending $120 on food at the Calgary airport in one sitting. The waitress at Chili’s received a $70 tip. What an empty meaningless attempt at compensation. When our flight was delayed well into the evening (our 5 pm flight finally departed shortly after 1 am), I made attempts to have a hotel arranged for us in our arrival city. I was told by a Flair Airlines representative that I would be contacted by email within an hour to let me know the status of my hotel request. That was December 27th. It is now January 25th. I never received a follow-up. I paid out of pocket for a hotel. When we finally got onto our flight, a person came on the loudspeaker who identified themselves as a pilot, made it clear they would not be our pilot due to airline regulations surrounding how many hours they could work in a day, and explained they were able to find another pilot. Don’t have a person announce to a plane full of people that they are working their pilots far beyond and up to legal limits, immediately prior to takeoff. I emailed [email protected] with details of my complaints. They responded by saying I needed to send all complaints to [email protected]. Yes, you read that right. I requested compensation via email (The only channel to do so). I have subsequently been offered compensation ($250 per person) which I don’t feel is adequate. I was told I would be contacted in ‘2-3 weeks or longer’. I followed up by e-mail today to see the status of this. I was told I don’t qualify for compensation. By the same email that has already offered me compensation. I sent them a screenshot of their email offering compensation. I patiently await the next page in our saga.

### "Customer service is useless"
Flair flight 1225 Friday 13th January, 2023 4:45 Vancouver to Toronto I paid extra to reserve seat 3D, which was supposed to have extended legroom. It did not. My knees were jammed against the seat in front the same as they had been in row 8 in the flight from Toronto to Vancouver. This time I could not even fit my laptop bag under the front seat because it was much too narrow. I asked the attendant politely if she could give me a seat with extended legroom. She said I had one already. I told her it was not extended legroom and I had paid extra for it. The two people to my right and two in the row behind me spoke up and said they had paid extra, too. I pointed to an empty seat in the bulk head row and asked if I could sit there. She said, “No. Everyone has to stay in their assigned seats.” She told me I could call Flair customer service and ask for a refund. As we were still on the ground, I got up to ask the attendant for the Customer Service number. I called and went through a long process of identifying myself. The service employee claimed that I had an extended legroom seat and that he could not issue a refund. I told him he was mistaken but he paid no attention. One of the flight attendants said that this plane had been switched from another larger one that was supposed to fly tonight and the seats were tighter. The crew chief came by and was trying to tell me something about another row being available, but I was still speaking with customer service. A few minutes later, she ordered me to put my phone away as the plane was about to take off. I finished the call and she knelt down beside me and said, “Are you going to stop disrespecting my crew?” I said, “I’m not disrespecting anyone.” She said, “If you don’t respect my crew, we’ll turn around and put you off the plane. What do you want to do?” “I want to go to Toronto.” “If it were my call, I’d put you off the plane. Are we going to Toronto or turning the plane around? What do you want to do?” “It’s your call”, I replied. She got up and called the captain on the phone. A customer sitting in the bulkhead aisle seat C, turned and said, “I’ll be your witness.” I thanked him and we were exchanging information. He caught the eye of an attendant who was sitting facing him. He told her to tell the crew chief that he would switch places with me. She tried to get her supervisor’s attention but no luck. The chief came back and said to me “The pilot wants to get airborne because the flight is two hours behind schedule.” I asked her, “Can I go to row 8?” She replied, “No it’s not available any more.” The passenger in 2C said to her, “I’ll switch with him.” And we did. One and a half hours in, I walked down the aisle. There were at least 10 people stretched out fully in empty rows. One row, 15 def was still empty. She could easily have reseated me in an empty row. The gentleman from row 2C is my witness. I was not rude, loud, or disrespectful in any way to the attendants. I was asking to get the seat I had paid for. For that, she would have held up the half empty plane and removed me. I would have had to pay for accommodation and a new flight and I’d have arrived in Toronto who knows when, having missed important engagements. Customer service is useless.

### "less than the train or the bus"
Flew Flair for the first time. The aircraft was rather new (delivered June 2021) and quite clean. I didn't pay for a seat, so I was assigned 32F,last row, window seat. The seat didn't recline, and the legroom was acceptable at best. The flight took slightly over an hour, so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. Boarding was a bit chaotic, but not that bad. There were different zones. Zone 1 I assume is for people who paid for advance boarding. Zone 2 is for window seats etc. etc. We took off a bit late, the plane had Wi-Fi but only for preloaded content. There was a tab for meals/beverages and flight info, but they weren't active. They didn't serve any food/beverage (free or paid) which again isn't a problem as we started descending shortly after we reached cruising altitude. We landed on time, the landing wasn't the smoothest but regardless fine. I paid less than I would have if I took the train or the bus.

### "a $279 fee for two check in bags"
Not Verified |  I just flew from Toronto to Calgary on Jan 7. I was struck with a $279 fee for two check in bags one way that's $588 return, I was going skiing so I needed two bags. I fly out west two or three times a year, the most I have ever been charged by multiple airlines, including flair was between $40 and $50 per bag. I could not believe they can rip customers this way. I have contacted them and all they recommend is to try and get a refund from them, in other words weeks or months of aggravation because they ripped me off.

### "don’t know what they are doing"
I booked flair airline for whole family last year in June 2022 for December 2022 from Edmonton to Los Angeles, everything was fine and i booked my hotels, rent a car accordingly. In September 2022, I called them to reschedule my son’s flight only as he had exam and we were looking his flight reschedule after 5 days from us but when i called I got to know that my whole flight is cancelled in august 2022 which i did not know and i never received any call/email for this cancellation. I was very upset and caused me more money to rescheduled it change destination from Los Angeles and to las Vegas. Anyway I rebooked again from them and flew to Las Vegas. When we came back from our trip to Edmonton on 2nd January 2023, they lost my one of my bag and from that day I kept calling them and emails as advised to send and also filled report in their Edmonton airport customer care but still no updates yet and when i called again this morning, customer lady said that they haven’t receive any of my email and was saying might be I am sending to wrong email. I confirmed from her right away and i did sent to the right one. In short they don’t know what they are doing and they don’t know what is customer service.

### "not even receive an acknowledgement"
Not Verified |  My flight from Ft Lauderdale to Kitchener (F8523) on 8 December was cancelled. I received an email the day before saying the flight was cancelled. This email came after I had already received confirmation that I was checked in for the flight above - how can this be less than 24 hrs before I was due to depart? The email informed me I was booked on "the next available flight," but that was 5 days later! This was shocking - no consideration about extra hotel bills and meals it would cost me, and no consideration that business meetings would need to be cancelled disrupting the work of myself and other people. Absolutely shocking. It took me hours on the phone to eventually reach a Flair agent who found me a flight from Ft Lauderdale to Toronto two days later. This was better, but since I had left my car at Kitchener Airport it meant I had to pay for a taxi late at night to get me to Kitchener. To compound all this, I wrote a letter of complaint asking for reimbursement for the additional costs (I sent copies of the receipts) ... and did not even receive an acknowledgement from Flair, let alone a resolution of my complaint.

### "luggage still hasn't been found"
My husband and I were on the tail end of our holidays travelling to Whistler via Vancouver. We checked in bags the same time, very early before the flight was to leave. Unfortunately my bag didn't arrive with everyone else’s. After waiting at the carousel for a long time we were told to check oversized baggage even though it wasn’t checked in as this. Nothing came. We started to realise that it wasn’t just my luggage but so many that were missing. If you walked around the terminal where collections are there were hundreds of bags that had clearly arrived late waiting for owners to come back and get them. Remember when they used to say leave no bag unattended? Definitely wasn’t the case here. We filled out a missing baggage claim at the airport that clearly wasn’t lodged as we got no confirmation email about follow up. I went online to try and talk with someone however this can only be done over chat bot or email. They proceeded to ask for all the same information I thought we had given them. It’s extremely disappointing and frustrating to deal with this while on holidays for the first time in 3 years. All we are after is an immediate follow up and honesty in what has happened. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to replace minor this while travelling in the holidays. Family’s, young traveler’s, backpackers are not they are on strict budgets. It was so clear this is happening to more than us. Extremely disappointed. It is now 11 days on and the luggage still hasn't been found. The incompetence this airline has made with losing my luggage and the mental and emotional toll this has taken on us is terrible.

### "No customer service"
Flight from Kitchener to Halifax was five hours late due to issues with the crew. Finally got where we were going at 4:30 a.m. Our flight tonight was scheduled to leave Halifax at 10:30 pm but is now supposed to leave at 12:40, which means we'll get home after 2 am. More issues with the crew. No customer service. Currently sitting at check-in trying to check bags but there's no one here. Of course. Never again. These people make Swoop look like Pan Am in the 60s.

### "staff are aggressive and rude"
Not Verified |  I was told Flair was a scam but had high hopes. Pets are treated well but people are treated like savages. The staff are aggressive and rude. There’s a reason why they have these prices - give in and pay the steeper prices because if you don’t have a heart problem, you will after this trip!

### "Flight cancelled but was not notified of the cancellation"
Not Verified |  Avoid like the plague. Does this airline even have customer service staff? Or is it some kind of hoax? Impossible to get a hold of anyone. Company like this should not exist. Flight cancelled but was not notified of the cancellation or given any rebooking option. Booked another flight with WestJet instead and waiting for a refund from Flair. No idea if will even receive one because there was no human to talk to, only a robot.

### "delays and cancellations are rampant"
Not Verified | I imagine over 90% of Flair's customers are not returning customers. We certainly won’t be. As many others have noted, delays and cancellations are rampant with no communication from the airline. This happened to us today. Flight was delayed from 7:35 to 8:20 without any communication (told us at 7:30). Then again delayed until 9:05 and then again until 9:25. No meal vouchers were offered. It’s worth noting that for 2 tickets with each having a carry on and checked bags, the total cost was $1100. I don’t think this is too far off what you can get with Air Canada. Will not recommend Flair to anyone I respect.

### "file an additional compensation claim"
Day of my flight, got an email stating my flight was delayed by 30 mins late and was offered a $10 voucher for food/drinks. After going through security and getting to my gate, the boards showed that the flight was delayed to 5pm ET. After being at the airport from 10:30AM, the flight was cancelled at 3:30PM due to something that was within the airlines control. The flair associates at the airport counters were not only rude but one almost got violent. They refused to help me find a different flight or support with a resolution. After waiting on hold for over 8 hours, flair called me back and issued a refund for the flight they cancelled. Per their email, I was entitled to file an additional compensation claim which I have tried to do multiple times. I have sent in 3 emails, I tried calling back and I even tried connecting over social media with no avail.

### "do not waste your time or money"
I didn’t actually fly as we realized our flight was cancelled an hour before take off when we were having brunch and over heard another passenger… they did not contact us to let us know, the app said it was all on time as did the website … I still haven’t heard from anyone a day later about my money. I am a single parent who worked very hard to arrange this trip for myself and my daughter, instead we spent Christmas in the airport trying to get information and fighting back tears while we saw people being restrained by police trying to get answers. A couple of hours later I was emailed letting me know that I had been rebooked for a flight seven days later, returning four days later. This flight is also 1500 cheaper then my initial purchase I will not be able to get back my 3000$ paid in accommodations in Puerto Vallarta, where we were to spend 12 days, Christmas and new years. Instead I am out that money and feel completely depleted. This airline is terrible. It’s been over twenty four hours and nobody has provided any insight onto compensation for this, I wish I could be refunded as well as compensated for all of my lost money: there is nothing that can be done to give my daughter back her Christmas or the vacation we have spent months anticipating. I would give a zero if I could. Absolutely do not waste your time or money with this company.

### "people at the terminals are useless"
Not Verified |  Got a text 2 hours before my flight saying it was canceled and would be 5 days later, googled and found a flight tomorrow, through Flair air, why couldn't they put me on that flight? Waiting now 5 hours for a call back for a refund, not sure how much longer, was given the option to text, it's automated, no actual answers. The people at the terminals are useless, all they do is give you a number, no information why the flight was canceled, nothing. By law they are required to refund the ticket, plus pay back baggage, also because it's not than a 9 hour delay they must also pay me $500. All the customer service I have received so far is 0 stars but you can't select that. Hoping the service on the phone is better but I would not recommend FA to anyone.

### "absolutely no customer service"
Flair ruined Christmas. We were set to fly home to Ontario on Dec 23. There was some snow in BC, and due to Abbotsford being a small airport and not bothering to prep for this even though we knew all week that it was coming, the runway wasn’t clear. WestJet and Swoop cancelled all of their flights the day before. The 24 hrs notice allowed people to get refunds on things like car rentals. We were shocked to see our flight, and one other flight were still “on time” the morning of our flight. We woke up at 4:30am. Got to the airport at 5:15. Flight was set to board at 6:30, depart at 7:15. We didn’t board until after 7. Then we sat on the plane until 9:30. They told us the chances of getting there were very high and there was no reason to think we couldn’t go but the runway needed to be cleared more. We then were told to get off the plane and waited in the airport until 12 when they said it was cancelled. While waiting in the terminal they suggested we go buy food. They didn’t even offer vouchers or snacks or anything. All of that aside, they provided an alternate date 4 days after Christmas and they don’t answer the phones, or fulfill the call backs. There is absolutely no customer service. They provide you with emails and chat options to which no one ever replies. Their website is always glitching and the “rebook” page doesn’t work, so we missed out on the flight one day earlier out of YVR we wanted to switch it to. This is the first year in my whole life that I won’t have Christmas with my family. I know weather is out of flairs control, but they handled it HORRIBLY. I’ve flown Flair before. They charge you for everything, right down to your boarding pass. There is no food on board. No alcohol on board. Their extra leg room seats are expensive and still are not extra leg room. My boyfriend is 6’4 and with extra leg room his knees were absolutely crushed by the seat in front of him. The only way is to spend $50 per person on exit row seating. They also didn’t let him move to an exit row despite us paying for extra keg room and not getting it. They said we had to pay for it. Honestly I know Flair is cheap, but I’d rather not travel at all than ever book with them again. I’d give a 0/10 if I could.

### "The service was unacceptable"
Not Verified |  The service was unacceptable! No one cared about me or family, even though they claimed to be a “family friendly airline”. We were looking forward to spending time together as a family during Christmas but unfortunately, this airline ruined the entire trip. When I tried to book again no one was helpful and just helps canceling my flight. I wanted to get home for Christmas and my flight got cancelled many times for no reason and now I have to spend Christmas alone.

### "another excuse of it being backlogged"
I never had issues with flair, I always fly with them until recently. I had a flight July 18th at 3:45 pm, they overbooked the flight and put me on the 11pm flight which was ALSO delayed until 2am the next day, we didn’t leave Winnipeg until 3am, I got to Toronto at 7am, had a flight to Cuba at 3pm in Toronto. I couldn’t get refunded for my hotel that I booked because I was supposed to spend the night in a Toronto, I emailed in August about compensation, sent in my void cheque etc, everything they asked for, they responded quickly to tell me what I needed and when I sent it in, and a month went by with no deposit and no email back, after I sent in all the information. I emailed again which they responded within 10min. It has now been 4 months no compensation, and different excuses every time. Backlogged, one said I received and email in September for my deposit which I didn’t, they then told me my deposit will be fast tracked as there was a mess up and that’s why it’s late and that id get it by the end of the next week, (December), I waited 2 weeks and didn’t receive it, emailed again, and yet another excuse of it being backlogged. Mind you my Cuba flight was delayed and they compensated me within 3 weeks, they are a much busier airline so there really is no excuse. If you’re expecting good customer service, do not fly with flair.

### "online check in never works"
Please if you value your time and sanity - do not go with Flair Airlines even if they are cheaper. They say it is a $25 fee to check in at the airport but their online check in never works. They sent me message to check in for a reservation I had cancelled weeks ago and the check in failed but somehow they managed to charge me for adding baggage to this cancelled reservation. When requesting them to refund the charge they refuse to do so. The worst experience I have ever had with an airline.

### "waiting over an hour for my baggage"
Not Verified | Hands down the worst airline I have ever flown with. I got off my flight at at 430 and have been waiting over an hour for my baggage to come. 4 WestJet flights that had landed after we did, have already fully unloaded on the same baggage carousel. Flair is a scam. They claim low prices but charge you for every bag, personal item or checked bag. Even the coffee and water on the plane cost money and their staff is very unhelpful and rude. 0/10 recommend Flair Airlines.

### "customer service is non existent"
Flair cancelled my flight home from Mexico. They rebooked in a flight 3 days later. They only fly this route sun and wed. They said it was a “controllable lack of aircraft availability. I emailed and used their chat bot with no reply. I called their assistance number They were not able to provide me with any arrangements for having to stay 3 more days in Cancun and could not tell me if there was any compensation. Which now, they say it was safety issue and they don’t have to compensate. They are not obligated to book you on a different airline as they are a small carrier. So I am out about 1700$ For my lodging and food and transportation for the 3 days I was stuck in Cancun. Their customer service is non existent. The chat bots are terrible. They never give you a live agent. There was absolutely no help for making arrangements I believe they cancelled because the flight as not full or even close. When we flew home 3 days later, that flight was also almost empty. I believe they cancelled to save thousands and thousands of dollars, then tell me it is a safety issue so they don’t have to compensate.

### "bad customer service"
This airline didn't allow me to check in online beforehand, I tried many times, different browsers, and the application with no avail. It took me forever to speak to a representative and when I finally did, they did absolutely nothing to help me check in or amend the situation. They simply said there was nothing they can do and that I have to arrive at the airport three hours early, for a domestic flight within Canada! Bad user experience and bad customer service, I will not be flying with this airline again! On top of everything else, its 83$ to check a piece of luggage! Obscenely expensive.

### "Completely unreliable airline"
Not Verified | Avoid this airline at all costs. Cancelled our much-anticipated flight (which we'd booked 1 and 1/2 months previously) with only 24 hours notice. Had to switch to an AC flight from London, ON which ended up costing us an extra $1800. Zero compensation from Flair because it was a 'controllable for safety reason' loophole. Which of course actually means 'we didn't sell enough seats so we cancelled the whole flight'. Completely unreliable airline - you cannot talk to an actual human - no phone numbers on their website. A horrible experience. Avoid, avoid, avoid.

### "the most amusing flight"
The flight attendants made this the most amusing flight I've ever been on. Funny, sassy and they take safety really seriously! Would fly again just to be serenaded with more flying-themed Christmas carols. Only thing that sucked was how expensive it was to check a bag.

### "Have some flexibility in your booking"
It's cheap. Delays are possible, but they are with any airline. Have some flexibility in your booking. More frequently flown routes like YYZ-YVR are safer.

### "This airline only knows how to disappoint"
Flair Airlines, where do we begin. 1) Cannot get a person on the phone to make any updates to the itinerary. Had an infant in arms that needed to be added so you cannot do the automated booking. This is a total nightmare talking to them via emails and their chat bot. 2) Plane slid off the runway two days before our flight so our flight was cancelled because they have no other planes. Zero Resiliency in their fleet (or lack thereof). Only found that out days later...keep reading. 3) They send an email to some address that was not ours. Never received a text or phone call to my cell number about the cancelled flight. 4) Arrived at the airport, no one at the booth, Just a print out saying flight cancelled today. 5) 12/8/2022 flight was cancelled, and without communicating with us, Flair re-booked the out bound flight for 12/13. Our return trip back home was 12/12 in the booking. Even though we could not get to Canada due to their own mechanical issues, they refused to refund the second part of the trip, stating that it was not cancelled. After getting on the phone with a person in a call centre outsourced to some other country, I asked their representative, "how can you force me to keep the return flight when I cannot get there until the day after I am supposed to return? The answer was "This is our policy". This airline only knows how to disappoint. By offering to save a few dollars, they kill you with negligence in their customer service, fail to communicate in a reasonable manner and charge you for anything they can. Do not book with this airline. You will regret it.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
Avoid this airline at all cost. As a small operator with a limited flight schedule and no extra planes you can be stranded for many days. They cancelled our flight twice for "controllable for safety reasons" and refused to cover hotel and meals. The catch was it had nothing to do with our planes safety. One of their planes ran off the runway and in getting it serviced, had to reallocate the plane from our route to service other routes. Customer service was terrible, the chat bot looped you endlessly and it was impossible to get any support. After 2 cancelled flights and $1000 in extra expenses, we couldn't even checkin. The app crashed with an F508 message at the exact second (24 hours in advance) that you are able to checkin online. Later, we were actually able to checkin but it put us in different rows. Even after that, it showed other passengers that my wife's seat was available for them to select. When we actually boarded the plane, several passengers had the same seat assignments. It's a complete Mickey Mouse operation. If you are still thinking about it because it's cheap, wait until you go to buy your tickets. They gouge you for everything. $120 for the flight and $260+ for the luggage. Almost forces you to pick a seat for another $17 to $35 per person each way. Want a coffee or water on your flight .. dig out your pocket book again. I can't believe they are still in business.

### "the worst airline experience"
Flair Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever gone through. They cancelled my flight last night at 12am and told me that the next available flight is 16 days from today. Did not offer compensation or help in rebooking my flight. Keep in mind 16 days from today is December 28th and i would have missed Christmas with my family. When I finally figured out that they had another flight to night, they asked me to pay for the new flight. I eventually kept refusing to pay for a problem that wasn't mine to fix so they ended up voiding the cost. Customer service was beyond terrible - they were hard to reach and then continued to be useless and showed very obviously that they did not care. I will never be flying with Flair again and i would recommend anyone who is reading this to think twice before considering.

### "I will never fly with Flair again"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline. Completely unreliable, both my outbound flight to Edmonton and the inbound flight returning from Edmonton were cancelled by Flair the day before and rescheduled without asking to date/time that didn't work for my husband and I. We lost two days of our visit because of Flair's unreliability. First cancellation was some plane problem and then the second time, no plane. I did manage to get a credit but had to rebook and ended up spending $500 more because of last minute bookings. I will never fly with Flair again, they are terrible and they have extremely poor customer service.

### "Worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Worst airline experience one can ever have. Cancelled our flight one day before the departure and then rescheduled our flight a day after. Was supposed to return on Sunday and go to work on Monday but they booked a flight on Monday evening. Can’t afford to not going to work even for a day and no help from their customer care in compensating the loss I had to bear to book another flight the same day with 500$ difference. Never fly with this airline ever.

### "Avoid Flair Airlines if possible"
Worst airline company ever. They canceled my flight and rescheduled my flight 2 days later. And they only provided 1 night hotel voucher. I was advised that another voucher should be coming next day however I have not received as of 6PM. Avoid Flair Airlines if possible.

### "Worst airline I have ever met"
Worst airline I have ever met in my life time. Cancelled my flight one day before scheduled boarding time due to lack of aircraft. Re-scheduled to a flight a week later without consulting me. It did not work for me so I had to buy a replacement ticket. Double the cost. No compensation. The on-line chat service uses a robot to ask same questions so many times. When you finally gets to a service Rep, he does not know what he is doing. Worst ever. Do not use them, no matter how cheap the fare is.

### "probably the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Flair Airlines is probably the worst airline you could possibly be tempted to fly with even with their cheap prices. I found out that my flight was cancelled at the airport, two hours before departure. No reason given by the staff. The options I was offered: refund of the flight (an amount of 125$) or reschedule my flight 6 days later. Other flights were still available with other airlines, nothing to do, Flair will not help you at any time to propose an option that will bring you to your destination as soon as possible to minimize the inconvenience. I had to buy a new plane ticket on the spot at my own expense at more than 1100$ to get back home. Unacceptable. Flair Airlines, never again.

### "Had to book with Air Canada which cost me $1600"
Not Verified |  Booked a trip to Vegas with Flair Airlines, which got delayed 3 times. We were booked Thursday to Sunday. The flight got delayed until Friday. So when we got to the hotel on Friday they gave our hotel away because we were a day late. Spent an extra $1300 for 2 nights on the only hotel we could find. Went to the airport to catch the flight home, they canceled it and rebooked me for a flight 4 days later. Had to book with Air Canada which cost me $1600. Cost me an extra $3000 on flights and hotel all because of delayed and canceled flights. Their flights are cheaper but when you have to book with Air Canada to get home it ends up costing a lot more money. I will never fly or recommend Flair Airlines to anyone.

### "Changed my flight departure time 6 times"
With Flair Airlines, you buy your ticket on a promise, a hope and a lie and then the truth always shows up. Changed my flight departure time 6 times the last three days. Six. Supposed to leave at 7pm, then 8pm, then 3pm, then 5pm, then 9pm. I cancelled my ticket but the last I looked they're still changing the departure time. Totally ruined my plans at work, how to get to the airport, how to get picked up from the airport and my weekend plans. The reasons they gave for all these errors? Not enough crew, pilots required rest because they got their too late on their last flight, maintenance, and just a good old regular schedule change. I don't know how to parsec a star because I would feel guilty leaving this loser of an airline a one star rating.

### "have cancelled on me twice"
Not Verified | It feels funny putting December 2022 as the time when I last flew with Flair because the flight isn't happening. They have cancelled on me twice (with less than 24 hours). It's unreal. They have booked me to go to Ottawa and return home on the day I was supposed to be returning. I am now out money for the hotel because I'm late cancelling and I don't get to see my son play in a tournament. I will 100% pay the extra money to fly on a reliable plane.

### "make sure have online check in"
Budget airline make sure have online check in as it says on email. Perfect airline to save money butp Print our own boarding pass. At airport you will C$ 25.0 for drinks you have to pay 3.50Cad. When you check in online. they will send you instructions. Read and follow you will be fine. our flight was 6 am, we were at the airport 5 am and no one was at ticket counter.

### "the app is useless, it kept crashing"
Worst airline ever. We (my wife and I) checked in on-line late the night before the day of departure. Our flight was supposed to leave at 14:30 hrs only to find out that it was rescheduled for 19:00. We never received notification and we had to leave our accommodations in the morning (as planned). While we were at the airport, we did receive a notification for further delay to 20:30 and again to 21:00 hrs. All the restaurants were closed by now and the boarding staff only provided us with a granola bar and a miniature water bottle. There were only 29 passengers on the flight with capacity for 186. I asked if I could sit in a seat with more leg room (I am 1,88m/ 6'3") after take off and I was denied since I did not pay extra for that. Ridiculous, so after 30 minutes (on a 5 hour flight) I moved anyway. I got dirty looks from the flight attendant. An announcement was made that we could use the Flair App for in-fight entertainment but the app is useless, it kept crashing. The seats can't recline so that was annoying. Under CTA (Canadian Transport Agency) guidelines, I filed for compensation of $500 for a 6.5 hr delay but was denied. They stated that an automated notification system had sent an email stating the change to 19:00 hrs weeks before. As mentioned, that one I never received and I was not the only passenger that had not received this notification but did receive the other 2.

### "everything else was chaotic"
The flight and the booking processes were smooth, but everything else was chaotic. Would not let me board my flight to Canada when I had all the necessary documents according to government resources. After 1 hour of back and forth and so much stress (I was about to immigrate to Canada with all my life in my suitcases, they finally agreed I did have the right documentation and let me board. I would probably have missed my flight if it wasn't delayed, which leads me to the 2nd problem. Flight got delayed by 2 hours, I got an email but all the screens at the airport showed the flight was on time, so I ran to the gate because I wasn't sure what was going on, just to get there and realize that obviously the flight was indeed delayed. No updates for customers and so much lack of knowledge. Do not recommend.

### "make sure you have no checked luggage, only hand luggage"
So, what it really means with a ‘low fare’ from Flair Airlines? Very high probability your checked luggage will be lost and never returned to you. Mine was lost on the flight coming from Montreal to Vancouver. It's been 19 days now, and they still can't localize it. Four other passengers of that same flight lost there luggage as well. If you ever decide to travel with this company, make sure you have no checked luggage, only hand luggage.

### "slow bag drop off and long line ups"
So, what it really means a ‘low fare’ with Flair airlines? To save costs, Flair does not offer electronic kiosks to check in or self-serve stations to print bag tags. Their counter locations are far-away and staff limited that makes the slow bag drop off and long line ups. They will may you walk the long length of the airport to a gate. They do not offer food or beverages during flight. Flair does not respect your time! Flair needs to do better!

### "Buyer beware"
The website promises better prices and accessible air travel for all. What it leaves out is that the flights are not always less expensive - and, even if they are - you pay to select even a standard economy seat in advance, you pay over $50 to take a carry-on bag, you pay for a simple drink and snack. My WestJet flight to Vancouver was $75 less, and a drink, snack, and carry-on bag did not cost me extra. Buyer beware.

### "at no point did they try to help"
Stay away. I arrived 1.5 hours before my flight but they would not let me board, claiming I had to arrive 2 hours before hand for a domestic flight. Even though I had checked in the night before. They insisted I call their customer service, which of course was closed before 8am. I then asked to fly without my bags and they claimed I could not board in time, even without bags. Incredibly poor and at no point did they try to help.

### "cancelled the flight with no notice"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Stay away. We were booked to fly with this airline and they cancelled the flight with no notice. We were not called, email, or notified in any way. We did not figure out that the flight was cancelled until the day of the flight when we went to the Kelowna airport website. We noticed that our flight number was not listed on the board of flights for the day. This led up to about 45 minutes of digging on the Flare airline website to finally find the information that the flight was cancelled. We were already heading to the airport at this point. We had gotten up at 430am to make the flight with a young baby. We then had to drive to our destination of Victoria. This meant that we arrived to the island at 6:00pm instead of the 9:30am we expected. Again, with an 8 month old baby in the car. When reaching out to the airline the only response was sorry not sorry. We asked for compensation as the trip took hours longer than we thought. The response? That the flight had been cancelled for a month so there was no chance for compensation. There was no concern for the fact that they had not attempted to notify us about the cancellation in any way. No care of the hell that the day became because of the horrid treatment we got from the airline. Truly disgusted by this airline and really makes us think about flying at all anymore, post pandemic. We will be sticking to Air Canada from now on. It may be a bit more expensive but worth it if you actually get to fly with the airline. Fuck you Flare

### "worst airline I have ever traveled"
Flair Airlines is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on in my lifetime. Customer Service is not even on any scale of 1 to 10. It should be rated a big fat zero. Our flight was delayed for more than 2.5 hours without any compensation from this airline. I would advise everyone to avoid Flair Airlines even though it's ultra discounted.

### "happily surprised with my trip"
It was my first time travelling on a low-cost airline. I always travel light so it was a delight to have the option of paying less since I did not have a luggage. The boarding and flights were on time, the staff was helpful. Obviously, you cannot expect the same level of comfort as a regular airline when you are travelling with a low-cost, but I was comfortable enough to sleep on the plane. Considering the cost of my ticket, I was happily surprised with my trip. The only thing I struggled with was the app which was not user-friendly and crashed a lot. That being said, everything else was great for me!

### "would not be be refunding the difference"
I tried to pay for luggage after checking in online, their platform was down, I tried over and over no result. I went to the airport and stated the issue with their website. Their employee, convinced me to pay the airport Charge, and gave me a number to call and get my refund on the difference. I did just that, and got on the phone with another employee, who to took the matter as a Joke, when I demanded for a serious answer, she gave me an email, which I sent an email to asking for my refund. I got a reply less than a day later that they would not be be refunding the difference.

### "the worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  We got stuck in a Hurricane (Fiona) in Corner Brook Newfoundland. Was sent an email saying we couldn’t return due to cancellations until a week later than our scheduled flight. We ended up having to book a flight 4 days later than scheduled. In order to get on that flight Flair charged us an extra $600 dollars to return. We already paid for our ticket but had to pay again. We tried to get a refund once home but was told it wasn’t going to happen. What kind of Airline treats their customers this way? On top of that amount they tried their best to get another 200 from us. We couldn’t use their site that stated you could book for free if you had a flex ticket because it was down too. We needed to get home to go back to work. We also had a flex ticket. We also paid for premium seats for extra leg room for my husband which we did have but they forgot to mention the seats are only small across so he was very uncomfortable all the way because his hips were wider than the seat. This was literally the worst flying experience we have ever had. I would have expected to be reimbursed since none of this was our fault and they should stand behind their customer satisfaction. I will have nothing but bad things to say about Flair until I get my money back. Two Very Unsatisfied Customers

### "just as good as Air Canada"
Not Verified | Affordable price! Boarding and everything else was just as good as Air Canada. I will go with Flair every time. If you're worried about flights be cancelled (rare occurrence as far as I'm concerned) just get flight delay / cancellation insurance on a credit card. Remember that people who take the time to write a review usually have a poor experience. I've had one terrible experience with air Canada

### "The worst airline"
Not Verified |  The worst airline. It was delayed about 5 hours so i had to wait 5 hours in Montreal, which has no shop & good restaurants. My trip was really great but this delayed flight made my trip so sad. Never recommend. 2 point for the price. But you should choose another airline.

### "So sick of this airline"
So sick of this airline! Definitely not recommended to travel if u wanna travel hassle free. I have reached them more than 10 times, few times before travelling and about 10 times after travelling via emails, phone calls and no help. Its been more than a month that i have been trying to get my own money back that was over charged. My flight was booked for aug 12, i checked in for a baggage while doing web check in, a day before. Flair system was down and after i enter my credit card, it didn't take me to the confirmation page saying my payment was processed, therefore after half an hour wait, i entered my credit card again and added bag. And then it still didn't took me to the confirmation page. Then, I reached on aug 11 through online chat and then called at customer service, they advised system is down and they cant see the payments or baggage being added and it can be take care of after if i am overcharged. Then at the airport i was advised that they will enter weight under one baggage so i can claim over charged baggage later. Then i sent my bank statement showing i was charged twice. Then i have been told by flair that I cant get my own money that was over charged? I tried reaching customer service over the phone but no help since refund department is only through emails. I have attached my bank statements of being over charged and i don't get any response from flair refunds. While call centre tells me they can see all the emails i sent and they can see how i have been trying to reach flair before i flew for being overcharged. I feel like my time i have spend on this issue is more than the baggage price.

### "flight and route had been cancelled"
Not Verified |  Arrived at the Checkpoint and Flair had cancelled the route and my flight without letting me know. I drove the prior day to the airport area, found a place to stay the night before, arrived at 7:30am to check in. The flight and the route had been cancelled. The only assistance at the counter was “Sorry, didn’t you get the email?”. I did not receive an email. There were several other potential passengers who had the exact scenario. I was out the flight, added charges, the gas to drive the day before and accommodations.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Purchasing experience was good. Then ce check in time. Checking in from Edmonton to Vancouver was ok, had to try a few times on the app to get it through. Plane was ok. Tight seats and expensive snacks. The real headache was the online check in from Vancouver to Edmonton. Tried several times with no success. Tells me my seats are in two very different rows when my purchase agreement shows I paid for seats 5e and 5f. Can't contact anyone via chat. Can't contact anyone on the phone. Horrible Custer service. Will never fly with them again.

### "told that my ticket had expired"
Not Verified |  I originally booked a trip from Montreal to Vancouver on July 5th to return on July 8th. I had to cancel because I caught Covid a week before my departure date. I was fortunate to receive a credit for the ticket. I rebooked to fly for thanksgiving. I received confirmation that I had a trip booked from October 8th to the 11th. I also had to pay a difference of 60$ more for the tickets (meanwhile tickets were almost half the price on the site). When I reached the airport I was told that they could not find a boarding ticket for Montreal to Vancouver, however, they could see one for Vancouver to Montreal. I should them my email and they said they did not understand why they could not find the ticket. I was told to call customer service because they could not do anything. I waited on hold for 2hrs and 2mins before I was able to talk to someone­. I was told that my ticket had expired. I booked the ticket on September 25th, 2022. They approved a refund (not including the 60$) without any hassle when they wouldn`t give me one in July when I had Covid, which makes me realize they messed up on their end. The customer service at the desk was not polite and was actually smiling while my daughter was crying and after I just explained that my son was expecting us for Thanksgiving. My son was the one who suggested I try this airline meanwhile I will warn people about this company! It`s almost like it is a complete scam.

### "my first and last time"
Horrible. Price is affordable and cheap but that does not justify the horrible service. It’s my first and last time booking a flight with this airline- I’ve purchased cheap flights before but the experience had never as horrible as with them. Online check in does not work at all and the website is full of glitches (it had no record of my paid baggages and they’re asking me to pay again + my boarding pass was incorrect and I had to go early to the airport to get it printed out right). I called twice. I asked for assistance and agents over the phone will literally hang up on you while putting you on hold.

### "entire experience was just terrible"
Confusing instruction and frustrating customer service. We were not told by any emails stating that we HAVE to checkin 24 hours prior the departing time to get a lower price carryon fee. When we checked in online, the option of adding carryon bag disappeared and we were forced to add carry on in airport which was $59+tax. Funny how these fees are higher than the flight ticket itself. We would be happier if the customer service was more helpful. Unfortunately, the customer service agents were very disrespectful and impatient with us. We could literally felt that they did not want to talk to us and simply wanted to take the money. The entire experience was just terrible. First time and last time with flair, never again.

### "Staff extremely rude and disrespectful"
Not Verified | If there had been a zero star I wouldn't even give you that. Staff at Edmonton international Airport is extremely rude and disrespectful so is the customer service over the phone. Your staff didn't give me the boarding passes that I had paid for. Your staff closed the counter an hour and 15 minutes before the flight departure time and started checking in for the next flight. Kicked us out of the check-in line and didn't even let us speak to the person at the counter. Your customer service on the phone is exactly the same, rude and disrespectful and has no idea how to work with customers that have paid already. On top of everything you system goes down and we are unable to download our boarding passes. Pathetic airline.

### "Do not fly with Flair"
Terrible Airline. Do not fly with Flair. The ticket agents deemed our identification unacceptable at the Winnipeg Airport. However we had used the same ID when leaving our home in Calgary flying to Winnipeg. But, they would not let us fly home. We are stranded here and cannot go home to get other ID. I only had enough meds to last my trip now stuck without my medications, can't pick up my dog from the kennel on time, And have no way to my passport from home. I can't believe after paying for our flight home that they would not let us board even though we had two pieces of ID showing our birthdate and names.

### "We wasted 12h at the airports"
Not Verified |  My worst experience in any airlines and among the top worst experience with customer service. The flight got pushed back by 2 hours the night before (9:25am flight) but we had planned our itinerary ahead so we were at the airport by 7am. We got notified not once, not two, not three but 4 times in a row that our flight was delayed. +2h then +1h each other times until it got just cancelled 5 hours and 56mins before the initial flight schedule. We then wasted hours to get our luggages reimbursed since the employee at the counter told us to call a number (a wait of up to an hour) who then told us to go at the arrival luggage drop off who told us to go back to the employee at the counter who called a supervisor in the meantime who called higher in the hierarchy of Flair Airlines who told him that the employees were clearly not updated to the last info and that it would take time (as in days) for everyone to receive the proper information. This is not a joke. We wasted 12h at the airports, in emails and on the phone and we are not even done. We finally booked a flight with another airline and we'll never buy a ticket from Flair Airlines again.

### "Do not book with Flair"
Worst airline ever. First off - could not check in online through the website or the app the night before. after chatting with an agent they informed me they would leave a note on my profile saying there was a technical difficulty and I wouldn’t have to pay the check in fee when I got to the airport the next morning. They also told me to show up 2-3 hours early. When I showed up 2 hours early, there was no one at the customer service counter to help me for at least 45 minutes, and when they went to check me in, they informed me that my flight had been cancelled on Monday. My flight was scheduled for Friday. At no point over the course of those four days had I received any form of communication letting me know that my flight had been cancelled. Turns out, they had done the same thing to over half a dozen other individuals who were scheduled for the same flight They then informed me that I could “call customer service for a refund” but couldn’t rebook me for a new flight as there wasn’t one for another 4-5 days. This is the poorest customer service I’ve ever experienced and worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Do not book with Flair, they will screw you over and not even give so much as an apology

### "not recommend this airline"
My bag was lost on a flight from Edmonton to Kelowna. Absolutely nothing has been done to find it, the baggage department does not have a phone number and the multiple emails sent over days have not been answered. Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Months later with little to no communication my bag was never recovered. Flair said they would pay out $2100 and said it would take 2-8 weeks, this came to pass with no sign of money.

### "my experience was very good all along"
First time flying with Flair. I read the reviews before and I was worried but my experience was very good all along. Good service at the airport counter, no extra fees, on time, good service on board, and it costs way less. Was travelling with my baby and it all went smoothly. Their entertainment system is accessible only on your own device via their wifi and works pretty well. Less choice of movie than other airline but I still found pretty interesting stuff. Seat wasn’t super comfortable, but I’m tall so I always say that after taking the plane. To me it was as good as an experience than any other airline I used in the past.

### "Delayed our flight by 12 hours, no email, nothing"
Delayed our flight by 12 hours, no email, nothing, I got a text at 4.30 am saying it was almost time for my flight instead. The last flight we took we paid for seats and someone was sitting in the seats and they said they could do nothing about it “the flight was full” which it was not. This airline is cheap but they are also the poorest run company and have no respect for their customers.

### "They don't have enough flights"
San Francisco to Edmonton. Flair cancelled my flight the night before the morning departure and they failed to offer any alternative other than refund. My original itinerary was suppose to fly out Thursday and Return Sunday morning. But they rebooked me on a flight out Sunday morning and same flight back Sunday morning. What's the point? The rep on the phone is so nonchalant with my issue. Basically just no there's nothing we can do. You can hear from his tone of voice, he isn't even trying at all and can't wait to get me off of the phone. At least Swoop would rebook you with WestJet but Flair can't even do this at the least. They don't have enough flights and they will not rebook you with another airline either. I would recommend Air Canada over this garbage airline.

### "waiting for my bags for the past 2 hours"
Not Verified | Calgary to Toronto. I have been waiting for my bags for the past 2 hours this is honestly the worst airline in the world there is no effort put in to the work and I will not travel again. If you wanna get home on time I suggest you go with other airlines

### "use safety as reason to avoid compensating"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to depart at 9:00 AM on a Monday but the flight was pushed 2 times until 2:00 am the next day Tuesday. However even the 2:00 am flight did not depart until 4:00 am . In total the flight was delayed 17 hours. We got stuck at the airport the whole night waiting for the aircraft to arrive. We were also charged a penalty of changing our flight departure time from pm to am hoping to arrive in Toronto early. Yes we arrived early but early the following day. Lobbied for compensation but they conveniently reasoned that they do not compensate if the delayed was due to safety. They always use safety as reason to avoid compensating passengers.

### "had to pay $61 for our carry on bag"
I can’t really recommend this airline unless you are desperate. We had to pay $61 for our carry on bag and as we boarded the plane we were told that our personal item (a bag) was too large to be a personal item and we would have to pay another $61. We take these items on a regular basis on other airlines with no charge so we were not pleased and ended up paying more than we would have paid with a real airline. Be careful when you book with Flair or you may end up paying more than you think you will have to pay. There’s very little leg room so if your tall you won’t be happy.

### "I may have lucked out on this trip"
Not Verified |  On the first day, we were delayed due to staffing but not by too long, I was travelling with my son on my own and I have never had so much help from staff before with him (He lapped it all up). When boarding we ran into an issue with the phone app boarding passes but soon figured out took an additional 5 mins it was shortly after the app launched so I can see why they would have bugs here and there. Now onto the fun part when flying back I went to check in the night before but couldn't, kept saying that there was a change to my flight so it wouldn't let me check in. after talking to support (which was no help) and getting my husband to talk to them on my behalf  He was at home in another province) he got nowhere. So I showed up early to the airport willing but not happy that I would have to pay extra to check-in. I got there and the girl let me know they were having a problem with their website and waiving all check-in fees. once we got the boarding pass we got on the plane (again late but it was do to airport staff and not the flair airline staff) and when I got to our seats I noticed we were not in the right seats we were placed in an emergency exit seat which is a no-no if you have a child younger than 12. I let the staff know that these were not the seats I paid for. I was moved to the front of the plane for my inconvenience and to make sure that my son was safe. All and all I think I may have lucked out on this trip I am going to try again and see what happens.

### "wasn't able to get a boarding pass"
Not Verified |  I got to the airport at 6 am this morning for my flight at 730 am I checked in the night prior and was unable to open their attachment with my boarding pass on it. I went up to the front desk to get them to print it off and she refused said the gate is already closed. The flight wasn't leaving for almost 2 hours. I have to be in Montreal for work and she said nothing she could do. I chatted online with their "support" all her kept repeating was my flight was off at 730, it was 645 am I don't know if he clued in the time change from where he was but it hadn't even left yet. I paid for a flight, checked in and still was told wasn't able to get a boarding pass. I wrote a email they said well you missed your flight so there's nothing they could do.

### "good value for the money"
Not Verified |  The service was good. There was no delay in flights while the staff were friendly and courteous. The seats could not be reclined back, so I am not sure why the pilot asked to put the seat back in an upright position. Passengers get little or poor sleep since the seats cannot be reclined. Overall, it was a good value for the money.

### "they have poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Please don't ever book this flight. This is extremely disappointing airline since they have poor customer service, we would have to pay extra if we checking on the airport, their portal for boarding pass doesn't work plus there is no guarantee to be seated next to your family, as they select random people as per boarding pass. Not just that they have the audacity on top of that to ask for money in order to have a special seat next to your loved ones.

### "very rudely treated by the ground staff"
Vancouver to Toronto. For some reason the airline wouldn't allow everyone in our family to check in on-line. On calling the airline we were told to go to the airport 3 hours before the flight and they would waive the checking in at airport fee. On arrival at the check in desk 3 hours before, we were told that that there was no record of one of our party who couldn't check in even though we had the flight itinerary with all the passengers showing. We had also paid extra for seats which had extra legroom. After being very rudely treated by the ground staff, and waiting for nearly 2 hours, they eventually found the details of the passenger that was missing and issued boarding passes but not for the seats that we had booked and paid extra. They also charged us for using the check in desks and said we would have to call Flair Airlines for refunds. We are still chasing them for the refund as I write this review. Terrible airline!

### "We will never fly Flair again"
We will never fly Flair again. The cost is only marginally cheaper after paying for all the "extras" like checked luggage and a seat. No free food offered on a 5 hour flight. Best we got was water with ice. They canceled our original flight and we had to reschedule for a later flight. Unfortunately, their system still reminded us several times to check in for the first flight that no longer existed. Our return flight was scheduled for 9:40am but when we attempted to check-in, we were informed that it had been postponed to 3pm. No e-mail or notification was sent. And again, we got reminders to check in for the 9:40am flight. No in-flight entertainment aside from wifi to watch old movies or play terrible games on your cell phone or tablet. Solitaire was available for an extra fee.

### "a don't care attitude"
Terrible company, bought ticket for a boarding time at 3pm, and this company changed it to 6am in the morning without notice. Also left us no other option to make any last minute change, you can either accept or refund it. Our whole vacation plan got ruined. Customer service is rude and give us a don't care attitude. A luggage will cost $130. And you need to pay money to drink water. No on board service what so ever.

### "You get what you pay for"
Not Verified | Calgary to Montreal. You get what you pay for. If you are a budget traveler and absolutely have to travel, Flair Airlines will get you from point A to B just that you might be delayed a few days here and there. The customer service is total garbage and the self service options are limited. I had to cancel part of my journey and they issued credits which is fine but the credits cannot be used online. This is a low cost carrier and they really don't care about customer experience just like most other airlines out there. I would only recommend you book with them if there are no other options available and you are not on a tight schedule.

### "no compassion for any situation"
Not Verified |  I have booked 2 one way tickets to Toronto from Vancouver for October 24th. For 2 passengers it had cost my only $138. These tickets were purchased on August 25th and today is August 31st. I had contact flair airline to change my flight time (same flight date) but just to arrive 6 hours prior. Flair had informed me I would have to pay a charge of $29 each passenger to change these which I believe is very reasonable however the flight difference would cost me an additional $250 on top of the $138 already paid and then the changing penalties, It’s pretty ridiculous, and intentional, absolutely no compassion for any situation.

### "very poor customer service"
Not Verified | Kitchener to Halifax. You get what you pay for. They do offer cheaper flights, but is possibly the worst airline I have ever flown with. This year is my first year flying with them (3 different trips). My most recent experience is this past weekend. I went to Halifax over the weekend. My return trip on Sunday was at 3:45 pm to Kitchener airport. When I got to the airport to check-in, they informed me the flight was cancelled - because the plane wasn't safe to fly. No notice at all about the cancellation. The only available flight for that day was 9:30 at night to Toronto Pearson, we had no choice but to take the flight. We waited in the Airport for 8 additional hours, and then had to take an uber to Kitchener/Waterloo airport to pick up my car. In March I booked a weekend trip to Florida with a bunch of the girls for a girls weekend away, 2 weeks before the flight, they cancelled due to weather conditions? Trying to book a new flight without as much notice, cost me more than double than the original amount paid. They automatically book you on the next available flight which was for this trip on the Monday, the day we were supposed to be returning. Are you kidding? Flying is not cheap. So if you book, be prepared for very poor customer service. Swoop is another cheaper airline, and they are so much better. Even their airport in Hamilton has a little shopping and restaurants. Kitchener has nothing. Good Luck

### "Flair Airlines is not worth the risk"
Not Verified |  We saw the bad reviews of Flair, but decided to risk it. What a mistake! I am writing this review instead of getting ready to drive to the airport, because Flair rescheduled my flight by almost a week, 9 hours before the flight, pushing our family trip with my four kids into the school year, which can't happen. A Flair rep on the chat line just hung up on my wife, who was not being particularly unreasonable. This was after she spent literally hours last night struggling to correct the luggage having disappeared from the tickets. Everything is a mess now. We have reservations at multiple hotels, multiple rental cars, family events and outings planned with relatives. My brothers-in-law took vacation time to spend time with us. My kids are waking up and about to hear. My wife is crying. Do yourself a favour and learn the easy way that Flair Airlines is not worth the risk.

### "Worst experience so far"
Not Verified |  Me and my family's return flight was delayed by 48 hours (1 day before boarding). No reimbursement to hotel, uber, food provided. We stayed in hotel for 48 hours, and before boarding return flight, we received a message of flight delay by 45 mins. We waited, again it got delayed by 30 mins, we boarded the plane and plane took off 30 mins late even after. In total, there were several unexpected delays out of the blue with no reimbursement to what so ever! Worst experience so far I've faced. Do you think we all should fly flair airlines again? I guess NOT!

### "Extremely disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  Extremely disappointing experience. My flight which was booked months in advance, cancelled a day before departure for a reason that was not a surprise. The plane didn't arrive in time from the manufacturer. I spoke to someone who was very rude on the phone who said i should get a reimbursement and compensation. Only for me to be told I can only get an amount of $600 altogether in return even though i had to book a last minute ticket of $1150 to make the destination for my cancelled flight thanks to the late cancellation. I dealt with people who were either rude or couldn't even be bothered to spell my name right in all my exchanges. It was a horrible experience with this airline.

### "don't care about providing even mediocre service"
I am writing this review upon advisement of the airline. They either enjoy reading terrible reviews of their service or just really don't care about providing even mediocre service to their guests. Either way I will get right down to it. I booked a direct flight from Edmonton to Ottawa on August 3rd 2022 for the unfortunate and sudden passing of my Father. Everything seemed hopeful, until we starting boarding. After a 3.5 hour delay due to an unexpected "issue" (which would now have me landing in Ottawa in the middle of the night) we began boarding, we all received an email with a $60 food voucher attached, generous, but unfortunately it was only valid in the Edmonton International Airport on Aug 3, we were already boarded, rendering the voucher useless. The 3.5-4 hour delay had me landing in Ottawa in the middle of the night, I missed my rental reservation with Enterprise (Thankfully they were kind enough to honor the reservation from the night before) I also had to pay $200 for a hotel room. I emailed Flair Air and asked for them to reimburse the cost of my hotel room which I found under the circumstances to be completely reasonable. They declined, and invited me to forward my concerns to the CTA which I will gladly do.

### "Terrible airline, stay away"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline, stay away. They offer cheap tickets, but they are going to ruin your vacation. I got to airport at 4:00am, just to find out the flight was canceled. There were no managers, but 2 junior staff telling people our tickets were rebooked on the next flight, 7 days later. This was a joke. I heard from other people that they waited for hours at the airport if they cannot fill seats, they just cancel the flights at the very last minute.

### "Horrible service"
Horrible service. You pay for seats and its not honored. Lots of confusion in the aircraft. Actually had Flair attendants ask some passengers how they got on the aircraft when they had a clear. I was told by the check in attendant it was a window seat when it wasn't one., and when I complained, Flair claimed there was no record of any exchange to prove my claim.

### "ticket showed that I had no checked bag"
On the day that I booked the flight, I chose to pre-pay for one checked bag. Flair Airlines charged me $67.20 for this. On the day of the flight, I went to check-in online and my ticket showed that I had no checked bag. I called the airline to inquire about this, they put me on hold and after 10 minutes or so disconnected. I was in a hurry to leave for the airport so I paid for another checked bag when completing my online check-in. Also, when I booked the flight I was charged $316.20 for the flight and checked bag. When I received my Mastercard bill it showed a charge of $338.27 not to Flair Airlines but to eDreams BARCELONA ESP. When I called Flair Airlines again to inquire about this the same thing happened as the first time I called: they put me on hold and after 10 minutes disconnected the call.

### "Very poor experience"
Very poor experience. Original booking was for at 9:25am, text message that the flight was at 11:25am. No phone number could be found to call, I had to use the chat. The chat was useless. My account still showed 9:25am as a departure time. Then I received a text that the flight was delayed and to click on a link for departure time. I clicked and put in the information under my account; on the mobile website and the app; both were showing me I had no flights to manage. I had to resort to the chat. Finally got to chat with one agent who confirmed the flight was now at 13:25. At the same time I booked 2 suitcases for baggage check and reserved 5 seats for my family so we could sit together. I was told to pay the extra fees online. Again both the mobile website and app said “no flights to manage”. I woke up at 4am to another text that the flight was delayed yet again! And again the mobile site and app continued to show no flights to manage. Back to the chat I went; 4 different agents and none could help as I had a balance to pay and didn’t seem to stick around long enough to help me figure it out. Finally one said he’d have someone call me. They did at about 6:30am; both my credit card and visa debit card were declined which made zero sense as there was plenty of availability on both cards. I had to call my bank; I did and they confirmed there was no reason on their end that the transaction would not process. They took the time to look into it; they could see the 2 attempts from Flair with the note “Problem connecting to terminal”. The Flair agent had said she’d call back at 8am. At 8:30am still no call back; I decided to try to call the number that displayed on my phone from the original call; it went through and my payment went through this time and so I was advised the flight was now at 13:45pm and to go check in online. I tried and again no access to my reservation online; in fact I got the message that the flight had already departed or was canceled! Back to the chat; checkin at the airport and the check in fees would be waived. Got to the airport; checked in and had to pay for my carryon. As per policy flights delayed over 2 hours meal vouchers are to be supplied; no ticket or boarding agent had any clue about it so I had to feed my family of 5. We get on the flight and start making our way to the row of the paid reserved seats; only to see people sitting in them! Went to see a flight attendant; we weren’t on the flight manifest; yet we stood there with boarding passes in hand and a receipt for reserved seats! About 10 minutes later the flight attendants and CSA determined it was a double booking and managed to find 5 individual seats! I told them I was not going to sit my 3 children among strangers especially after I paid for 5 seats! I got “Mam, we are doing the best we can, it’s a full flight and you are delaying the departure”. They then managed to get 3 seats together, a seat behind that row and an individual seat a few rows ahead. We landed at 20:00. Waited well over an hour for the suitcases. I do not think I will ever book with them again; many others on flight; Aug.19 F8 931, also said never again.

### "the worst flying/customer service experience I’ve ever had"
This was the worst flying/customer service experience I’ve ever had. Our return flight was supposed to be August 16th, Calgary to Ottawa, but was cancelled well after the flight was supposed to take off. They rescheduled us for the next available Flair flight which is August 30th. Literally two weeks after our canceled flight. We have a child at home so obviously this wasn’t going to work. We had to call customer service four times to get anything sorted. They ended up putting us on a Flair flight to Toronto the next day (August 17th) at our suggestion. They then refused to reimburse us for a flight from Toronto to Ottawa, a rental car to get from Toronto to Ottawa, or gas to cover our trip. We’re still not back home in Ottawa and are scrambling to find a way to get home that we can afford. I will absolutely never fly with them again and you shouldn’t either, it’s not worth it.

### "still have not received my bag"
Worst carrier ever Flair lost my bag flying Tor-Van. It still hadn't been located by the time I was scheduled to catch an international flight 2 days later. Customer Service at Van Airport assured me they would forward it to me once it had been found. It was found on the 3rd day. It is now almost 3 months later and I still have not received my bag which Flair told me (in early July) is sitting in Edmonton. They have offered no explanation why it cant be couriered to me. They have offered no compensation and I cant claim on travel insurance as the bag is not official lost. Communication with Flair has been, at best, sporadic, unclear and unhelpful. Under no circumstances should you fly with Flair.

### "I am very disappointed"
My 15 year old daughter and her friend were flying from Edmonton to Kelowna with us last week. She has a cleft and had surgery on her palate (bone graft) plus some wisdom teeth pulled the week prior. She’s had a dozen surgeries but last minute had a set back and needed fluids. She couldn’t fly with us on August 9th. I contacted flair and the following day was going to book her on the flight on the 11th. I was told to contact the medical area to see what they could do for a refund on the initial flight. Originally the flight was $139 when I started calling on the 10th at noon. I was on hold, then spoke to someone who after putting me on hold told me to call another area and the same thing happened there. By the end no one could help me, said I couldn’t get a refund but to try emailing the medical area. I went to book my daughter and after wasting 2 hours calling Flair the flight price has gone up to $359 a person. I had to spend $720 to fly them both up. I sent the medical area an email and got a response that they couldn’t do anything and wrote “we’re sorry your daughter had a tooth issue”. I wish I hadn’t wasted my time contacting Flair - which I was told to do by the check-in area and just paid the $139. Flair, this was my first time flying with you and I am very disappointed.

### "ignoring their responsibility"
Flair has been ignoring their responsibility and obligation for cancelling our flight. Our Flair flight was canceled July 31 and they re-booked us 6 days (150 hours) longer than our initial departure. This change of itinerary was not acceptable. I am writing this letter to bring to the attention of the public the complete lack of assistance and co-operation from Flair representatives: 1st representative on July 31st by phone and 2nd representative by email correspondence from the Compensation Escalation Team. After several correspondences back and forth, it was clear that your representatives were not responding in good faith and was trying to avoid your responsibility and obligation to air passengers.

### "I will avoid Flair in the future"
My flight was canceled (canceled 07 July22, Flight originally for 12 July22). Flair Airlines' cancelation email included a ticket for a departure (2-days later) and an option for reimbursement for alternative travel arrangements (up to $600). I rebooked with United to leave on my original date. This ticket cost $300 more than the Flair flight. I sent a reimbursement request immediately via email (07July22). After six follow up emails and a month and three days (which goes beyond the 30-day response time set by the Canadian Transportation Agency), Flair provided me only with a ticket refund and $125 small airline compensation rate. I asked multiple times via email why I won't get reimbursed. They ignore the question, simply restating that the compensation rate is $125 and that they'll need either a canceled cheque or a "direct deposit slip" (a direct deposit slip is typically what you would provide your employer so they directly deposit your salary into your bank account. I provided a "Deposit Ticket" from my checkbook. They then said that they need a Voided cheque. I provided this and restated my question: why was I promised reimbursement for the alt. travel arrangements in the initial cancelation email and why am I being denied that reimbursement now? Again, ignored the question and said they don't have to give me anything and that this is the final communication. It's beyond frustrating to rely on someone's promise only to be lied to. Flair consistently communicated poorly throughout and violated their own Tariff Agreement and CTA regulations, albeit minor ones controlling communication. I know this isn't a situation where I was stranded on a tarmac for days but it is nevertheless frustrating. I will avoid Flair in the future and I hope you do, too.

### "he was kicked off the plane"
Not Verified |  My brother was supposed to fly from Calgary to Abbotsford BC and he was removed from the plane because of his walking. He was actually sitting in his assigned seat and he was kicked off the plane. My brother is a stage 4 alcoholic who is in the process of dying due to liver and kidney issues but there was no threat that he would die on the plane as he still has several more months of suffering before that happens. His walking is impacted by severe arthritis in his spine that he is not being treated for and, among other complications, he has shortness of breath as a complication of alcoholism. He had a few drinks before boarding the plane because he is a severe alcoholic and without those drinks he would be at risk of dying on the plane. He flew in the exact same condition 2 weeks prior with Flair Air from BC to Calgary - and he required a wheelchair to board and disembark. He did not cause any problems during any interactions with any Flair Air staff when he was asked to leave the plane or at any time while waiting to get on the plane. He is a calm, docile man who would have happily sat in his seat, followed all rules and instructions and disembarked without any problems except the use of a wheelchair. Instead, he is denied his flight home, taken off the plane in a wheelchair and wheeled directly to 2 police officers who he once again had to explain his health to. They promptly wished him a good day. I feel that my brother was discriminated against because he is simply an end-stage alcoholic. The flight attendants said "you smell like alcohol, have you been drinking? He explained his health conditions to them three times, but this did not matter as he had to leave the plane. He was at no time disruptive, out of line or inappropriate - he was even wearing his mask. As a consumer and frequent flyer I am fully aware that people who have been drinking are still allowed to fly. As a matter of fact, airports and airlines serve liquor/booze to people knowing they are going to fly and while in the air flying. I have also had the opportunity to observe disabled people, who could not walk at all, board and fly without difficulties. So, what's up? In speaking with a man from Flair Air's customer service, I found out the following. First, there are no notes explaining why he was kicked off the plane. Their notes report that he was a "no-show" when they actually had him boarded and sitting in his seat. Then the agent tells me that no-one who boards their planes are allowed to have any alcohol. I point out that airports have lounges in departure areas that serve travelers alcohol and airline flight attendants push carts down the aisles of planes selling passengers alcohol. No response from the agent. The agent reported my brother must have been drunk! I asked him if anyone bothered to test him to see if he was drunk as he has numerous health issues. Nope, just the assumption that the quiet man, who smells of alcohol is drunk. They are refusing to reimburse his ticket cost, but really, that's the least of it as my brother was supposed to be at the hospital in BC today for more medical tests but instead he is still in Alberta without a way home.

### "brutally poor customer service"
Not Verified |  We had our flight cancelled after a 2.5 hour delay due to lack of staff. The flight was full and the confusion that followed when it was cancelled was atrocious. The Flair staff had no idea what to do nor where to send the passengers. We were offered a refund or to spend the next 72 hours in a hotel in Vancouver to fly with Flair on their next flight out ... wonder if it actually flew out? We were supposed to be at work the next day and a lot of other passengers had child care issues and work commitments also. We were not offered help to get on other flights, which the majority ended up doing as people needed to get home. We have since been trying to get compensation (10 months now!) for Flair's controllable issue of staffing but to no avail. The brutally poor customer service and run-around by this company is unacceptable.

### "disregard for customer service"
From start to finish the incompetence and disregard for customer service & experience from Flair has been infuriating. They first moved out 10:50 am flight to 10:50 pm, a 12 hour delay with two weeks notice. As the only airline that flies direct to our specific destination, we could not reschedule our flight because this red-eye was consequentially the only time they were offering for the entire week once we were notified of the change. We lost a whole day of our trip because of this change. Their app does not work. It took 2-3 days to even list our flight and then would never display the details of the booking. Check-in was even worse. It showed that check-in was available, but then when I clicked "check in" it said that it wasn't available and send me on this repeating cycle of reminders and roadblocks. What normally takes 10 minutes with other airlines took an hour and a combination of their website check-in platform with chat support before we could actually get checked in. While at the airport the text message notifications sent us to the wrong gate multiple times. It kept saying that D26 was our gate when it was actually D27 and the gates were far enough a part that no one would have known unless they thought to look at the airport board. The old man who sat next to us on the flight nearly missed it because of this false information continuously being given by Flair. He also shared our frustrations with check-in, having spent 3 hours over the phone with Flair before finally getting checked-in. After the trip I tried to contact flair to complain or receive compensation for this 12 hour delay, and they did not reply within 30 days. I then had to follow up with them via email AND chat before getting a response. At which point the customer service was incompetent and clearly did not actually read a single one of my emails. Despite repeating myself on four different emails (it was even in the subject line) that my complaint was referring to the 12 hour delay, not one person addressed my complaint and instead continued to reiterate that the 1 hour additional delayed that happened on the day of travel doesn't qualify for compensation because it's less than 3 hours. The only thing that did not go wrong was the aircraft itself, although having to take a red-eye flight on an aircraft where the seats can't recline at all is awful. It is also hard to comment on the cain crew because other than the safety announcement and collecting garbage they didn't do anything. If you're flying for any amount of time over an hour, maybe two, never use this airline. If you do, be prepared for poor communication, changing times, cancellations, discomfort, and a lack of any competent assistance. With the extra charges required for baggage and seat selection, the amount saved by using flair was negligible and certainly did not make it worth it.

### "mentioned some absurd rules"
Not Verified |  They cancelled the flight 24 hours before the scheduled time and said we can either wait another day to get a new flight or can book flight of our own and we will be reimbursed up to 600/passenger. We confirmed this over phone and ended up taking an Air Canada flight for 700+ dollars. We forwarded the Air Canada ticket to them requesting for reimbursement. I had to send a follow up again after 10 days to get a response from them saying that they are giving me 125$ reimbursement per ticket and mentioned some absurd rules. I mentioned that no such conditions was mentioned in the initial email and for which they didn't respond anything. The customer service chat/ phone cannot help you with reimbursement. The wait for phone support is more than 2 hours and you get either a cold or condescending employee who don't care much about service and would just mutter printed answers. If you find it cheap you can book it but don't book hotels and other tickets trusting them, cancelling and denying reimbursement what you might have to face. Also never book them for any time specific, or important meetings. Never Again Flair.

### "Its so messed up"
Having flown with them once and it being ok I decided to give it another go as it is the only airline that does direct to Vancouver from Burbank. When they actually provide the service they aren't bad. Flight Out from Burbank to Vancouver was delayed but the airport staff were very nice. The return flight was a joke. I was due to fly out Thursday 7th July. They Cancelled this Flight Wednesday the 9th and scheduled me for the 10th of July. I spoke to customer service and they guaranteed that this flight would go ahead 100%. So I trusted them. On Thursday the 7th Flight was cancelled again and rescheduled for Thursday 14th of July. I had to get back for work and my only option was to rebook with another airline which might I add with no assistance from Flair. The flights were astronomical in price due to last minute. Flair Offered with the second cancellation via email to reimburse up to $600 CAD id you choose this. No flights on my original route were in this price range and even having to fly to LAX it was just under $600. I also had to figure how to get home from there. Flair refunded what I paid for original ticket with them. They told me I had to submit a claim for reimbursement of the alternative ticket and delay compensation for original flight cancellation - two separate cancellations. Well they will lump it into one claim. Subtract the refund they provided you off the alternative ticket (which I do understand). However you either get the reimbursed for the ticket or the low compensation for the original cancellation. Its so messed up. I thankfully had free accommodation but if I had been paying for a hotel and included this in my claim I would not have been reimbursed as "I choose to fly with an alternative airline" after the second cancellation. All within their control! I will be making a formal complaint against them. I missed work due to the original cancellation and due to the short notice leaves the customer with very few options. Not to mention have to chase them for reimbursement.

### "most stressful flying experience"
Toronto to Vancouver. This has got to be the worst airline and i've heard some pretty horrible stories. There is absolutely no benefit to flying with Flair. Even if you're the cheapest human on this Planet just trying to save a buck, do yourself a favour and pick any other airline. It's NOT worth the stress over the couple extra bucks they claim to save you. Starting with the fact that they charge you to bring every single thing on board with you. I'm not sure what the point in claiming to have cheaper fares is, only to charge people for every piece of baggage, sock, and item you bring on. You end up paying the save as any other flight, and at least they don't charge you for a carry on in most cases. So that already leaving a bad taste in my mouth, they charge you for your carry on + a checked bag should you choose to check one. When your on board there is no complimentary beverages. Not even water, you are expected to pay. There is no wifi on flight. They do have an app which you can watch movies & tv shows. However, if they can provide such then they should be able to provide Wifi. It's 2022. No drinks & no wifi on board makes for a fantastic flight! If that sounds like your idea to your start or end of a trip than Flair is the airline for you. I really wish I had known that prior to boarding. My flight was delayed for two hours which would have been nice to know prior to boarding. They gave us no email or even an announcement at the airport. You only knew it was delayed when you got to your gate or if you happened to skim a Schedule list. Where things got really fun was on my return trip from Toronto to Vancouver. I received an email the night before my flight this time, letting me know my flight was delayed. What I didn't realise was they delayed me until August 10th, with their excuse being a "Controllable late arrival from previous station caused by an operational delay" as stated in my email from them. Upon speaking with their live chat I'm told "They moved my flight to August 10th" No further explanation. What I don't understand is how they're unable to have more frequent flights to two of the countries most popular destinations, and they're boasting providing service to all of Canada. Wondering how many other people got cancelled today, or any other day for the week. I was provided a 'bunk' email from my live chat rep from Flair, and when I emailed the address I received an automatic email saying my message was "blocked". Dealing with Flair has been the most stressful flying experience I've ever had, but I will never make that mistake again.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
Tried to fly from Windsor to Halifax. Flight was delayed 3 times before departure. That was just the tip of the iceberg. We were turned around mid flight and landed in Ottawa. We were told to wait for an email for further information. This email was never sent. The entire flight of 100+ passengers were stranded at Ottawa airport. Flair had 3 hours to get a customer service Rep to their "base" in Ottawa. Upon reaching customer service on the phone, no one working at Flair was aware we turned around to Ottawa. This was after 3 and a half hours of us being stranded in the Ottawa airport. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Flair Airlines is not worth the discount for an incompetent experience. I cannot get a boarding pass for check-in with this company's disastrous online checkin system. When I do, it's never electronic. They've been having the same error for two weeks. They won't offer compensation or anything other than "sorry, we're experiencing errors with our computer booking system. I will never fly with them again.

### "don’t appreciate delays"
Not Verified |  Please, opt not to fly with Flair if you don’t appreciate delays and flight staff with horrible manor. Beyond receiving multiple emails before the flight—each reporting a new delay length, passengers could not leave the plane after it landed as they were having more challenges. The flight attendants were disrespectful and made folks harshly aware of their disorganization.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. First I couldn't log in with my reservation code and later they cancel my flight altogether. I was told I could book another flight free of charge but they only had 1 flight that day at an inconvenient time. They simply said: well we tried, here's your money and good luck. Now I'm stuck booking another flight far more expensive than what I paid for my round trip.

### "Terrible, terrible service"
I booked two separate flights. One from Saint John to Toronto and return and one from Toronto to Winnipeg and return. I had paid for my seats and extra baggage on each of these bookings. I was contacted by Flair that my flight from Toronto to Saint John would be delayed my 2 days. I inquired as to whether they would cover the cost of hotels, meals and transportation in Toronto and I was informed that I had been advised 14 days prior to the flight from Toronto to Saint John and they would not cover this and if I wanted I could file a complaint with Canadian Transportation Agency. I requested a reason why the flight had been delayed and was told it was for “Operational Reasons”. This essentially stops any recourse with CTA. I then had to rebook my flight from Winnipeg to Toronto at my own expense to connect with the delayed flight. This is great if you have unlimited funds but I am retired and on a pension. I had paid for my seating on both bookings and when I arrived at the airport in Winnipeg to go to Toronto, I was informed my seat had automatically been assigned by their computer system. Again no refund. The flight was then delayed by two hours and it was a good thing there was a long layover in my flight from Toronto to Saint John otherwise I would have missed that flight. I was also never informed of the percentage reduction of the cost of my flights due to the fact that I am a veteran either. I went on line to check on a refund for the seating error and the “chat bot” could not answer the question and I would be connected with a live agent. After the live agents hung up on me three times, I gave up with no way to have my questions answered. The customer service (and I’m using that term loosely) is not existent. Terrible, terrible service. The only bright spot was the flight attendant supervisor on my flight from Toronto to Saint John was funny and had the passengers laughing when he got on the speaker. The other flight attendants were very professional and made accommodations for passengers if it was possible. For this I am very thankful. Would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. I had a terrible experience with Swoop Airline and now with Flair. Apparently I am not meant to fly discount airlines.

### "no ground staff available"
Told twice gate was changed. Get to the airport and told the flight was delayed. 24 hours, no ground staff available for questions. Would you not think they would be. Back to Halifax and now the refund process for accommodation etc. Flight left 45 min late Still waiting on Tarmac for a gate. Time for this so far 40 minutes.

### "No complaints!"
No complaints! We were a bit nervous because of some reviews but we purchased on a seat sale we just couldn’t say no to. I’m 5’10 with long legs, my husband is 6’1, also long legs and a big guy. We were in the second last row. It was cozy but fine. The flight crew were all very nice and had fun personalities when going through the safety stuff. We had no delays at all. We only brought carry on so I can’t say how luggage went. No perks like USB ports, wifi, screens, etc., but clean, comfy enough and cheap. You can’t go wrong.

### "Just really bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight to the USA, they notified me the flight was cancelled with no explanation. I tried to request a refund over the phone multiple times but no one answered the phone. The link to make changes to your cancelled flight on their email did not work nor does it show a refund option. Just really bad customer service.

### "One of the worst flights"
One of the worst flights I have ever flown. Food not available, seats are uncomfortable, flight got delayed. Also, if you wish to change to another seat they will charge a fee even if the whole aircraft is unoccupied which is super weird.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  They happily took my money then canceled my flight with about a weeks warning. They didn't offer anything in the way of help to get me back home and only offered to put me on flights that I either couldn't make due to my connecting flights or that were hopelessly far in the future. They didn't offer any other help or compensation, and no one I talked to (after spending hours on hold) even acted like the airline had done anything wrong. I ended up having to book last minute on another airline myself, costing me another 800 dollars. I will never fly this airline again, they took my money then stranded me on the other side of the country and didn't care.

### "still no refund, very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Originally, my flight was supposed to be at 10:40AM. I drove half an hour to the airport and when I arrived, I got a message that my flight was delayed until 5PM. I drive back home, and find another text message saying that it's delayed again until 8:40PM. I arrive at the airport at 7PM and get a text that we are boarding at 8PM. A few minutes later, a text that the flight is cancelled. There are no representatives to be found at the airport and the phone lines are down due to a network issue. I try to change my flight on my phone and the flair website won't work. I find a Flair representative at the departures desk who tells me that he cannot change the flight for me, I have to user the online chat. After a couple hours, I finally talk to someone and manage to change my flight. I wake up the next morning, and have a text message that my flight is delayed 2 hours already. At that point, I decide to cancel my trip altogether. I contact Flair again and ask for a refund. They tell me it will be up to 10 business days for a refund. It has now been 10 days and still no refund. Very disappointed.

### "Really impressed overall"
Amazing customer service in Ottawa. Really impressed overall. Paid for extra baggage and found it easy. Super nice people every step of the way. I would definitely fly with them again.

### "awful customer experience"
Not Verified |  Really awful customer experience. I couldn't add baggage or choose a seat. Finally got through with someone who disconnected the chat prior to answering all of my questions and the payment option wasn't showing online. I finally got an updated cart value and she had added $348 in addons rather than the single seat and carry on. Called in to see if I could get it adjusted, he also hung up on me.

### "It’s very frustrating and disappointing"
Not Verified |  My luggage was lost for almost a month now. I’ve been contacting their customer service agent multiple of times through emails and calls but no responses. It’s very frustrating and disappointing. My medications, important papers and lots of my valuable items were there. Do not fly through this Airline, they don't care about their passenger’s belongings and no responses from them at all. I will never fly through Flair ever again, even if its free!

### "Will never fly with Flair again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly with Flair again. Flying home from Charlottetown with my sister and 90 year old mother at 11 p.m., arrived at Airport 8 p.m. Monday, July 18th. Dropped keys off for rental car in drop box after arriving at airport 3 hours of flight. Go to Flair to check in. No representative at counter. Someone from other airline inform us flight from Flair was cancelled. Nothing showing on screen at airport. No e-maul or text flight was cancelled. Try calling Flair with no success. After 2 hours on phone informed flight left at 10:00 a.m. and next available flight is Friday, July 22nd at 10:30 a.m. Stranded at Airport with no car and no place to stay for night. Get car back at double the price. Don't get a place to stay until after 11:30 p.m. very stressful, while my 90 year old mother is sitting in a wheelchair for almost 4 hours.

### "forced to pay more during airport check-in"
The Flair website doesn't work as expected for at least 2 weeks (July 2022). Cannot complete the process to add a bag or to correct details or to do online check in. For that, I was forced to pay more during airport check-in, and it didn't interest them and there wasn't anyone to complain in front of because the employees during check in aren't Flair (they just hire them for this operation). Both flights had delays! First has delay of 3 hours, second had 4 hours. No compensations of course or any will to help in those cases. The airplanes are just like buses with wings.

### "Never, never again"
Not Verified |  Flight from Ottawa to Charlottetown at 13.20 on July 18. Received an email at 11 pm the night before to advise that the flight time has been changed to 07.20 in the morning. Since I was already in bed, I missed my flight. I call to customer agent to complaint about it, that it's not right to change it like that but he said I was entitled to any refund. Try to book me on an Air Canada flight the next day for 1,200$ for 2 one way. I said it was not acceptable and he hung up. Never, never again.

### "Just book with a different airline"
I know it’s cheap, but you end up paying for it by losing an entire day. Flight was scheduled for 8:05, and got changed to 6:20pm. Same thing happened to my husband, same times. If the flight is not full, they will delay it. This resulted in loosing an entire day with my husband, who I only see once every couple of months because he’s in the Navy. They don’t care about you as a customer. Just book with a different airline.

### "Never ever fly with these guys"
Not Verified |  Apart from the flight being changed by three ours we also paid for our baggage online before we left - money taken from our account. Got to check in - no record of it on the computer. We had to pay again. The Desk clerk said this is happening all the time. Try and get a refund! We cant get any answer from any of the numbers emails - the person we spoke to said we don't do refunds and hung up - this really is Fraud. Never ever fly with these guys.

### "It was such a disaster"
Never Fly Flair Airlines. It was such a disaster. First I arrived at airport two hours ahead at 8.30pm as my flight was supposed to be at 10.30 pm. In Edmonton, everything was closed for the night all restaurants etc, all shops were closed also. I went to counter to ask where to go, after they viewed my boarding pass, they told me Flair does not allow pets in cabin! Yea right, I when through heck the week prior booking my pet in cabin. finally after much trouble the chat people finally assured me i was good to go. First they told me it is only handled through email, I tried that three times only to get a response that it has to go through the chat line, i finally found a phone number only to get a recording saying to email or go to chat. After arguing with the third chat person, they finally told me all was booked. I got to desk at 8:30 only to hear they knew nothing about my pet in cabin and also told me flair does not have pet in cabin. even thou if you know where to look on their website which is very unclear, i found it. I spoke to supervisor and after 45 minutes finally got it settled. What a hassle. Now when i entered the gate area, everything was closed, I could not even buy bottled water. After going to the gate 12, by the way, I am semi disabled, walking was not good on my knees, and finding a cart was impossible. anyway i got to gate and asked them where to purchase water, but then said way back at gate 54, and also the flight was delayed one hour as well. I told them I could not do any more walking but all they said was, sorry, no offer of finding a cart or anything. I had no choice but to walk back to security to find a bar, fortunately they did have bottled water expensive $4.25 each small bottle. after walking back to gate as the first delayed hour there was another delay for an additional hour. So i asked the people at the gate for a dog area. My pet was thristy and needed to go. They said it was at the other end of the airport. Now what. My poor pet didn't know what to do. She ended up soiling her carrier. What could i do but go to washroom and wash everything I could. Then finally we boarded but at the same time as the other flair airline flight to Abbotsford. so disorganized. Once on board, the attendant was very kind but since she did not know edmonton airport she could not comment on any thing that was happening. After taking off, they annouced that no snacks or drinks will be offered tonight, I know the flight is only 1.5 hours but really? airport was closed, no pop machines either, flight delayed over two hours, and not refreshments were being offered? I feel sorry for any of the elderly people traveling and also people with children, since all liquids are emptied at security and no where to purchase even bottled water. Oh yeah sure, they had water fountains all around, but after this pan demic - Covid-19 no one wants to drink form those fountains nor even get water to drink from them. And I don't blame them. Now the only reason Flair Airlines is getting a 1 out of 10 below is only because I could not give a 0 out of 10. Otherwise this is what they would get.

### "They are an awful airline"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever - both legs - to and from Winnipeg from Toronto were delayed 4 hours the first leg and now 2 plus hour return. They are an awful airline - cant even checkin online - their dumb system is "under update" - really 0 an update for the last 4 days. Stay away from this airline

### "I am still fighting to try to get my refund"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight for my brother and I to fly from Windsor to Halifax. Our flight was cancelled and I was given the option to receive a refund. I filled out the paperwork and received a message the next day that I was not eligible for a refund as I had rebooked. I did not rebook, I explicitly told them I wanted a refund, because the date that was offered was actually the day we were scheduled to return. If I were you, I wouldn't trust this airline. I am still fighting to try to get my refund.

### "Do not fly Flair"
Not Verified | Calgary to Abbotsford. This flight was booked for my daughter. I asked for wheel chair assistance and had booked a seat which would provide extra room. She waited in line to check in over an hour and was then told she was too early she would have to come back. She asked for a wheel chair as she was unable to stand that long and was told they had none even though she could see them chained up against a wall. They would not unchain them or even attempt to assist her. When she boarded she was assigned a different row and seat. One that was not what I had paid for and it seemed there was no fee for this row or seat. I have attempted to call, email and chat with flair but to no avail. I wonder for the return of $37.50 it is worth my time sitting on a phone. Do not fly Flair.

### "an airline that won’t speak to customers"
Calgary to Victoria. Had an incident of double booking a flight, both approximately $400 with Flair, as a result of a slow loading website of theirs. I thought it would be no problem to cancel one and keep another, I spent days leading up to my flight on hold for about 8 hours of hold in total. I didn’t even speak to an operator once, tried everything they told me to do email, SMS, emergency email, wait on hold for HOURS. To no avail, it’s been almost 3 weeks since my initial attempts and I have yet to even speak to someone. Very upsetting and a waste of $400 doubt I’ll ever be flying with an airline that won’t even speak to customers about problems.

### "Do not fly Flair"
Not Verified |  Do not fly Flair. 3.5 hour delay, no organization when boarding the plane. When they did start to board the plane, they paused to boarding to allow another flight to offload. Another 1 delay. Cart to get a drink took 45 minutes to make it down the aisle. Food options were terrible. With a flight delay of 3.5 hours, by the time we reached the flight, my son was hungry and there are no decent snacks. I chose this airline to save a few dollars and that was a big mistake. The App for inflight entertainment didn't work. We flew back on a different airline and the experience was much better!

### "I wanted a refund"
Not Verified |  Flair Airlines delayed this flight over 2.5 hours today. And when the flight finally was ready to take off they discovered it was overfueled. This meant we would need to fly an extra hour or so in air in order to burn off fuel. I booked this trip as a day trip last minute (due to some other cancellations). I had 2 meetings I would have been able to attend if flights were on time. After the first delay, I would have been late to the first meeting but still able to make it to the second. After discovering the fuel overage, I would have missed the second meeting. I would have flown to Vancouver only to sit at the airport for a few hours and come right back. I talked to several service people and they said a refund wouldn't be an issue. When it came time to speak to service agent on the phone, there was nothing they could do since the flight was only 2.5 hours delay. They didn't count being in the air an extra 1 or so a delay. I wanted a refund as I never even left the airport and didn't make it to any of my meetings. Customer service in person was nice but not helpful. Customer service online and on the phone were not helpful at all and couldn't look past what the their policies were. I think Flair truly needs to rethink how they handle their customer service training.

### "just had the worst experience with Flair"
We just had the worst experience with Flair airlines. I tried to check in online June 23rd and online checking was not working. I contacted support (which took a long time to get through) and they told me to check in at the airport. We woke up to find that our flight was delayed from 7:55am to 9:30am. Luckily, we had not left yet so this was not an issue. We arrived at airport at 6:00am (3.5 hours before departure time) as we wanted to make sure we had plenty of time to check in and pass security. We went to wait in line which was already pretty big considering time and found out they were checking in another flight going to Florida before they would start checking in for New York. Asking around it seemed that everyone had issue checking in online. The line started moving very slowly at about 6:30am. We slowly made our way up to the counter and finally at counter after 9am. There were only 3 counters open for hundreds of people trying to check in. While at counter we also encountered delays saying we hadn’t paid for baggage for my daughter which we had. I was showing confirmation and the attendant still needed to call in. We had also paid for seat selection, and they were seating us separately. We told them seating was fine as we were getting close to departure time. They confirmed flight was again delayed to 9:50am and that more then half a flight was still behind us and still needed to be checked in. We quickly went through security and ran to Gate 8 which was on boarding pass as we heard they were doing last call for boarding which again we were very surprised about because of all the people behind us that had not checked in. When we got to Gate 8, they told us that it was wrong gate and we were directed by another airline to gate A18. When we got there, there were several other people there that also missed the flight and several others that ran in behind me. The staff at the gate was very unsympathetic and very unhelpful. The took our names to give refund. We explained that we needed to get to New York as we had non refundable hotel booked and we were not able to reschedule trip. They were very quick to leave us (group of at least 20). We went to Flair counter to find out what to do and where luggage was that was checked in. Again, manager and staff were not very helpful and actually very rude almost insinuating that we missed flight because we got there late. When we asked about our luggage, they directed us to go to baggage claim and that it should be out in 30-45 minutes. We waited. Nothing came. When we asked at Flair counter at baggage claim, the girl said she was not working and couldn’t help us and directed us back up to the Flair counter. When we went up the manager told us to keep waiting downstairs. When we asked her to confirm that luggage was at there, she mentioned that she did not have the right shoes to go check for us. We couldn’t rebook our new flight until we knew where our luggage was. Finally, after many hours (approx. 2:30pm), our luggage came out. At this point all flights out of Pearson were extremely expensive and few so we ended up finding a flight with Porter out of Billy Bishop airport. By speaking to many people that were in line after us in check in, they were all turned away before

### "service agents were very untrained"
The service agents were very untrained they told me that Flair did not allow any pets in cabin. It was a nightmare booking the flights on line but even worst trying to book my service dog in cabin. The website had no information about it rather nowhere I could find. The chat line only answered during the day and still told me to email [email protected] which I attempted to do three or four times only to get an automatic reply telling me to contact them through there chat line only. Again tried the chat line for them to again insist to email they only, I found a phone number finally only to get a recording to contact them through email or chat line only. When I arrived at the airport check in they did not know about dogs in cabin and did not recognize my service papers for my dog. Insisting also a copy is not acceptable only the original will do. Also after telling them the trouble I had getting my dog booked on my flight they found nothing. After 4 attempts with the chat line last week the chat line assured me all was booked and not to worry just go to airport they will allow it. That did not happen and since it was about 8:30 pm getting through to the chat line again was not happening. One agent at the airport told me I needed an email from the chat line and that was the only way to make it happen. Seems to me the supervisors of all these agents were out of touch with what is what.

### "Please NEVER use Flair"
Not Verified | Toronto to Winnipeg. On Jun 25, 2022, the line to get the boarding pass was of over 200 people and took us over 3 hours at Toronto airport. After that they delayed the flight F8311 for 2 more hours with the excuse they were loading the bags. Once in Winnipeg only 5 bags came on the flight, today is July 04 2022 and I haven’t receive my bag. Anytime I call Flair they hang up on me, only once they responded and said they will find my bag but Flair is not making responsible or paying for my bag. I have sent messages on the chat and still no response. Please NEVER use Flair, you will lose not only the whole day with the delays but also will loss your belongings.

### "said the left an hour before flight"
We were an hour before flight to get boarding pass. Online tickets said that we have to be 45 minute before flight. Attendants were not there. Us and 8 people more were waiting for them. We talked with Information desk few times and they try to call them 3 times but no luck. After an hour attendant showed up and said the left an hour before flight.

### "Will be seeking all manner of redress"
Not Verified |  Cancelled my flight via text at 630am for 1030 departure. Next available flight in 2 days. Had to grab a flight with a real airline. That went smooth. Will be seeking all manner of redress via passenger protection regs. Never again.

### "ridiculously unhelpful in providing options"
The airline cancelled my flight and was ridiculously unhelpful in providing options. First they suggested me waiting to get another flight 4 days later. And when I called to complain, there was zero initiative applied in trying to resolve the issue. Vague information about accommodations and telling me they can't guarantee me staying in one location if I chose to wait for their suggested flight. In addition to these, they also could not book me a connecting flight that would get me back to work faster because my original flight wasn't a connecting one. In summary, they cost me about 20% of my monthly pay, because I had to find a solution to the problem myself. The alternative was to take their option and probably be out of a job. I told them this by the way, and they were adamant that there was nothing they could do. Lesson learned. Albeit, a very expensive one. Never using them again. Will never recommend them. Not even to my enemies.

### "refused to fairly compensate us"
One of the worst experiences with an airline ever. I knew it was a budget airline and didn’t expect any bells and whistles but I didn’t expect to be “consolidated” with a flight two days later. They dumped over 300 people and told us they would fly us home in two days. Interestingly, Flair sends lots of annoying text messages about our upcoming flight but when it came to tell me about cancelling out flight home they send an email at 2.13 am? Fortunately, we checked our email at 600 am and were able to get seats on another airline. Most of the plane wasn’t so fortunate. My partner and I had to get home for work and staying two more days was not an option. Finally, to add insult to the who matter, Flair refused to fairly compensate us. Thanks for the ruined vacation Flair.

### "Will never fly Flair again"
Not Verified |  Flight to Halifax got cancelled last minute. Both the newly booked departure date and the original return date were on the same day. Had to rebook my entire trip to visit a dying family member and they still upcharged me $130 to rebook my trip. The reason for the cancellation was a Crewing issue. Flair's issue not ours yet we still had to pay an upcharge. Brutal customer service. Will never fly Flair again.

### "Horrible service in the plane"
Horrible service at the desk. Horrible waiting time. Horrible service in the plane (can't even get a glass of water for free). Horrible seats in the plane.

### "Terrible customer support!"
Terrible customer support! I was trying to contact Flair customer support. Neither of the contact methods they provided works. I tried calling, emailing, messaging, using chatbot, even facebook message. It's been a week and I haven't got any response from they yet! When calling and holding on the line, it cancels the call by itself after 1 hour!

### "hesitate to book with these guys again"
Not Verified |  The airline canceled the service from Ottawa to Kelowna. Despite having the ability to still fly us to Kelowna through a connection, they refused to provide this service and rebook us through Calgary. Service agent helping me was unwilling to provide any answers to my questions and only to offer a refund. He eventually left our chat without any explanation. The skeptic in me thinks the airline is reneging on flights booked months ago at lower costs so they can try and recoup their costs that have gone up due to inflation. I would hesitate to book with these guys again. For many flights, they are no longer budget and WestJet/Air Canada are competitive in price.

### "shameful customer experience"
Not Verified | Beaumont to Kelowna. I'm not going to sit here and waste even more time, all I'm going to say is I will never fly with this airline ever again. Even if I got a free ticket I would still not fly, useless in all categories, shameful customer experience. I now wish they did get thrown out of Canada.

### "Flair denied reimbursement"
We were 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids). My return flight (Calgary to Ottawa) was supposed to depart at 11:45am, May 8th. On that day, it was delayed several times, changed to connected flight(Calgary to Winnipeg to Ottawa), delayed again, and finally cancelled. Flair offered me to take the connected flight of May 12th, which made no sense. Flair agents (customer support) didn’t even try to find any other option for me, and just told me to choose taking the flight or getting refunded. I myself found the direct flight of May 10th. It was the only option I could choose. To make this change, I had to be online for 3 hours, and I also had to be on phone for more than 1 hour, which already ruined my precious vacation. I had to stay around Calgary area to spend unpredicted 2 days and 6 hours. But Flair didn't offer anything for my extra stays. It’s absolutely Flair’s fault. For hotels, rent car, for meals, I had to spend hundreds dollars. But Flair denied reimbursement because the delay was made on "technical issue".

### "they decided my bag is too large"
Not Verified |  While I understand cheaper flights come with some compromises, I don’t believe poor quality of service and last minute expenses are worth it. I have been a frequent traveller with flair, using the same personal bag for work (6 flights in 2 months all flair) 3 different airports. I most frequently fly into Waterloo. This is the first time I’ve left Waterloo and they have decided (my bag that fits under my seat even when I’m in the middle) is too large and charges me a last minute $60. How are you gonna charge someone on a return flight, I’m going back with the exact bag I came with. I was told I have been receiving free bags during my flight and the airports aren’t doing their job.

### "All the reviews are true"
All the reviews are true. Arrived at the airport on time was told flight was on time. 1 hour before departure was told flight delayed by 5 hours because they they had a mechanical failure with another aircraft and they were taking our aircraft to replace the broken aircraft. When I asked customer service rep his exact words were "you get what you pay for! Swoop was $150 more. Oh and after I bought and paid for tickets my credit card was charged another $500 for fees. Not reputable at all! Crooked and dishonest!

### "certain my luggage has forever been misplaced"
I flew with Flair from Edmonton to Kelowna and on my return flight they misplaced my baggage. How my baggage got missing in the first place is beyond me because it was a 45 minute direct flight. Anyway I go to the flair counter and fill out a delayed baggage form, I was told that I would receive a call from them later that day, I didn't So I called their customer service number and was told that my issue would be escalated to their baggage department and I would hear from them in 72 hours. 72 hours goes by and still no word so I call them again and now they tell me that I have to email the baggage department directly myself, which is supper annoying because they should just have told me to do that in the first place. Anyway I email the department a week goes by and the only responses I get is that they are waiting for communication from the airport. So I go back to the airport myself and speak with a supervisor who confirms they don't have my bag. It has been 2 weeks at this point so I'm certain my luggage has forever been misplaced. I ask for a refund for my things but apparently the only way to get a refund is through the baggage department that I've been emailing for the past 2 weeks and all they say is they are waiting for communication. I got a number from the supervisor for the baggage department which I have called multiple times, left multiple messages and also continued to email the department asking for a refund but again no one has gotten back to me This airline is a scam, they are basically crooks so please please please stay away from them. I know they are cheap but I would honestly pay a couple hundred bucks more for peace of mind and actual customer service

### "a voucher that didn’t work"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service and horrible experience dealing with this airline. My flight got canceled and they refunded through a voucher that didn’t work and sent an email but didn’t go through because their mailbox is full. No one answers the call. Virtual assistants are useless. They disappeared in between the conversation and I waited two hours. Still no solution to the problem and i wasted my money too.

### "I also expect someone to eventually answer a phone or reply to an email"
Not Verified |  I'll try and keep this short and sweet. For full disclosure, I have used Flair about 10 times in the past year since my wife is living in another city for school and Flair goes there direct...and economically. I never check bags, I realize the seat is hard and service is not great. I expect that for the price. This time we flew to Vancouver for my daughter's hockey tournament. No issues going, except being late but that's standard for these guys. They have been late on approximately 90% of the flights I have used with them. On the way home her goalie sticks were lost. For 19 days. Just got the call they were found. I realize it's easy to lose goalie sticks taped together, they are only about 6 feet long and I'm sure people travel with them daily. The issue was the lack of customer service. I have been on phone hold for hours, virtual chats, and about 5 email strings and rarely do you get an actual human. In fact I only had one respond. She kept me from going postal over this. Phone numbers that are busy for hours (I have screenshots), hung up on by virtual chat numerous times and silence most of the time. I expect poor service, it's a cheap airline but I also expect someone to eventually answer a phone or reply to an email. This company sucks, avoid at all costs unless you have a masochistic side that needs some attention. Would never recommend. Oh yeah, forgot to add-the seat beside me was covered in vomit on another flight and no one told me, nor cleaned it. I overheard the cabin crew discussing it.

### "will never fly with flair again"
Flying from Halifax to Ottawa, Ottawa to Vancouver. Canceled one time, then from Vancouver back to Halifax canceled 3 times. End destination was Halifax 1030 am. Got there at 930pm. The most unorganized air line I have ever seen. Landed unexpectedly in Winnipeg due to a medical emergency which is totally understandable but the service there was terrible. No one tells u anything. No one knows anything. Whole trip was only issued one boarding pass and was supposed to have 6 all together. One person tells us to go here or there. We get there and that persons says can’t be here. The right hand doesn’t know what left hand is doing. This isn’t just our party of people it was whole plane. No passes, no idea what was next. I personally will never fly with flair again.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Haven't flown yet. Flight got cancelled. Their solution, after spending three hours on the phone waiting for customer service  was to offer a flight six days later. Finally got rebooked for three days later and now having to wait more time to get the hotel voucher. This is terrible customer service.

### "they'll give no warning and offer no solutions!"
Not Verified |  If you want to get somewhere at a specific time then this airline is not for you! Don't worry they'll give no warning and offer no solutions! Just make sure you don't have plans at the destination cause you won't get there when you want! But thank you for flying Flair Airlines I'm sure it'll be your last time!

### "First time, last time"
Kelowna to Vancouver. Real bad experience with this company! First time, last time. Be ready to waste your day because of the cancelled or delayed flight and on top of that they don't reimburse you. There is nobody to speak to at the airport!

### "This airline is pretty good"
Not Verified |  This airline is pretty good. They have a chat to help you if you need it. The algorithm updates you of all check-ins and the price is amazing. They make money on food and luggage charges, so you need to consider that. I travel with a backpack on this airline, no charge. They may charge you to sit together, but you can not select a seat, and if it’s not full, they let you move once they board. I’m sure lots of people will complain that luggage and water cost extra, that is just the business model, if you account for that they are an airline excellent.

### "staff was friendly"
Not Verified |  The flight was on time, staff was friendly and the plane was new. Very happy. I regret reading the reviews before boarding. Nothing like what people had said, good job!

### "cancelled 2 hours before my flight"
Got an email that my flight is cancelled, 2 hours before my flight. Please never choose this airline

### "Horrible booking, horrible customer service"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They are all about the extra fees, they don't care about anything else. Horrible booking, horrible customer service, horrible experience. If I could give them zero stars I would. Stay far away, the slightly lower prices are not worth it, you'll end up paying the same and the experience is horrific.

### "Gouged with high fees for baggage"
Not Verified |  The only positive experiences about this airline - flights were on time. On-line app did not work properly. Gouged with high fees for baggage. Rude staff. Upon arrival in Toronto had to wait two hours for baggage. No one at baggage counter. Had to go up to ticket counter to get action. Was told the baggage carousel was not working which was a lie as three flights with Westjet delivered baggage on the same carousel while we waited. Seats don't recline. No food. Charged $7:50 for instant coffee and a chocolate bar. Will never fly Flair again.

### "So disappointing, do better Flair"
Not Verified |  They canceled our flight home the morning of our flight Friday until Monday. I have kids, pets and a job so I needed to pay an additional $1,000 to take an 18 hour bus ride with two kids. Their customer service is an absolute joke, they hang up or end chats mid way through. Flair has given my family the most terrible experience and as a young family this was our first ever trip. So disappointing, do better Flair.

### "by far the worst flying experience"
This is by far the worst flying experience I have ever had! The flight was delayed constantly with no communication as to why. I was stuck at the airport for literally 8 hours without any idea what was going on. They finally told us, the flight was cancelled! And there are no other flights for days. But don't worry, you can get lodgings, food, and cab fare reimbursed when you submit your receipts. They managed to secure another flight for the next day, which was again delayed by over an hour, but at least this time it actually took off and I got home. I submitted my reimbursement requests with receipts, full details, and every piece of information they requested. They then took 3 months to get back to me after I contacted them multiple times ... and they denied it! They said, because it was cancelled due to a safety issue, they would not reimburse me ... even though the entire crew of employees said we would get reimbursed. It is now 9 months later and I'm still calling them to get reimbursed, and they are still giving me the run-around. Hanging up on me, disconnected chats, and did not respond to emails. This airline is an absolute scam and I cannot believe they are still in business. I saved $50 on the airfare, but paid over $200 in other fees and lost another few hundred on billable clients because of their awful airline. Stay away from them at all costs.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Flight got cancelled/postponed a day, once I actually got a chance to fly, it was delayed 2/3 times. Customer service at checkin was terrible and very rude considering I was the customer. One worker said my “personal bag” was fine and then followed up with the manager hanging over her shoulder to then demand I pay for checked bag (money hungry airline). Make sure you online checkin and skip the Flair checkin line (I did online checkin but they directed me through the line), then once you get to your gate they tag everyone’s bag for free!! All about the money and not the customer! Will never fly with them again no matter how tempting the low fares are. I overheard another customer that was delay over 7 hours trying to tell them that the “flair vouchers” that he received for a 7 hour delay didn’t work anywhere in the airport and no stores or restaurant accept the flair voucher. That says something about the airline if a major airport like Vancouver doesn’t recognize their vouchers as valid.

### "caused me great distress"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly back to Edmonton from Toronto on the 21st of May. Since the 20th of May, we received 2 cancellation notices and 2 delay notices. And now I am tentatively flying on the back on the 27th May! I was provided a $10 food voucher today. Yes $10. I was provided hotels vouchers that I could not claim because there are 2 of us flying and room availability for 2 were not available at the same hotel. The hotel availability location also changed on the 2 cancellation notice. That means I had to travel between hotels. It has caused me great distress; I am not able to report to work, it has created extra financial burden that I could have never fathom. I am now on the flair airline phone line, with 40 people ahead of me. You decide if you will fly flair.

### "The worst airline to fly with!"
Not Verified |  The worst airline to fly with! Their seats are cramped and don’t recline! They serve no alcohol, their food selection is non-existent! Their agents are rude as are the flight attendants. If you book together and don’t use the seat booking and pay extra you get put in different sections of the plane. I will never fly with this airline anymore. They were 1.5 hours late going to Toronto and 1.5 hours late coming back to YVR.

### "charged me 70$ for a cabin bag"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have travelled. I travelled from Ottawa to Vancouver roundtrip. when I travelled from Ottawa to Vancouver I was not charged for my cabin bag, but from Vancouver to Ottawa they have charged me 70$ for a cabin bag. Ruthless airlines with lack of communication from employees. I would never recommend and travel with flair again.

### "Swoop = hero’s. Flair = very bad. Fly Swoop!"
Do not be tempted by the low fare! They are not reliable and we will never use them again. Didn’t get to use them this time actually. They left us at baggage drop, there was no one there even though we were there before their 75 minutes before flight time posted warning. And we couldn’t call anyone and online chat ghosted me. Swoop was still there and had a flight around the same time and totally helped us out by getting us tickets with them instead. Swoop = hero’s. Flair = very bad. Fly Swoop!

### "flight crew never bothered to give water"
Flight had to be diverted to Kitchener due to bad weather in Toronto and Flair didn’t have enough fuel to enter a holding pattern. Can’t bring suitcases on without a ridiculous charge. App is garbage and the wi-fi barely works. We had to wait for two hours when we finally did get to Toronto due to a backlog of planes entering at the same thing, flight crew never bothered to give water while we waited for hours to disembark. There’s a stigma associated with cheap airlines, and places like Flair only help to reinforce that.

### "Would highly recommend"
Not Verified | Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Excellent service! Excellent value! We were very happy with our overall experience! Our check-in was very smooth, flight was on time and seats were comfortable. Would highly recommend this airline!

### "perfectly normal flight"
Greatest price I have ever seen and perfectly normal flight, landed early, zero issues! Infact I was late and was still permitted to board. Thank you

### "if it's too cheap to be true, it probably is"
Unreliable service. I booked this ticket with my family of 3 to take advantage of the long weekend. Then, around three weeks before departure, we were informed by email that our outgoing flight was cancelled. No offer to reroute or anything. Simply cancelled. We had to email the refunds team to get our money back. Thankfully, we were able to get the full amount. However, because of this, we had to cancel our entire trip, including hotel. Never take this airline unless your schedule is extremely flexible, and you are ready to get email for last minute changes. Moral of the story: if it's too cheap to be true, it probably is.

### "customer service has been the worst"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight from Edmonton to San Francisco for my birthday. We've arranged for my in laws to come and babysit and my husband and I scheduled days off work so that our travels would be possible. Just four hours prior to checking in, they send us email notifying us that our flights have been cancelled. Instead, they've re-booked our flights for 5 days from our original date. When my husband tried to call and sort the matter and get us on a different flight, they said it wasn't their problem and that they would not refund us, even though they cancelled our flight. So, now we're scrambling to cancel our hotels and reservations, which likely we will not get a refund. The customer service has been the worst that we have ever dealt with. They should not be allowed to operate and there needs to be an investigation into this airline practices.

### "their service is so cheap"
Not Verified |  “Do not travel with Flair”. Flair is cheaper compared to others because their service is so cheap. I don’t understand why are they still operating. No any refund if we change or cancel flights even a month before our reservation. No changeable flights, in fact we are compelled to pay extra charges for taking no service. We can see the availability of flights online on mentioned date but when called we are told there’s no any available flights. Had to book twice because they don’t want to get bothered checking flights and changing it. Once you booked the tickets, you have to either board on the same date or just cancel the ticket without getting refunded, in fact paying extra cancellation fees.

### "did not refund my bag checking fee"
Not Verified |  Flight was canceled, Pilot decided not to show up. Had to rebook with Porter to make my connecting flight because they had no other flights today. Asked for my refund, they gave me back only half of the ticket price and did not refund my bag checking fee.

### "Simply cannot risk having my plans derailed again by this bad company"
Flair Airlines should not be allowed to operate! If I had done a bit of a research before booking, I would have stayed far far away and paid a bit more on other reputable airlines. In March, as I booked a trip for my family of 4 plus my parents for the Victoria Day long weekend in Vancouver from Calgary. We were able to get a nice deal on both flight and hotel, with Flair Airlines flight being the return flight on Monday May 23rd (Monday is a holiday and Tuesday back to work). We so looked forward to this trip as this would be the first time I have brought my parents to Vancouver, and my kids were excited. We had great plans. Then mother's day morning, I got an email from Flair, saying the flight is changes to Tuesday May 24th - a 24-hr delay, two weeks before our trip! Delaying our return trip for one day is not an option for us as we all have to work on Tuesday May 24th. We were unable to find any other flight home for less than $300/person additional charge. We had to cancel everything and get the refund. Although I did not lose money, it completely derailed our plan and I had to cancel the outgoing flight with WestJet and cancel the hotel downtown Vancouver. I don't understand how an airline can just say "due to the pandemic" and then just cancel the flight 2 weeks before takeoff. Last time when I was at Zurich airport, Air Canada overbooked their flight and was offering a hotel room + Euro 1000 per person who opt to stay an extra day. This is the first time dealing with Flair and I don't think I will ever book with them ever again! Simply cannot risk having my plans derailed again by this bad company. I feel bad for people working there. I will write to expedia also to ask them not to offer Flair a place in their choices as this is not worth it.

### "Totally unreliable company"
I strongly urge you to never consider this airline despite their lowest prices to rope you in. We had our flight changed four times! The flight changes were not just a couple of hours or so each end. They legit changed them 24 hours. Not only that they moved it forward a day. Then moved it back a day! Each time they did that we had to rebook and cancel hotel reservation which was non-refundable! My spouse and I also had to continue to change our work schedules. Totally unreliable company. The customer service center is not in Canada but outsourced overseas, so do not expect a good experience with that either. The best option they could offer was a refund. Well too bad I booked the flights 2 months ago and now get messed around with less than 10 days before my flight. Now all competitor airline flight prices have gone thru the roof. Flair Airlines has left me absolutely high and dry and cost me a lot of money. They have no interest in making it right. Please never consider this joke of an unreliable airline.

### "Never use them again"
Not Verified |  3 min before boarding flight was canceled from Ottawa to Winnipeg. I had to rent the car by my own expense and drive all the way to Toronto to take the flight for the next day. Me and my husband missed one day of work. Totally irresponsible company. Never use them again.

### "they were not going to refund the flight"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight to Fort Lauderdale from Toronto for 15 people leaving on May 13 2022 returning May 22 2022 . We were just told 5 days before leaving that our return flight was canceled. So we called Flair to find out what was happening and we were told that we could cancel the whole flight and get our money back and rebook with someone else. We managed to get a flight that cost a couple of hundred dollars more with a different airline. When we called Flair back to cancel the whole flight we were told that they were not going to refund the flight down but would refund the return flight. We proceeded to tell them that we were told that the whole flight would be covered but the customer service rep said that someone made a mistake. We told them to check the recorded phone call and they would see what we were told . He wouldn’t even let us talk to a manager.

### "staff were friendly and professional"
Cheap flights means basic service, but who needs a $300 glass of wine? I took Flair there and back. Flights were on time, staff were friendly and professional. The max was a comfy ride. I was worried with its history, but reminded that it’s the most scrutinized aircraft which probably makes it more safe. Extra baggage is where they will grab you, so pack light . I will choose them again and hope they stick around.

### "zero care about their customers satisfaction"
Cheap flights, not so cheap. First my flight scheduled to leave Winnipeg at 11:20 on Monday May 2nd and arrive in Kitchener at 2:30 EST was cancelled. This happens. It's unfortunate. It was said to be a bird strike but many passengers in the airport seemed to have been told it was a staffing issue so who knows what to believe. Regardless, replacement flight few from Winnipeg to Toronto. Many of the passengers were like me and had left their vehicles in Kitchener. After 7 failed Uber attempts (I assume they didn't want to make the hour drive to Kitchener) and 1 failed cab attempt (same reason) I was able to find a cab willing to drive me for $155.00. In addition, I had to pay an additional day of parking at the airport as I didn't arrive there until 2:30 am. (The replacement flight was supposed to leave at 7:40 but that was wishful thinking. We ended up taking off at about 9:45 local time. I suppose I could have stayed another night and tried to get on a flight back to Kitchener but with the additional food and hotel costs, I would have likely been out more money. Flights change. For the safety of the passengers and crew, I get that. Moving the flight to an airport an hour away with not offers of compensation or additional assistance is brutal management and absolute zero care about their customers satisfaction.

### "Do not fly with Flair"
Do not fly with Flair, terrible customer service that is non existent, terrible experience, no resolution for canceling our flight and leaving us stranded in Nashville, still no refund, support phone number says out of service and they don't have solutions or know how to work with the customer. Multiple calls, stay on hold for hours then drop. Cheap flights but also a scummy company. Don't waste your money with Flair, pay a little more to know you'll be taken care of by a reliable air travel provider. Your choice. First and last time I will be flying with Flair. On our departing flight they had 1 attendant to check everyone in which had us waiting in line for 2 hours, barely got to the flight on time. For our return flight no one was at the airport to answer our questions, the WestJet ladies said the Flair workers left the minute they found out the flight was canceled. Times were moved around to a 8am return flight causing us to have to cancel plans. Awful experience, I hate Flair.

### "Horrible experience"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. Worst airline I’ve ever flown on by far. First I need to pay an additional $10 to check in and pick my seat. Why was this not included in the initial price? Charged me $60 a bag for luggage and charges for carrying on?! Unheard of for me. Plane delayed by 2 hours which I believe was very preventable reason. Communication for delay was at least well communicated. I am now sitting on the plane been waiting 30 mins to exit, the captain tells us “customs is delaying us, we are only allowed to let 50 people leave every 10 mins” and of course we’re at the back. Not included food or drink, not even water in a cup Overall, Horrible experience and won’t be booking every again.

### "experience was abysmal"
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Before you read this, you might be thinking, “sure, they have some bad reviews, but it’s probably because they’re a discount airline. How bad can it really be?” Let me tell you, the answer is EXTREMELY bad. This company is a pathetic excuse of an airline. I’ve never experienced such disorganization, poor management, and complete disregard for customer service. After arriving at 6am for a flight at 8:30am (which had been delayed from its original departure time of 7:55am), we joined the check-in line to drop our bags. Despite checking in online beforehand, we had to wait in this line to drop our bags. We waiting for about 20 minutes before an agent told everyone in the line that we had to move to a different area of the airport to complete check-in. We then joined a massive line comprised of people from two flights. There were only two-three agents working to check everyone in. They began to prioritize the flight ahead of ours, which meant that it didn’t matter where you were in the line up, the people on the flight before mine got to go to the front of the line. It took agents five minutes per person to check people in. This is not an exaggeration. We stood in line for two hours simply to drop our bags. When we finally got to the front, the agent took our passports and then received a phone call. He handed the passports back to me and informed the group of us (around 20 people) that we wouldn’t be able to make it to our gate in time for our departure and that we needed to call Flair to sort this out. People were obviously angry and upset. I phoned Flair a couple hours later, after quickly rebooking my flight with a different airline. The customer service experience was abysmal. I explained the situation and asked for a refund. The agent consistently repeated their policy which states that because I “failed to show up for my flight” there was nothing they could do. Needless to say, I will NEVER book with this “airline” ever again. The discount you think you’re getting by booking with them will be rendered irrelevant when something like this inevitably happens to you. If I could give less than one star, I absolutely would.

### "very bad experience with this company"
The flight was supposed to take off at 07.30am and then it was delayed for 4hrs, (take off at 11.30 instead of 07.30). After boarding the delayed flight, when all passengers were on the flight, the captain announced that the flight had a problem and it would be delayed for an extra hour, this is not the first time this has happened, very bad experience with this company, this is my last time to board it. If I was asked to rate it from 0-10 (0 waste and 10 best) I would give it a 1 out of 10. Very poor, very poor.

### "seats are small very uncomfortable"
Toronto to Abbotsford, a2 hour delay. I spent extra money for more leg room Did not help at all! No charging stations, no alcohol service, seats are small very uncomfortable!

### "Very brutal experience"
Not Verified |  Brutal experience. I was to fly on April 22, 2022 from Vancouver, to do this I first had to fly to Vancouver from a small community in northern BC. The flight from my small community with a smaller airline was on time and uneventful, which is always a good thing when flying. I no sooner arrived in Vancouver about 5 hours ahead of my scheduled departure with Flair and received my first text indicating my flight was delayed by 1 hour and 15 minutes, no big deal. Half hour later another text, another 2 hours, and then another adding another hour. So, a 3.15 flight now leaving at 7.30. Then flight cancelled until the next day at 3:15, 24 hour delay. No Flair personnel anywhere to be found, all information done by text. Could not get a room from them, or meal vouchers, or even any formal, one on one communication, very poor people skills and communication. Could not get back home, no flights available, so slept at airport, what a nightmare. Looked up at flight monitor and flight again showing another delay, so decided to take the next flight home and not fly with Flair. They did give me a full refund but I still spent $550 round trip to get to Vancouver, plus meals for the 24 hours I spent touring the airport. Very brutal experience, I will never fly with this airline or similar low budget airlines again, poor service, poor communication, no apology. This company should not be in a customer service industry, and the owner should be ashamed. You can tell it is only in business for the money, money, money.

### "no thought for passengers"
We booked a flight for our daughter to a funeral. Then funeral plans changed. So we canceled the flight within a few hours. We were charged $59 cancellation fee each way. Then tried to use our credit a week later. Nope! It can only be used by the person who paid. My husband. He swore he would never fly flair a few years ago. He tried booking a ticket for me. Won’t let him do it. Tried calling. Call center is in South Africa. That is why wait times are long and communication is so awful. No manager available, promises to have a manager call not kept. No customer service, no thought for passengers. Once they have your money they will ensure you get not one dime back in any form.

### "don’t plan on flying with Flair again"
I tried getting a credit voucher for booking reference # R6V3G9, applied to this months flight which was promised to me it would work, as the original flight was booked with my credit card for my own employees. I was on a phone multiple times for hours trying to get through, a couple times when I got through to a person, they couldn’t talk English well enough for me to understand, as well, they couldn’t pull through with applying the voucher to my current flight that I have booked. Due to these inconveniences, I don’t plan on flying with Flair again. They are impossible to communicate with and not backing up acceptable flexibility.

### "Terrible communication, terrible service"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 3 hours and then rescheduled to the next day 7:00 am due to mechanical issues. Was going to take them 2-3 hours to find everyone a hotel room. Set people up at a hotel and when the travellers got to the Crowne Plaza their names were not on the list. Food voucher offered for $20 was useless because the restaurant did not open till 6:30 am and flight was at 7:00 am. This airline had no idea what to do to accommodate passengers who were forced to stay overnight due to mechanical issues. Terrible communication, terrible service. The flights were cheap but not worth the aggravation.

### "like the you get what you pay for aspect"
Just flew from Vancouver home to Edmonton on flair, it wasn’t the first time I’ve flown with them and won’t be the last. On my flight today we had a awesome flight attendant do the safety presentation and hands down was the best one I’ve ever had to sit thru. I like the you get what you pay for aspect -  priority boarding for 10$ where other airlines make you book business to receive that service. Overall smooth flight.

### "chat service is terrible"
While booking the flight I put the last name wrong that was due to auto fill on my Google. I tried reaching out with in 24 hours to connect and change the last name nobody answered and after 24 hours they are saying that you can't change the last name and cancel the flight and you will get the store credit after deducting 39 dollars each. I cancelled the flight and when tried using the store credit again the issue was the wrong last name. To change that again I have tried contacting at every platform but nobody replied. So I booked my flight again by wasting more money. Your chat service is terrible. I have connected with agents more than 20 times but nobody replied. Left mail and text too nobody replied. I called nobody answered. Hats off to such an awesome customer service. I would suggest please charge more for flights and give good customer support.

### "airline has the worst airport staff"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with any airline in Canada! Firstly my actual flight was cancelled and they put us in a hotel and rescheduled us two days later! Then the new flight was late by more than two hours and the staff had no idea. Staff was saying that the flight is on time and then the airline has the worst airport staff - unprofessional, completely ignorant and rude!

### "they said the flight did not exist"
We had a return flight to Montreal from Vancouver with Flair Air during Spring Break. Our flight return was scheduled for March 31st, at 9:50PM. We had 3 confirmation of the flight (March 10th, March 24th, and March 31st), however, when coming to the airport we could not find the flight on the list. We talked with the Airport information desk, and they said the flight did not exist. We called Flair and were on hold for 3 hours, but no one picked up. We had no response from an e-mail either. We went and stayed the night in a hotel, trying to figure out what to do. By making an account through their app, I learned our flight was changed to 25 hours later. I talked to the Flair employee managing the booth, and he told me that the Airline sent me an e-mail to an address which I did not put in (it had my name with random numbers that followed with an @booktravelwind.com). When I got home, I tried to access this e-mail, using the link I found (reservation.flyflair.com), but the link did not work, and the e-mail was stated to not exist on the flair website. It appears as though they made an e-mail, sent the cancellation to that e-mail with no way of accessing the e-mail, to avoid any type of compensation from the flight cancellation. The man at the counter gave me an e-mail that at least responds, figured everyone should have it: [email protected] Glad it seemed that we saved on the flight initially, but it ended up costing way more in time and money down the line.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Round trip flight. The flight out was fine, as long as you're aware of the extra fees prior. Only really worth it if you travel light. The problem was the flight back. It was delayed morning of, for 2 weeks. After waiting for an hour and a half on hold to get through, the agent said that the only options were a refund, or to book a different flight (only with them of course). The soonest flight was 3 days later. When I told the agent that this was unacceptable and I wanted to speak to a manager I was told he'd call me back, which of course he never did. So my only choices as I absolutely had to get home that day was a $2,000 flight with another airline, or rent a car and drive 14 hours. Nothing was reimbursed, I still have yet to hear back from the manager. Their complete lack of empathy in a situation that they caused is disgusting. Not only was the agent not willing to work with me at all (the cost of the rental was only 100$ more than the flight, I wasn't asking for the moon), but she was completely void of any type of concern. These are the only options, which do you want". I will never fly with them again.

### "don’t want give us any compensation"
Not Verified |  I had a return flight to Calgary from Toronto, they changed the flight time and didn’t send any confirmation or notification that my flight has got changed due to some technical issues in the flight and next flight would be 2 days later. On the website it was showing flight, got Canceled so you can’t select seats. My boyfriend talked to them and they don’t want give us any compensation for this fault by them, customer service doesn’t know the proper details or anything for compensation, now our flight has canceled and we will be stuck in for 2days in Toronto on our own bills, waste of money and time for this flight and service. Pay some extra money and get a better flight.

### "It is an airline to avoid"
On Mar 31st when I flew with my family from Calgary the flight was almost 3 hours delayed, mechanical instrument problem offloaded, loaded without a basic Curtsey extended to customer. On April 3rd was returning back the check in counter lady treated in such a bad behaviour, she doesn’t how to talk or explain that I need to pay extra for hand carry as what I paid was only one way (I fact I later I found out that I paid already). I know it is a cheap airline but we don’t need to behave cheap as well. It is an airline to avoid.

### "won’t recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  By far the worst airline experience I have ever had, costumer service is the worst I have ever seen. When I reached out over a lost suitcase, I got zero response, so I reached out several more times and still nothing! Start to finish a bad time, will not use again and won’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Terrible communication and ability to accommodate for their passengers"
Terrible airline. My first flight was delayed twice, only 3 hours in advance. Where my travel day started with a 3 hour drive, I waited at the airport for 8 hours then we hadn’t even boarded by the departure time with no notice made we’d board late. My second flight was the same, delayed twice, then cancelled at the time of expected take off. The airline supervisor at Ottawa was terribly rude and wouldn’t let me ask questions ‘because it wasn’t in his authority to answer’, last time I checked it is the supervisors responsibility to answer passengers questions. I have now missed my flight, my transit, and a non refundable Airbnb. And the only thing I am being compensated is a confirmation for a flight tomorrow, no food and so far no accommodations after I’ve been traveling for 24+ hours with no sleep. Terrible communication and ability to accommodate for their passengers. Will not be flying with again.

### "Please don't fly Flair Airlines"
I booked a flight on Flair Airline for a trip with my young family from Ottawa to Orlando during the 2022 March Break. We wanted direct flight from Ottawa to Florida to minimize the travel fatigue. Major airlines are sold out on direct flights from Ottawa to Orlando as at the time we purchased our tickets. To avoid long transits in Montreal, Toronto, or other hubs, my spouse and I decided to consider flying with Flair Airline, since their flight is a direct 3 hours flight from Ottawa to Orlando, Sanford Airport. Interestingly, the difference in price between the cost of purchasing Flair Airline ticket for four, and the cost of purchasing tickets from other major airlines for four, as at the time we purchased our tickets (three months in advance), was negligible. Suffice to state that the cost of the ticket for Flair Airline was not a huge factor that influenced our decision. Rather, it was the fact that they fly straight to Florida. Sadly, on the day of our departure from Ottawa, at about 4.am while we were in the car heading to the airport to board our flight at 7.am, my spouse received an email from Flair Airline that our flight had been postponed to 9pm the same day. We were shocked and asked the Uber driver to return us back home. About 30 minutes on our way back home, we received yet another email from Flair. It was similar to the first one they sent except the time difference. It reads “ We wish to inform you that Flair’s flight F8320 from Ottawa (YOW) to Orlando (SFB) on Monday, March 14, 2022 will be delayed because of crew availability. Your updated departure time is now March 15, 2022 at 10:30 AM local time.” A few minutes later we received a series of other conflicting emails that keep moving the time and date. To cut the story short, Flair Airline did not airlift us as they only fly to Florida once a week. They ruined our family vacation. Our poor kids were devastated. They already told their friends they would meet in Florida. I was also devastated. We lost other incidental cost like hotel, tickets for Disneyland, etc. Finding alternative flights to Florida the same day during March Break comes with high cost financially. Our vacation that we planned many months in advance was ruined. Please don't fly Flair Airlines if you love your family. It was after they screwed up our vacation that I found that this is their common unethical business practice.

### "beyond disappointed"
Calgary to Vancouver. Cannot review the actual flight experience, as we never made it onto the plane. A few weeks after booking directly through Flair, with all details confirmed, we received a phishy looking email from Flair saying that there were changes to Flair's schedule that affected our flight. The email expressly said "we've reallocated you to the next available flight". Following that, there was a questionable looking link. Nothing in the email said we had to take any action to confirm the reallocation we had been assured of. We also went online with our reservation code to confirm our booking and everything looked good - it still showed we were booked on our flight to Vancouver, with our chosen seats, etc. When we arrived at the airport for our flight this morning, we were informed that our flight had been cancelled and they did not book us on the replacement flight. The new flight was full and they couldn't accommodate us. The customer service people at the airport weren't at all aware of what was going on, and at first were not willing to help out - one lady just walked away. They weren't even sure if they could give us a refund. After showing them the email we had received, they seemed to understand that the email was misleading and took some pity on us. Eventually we were able to get a refund, but obviously we are beyond disappointed that our weekend plans in Vancouver are not going to happen.

### "first time with this company and last!"
First of all, got to the airport, no self check in computer, so go to the counter, they charge 25$ to register you! So I did it on my phone in front of the clerk for free. Then to bring my cabin luggage, the same one that I bring on every flight that goes in the overhead compartment I had to pay an extra 60$! They did not even sit me and my wife together. We reserve together on the same reservation, when we asked to sit together they wanted more money again. So first time with this company and last!

### "Their website messed up my flights"
Their website messed up my flights, email support tried to charge me $600 to fix it over the course of a few weeks, and later the Instagram rep solved the problem and upgraded my flights in 50 mins. In January 2022 I booked flights to Vancouver as an Artist I like was going to be playing in February. All was well until the artist decided to change their show date by 3 months a few weeks after I booked my tickets. I didn’t think this would be an issue, however Flair has a 'Strict' no modification policy unless you pay their absurd 36$ per flight per passenger fee. There is the option of Travel Flex (which I'm pretty sure I paid for when I booked the tickets but didn’t have later, but that’s a whole other issue with booking thru 3rd party sites! Don’t do it!) which I also learned is a scam, as it only allows you to modify each flight one time, contrary to their offer of it being unlimited. Current state of flights: February 4th YYC-YVR, February 6th YVR-YYC. So I go to modify my flights, I select the first flight, input the new dates and move to the second flight. This is where I screwed up. On the Flair website, you can only modify one flight at a time. When I went to change the second flight, it didn’t go ahead with the first date changes, and I ended up with my departure flight being after my return flight and the system decided this meant I wanted to go from Vancouver to Calgary instead of Calgary to Vancouver. Current state of flights: February 6th YVR-YYC, May 19th YYC-YVR. Now while I only paid to modify one flight, my return flight became my departure flight and my departure didn’t change to the correct dates (again this was my fault, but the website is not very clear you can only change one date at a time). So at this point I'm stressed. I paid $80 to change my flights around, and everything is unbelievably wrong. So I message support through their text line and email line. Neither of them gets back to me that day so I wait on it. The text line never responds, but I do get emails back, and oh boy does everything go down from here. I ask them for (what I think) is a simple request. I don’t understand how I changed my flights around so much, and how they ended up so wrong. I was hoping that support could correct the flights to the correct dates since I already paid the fee once and didn’t receive the service I had paid for. I ask them for (what I think) is a simple request. I don’t understand how I changed my flights around so much, and how they ended up so wrong. I was hoping that support could correct the flights to the correct dates since I already paid the fee once and didn’t receive the service I had paid for. Hope this email finds you well. We apologize for any inconvenience however for every cancellation made, modification fee will be charged. Kind Regards...Customer Service Agent" This is the response I received. I laughed aloud when I read that.

### "have not received my money back"
#9989; Trip Verified |  On January 28, I booked two round trips with Flair from Calgary to Toronto on the weekends of May 5th and May 13rd. On March 5th I received an email saying that my flight for May 5th had been rescheduled and giving me several options. As my supposed new trip would last less than 24 hours, I requested a refund, it is today (March 24th) that I have not received my money back, nor anyone from the airline has contacted me. On top of that, today I received a similar email regarding my second flight, but in this case, the form is void and I cannot even know which is the change that they suggest, nor request the refund or do any other action. Obviously, both emails ask not to answer because they were sent from an "unmonitored" account. To make things worst, I still can see that the same flights are offered at several times the price that I paid for my tickets. The only way in which the airline can be contacted is by phone. I cannot explain how offended and disappointed I fee, this would be the last airline I would recommend someone to use.

### "Never fly Flair again"
Not Verified |  I bought a seat in front of the aircraft for my mom for $50.85 so she could get in and out easy as well as use the washroom easily. She is 70 yrs + To my surprise she was taken all the was in the back of the airplane squeezed in between a couple of passengers. When she asked the flight attendant about the seat that she paid for in front she was told to deplane and talk to the boarding counter. The next day when I called Flair for a refund I was on the phone for 1hr and 15 minutes! They did not have any explanation for this action. Never fly Flair again

### "One of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  One of the worst airlines I've ever tried to fly with. And will be the last time. It's would almost be faster to walk to Toronto from Winnipeg .the delays are unreal. If you can't support your customers. Pull out of the game and let WestJet or Swoop take over your lanes.

### "the worst customer service"
On March 07,2022, at about 8:40 am, at Edmonton International Airport, flying from YEG to YVR, I experienced one of the worst customer service in my life. My flight was scheduled for departure at 9:15am and I was trying to check in on the Flair Airline app but the app was not working so I approached the Flair customer service desk for help. I was standing in line and staff waved at me and I approached her desk. This staff was very disrespectful, rude and had bad customer service. I showed her my phone and explained that the app is not working and I can not check in. Can you please help me to check in. She told me that I have to pay $25 or she will not help me. I must do it myself on the app. I showed her my phone and I said please have a look at my phone and look. It is not working But she was like a Machine, keep repeating Pay or go home. There were a lot of other passengers, so I asked a few of them if they had changed $25 for checked in. All of them responded No. I still don't understand why this staff picked on me, what I did went wrong and was it something personal. She called the police on me because I was arguing about why I should pay $25. The police came and I explained to them, the police officer was very nice, He told me to pay it now and then call their customer service to dispute it and he left. I pulled out my Mastercard to pay and now this staff refused, and she is not allowing me to board the plane. I often fly with Flair but never had any such bad experience. I asked this staff for her Name, she refused, I asked her supervisor's name, she refused, I called their customer service and waited on hold for more than 2 hours to talk to a customer service agent, and she told me to write an email to support.

### "their service is horrible"
Not Verified |  My Father booked a flight, but the day of my flight I discovered that my government ID was invalid, so I went to the government service office to update my ID. They gave me the temporary paper as well as my card. We talked to airport staff at least twice but nobody saw the issue. I am disabled and use a walker. But I was refused boarding. I was left at the airport by myself while the rest of my family was allowed to go on to Winnipeg. I found out from the Service Ontario (government) office today when I went to request another piece of ID that the Service was horrible -they didn't have any staff make sure I was okay or offer to make sure I could get home until someone noticed I was sitting outside waiting outside like 1/2 hour later as a friend picked me up an hour later. Not to mention that the simplest ask for assistance they add extra charges. There were so many extra charges that my credit for the return trip only gave me back 30 dollars. It may be cheap flights but their service is horrible.

### "We just want our money back"
In 2020 we booked seats on a flight from Edmonton to Kelowna. Flair cancelled the flight, and then refused to give a refund. We received credits which we tried to use for a flight to Phoenix in March of this year. Same thing. Flights cancelled, a month in advance, no explanation given. We just want our money back. Flair refuses. We are retired, and on a fixed income. We can't afford to buy completely useless vouchers

### "never traveling Flair Airlines ever again"
Not Verified |  This is the worst Canadian airline ever. I have had two instances of really horrible customer service. They will just take your money and never refund it back in case of any cancellation. I canceled the flight on the Flair website by using my flight reference number on the day of the booking itself. And it also showed me that I would be getting a refund but I never received any refund. When I contacted customer care they told me the flight was never canceled by me. And then they refuse to process any refund because they said you didn't show up for the flight. I'm never traveling Flair Airlines ever again.

### "had to cancel our whole trip"
We have been planning this vacation for months. When we got to the airport yesterday, we found out our flight was cancelled. The only options they would give us were to take a flight with them to the same location 5 days later, get our money back or drive another 1.5 hours (we just paid my SIL to drive us 1.5 hours to the airport) to Montreal and try to catch a flight from there ( on my own dime with no guarantee). We tried to buy tickets with another airline but because it was March break the tickets were incredibly expensive. (They were around 400$ 2 months ago and 1500$ on the day of our flight) We had to cancel our whole trip. I lost money on our airbnb rental and our return flight. We were devastated. I finally got through to someone on the phone 2.5 hours later. They also could not do anything. How is this okay? The wrecked our entire vacation. No responsibility on them at all to fix this or make it better. I don't suspect this company will be around for long with values, ethics and customer service as horrible as this. I will be seeking compensation as well. The only reason they got 1 star is because 0 wasn't an option.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  I wanted to like this airline… I paid $82 round trip for my flight! I travel from Thunder Bay to Toronto often, so i was thrilled when this airline started flying here. The flight to Toronto was great, it was no frills but for $82 I was impressed. I was supposed to fly from Thursday night- Sunday night to visit family for the weekend. I showed up the the airport Sunday night to find out my flight was cancelled, but i got no notification of it being canceled and neither did any other passengers there, the customer service rep then tried to tell us we were lying because an email was sent out. I checked the flight before going to the airport and it was not cancelled to i think they cancelled it last minute. The flight flying out Monday was cancelled as well and the next flight they had was Thursday. So they gave us the option to rebook 4 days later or get a refund of like $40. All other airlines flying out were charging $600+ for 1 way last minute flights (they wouldn’t book us on another airline), so basically our choice was to pay that or stay in Toronto 4 more days (luckily i was staying with family members but other passengers had to pay for a hotel they didn’t compensate them for). So now I'm stuck in Toronto, missing out on 3 days of work and an exam because of Flair. i phoned their customer service to find out why the flight was cancelled in the first place and see if they would compensate me at all. They told me it was cancelled for weather (doesn’t make any sense because all other airlines were flying, there was no bad weather, and the flight the following day was cancelled too). He told me i had to contact them through email to try to get compensation, which they told me it was cancelled for unscheduled maintenance. I also will be shocked if i actually get on my flight Thursday since they’ve now rebooked 2 flights for Thursday. I will never fly this airline again.

### "not received any sort of compensation"
Flair Airlines cancelled my morning flight the night before for “maintenance issues”. This was the day before Christmas. I was devastated. I called Flair customer service to see what could be done. After being on hold for a few hours, I finally got through to someone. She assured me that I could buy a new ticket through Air Canada and Flair would return that money to me as compensation. I made a point to ask the woman on the phone “will I receive this money back immediately?”, I asked her this question twice; both times she said “yes. Email all your flight information to our email and you will receive the money back immediately.” This was in December, it is now March 7th, and I have not received any sort of compensation. What an absolute nightmare.

### "I will never travel with Flair again"
Not Verified |  Our outbound flight experience on Flair was great. No delays, no check-in problems, flights on time. However, our return flight was cancelled once we were at the airport due to maintenance issues. Flair offered to rebook 4 days later or give a full refund. They were not willing to discuss anything further, or provide help finding a hotel etc. I understand that this is a discount airline and that comes with its pitfalls, but the discount airlines in Europe know how to treat their passengers and don't leave people stranded. I filed a compensation claim for our 10 travellers, which I imagine they will deny as this was a cancellation "out of their control". I will never travel with Flair again, unless I don't care when or where I arrive.

### "If you don't give any expectations, you will be satisfied"
Second time going to Vancouver from Toronto with these folks, price was amazing compared to AC/Westjet even Swoop. When I looked at their departure through flightaware, most of their flights were delayed. Few of them were couple hours delayed. I tried my luck again as my first flight with them had no delays. I didn't get any delays again! Of course there is no complimentary food and beverages. They just transfer you from A airport to B airport, and they did that well. Seat wise though, it's the worst I've ever sat on, however I could deal with it as flight is only 4~5 hours. Overall, I got lucky with them so far, thus had pleasant experience. If you don't give any expectations, you will be satisfied.

### "No customer appreciation"
Absolutely atrocious. Delayed 2 hours today, and the checkin staff have the audacity to charge me an extra $60 because my personal item has straps sticking out of their size box. No customer appreciation at all.

### "they aren't able to do anything about it and I'm furious"
Terrible customer service! Bought return flights YYZ-YVR and purchased travelflex so I could easily change my dates if needed. Turns out, using travelflex, my flights are now 319$ (for any day for the next 5 months) as opposed to the advertised 59$-199$ on the website! I called and they aren't able to do anything about it and I'm furious.

### "find so many ways to screw things up"
The flight itself was fine. the online booking and subsequent phone calls were a gong show. Flair managed to find so many ways to screw things up. The website said "print your boarding pass" but it would not print. The phone call to rectify this only created more problems. The website insisted on creating the same baggage allotment for the both of us and the subsequent phone call to Flair ended up giving my wife less baggage for the return trip than the outgoing trip. During one phone call, the agent could not understand this and he hung up in my face. Many other problems too numerous to mention.

### "Will do everything possible not to fly with them again"
Bought a luggage bundle pack when I purchased my flight to be proactive and save money as it is twice as expensive if you pay when you check in at the airport. When I get to the airport I am told that my check in bag is not a check in bag, but a sports bag and I have to pay $52 more on top of the price I paid for the bundle package I already purchased. There was no option for a sports back when choosing the bundle packages and when I call the customer service line they said it is on a pack page and it was my responsibility to chose the right bag. This Airline is so ridiculous! Will do everything possible not to fly with them again.

### "This is the worst airline I’ve ever seen!"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I’ve ever seen! You better pay extra money to something legitimate. I booked a round trip but had the worst experience to and from. When we boarded from Ottawa to Edmonton, the flight was delayed but communicated late (that was ok, it can happen to any airline), but after boarding (2 hours later), they started counting inside the plane saying that the number of passengers on records does not match the number of people inside the plane (My first time to hear this). So in total we were delayed 4 hours and we had a small child, yet they offer nothing to eat (you have to pay even for water!). Now the worst was on our way back, when they lost all our bags and we had very important things in them (remember these are carry-ons, but we had to check them in). We contacted them daily, but the only people you can reach on phone is customer care (only in Edmonton), the rest is via email where they only reply when they want. It took them 7 days to get our bags, and they had the audacity to ask us if we’ll be going to pick them on our own yet they promised to deliver them!

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. You can’t even pay the extra baggage (which is my carry on) at the airport unless you have a Canadian credit card. I had to try four times before the Payment online was confirmed using a friend’s Canadian credit card. Nothing is included, not even water. Just pay a little more for another airline.

### "pay a little extra for a better airline"
They lost my luggage - it’s been 7 days. The only way to contact this via text or email. It took 6 days for them to reply to my initial text from Dec 24th. They asked me for my name, phone#, DOB which I supplied and they have not replied! I finally called Abbotsford Airport directly only to be given another run around with different people who all apologize profusely and insist that my luggage is not lost, it's in the system but cannot produce it. I had xmas gifts which were not given and had to cut my trip short due to this issue. I have called, emailed and texted every day with no Information on where my bag is. If you lose you bag don’t hold your breath to get it back during your vacation. Advice is to pay a little extra for a better airline - they’re cheap for a reason.

### "Pretty good service"
Not Verified | Pretty good service. Staff served with pride and were very kind and helpful. This is one of Canadas best low cost carriers. Although the service was good, the seat was well.. meh. It could have been better. The legroom seems acceptable until the long flight duration. Flair is generally a good airline though. I think you should use Flair if your taking a short hop, perhaps under 3 hours. Besides all the cons, very great service!

### "it has severely negligent customer service"
I have taken a round trip with Flair and found it has severely negligent customer service. Due to frequent delays, cancellations, app/website/booking errors, it's inevitable you will need to contact their customer support - who are unreachable. There is no compensation or remediation for their errors, even if it means sitting on the tarmac for an extra hour on your already delayed flight. Also concerned that their SMS messages have no safety/privacy practices (Is my DOB/name/contact info being deleted after confirmation? How long is this stored?). It typically takes 2 weeks for me to get a reply from their company (if at all), and they conveniently disregarded the messages they didn't want to respond to regarding privacy issues. In terms of the actual plane, it was uncomfortable and squished. If you're taller than average, your knees will touch the seat in front. I feel like the flight attendants are probably not being paid good wages in the sky or on ground, leading to poor service as well (probably not their fault). The last flight I was on, customer service agents were arguing with flight attendants during boarding because the attendants had switched their seats to preferred locations without asking on ground service. They also notified passengers on the flight that we were going to experience another hour delay while sitting on the tarmac because "We think a bird might have flown into a generator. Not one we need to fly the plane but it controls the AC/heat when we're on the ground. We're just going to finish cleaning up the feathers before we leave". Overall, it's concerning how unprofessional and disorganized the company was. Try Swoop instead! Competitive prices but much better reviews online.

### "pay a little extra for a better airline"
Not Verified | They lost my luggage - it’s been 4 days and there is no number to call to talk to baggage department, email only and that’s if they reply back. You call customer support and wait 1.5 hours on the phone to be told they can’t do anything. At the airport they have a tiny closet office no one can find and we needed an air Canada rep to call them down to baggage for us. I have called and emailed every day with no Information on where my bag is. If you lose you bag don’t hold your breath to get it back during your vacation. Advice is to pay a little extra for a better airline - they’re cheap for a reason, it’s because they suck.

### "flights depart late"
Not Verified | Calgary to Toronto. Always flights depart late, if have a connecting flight or an event to attend, don’t fly this airline. Water is not offered unless you ask for it, I expected them to at least offer it which I think is the least they can do. Please don’t fly if you want peace of mind.

### "How could they be so heartless"
I called and asked about vaccination QR code. Man said I couldn't fly on the 26th since my shot was on the 13th. Said I needed to wait 2 weeks and to book for 27th. We drive to airport, 2.5 hour drive from around Irma area. I get dropped off.. guy says I can't fly until the next day. I tried explaining what I was told on the phone and that I was told to book for the 27th. So he cancels my flight and didn't tell me. I couldn't find the itinerary online to change my flight because he did that. He gave me the custom service number to call and said to pay the difference from changing flights. I waited on hold for an hour and a half. The lady said there is nothing they can do for me and just kept saying sorry. I had spent around 600 total on my ticket with the 1 change I had to make changing fly day. So now I get no refund or credits towards another flight from what she told me. Asked to speak to manager and now am waiting on a call back (within 24hrs) from her supervisor. I don't have money to waste. How could they be so heartless at a time like this.

### "many areas for improvement"
Despite registering for both the app and email, I never received a text to check in. At the check in counter, the staff were polite but confused. At the departure gate the staff were again confused and boarding was delayed 75 minutes. Once on board, we waited for an extra 60 minutes without explanation before pushing off from the gate. The plane taxied to the end of the runway, then aborted the flight and returned to the gate. We then waited about 90 minutes without meaningful explanation. Then at 18:30, some 4.5 hours after our scheduled boarding, we learned the flight was cancelled. I do not blame or fault the pilot, who expressed genuine regret. But all passengers were kept in the dark almost the whole time. What bit of details shared were done so poorly. In fact, it seems many passengers learned about the flight cancellation via email BEFORE the Captain knew or at least shared details. Then everyone had to have their refunds processed before we could reclaim our bags. It is good that the mechanics and personnel detected the faulty part or problem. But had the airline been transparent and service-oriented, it could have alerted passengers promptly so they could have explored travel options. Instead, it was the mushroom treatment for all - kept in the dark and fed poor information. There are many areas for improvement that Flair will need to meet if it hopes to remain viable.

### "Horrible horrible experience"
Was scheduled to fly on 12/23/21 first time with family for a wedding but received an email the night before that the flight has been canceled. Tried many times to rebook, no one picked up the phone. Sent emails with no answer. Not sure how to get a refund. Had to cancel the whole trip. Horrible horrible experience.

### "had a very bad experience"
Not Verified | We had a very bad experience with Flair the first time we are flying with them. The counter at the airport was empty for a while and passengers had no clue where to drop the baggage. The app was really terrible for online check-in. It only checked in 1 out of 4 passengers. We had to wait at the counter for remaining check-ins. Then they said that gate is not know but it was showing correctly at every screen. We were confused and had to wait for the last minute. They didn’t check the vaccine check at the counters even though every passenger literally came from the counter. They repeated the process at the gate delaying the boarding which was already delayed by 30 minutes.

### "my first time flying with them and I regret it"
Worst possible airline to travel with, it took me longer to fly with them than it would take on a car ride. They will change there departure time without any proper reason or enough window for the passengers to do any other arrangements. The tickets are cheaper but trust me the amount of time you will waste on other issues would way more costlier than saving few bucks. If you value your time a little bit please do not fly with Flair Airlines. It was my first time flying with them and I regret it.

### "too much hidden cost"
Such a horrible experience. They canceled flight at very last moment and another flight they arranged was 2 hrs delayed because their cabin crew staff didn't arrive in time. Horrible  and too much hidden cost even for hand baggage and checkin, they take cost from the customer on counter.

### "never book with this airline again"
I booked a $95 flight from Calgary to Abbotsford for 11 am Dec 21. I purchased trip insurance to change this date in case I needed to stay longer (I’m here for a family emergency.) 10 days before this flight, Flair emailed me saying they moved my flight to 9 am. I live in rural AB and have no way of getting to this flight anymore but I knew I had trip insurance so thought I’d login to my Flair account and change the flight. WRONG - the insurance is a joke, your flight is flexible IF there’s a medical emergency/ natural disaster, etc. the insurance company told me to contact Flair as they are the ones who changed the flight to a time that no longer works. I called Flair because they changed the time by under 2 hours, I’m expected to make the flight and there’s nothing they can do about it. I said I found a solution, a flight leaving at a later date, couldn’t I just be booked for that date instead? No, they don’t do that- they told me to rebook and cancel the current flight, on my end. They said if I did it over the phone it would be even more expensive. So I cancelled my flight, got charged $60 for a cancellation fee and used the credit to rebook a flight during the busiest time of year for three times the price. I’m paying over $300 for a one way trip from Calgary to Abbotsford and Flair wouldn’t compensate for any of it, even though I bought trip insurance and they changed the original flight. This is a huge expense for me and I do not understand why Flair wouldn’t step up and try to accommodate a customer in any way. I feel totally ripped off and they have stolen that money from me. I would never book with this airline again - this was the first and only time. I called customer service three times and was even hung up on once. I’ve emailed them with no reply. I was told it was $39 to cancel a flight (that again, THEY changed) but the receipt says $59 to cancel, WHY?

### " my trip went extremely well"
I found the airport staff and cabin crew competent and friendly. Allowing for the required Covid 19 protocols my trip went extremely well. The Boeing 737 is my favourite choice of aircraft and was perfectly clean. All things considered including the inexpensive cost of the flight, I’m a Flair Air Fan.

### "Please educate you crew"
Please educate you crew about what a QR code actually means. The Flair employee looks at the QR code like she/he can read the encrypted data embedded and then ask for the date of first vaccination. They do not scan the code. That's all I have to say.

### "will not compensate to passengers"
Flight between YYZ to YXX got cancelled without any forms of communication or notification. Rebooked to YVR but Flair declined to offer any help for transportation between YVR to YXX, our original destination in ticket. We paid $160 taxi fare plus total of 6 hours delay to YXX at the end. Took 3 weeks still no reply for our complaint so we followed up. Complaint result at first was an reimbursement of taxi fare if we can provide proof of payment. Then while we asked for full compensation, another Flair staff replied no full compensation due to safety and only reimburse our meals. After multiple emails, they are willing to reimburse our meal expenses but suddenly another staff from Flair asked us for all the same information of our complaint and to re start the whole process again. In the meantime, staff who committed for transportation cost reimbursement replied us if we can provide taxi payment receipt then they will reimburse our transportation costs. Then again another staff again she will look into our complaint and require us to provide all our information and details of incident. So not only we don’t know who is in charge of our complaint but also who will decide our compensation when one said transportation costs will be reimbursed and another said Flair only reimburses meals but not taxi fares. Also our flight was rebooked to YVR instead of YXX, Flair declines its obligation to transfer us to our original destination even CTA’s guideline said so. The ground staff at YYZ even told us that Flair is a discount airline so it will not compensate to passengers and it will not care the passengers protection or right.

### "Super organized cabin crew"
Super organized cabin crew and at check in Flexible re moving my seat so I could avoid neighbours arrival and departure times fully on. Flight costs were great and a pleasant change from Westjet and Air Canada

### "charge me for another carry on bag2
I purchased my ticket online and I added one checked bag and one carry on bag. I had one personal item as well. After I give my checked bag and get to the boarding gate, there was a lady agent from flair at the boarding gate and she asked me to pay for the personal item as well because it was the same size of my carry on bag. She said you have to pay now or you cannot get to this flight. I explained that the personal item is free of charge, she was very rude and didn't listen to me. A manager was passed by and I asked her for help, and the manager said to charge me for another carry on bag which was $20+tax. I had no choice. So I give her my credit card and she said ok you can board now. I thought she charged me that amount, but instead she charged me $79+tax.

### "the cabin crew were polite and very helpful"
Not Verified |  I flew Kitchener to Calgary to see a friend. The cost of my Tuesday flight was only $199 which was much cheaper than the other 2 airlines I priced. The flight left on time and the cabin crew were polite and very helpful. There was no food or beverage service on the plane but that was made known in advance. I also want to comment about the previous review complaining about their policy for pets on the plane. The website clearly states that small dogs and cats can travel in the cabin if the combined weight of the pet and the carrier does not exceed 22 pounds. There is a $75 fee for the pet and only 4 pets allowed maximum on each flight.

### "I appreciate the cheap flights"
Not Verified |  Great price. Great service. Great staff. Great flight. I will fly again for sure. I appreciate the cheap flights and the airports they fly to. I wish 8n service drinks could be served even for a fee, but the current pandemic prohibits that.

### "not good at accommodating pets"
Not Verified |  I had tried to bring my pet rabbit in cabin, and no where when booking did it say rabbits are not considered as pets. It was not until I was at the gate, waiting to board that I was told I was not allowed to bring her with me, and was either given the option to miss my flight and rebook for 2 days later, or leave without her. I was able to get someone to come pick her up, which was not easy for them to get the rabbit, since they couldn't get through security. And now I'm being denied a refund, even though I had no knowledge of this not being allowed until 5 minutes before boarding, even though I've taken a rabbit in cabin on other airlines before, and the gate attendants said I would be able to be refunded. I would definitely say that flair is not good at accommodating pets and their owners, and 100% do not recommend for pet transport.

### "crew was very active and young"
This was my first time that I had flown to on Flair airline. When I landed at Orlando airport, I came to know that this was an inaugural flight to this airport. The ground staff at airport was very polite,  well groomed and smart. The aircraft was new and immaculate condition. The cabin crew was very active and young. The aircraft left at time and was on blocks at time. Big clap. But the travelers who want to travel economically MUST support this new player which offered a ticket at 65% less than Air Canada and 70% of other American airlines. Though there will be some operational issue; but for cost and comfort, those will be ignored.

### "Felt like highway robbery"
Was unable to obtain our boarding passes online so we went to the counter. We both had carry-on luggage with nothing to check in. Completely shocked when we were told it would be $150.00 for our carry-on and that we should have read the fine print about fees. We were also told because we used a third party to book the tickets it was on us to learn about their fees. Had we know about carry-on fees we never would have booked with them. Almost ruined our trip and out of anger we ended up paying to ship our carry-on bags home. Felt like highway robbery. Will never fly with Flair again.

### "Told flight was cancelled and I had to rebook"
I was purchasing my ticket online, got about 3 errors then my MasterCard notified me my purchase was approved. Flair still said error so I sent a chat to an agent. They emailed me my itinerary. Couldn’t check in online so went to flight desk on the day of my flight. Flight desk worker said my trip had been cancelled then said payment didn’t go through. I showed her my proof of purchase and itinerary. Told flight was cancelled and I had to rebook. One way was double price of my return ticket I originally had and still didn't have a flight home.

### "bad customer service"
Our scheduled departure time was 1300 (1pm) but they notified us when we are lining up for check in that it was changed to 1800 (6pm) which is a 5 hours delayed. Everyone was angry because it was too long to wait. The attendant were not even apologetic. We asked if there’s a food voucher because we have to stay for lunch & dinner but the attendant replied there’s a free water only. I should have listened when my friends were telling me not to book with Flair because of the airline’s history of being delayed & cancellation. Now I missed attending my friend’s wedding ceremony. In summary, bad customer service because there were no options & no accommodations for the wait time.

### "customer service is fantastic"
Not Verified |  I had flight Flair Air a few occasions and my experience has been great. I had some problems today regarding my flights and all the requirements necessary to be able to travel. Toby was amazing at not only listening to my concerns, but also providing us with all the information we needed for my husband to make a good decision. Toby was very understanding and gave us the two best options to solve our problems. I had no complaints regarding the flight either. I heard come complaints about the seats but this has not been an issue for me maybe because my flights had been mostly short (from Edmonton to Vancouver or Kelowna round trip). The prices of the flights are very competitive and the customer service is fantastic!

### "This experience was very frustrating"
I had booked a flight from Calgary to Abbotsford and was notified that the flight was delayed by 1 hour two hours prior to the departure of my flight. Once I had arrived to the airport, I received a 2nd notification that the flight was delayed by 7hrs and was notified half hour before the boarding time. The personnel at the departure gate notified us that we had two options to get to our final destination, however they did not know if any of these options were going to take place at all. This situation was very frustrating because I had to return back to the airport to take a 03.00am flight (flight that the personal did not know if it will depart). In addition I had missed two days of work and had no means to communicate to my work since the delay flight was notified to me last minute. This experience was very frustrating since this issue affected my work and personal life.

### "was very pleasantly surprised"
I recently took a mini-break to Vancouver from Edmonton, and was very pleasantly surprised. Both legs were dead on time. Check-in was a breeze. I had purchased a bundle which included one carry-on and one checked bag and check-in staff were friendly and professional. Yes, the $65 basic one-way fare increased to about $220 return with the extras, but that fare was much lower than the major carriers. One check in person asked if I preferred a boarding pass rather than using my phone. I joked if there would be an extra fee and she laughed. Nope. The Max 8 plane was clean and economy legroom was average. There was no in-flight service at all, due to Covid restrictions, but the flight crew were pleasant and efficient on both legs. Not many review "good" flight experiences, and this tends to paint a distorted picture of an airline's performance. But I have no complaints. What was promised was delivered.

### "still not received the refund"
Booked a flight from Abbotsford to Calgary. Tried to look up my reservation online but the system could not find it. Called in only to be told that the flight has been cancelled and they asked if I had been notified. I stated no. Asked if I wanted a refund, I said yes. That was back on September 24, 2021. Called them back a week later as I had not received the credit. Was told it had been issued and I needed to call my credit card company. Called credit card company and they have no record of the credit being issued. So we have formally disputed the charge and are waiting for the credit card company to resolve the issue. To date (October 14, 2021) have still not received the refund. Not to mention, Flair is still selling seats for this flight that they have cancelled. If it's too good to be true, it probably is & you get what you pay for. Flair is a scam, avoid at all cost.

### "find their flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  My daughter and son in law were scheduled to fly out tomorrow morning and were checking online this morning to find their flight was cancelled. They thought this was an error as they received no email or text call nothing to say their flight was cancelled. After finding a phone number to call the woman that they spoke to said that in fact it was cancelled. They were angry as if they had not actually checked before hand they would have been driven by another family member (a 2 hour drive to the airport) and dropped at the door. So if that had happened they would have had no ride home. When they spoke to the woman on the phone she said it was down for maintenance. So they book a bunch of flights and then randomly throw in the maintenance instead of scheduled maintenance and not screwing up customers schedules? I am thankful they checked but it screwed up their trip offering to put them on another flight almost a week later.

### "would use Flair Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Flew from Halifax to Kitchener/Waterloo. Everything fine. Friendly counter staff. On time. Felt like a new plane. Clean. Excellent price. I would use Flair Airlines again.

### "I have never received worse service or been treated so poorly in my life"
Not Verified |  I have never received worse service or been treated so poorly in my life. Myself and my 11 year old son were scheduled to depart a flight at 10.15am. When we arrived at the Flair lineup, other passengers were being processed. By the time we got to the counter to be processed, it was 9.31am exactly. We were told by an extremely grumpy female service agent that the desk closed at 9.30am and we could not be boarded, and she left. My son broke down crying and sat on the floor of the airport - someone from Westjet came over to console him while I contacted customer service. I was told by customer service I was considered a no show for the flight, which meant not only that I wasn't entitled to a refund, I couldn't use the money I'd paid for the tickets towards a flight the next day, they were simply keeping my money and I'd have to purchase new tickets. I was told to read the policy. After arguing with customer service and pleading my case that I was actually in line before 9.30, they continued to refuse to do anything and told me I'd need to escalate the situation with the airport. I will never, ever fly Flair again. Keep the money

### "I must have valid identification"
I boarded Toronto with my ID, with no issue. However, on the way home the gate operator stopped me for having identification that expired nine days prior. She sited Flair’s policy of requiring valid identification for not letting me board. The Flair manager said that she couldn’t help me and that I must have valid identification in-hand to board the plane. This meant, having my passport somehow mailed to me while I wait in Edmonton. I share these details because even though I recognized that I missed renewing my licence, I was still frustrated that the airline couldn’t separate their policy from the human side of the situation. I should note that due to COVID the Ontario Government had provided grace period for renewing licences until 2022 to avoid people coming into their Service Ontario buildings. Regardless, I got a hotel room that night, renewed my licence online and printed off my temporary licence for my attempt to board the plane the next day. Prior to boarding, I double checked Transport Canada’s requirements, the official policy on Flair’s website and in both cases there was indication that my temporary licence accompanied with my photo ID was ok. In an effort to not disrupt the on-boardin process, I talked to Flair early to make sure that I would be able to get on. However, yet again, they said I would not be able to. This time, they said that my licence needed a white sticker to accompany the temporary licence and the photo ID (the latter two which I had). Without finding any resolution with Flair, I walked to the next gate where WestJet was boarding a plane to Toronto one hour after my flight was supposed to leave. I explained the situation and immediately, the Gate manager said that my ID was fine, he understood my situation and I bought a flight home.

### "I had a great experience"
I booked a flight with Flair Airlines after reading all the horrible reviews, because of the low price and because if my flight was cancelled like so many others say, it wouldn't be a big deal. After flying with Flair, I felt the need to write a positive review, because I think there are many people like me who have had a good experience, but most don't leave a review unless they are unhappy. The staff at the check-in counter were very friendly and went out of their way to help a man who had 5 bottles of wine that he wanted to bring on the plane. Of course, he couldn't bring it on the plane, but the employees came together and found a box for the man to pack the wine in and check and did not charge him a cent extra for it. The employee wrote, 'FRAGILE,' on every side and corner of the box, to make sure it was handled with care. Keep in mind, we were in New Brunswick and most east coast people are very nice, so that may have contributed to their helpfulness. The boarding staff were extremely friendly. Once on board, the plane was new and clean and my preselected seat was awesome! I sat in 1C where there was a ton of leg room and no one sitting beside me. The flight did not include any refreshments and I knew that ahead of time, so I brought my own snacks and a bottle of water I bought at the airport. The only real negative was that there are no power or USB outlets on the plane, which is not very convenient and I really don't understand, with it being a new plane. I did charge my phone while waiting to board, so I had more than enough power for the flight to Toronto, but I could see it being a problem for a long flight, or if you hadn't pre-charged. I can't tell you if the flight attendants were nice or not, as I had no interaction with them, even though I was sitting in the front row, right where they sit and hang out. None of them said a word to me, so I guess maybe I can conclude from that that they weren't super friendly. Overall, I had a great experience and the price was ridiculously inexpensive. Read the reviews, (and some of them are really terrible), keeping in mind that most happy people don't leave reviews, then decide for yourself whether the savings are worth the risk. Good luck!

### "flights were delayed by 7+ hours"
Not Verified |  Second time flying with Flair and both times the flights were delayed by 7+ hours with not much explanation other than “the plane was being used” . Staff couldn’t figure out how to refund tickets nor could they get a hold of any management or anyone at there call center. Don’t fly with this company.

### Flair Airlines customer review
Flew from Halifax to Ottawa and back for the weekend. For the price I paid for a weekend trip with Flair, I was extremely impressed after expecting the worst due to reading bad reviews online. The staff were extremely friendly, the plane was modern, clean and somewhat comfortable (for the price), and both flights went perfectly smooth. I experienced zero delays (in fact one of the flights was even early!). My bag made it with no issues and it was a completely seamless experience. Flair really impressed me with their service and the price of this ticket. I am looking forward to more cheap flights with them in the future and hope they can grow to a larger low cost airline in Canada.

### "Ontario drivers license being expired"
We were stopped at gate because of Ontario drivers license being expired. We didn’t know this but immediately got an extension online. Staff would not accept this either and was stern and aggressive in her manner. She said there was no chance of flying Flair Air without permanent DL or passport in hand. We asked for our bag to come off. She said yes you’re bag will be taken off plane. It was not. She claimed it could not be found on plane. We made it clear we needed our medications. I highly doubt they even attempted to look for bag. We asked at Swoop counter. They checked with manager and there was no problem with our documentation. We took the next Swoop flight out but not before incurring $1000 in tickets, hotel and rental car. Medications demanded we get home ASAP and pick up our bag, at YYZ. Day 3 and still no word from Flair Air management. A simple explanation and apology regarding this employee is all we require. Wrong advise regarding documentation and left stranded without medication and bag. Terrible experience. Corrected by Swoop. Day 3 update - Flair Air called from Toronto airport regarding our bag. I asked to be delivered to house. They said no, I had to pick it up inside airport. Day 3 update - Flair Air representative at airport said "all airlines have different ID requirements". Same person said "we don't have to take the bags off plane". Again, I thought this was a requirement.

### "I didn’t get on my departure flight"
They are sneaky and cheap. Take your money and cancel flights - they said nothing I can do about it. Called into the call centre 5+ times and they have dropped my calls twice after waiting on hold 2 hours.I Booked a round trip flight. On my departure date their website wouldn’t let me check in online. I called in and the man told me i would need to check in at the desk at the airport. The ticket girl at booth wasn’t around to help, she left 45mins before the departure time. They closed the gate 45mins before the departure time. They wouldn’t let me onto the airplane. I signed up for the airplane text message notifications and while I was there trying to get on, it was sending me messages like “status: boarding now” “status: last call”. I had a return flight also booked that I tried to modify the date, I received confirmation that my card has been charged but I didn’t receive any new itinerary for my additional money spent modifying the date. After calling in yet again, I found out I didn’t receive an itinerary Because Flair air automatically cancelled the return flight because I didn’t get on my departure flight and you can’t modify a cancelled flight. The return flight date hasn’t even happened yet and they said it’s cancelled because I forfeited by not getting on the airplane. So flair air has taken my money for a flight that hasn’t even happened yet and taken it upon themselves to cancel my itinerary on something that I should still be able to use.

### "Flair does not have any standards for the staff they hire"
Hands down the most horrifying flight experience I have ever had in my life. I was going to Calgary from Toronto and arrived in Calgary without a hitch. Due to the pandemic there was a period of time when Service Ontario was not issuing renewed driver's licenses or health cards, so expired licenses are treated as valid as per the Government. I had therefore not thought to renew my IDs and did so a few days prior to the trip. So I had my hard copy expired license (still valid in Ontario) as well as the temporary ID form which clearly states that the ID is valid with the expired card with the form showing proof of renewal. However, this was not sufficient for the staff member from Flair. They allowed me to get on the flight to Calgary but would not let me on my return flight home. The only option they were giving me was to wait for my renewed license to arrive in Toronto, and then have it mailed to me in Calgary and rent out a hotel for a month, and get fired from my job. Thankfully I was able to speak to a reasonable manager from another airline who had capacity for common sense and sympathy, and was able to get on a flight home, but had to purchase new tickets for my fiance and I to get back home. I will be getting my money back from Flair if it is the last thing I do. If you have been unlucky enough to already have booked a flight with Flair, make sure they do not have the smallest of reasons to turn you away because they will do everything in their power to ruin your day. I assume this has happened dozens of times with every flight with Flair. It appears Flair does not have any standards for the staff they hire. Unfortunately their low standards for staff competence translates into the most horrifying travel experience you can imagine.

### "overall happy with Flair"
I called in to use up a Covid cancelled flight credit for my group of 8 people. Once we got through the phone line, it was a very smooth transaction using up the credit for flight and baggage and we were even able to add on another passenger a few days later. Flair was much cheaper than Westjet or Air Canada even with baggage costs. The flight itself was straight forward with friendly crew members. We arrived on time and were very happy with the savings. Once there all of the baggage but one was received. We later found my baggage in oversized in a plastic bag with the zipper broken and contents thrown about. I was disappointed with this and went back and forth with the agent a few times then with the property irregularity report form completed and receipts for replacements in hand, Maya from the baggage department helped me get it all sorted and reimbursed for my few missing items and costs to repair my bag. I am overall happy with Flair and will fly again! Thankful we have a cheaper alternative to keep the market alive with competitive pricing for travelling with families.

### "in-flight staff were lovely, everything else was a nightmare"
The in-flight staff were lovely, everything else was a nightmare. I booked with Flair because it was 1/2 the price of WestJet or Air Canada. On the way there, everything was ok. There was no food or beverage service, no inflight entertainment, no charging options for electronics, and the seats did not recline. But that was okay since the flight was just 75 minutes. However, I did not get the seat I paid for in advance (row 3, I was put in row 24). On the way back, I was at the gate with 11 other passengers standing around, with no one at the desk to check us onto the flight. We stood around for 15 minutes and then watched the plane leave! When the staff came back to the desk, she claimed to have been there and we were not. She snapped "no refunds" and then told us it would be $200 to rebook on the next flight (in 24 hours). Our luggage made the flight, and when asked about getting it back she said we could pick it up whenever we got back to Vancouver! I had to replace almost everything in my bag to stay another 24 hours. By the time I got to Vancouver, I tried to collect my luggage. But I was told I needed a special PIN number, I had to explain about the luggage five times and wait 90 minutes before someone would go get my suitcase. Customer service will not return any of my messages about the bag, the service, the flight leaving early or anything else. I will never fly discounted airlines again.

### "I would not recommend Flair Airlines"
They didn't let me board one hour prior to my flight saying boarding is closed. I was able to get a boarding pass for my sister an hour And half before the flight but not for myself, no one was willing to help at the airport it was a technical error. No flight available until next day, basically i was not able to use my ticket and i paid for it. No refunds , nothing. Just a trip to Toronto i paid $1000. I tried calling customer service for help but no one attended my call. I would not recommend Flair Airlines.

### "friendly, helpful and knowledgeable"
I had an amazing flight, both way from Edmonton to Kitchener and my return flight home to Edmonton. The staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, and Flair Airlines will be highly recommended my me and my family. Thank you. Keep up the brilliant job.

### "would not recommend"
Not Verified | Montreal to Toronto. My partner and I took Flair Airlines to go to Montreal just for 2 days. Came back to Toronto our luggage didn't show up with us. I have been trying to just get in contact with someone to get some answers but the supervisor doesn't even care nor do the employees. I went to the airport to speak to them and asked to finally see the supervisor to see if he knows where our luggage is - waited 2 hours and he never showed up. It has now been 4 days and I haven't get a call back or any sort of information about our bags. They made our trip the most stressful weekend ever. I wish I never booked with them. Still waiting for someone to get in contact with me. This really affected our life this week and I'm so disappointed that a company would hire staff and supervisor like this where they can not even take responsibility and provide the service and make it at the very least look like they care. Horrible experience and would not recommend it to anyone.

### "everything worked according to schedule"
First time flying Flair, had to buy a ticket on the last minute from Toronto to Montreal, all the mainstream airlines add a huge premium on the price, the only option I had was Flair, whos pricing was extremely reasonable. I was initially apprehensive on the negative reviews but made the plunge nevertheless. I have zero regrets, It was a breeze everything worked according to schedule, the flights were on time and the service was excellent. What I realized was that almost all of the negative reviews were based on the airlines charging for your bags, most people do not read and review before they book and kind of go unprepared to the airport then use their devices to rant online ignoring their shortcomings. Flair is providing a service thats quite lacking in Canada and hugely popular in Europe. I hope more in the line of Flair proliferates in Canada so that we can explore more cities in the vast land.

### "To say their customer service is poor is a gross understatement"
My outbound flight was eventless. Nothing to write home about in terms of in-flight service, etc. Returning was a nightmare. I arrived at the airport to learn my flight was delayed by 1 hour. Between the scheduled departure and the revised departure time, my flight was cancelled. Next flight out? 4 days later. I was forced to book a last-minute flight to Vancouver with a competing airline, with no assistance or information coming from Flair. I have contacted the airline a dozen times through telephone, email and social media in the intervening 2 months since my cancelled flight, with zero response. Zip. Nada. Zilch. To say their customer service is poor is a gross understatement. If you want to throw away your time and money, ruin your schedule and raise your blood pressure, by all means fly this airline.

### "First time using Flair and not the last"
Not Verified |  Wow, best rate ever! Flight was on time on both ways. Luggage wasn't lost or damaged. Seats are OK, no food or drink on plane (with Covid situation) and no TV or service but for the price, what do you expect. Plane was clean and new. Staff are funny and courteous. First time using Flair and not the last. It's about time Canada offers cheep flight like Europe. Best way to travel and visit our beautiful country. See you soon Flair!

### "we were quite impressed"
We flew as a family of 4 (including 1 infant) direct from YOW-YYC-YOW. Having previously flown with other LCC airlines in Asia, we were quite impressed with Flair's services and with their overall product. The ground staff both at YOW and YYC were professional, friendly and helpful when dropping off our baggage and boarding us. The cabin crew on both legs were also both friendly and accommodating when we had any requests or questions during the flight. They were also clearly visible throughout the 4h flight handing out water and collecting garbage which is a definite plus, as I've flown on full service airlines where the crew disappears as soon as the food is served and collected. The cabin was a tad dirty with food crumbs on the floor and smudges on our window, but it's understandable when flying with a LCC, as I've seen worse. Yes, both legs of our flights were delayed for about 45 minutes but they were both due to missing passengers who probably checked-in online and didn't show up (which in my opinion, is not the airlines' fault). At least the airline had the courtesy to email us ahead of time to let us know of the delay. Yes, we had to pay extra to reserve our seats and also for checked-in luggage but the benefits of purchasing these extras online ahead of time was clearly mentioned on their website during the booking process and we also felt that the add-on prices were fair. Overall, if you're looking for an airline to fly from point to point, you can't go wrong with choosing Flair as they offer a no-frills option at a fraction of the price you would pay with either AC or WS. For us, with fares going for $60 one way (plus tax), we didn't expect much but feel that the airline exceeded our expectations. My only complaint would be that it'd be great if their seats could at least recline a little as that would help a lot with providing more comfort on a 4h flight.

### "$40 extra for the carry-on bag"
I booked a ticket from Vancouver to Edmonton. It was Flair Airlines flight, Date Aug.30 and return on Sept. 06/2021 It clearly says while booking one carry-on bag and one small bag is allowed but at the airport, they charged $40 extra for the carry-on bag saying that we are not responsible for third-party bookings. On the way back, the flight time was 10.10 am on itinerary it was changed to 9.10 am and nobody informed me, I know how I managed to catch the flight. Here that airline persons said we are not responsible for changes ask eDreams they should inform you. Basically, both Flair Airline and eDream are big scammers together.

### "book, check in online, and go directly to the gate"
Not Verified |  Never fly Flair - Flair charges for carry on bags and can increase the flight cost beyond AC or Westjet. If you have to fly Flair do not report that you have a carry-on at the check in counter. At the counter you are charged for the carry-on (I was charged $62 for mine). If you go directly to the gate, no one monitors your bags or even checks the sizes. I saw a passenger with a backpack and bag both grossly oversized and not paid for. There was a lady with a bag, a backpack, a large "purse" and a dog in a carrier. Obviously no one at the gate cares and none of the flight crew cares. If you want to go cheap - book, check in online, and go directly to the gate.

### "Expect cancellations, delays, and serious understaffing"
Expect cancellations, delays, and serious understaffing at the airport! Know your rights under the Canadian Transportation Agency's Air Passenger Protection Rules (APPR) before you book with this airline. Also read Flair's Domestic Scheduled Passenger Tariff about your rights. Delays are common with this airline. My flight was delayed for more than 13 hours before being cancelled, and I was entitled to (and given) the rights under the APPR and the Tariff only because I had asked. They are not going to feed you, provide you with a hotel, book you on another airline, or provide any compensation for inconvenience for which you may be eligible under the Rules/Tariff if you don't ask. Also try to purchase your ticket with a credit card that has flight delay insurance.

### "Horrible customer service"
Worst flight experience I’ve ever had. 7 hour delay leaving Calgary. 4 hour delay leaving Victoria. Horrible customer service. Inaccurate flight data given to airports. Run for your life towards any airline other than flair, pay double if you must! 11 hour delay for 90 min flight.

### "tagged on 230$ in cancelation fees"
Not Verified |  I bought 2 sets of tickets for different trips. I had a medical emergency the day 7 days before the trip which consisted of emergency surgery. And I was advised to stay home. This was not acceptable by flair airlines as reasonable. Thus I lost all my money. The second trip , we were prevented from boarding the plane because my husband’s expired ID card, for which we let them know that due to COVID, all expired drivers licences were automatically extended. This was also not acceptable for a flight from Toronto to Montreal. When we went to cancel tickets, not only Flair did not refund the fees, they tagged on 230$ in cancelation fees along with the ticket prices, thus making it easier to just not do anything and let the money burn.

### "No issues at all"
Not Verified |  No issues at all. Great price. I followed all their instructions to avoid extra charges. I would definitely fly with them again. Flight was on time. Captain and crew were very friendly. I booked an economy airline and got exactly what I was expecting.

### "flight was delayed for more than 11 hours"
Mon vol (no F8337) a été retardé de plus de 11Hrs. Le Vol du 12 juillet 2021 devait partir a 11:15am et a finalement quitté à + de 22:55pm.Plus de 11 hrs d'attente. Nous avons eu un courriel a 10:18am nous avisant que le vol sera remis a plus tard et que vous deviez nous donnez des nouvelles aux 30minutes. Nous avons eu un suivis seulement à 12:47pm nous avisant que le vol sera plutôt à 21:15pm. Nous n'avions eu aucune information de la part de l'agente sur place car elle ne savait pas quand et s'il y aurait un vol. Et aucun suivis de l'agent sur place. Aucune façon de vous rejoindre ni par téléphone ou courriel par personne qui se trouvait sur place ! On nous a offert jus, eau barre tendre pour plus de 11:00Hrs d'attente! C'est trop peu. Puis un courriel a 19:02 nous avisant que le vol sera plutôt a 22:55pm. Ce vol a été aussi retardé. - My flight (no F8337) was delayed for more than 11 hours. The July 12, 2021 flight was scheduled to depart at 11:15 a.m. and finally left at + 10:55 p.m. Over 11 hrs of wait. We got an email at 10:18 am advising us that the flight will be postponed and that you should update us every 30 minutes. We only got a follow-up at 12:47 pm advising us that the flight will be at 9:15 pm instead. We had no information from the agent on site because she did not know when and if there would be a theft. And no follow-ups by the agent on site. No way to reach you either by phone or email by anyone who was there! We were offered juice, soft bar water for more than 11:00 hours of waiting! It's not enough. Then an email at 19:02 advising us that the flight will be at 22:55 pm instead. This flight was also delayed.

### "Very disappointing service from Flair"
Not Verified |  Flair contacted us 2 weeks before our return flight from Kitchener, ON to Kelowna, BC to let us know that the flight was cancelled. They offered rebooking or refund of only the return portion of the ticket. Turns out they had completely cancelled the Kitchener-Kelowna route, so they had not reasonable rebooking option for us. In this case, Canadian Transportation Agency requires them to 1) book us on a flight home, even if on a different airline, and 2) refund the entire value of our ticket. Flair refused to do either one, and offered only a refund on the return portion. With 2 weeks from our scheduled return flight, how were we going to find reasonably priced tickets on another airline? Yet still they did nothing for us. Very disappointing service from Flair. We will probably not fly with them again. Their small size means that when something goes wrong, they have few (if any) options to put you on other flights, and they just leave you high and dry.

### "I can never recommend Flair"
Poor service, value money, do not keep time, charges less in order to change more on the luggage. I can never recommend Flair to someone.

### "gave us another flight for four days later"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I have ever seen. Both sides of my flight had long long delays. My return flight has been canceled once they gave us another flight for four days later with no paying for hotel or taxi. This airline is terrible.

### "sincerely hoping I get refunded"
Not Verified |  My flight was set to leave at 2300 on August 29th and was initially delayed 3 hours but I was not sent an email until 830pm. Lucky I was checking the airport website hours before. Then my flight was cancelled with no other flight offered until Wednesday so I had to book a flight with another airline in the AM and book a hotel. You can't get a hold of anyone to ask questions or get a refund immediately. I am sincerely hoping I get refunded my flight and hotel but something tells me this airline will not do the right thing. This airline leaves passengers stranded with no regard for them at all. Just pay the extra money to fly with someone else, because you're probably going to have to anyways. If I could give Flair a negative rating I most definitely would. I'm disgusted and will never book with Flair ever again.

### "Both my routes had long delays"
Not Verified |  Both my routes had long delays, and I am talking about 5 hour and 6 hour delays. There is no consideration for the people who want to fly to their destination. And on top of that the people in charge are rude and very defensive

### "last time I am taking this airline"
Not Verified |  I reached airport 2 hours prior to my flight. My Id expired day ago so they ask me to bring my passport. I sent my friend home and waited until my passport arrived. I was in line to drop my bag off as I checked in online the lady just walked away and never returned. I was traveling with 5 month old baby and 5:year old boy. I had all the thing in that bag. I cleared security check and went to have and talk to them regarding taking my bag as all baby products were inside. They never helped just tossing around from one rep to another. Flight left after 2 hours but they didn't make any attempt to bring my bag in. This is the last time I am taking this airline. Flight was scheduled at 2 pm and left Edmonton at 7:30 PM.

### "Pay the extra and fly elsewhere and arrive on time"
Flight to Abbotsford delayed 3 hours. Messed up my whole schedule. Then the flight back home delayed 5 hours. All in all horrible. Checking in every other airline has 4 to 6 people checking in. With a line up out the door Flair only has 2 and 1 person boarding the flights. No wonder they are always hours behind. Pay the extra and fly elsewhere and arrive on time. Planes are garbage as well not tv no WiFi and if they want they will give up your seat you paid extra for. Been on hold 4 hours trying to call them and complain.

### "The flight itself was great"
Not Verified |  I flew from Kitchener to Edmonton and return mid-August. Both flights were delayed. To Edmonton - 1 hour. To Kitchener - 2 hours. Was this inconvenient? Sure, but I paid just under $200 for a return ticket (no bags) so I really can't complain. The competing airline would have cost $600. The flight itself was great! If you want in-flight service and a dependable airline, I do recommend looking elsewhere. If you are flexible and don't mind being inconvenienced (moderately, in my case), give it a try. Both of my flights were at about 90% capacity.

### "vowed never to use this company again"
Purchased a round trip from Abbotsford to Ottawa. All went relatively well until my scheduled flight back to Abbotsford on the 23rd of August. I received an email the day I was suppose to return home saying that my scheduled flight at 2:00 pm was delayed until 9:00pm due to crew fatigue. A couple of hours later I received another email stating that my flight was delayed once more until 11:00pm due to pilot fatigue. It wasn't 2 hours later I received a third email from Flair Airlines stating that my flight was cancelled and to call customer service it I had any questions. I spent the better part of 5 hours on hold that day trying to get through to speak with somebody with zero success. Being left with no other options, I purchased another separate expensive return flight back to Vancouver for the next day. With no reasonable flights back to Abbotsford I was stuck taking a taxi from Vancouver Airport to Abbotsford to collect my vehicle and vowed never to use this company again. I advise anyone who is thinking of flying anywhere, stay away from this terrible company.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. Would not recommend this airline to anyone. We drove from Windsor to Waterloo International airport for our flight to Halifax NS. After being checked in, we were notified through email that the flight was delayed an hour, no announcement was made to anyone in the airport. After waiting over an hour for the delay, the flight was ultimately cancelled through an announcement in the airport. We then were made to line up in an extremely disorderly fashion with airport employees given little to no information from the airline as to what we were waiting for. At this point, the last people in the line were served first with the entire end half of the line being pushed to the front. When we finally got to the desk to be put on another flight, the Flair employee was trying to be as helpful as she could be. She told us there were seats available for us but as she was trying to book, she said there was something wrong with her computer and a couple who was served after us was given the seats. When I expressed my frustration to the supervisor, nothing was done in compensation, they also refused to comp our parking as we had waited for 3+ hour for our seats to be given away. We were also told that our flights were cancelled and we would receive an email confirming this within two hours of the cancellation but it was never received. Currently, I have been on hold with their helpline for over 2 hours with no end in sight. The flight was the cheapest option and now I see why. Once I told my family about this experience, stories of similar experiences were brought up instantly. Flair flights have been cancelled this week, leaving people stranded with no help. Terrible service, I will never be flying with Flair again.

### "Haven’t even flown with Flair"
Not Verified |  Haven’t even flown with Flair and know that I will never set foot on that aircraft. Our family booked tickets to fly from Waterloo to Halifax. 1 hour prior to the flight the passengers were informed that the flight was cancelled and that the next available flight would be in 1 week. The only compensation they offered was water and crackers. The same happened to the family members who tried flying from Halifax to Waterloo. Our family spent $1000 additional dollars to change flights to make sure they would get their destinations in a somewhat timely fashion. No vouchers were offered for additional flight and/or hotel costs. Never ever will I fly this airline. Expensive mistake.

### "Not worth using discounted airlines"
Not Verified |  My Flair Airlines flight was canceled last night, advising me of the canceled flight at 3.00pm (flight was scheduled for 11.00pm). They called the reason as "unfavorable conditions at the airport due to wildfire smoke" on literally the clearest night I've seen/smelt in several weeks. Many other flights went out last night without issue. I think the plane was just pretty much empty going to Ontario and they dropped the flight. On top of that, in order to reschedule this canceled flight, they charged me an additional $140? Not worth using discounted airlines – you’ll pay for it somewhere in the end.

### "Save yourself the headache and pay the extra $$$"
I would not recommend this airline at all. This is my first and last time flying Flair. Two hour delay on my way from Montreal to Halifax, and 6 hours on the way back home. Save yourself the headache and pay the extra $$$.

### "no communication or explanation from the staff"
Not Verified |  Worst company ever. Flew to Edmonton on Thursday and the plane was over an hour late with no communication or explanation from the staff. Return flight even worse. Arrived for original flight time of 1.35 pm and with no announcements from the airline finally found out the plane after 4 delays, was supposed to go out at 7.35 pm. Spoke to the supervisor and she told me to file a complaint with CRYC as she didn’t want to talk to me and wouldn’t call the manager to talk to me.

### "Both of my flights were delayed"
Absolute worst airline. Both of my flights were delayed. First one was 2 hours late and the second was 4 hours. The flight attendants were rude and didn’t seem to like their job . The landing was super rough. I have flown many airlines and this is by far the worst. I do not recommend flair airlines even though it is cheaper. Lastly the compensation was a rice crispy square.

### "Cannot recommend them at all"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I ever flew with. On our flight to Abbotsford it was a 5 hours delay and on our way back to Toronto the same again and we missed our next flight. Cannot recommend them at all. If you take a look in departures or arrivals every single flight of them is delayed. I’d rather pay a couple hundred bucks more and can rely on my flight than fly with that airline ever again.

### "You have to be prepared"
You have to be prepared – make sure you pay for your bags ahead of time and remember that carryons aren’t free. As long as you do that you’ll have an enjoyable flight with friendly staff. I’ve been flying with Flair a few times a year for a few years now and I’ve never had any insane delays, rude customer service, or bad experiences. Just plan ahead, pay for your things, and you’ll have a great flight.

### "They charged for everything"
Horrible experience. They charged for everything. Even after I paid for the whole premium pkg they charged again. Do not fall for the cheap marketing, it will cost you an arm and a leg. Their customer service will not get back to you and you will be on hold waiting, with no response.

### "flight delayed for 6.30 hours"
Abbotsford to Calgary flight delayed for 6.30 hours. Except a sorry in email, the airline didn't do anything for the customers waiting for the flight. Service is very poor and staff is non cooperative, an old couple was asking for a water bottle from staff but she said she is busy in other flight's boarding. Pay little extra and get a good flight otherwise you will lose more money then you think to save by traveling with flair.

### "need to pay $135 for two bags"
Not Verified |  Cheap price that's what it sounds like but you need to pay $135 for two bags so add $270 for your luggage for two way trip. The flight to Abbotsford was 2.5 hours late, the flight to Montreal was 5 hours late. So instead of 11pm the flight was supposed to take off at 4am. We have been waiting for 5 hours and suddenly missed to drop off our luggage which was finished 45 min before the flight. We were 7 minutes late. OK, our bad, we were tired because it was a middle of the night and missed it. Rescheduling costed us $125 and since the next day tickets were more expensive I needed to cover that as well. So another $225. And they don't even offer you a glass of water for a 5-hour flight. Nothing to say about something more than that. I agree I did wrong in some moments, however those delays and cheapest possible service is not what I expect to plan my vacation.

### "highly disappointed"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Abbotsford. I purchased tickets for my family of 5, the total cost was $800+ and we had to cancel. We were given $556 or so back as flight credit, I tried to redeem the credit but was unable to do so. I have called 3 times spending an average of 2 hours each call but no one to talk to. This is my first time buying a ticket but highly disappointed.

### "there was absolutely no issues with the flight"
Not Verified |  Before booking I didn't look at the reviews. After I booked my flight to Vancouver, I just wanted to see the reviews for the flight as the flights from Waterloo airport were pretty recent. I saw that a lot of people were negative and complaining about the flights and the airline. I do agree with some of the reviews but people need to remember that this is a low cost airline and there is a reason why these airlines are low cost. I could book with them at 1/4 of the cost of other airlines. Apart from the delays of like an hour for both going to Vancouver and coming back to Waterloo, there was absolutely no issues with the flight. The check in people are at both airports were super nice, the cabin crew were professional and helped everyone for extra comfort, we had a baby on lap and cabin crew without asking them came to us and provided us with an empty three-seat which I feel not possible with any other airline. The call center are definitely understaffed and its hard to get on call with them. But I would say to get from point A to point B Flair Airlines is a decent option. It would be unfair to give them so much negative reviews considering the pandemic and airlines being struggling. For those people who need extra comfort and luxury for travelling, pay up more like 2x or 3x for other airlines.

### "Flight was delayed 3 hours"
Worst company. Flight was delayed 3 hours to destination. Customer service was brutal, no communication and flight on the way home had one person working the check in. Missed our flight cause we waited 3 hours before being checked in.

### "I will never fly with Flair again"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our flight because of weather conditions but what’s funny is Flair was the only flight cancelled that day every other flight leaving Kelowna was fine, They said it was weather conditions so they didn’t have to pay for hotels or anything else to accommodate their customers, The next available flight they offered us was it for another three days, so we had to work with another airline last minute and it it ended up costing us $2300 to get home. I will never fly with Flair again and I recommend you don’t either.

### "refused me to board on plane"
Not Verified |  Do not make mistake of booking with this airline. I booked for first time with flair just because it was cheap. They didn’t even let me board on plane saying that I was late when I arrived at airport 3 hours prior to boarding. They keep on making me go to different desks until they figured am out of time to broad now. Then they asked me to pay again for my luggage when I already paid for 2 extra bags and said or I can leave my bags at airport and they are NOT responsible for any misplacement. When I refused to pay again for luggage they refused me to board on plane saying boarding time is over. I asked for refund as my ticket included travelflex they said sorry, no refund or rescheduling. I spent hours on phone to get in touch for 3 days to check my luggage was added to avoid any confusion at airport. She couldn’t even help me with what luggage I added saying she doesn’t have enough access to check.

### "over charge you with luggage"
Not Verified |  Terrible service for outbound and inbound. We have to wait in line to checked in even though we checked online already. As in huge line ups. They booked so many passengers in one flight during this pandemic seasons so where is the social distancing there. When they saw my mother on a wheelchair and me carrying my baby, we would probably one of the passengers waiting in line and late boarding. We end up waiting for 3 hrs on the plane. And people still boarding and they blamed the security not their front desk staffs checking in people. And the first checked in baggage allowance is 23kg for $50+ if you go over 1-5kg you have to pay extra $100+ already. So cheap plane fare but they will over charge you with luggage/baggage. Not even a consideration just at least a little bit extra charge but it's $100+ extra. The 2nd check baggage is more cheaper than the 1-5kg extra. DO not fly with Flair. Flight attendants are not bad, friendly and nice but their policy are stupid and ridiculously terrible even some of their check-in staff were not friendly.

### "Customer Service is mediocre"
Pros: Very clean plane, flight prices are cheap, you are allowed to take on any pillow & blanket. Has the potential to improve but needs to improve drastically. Good for short flights only. Cons: App only works every now & then,ou can only take 1 small personal item on the plane that fits under the seat in front. ie... purse or laptop bag. (I used a fanny pack & small backpack). Carry on/checked bag costs $59 plus tax if booked each way through the app and if the app is working at that time. Carry on bag paid at the airport costs $79 each way. Checked bag at the airport costs $129 each way. If you are 6ft+ you will require a seat that has extra leg space. That costs $59 each way. If you want to select your own seat that costs anywhere from $11-59 each way if the app is working. Not recommended for kids under 12 or who are unable to hold there pee for the full duration of the flight. Only one bathroom in use and the wait is over 1hr plus once you get in the air. Seating space on the plane is tight and isle is extremely narrow. No social distancing at all. No food, drink not even water is offered on the plane. Be sure to grab something from Tim's. Customer Service is mediocre depending on who you get. Wait times to speak with someone on the phone are 2hrs plus to get through if the phone lines are opened. If the phones are closed you can email and it's possible when they respond they refer to you as someone else's name. If you have to cancel a flight they will only put the credit in that person's name that the ticket was booked for even if you paid for it. You have to pay for wifi on the plane.Upon landing one of the overhead compartments opened, thankfully nothing fell out and hit anyone in the head. Flight doesn't leave or land as scheduled ie..you will leave and arrive late. On the flight back which was supposed to be a direct flight from VAN to TO they decided to stop in Abbotsford to refuel? So we had to go up and down twice in one hr. Seats do not recline

### "recommend them strongly"
Not Verified |  I booked tickets for my wife and I to go to Edmonton but due to medical issues, had to cancel her ticket which messed up my reservation. But Flair’s response was impressive, politely correcting it and exceeding expectations with efficiency. Kudos for their skill & caring. I’ll fly Flair again and recommend them strongly.

### "This airline is a joke"
This airline is a joke. I will never make the mistake of booking with them again, I should have trusted the reviews. They cancelled my flight hours before the departure for 'unscheduled maintenance'. My flight was at 11:30 am and I got the email at 8:15 am. There was no option to reschedule or book myself on another flight. Was on the hold for hours and no answer - had to hang up eventually. I travelled from Victoria to Vancouver to try and catch a Flair flight the same day as to avoid paying an arm and a leg to book a completely separate flight with another airline. The check in line at YVR was a nightmare, they were so slow and weren't even half done checking in people who were on a flight that was already boarding. I tried telling one of the representatives my situation and a lady rudely yelled at me and said they will get to me after they finish checking in everyone for the upcoming flights. I asked someone to check for me earlier if there was space on the 11 pm flight and she said there was a few spots. The lady who was helping me couldn't even help me directly, she had to phone a number and wait on hold for someone else to book me and after she hung up she realized that they booked me for a flight on the wrong day so she had to call back and wait on hold again and by the time she called back that flight was full. They are completely incompetent and have no idea what they are doing. While I was there I also heard the stories of multiple people who had their luggage lost for over two weeks by this airline.

### "Extremely unhappy customer"
I booked a return flight with Flair Airlines and this will be the last time I ever fly with this company. The only positive thing I have to say is that the staff was friendly but the fact that both of my flights were delayed over an hour simply because of poor planning and incompetence is unacceptable. The first flight was delayed to take off because one woman never boarded the plane, so Flair held up the entire plane to wait for one person who never even showed up. The captain said it was illegal to leave when the passenger count doesn’t match the manifest? They don’t make it in time for boarding you leave them behind, it’s an airline not a babysitting service. If you don’t want to spend at least twice as long on the plane as what your flight time is, do not book with this company. I’m currently writing this from the tarmac where we have been waiting for an hour now and the captain just said it should be another 20 or so minutes. As the cherry on top they do not care to enforce the mask rule on the flights and I saw over 10 people who just had them sitting on their chins and were not ticketed or even asked to keep them on. They don’t even put in the bare minimum effort. Extremely unhappy customer.

### "all very nice and friendly"
You get what you pay for. You want a snack or inflight entertainment, go someone else. If you want to get from point A to Point B without breaking your bank account then go with Flair. Bring your own form of entertainment, your own snacks and you are good to go. Everyone I encountered either at the ticket desk or flight attendants, they were all very nice and friendly. I traveled with two kids aged five, we had absolutely no issues, what so ever. I don't understand what everyone has been complaining about.

### "Horrible experience from beginning to end"
Horrible experience from beginning to end. We were flying with our baby and no one at the airport knew about baggage allowances for the baby. It took over an hour to check in. The plane was incredible uncomfortable even though it was the first time it ever flew. No tv, you can’t even recline the seats and there was barely any airflow. Both flights were delayed last minute and our return flight the plane was still dirty with garbage. First flight at checkin we asked if it was sold out because we would ask for a seat with our baby, we were told it was only upon boarding to see half of the plane empty. Our baggage on return flight was lost and it took their customer service email 2 weeks to respond to me. When I was contacted they said their courrier service wasn’t set up yet so I could wait on our baggage (which included our baby’s bed and car seat) or pick it up at the airport ourselves. When we are went to pick it up, turns out it had been there for a week and no one told us. Their customer service is actually non existent and therefore not worth the slight discount. Do not recommend.

### "not recommending anyone to fly flair."
This is the second time taking this airline and I won’t make that mistake again. Seconds time they delay flight this time 5 hours. They don’t communicate to each other and why the delays were taking place then ended up getting everyone to exit security, to stand in line at customer service for almost an hour and half the time no one even showed up to tell us what the plan was, the. When we finally go thru security the workers are getting upset at us because their section is going to close in 10 min like it’s out fault and we havnt been miss guided and have been delayed for passed 5 hours. They refused to offer accommodations if flight would have been canceled and no flight departures for another two days later if our flight didn’t take off. Carry-on baggage cost was excessively expensive 62$, limited liquid products allowed (must fit in a small ziplock they provide with no flexibility if you bring 1-2 products extra they will no allow you to board with them which I’ve never before delt with let alone have no warning of this procedure. No food, no drink, no charging port and no Wi-Fi on board. Overall experience Never flying not recommending anyone to fly flair. In fact I would recommend you do not. You’ve been warned.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Not Verified |  First time I have flown with Flair Airlines and I must say the staff was courteous, helpful, polite and just overall amazing. Would definitely fly with them again.

### "Flair is among the best we have found"
Helpful with the flight crew equally so. Plane left on time, plenty of legroom. Return flight was delayed but we were notified and offered the option to change our return to the next available flight which was three days later - this we chose to do. There were issues contacting Flair by both e-mail and phone, which were somewhat worrying, and when we showed up at the airport to catch the rebooked flight there was no record of our change so we were charged for the trip back to Halifax. Once again all the flair employees were unfailingly polite, pleasant and extremely helpful. We had received a number of auto-replies to e-mails assuring us that Flair would honour requests and they were as good as their word. Once their communication problems were solved we received a full refund in quick time. We have travelled with several budget airlines before and Flair is among the best we have found. We congratulate them on the calibre of their staff and would recommend them for a short haul flight. Make sure you understand all the costs involved, comply with the baggage dimensions, check-in requirements etc when you book and your flights will be great value.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. They lost my luggage and they did not contact me when it arrives 2 days later. They did not want to ship it to Quebec, so i had someone go to take it and there was no agent at the place they told me to go! No one, so i cant get to my luggage and I can't have someone on the phone to help me. Worst service for a mistake they make.

### "worst customer service ever"
Absolutely the worst customer service ever. Call them: their office is closed, even when you call during business hours. If you do ever get through, the recording states that is it better to email them with your request. I tried that option, it took 9 days to get a reply, but only after I followed up with 3 more emails. I the end their resolution to our problem may have worked, if we had gotten through on day 1. Zero ownership of their admitted customer care issues. Ni help what so ever.

### "Lot of hidden fees"
Not happy with this airline at all. Got my tickets for myself and my girlfriend 6 months ago. Paid 110$ each. After all, after all hidden fees had to pay almost 750$. Lot of hidden fees - online check in carry-on says 30-50$. Paid 66$ each. Be aware. For the same money, you can fly with better airlines.

### "3 times cheaper than WestJet"
Not Verified |  Flair was 3 times cheaper than WestJet and Air Canada and had very good direct flights in the middle of the day. Our return flight got canceled due to mechanical issues and we were booked in their next flight, which was 4 days later, that was inconvenient. However, Flair paid for our hotel (Sandman Signatures) for the 4 nights we needed to stay longer and gave us food vouchers in value of $60 per person per day for 3 days. We enjoyed our extended stay and this was by far the best treatment we ever got when we got stranded.

### "when I did reach Flair they were very accommodating"
Not Verified |  My Mom was admitted to the hospital and couldn't make the trip to Vancouver in May so we canceled her flight. The reopening made it difficult to reach Flair to get the credit to fly again however, when I did reach Flair they were very accommodating. Staff member at customer service was excellent setting us up in time to fly out only two days away from when we planned to fly. The fare is excellent and we can fly right out of our own city making it easy to get to the airport and is a direct flight to Vancouver. This is a very important visit for my Mom who will be meeting her great grand daughter for the first time.

### "Cannot even secure luggage"
Total disregard for customers, insensitive to their failure and incompetence. Cannot even secure luggage from the counter to the plane, thereby misplacing the Luggage on such a short flight as Toronto to Ottawa. This particular incompetence caused me a great deal of frustration and grief. I could not get into my house, could not drive my car, could not have access to my medication, due to the airline losing my luggage. Can you imagine boarding a flight on one of the shortest routes in Canada only to find that your carry-on luggage that was checked in, containing every of my household accessories is missing and the staff have no idea what happened to the luggage.

### "best experience with the staff"
Not Verified |  On Wednesday July 7th I had the best experience with the staff of the Flair team on board my flight. I had recently been very anxious and I want it to be recognized that team members Robert and Nicole went above and beyond anything they could do to help me. They treated me so well and calm that they helped my anxiety through out the plane ride. I would like to say that people like Nicole and Robert are the people needed to be flight attendants in all airlines.

### "they took $80 for my bag"
This airline sucks. Their seats are the worst, I had a bag of 5.5 kg and they took $80 for my bag just for the flight from Ottawa to Vancouver. Air Canada didn’t charge me anything for this bag. This has been the worst flight I have ever been in and will never ever fly flair airlines.

### "Don’t fly Flair if you have a connection"
Not Verified |  I fly internationally at least once a year and by no means expected this one hour flight within the province to be so poorly handled. Firstly, it seems that I’m not the only one with baggage loss issues, and because it’s a ‘discount airline’ they couldn’t care less if you see your baggage anytime soon. Secondly, training seems inconsistent. From Ottawa to Toronto, boarding started when lift off was supposed to be, from Toronto to Ottawa they closed boarding early and while the plane sat on the tarmac for close to half an hour right by the gate, I saw two groups of people get turned away because ‘boarding ends strictly 15 minutes prior to liftoff’. Don’t fly Flair if you have a connection wherever you’re going that you have to make.

### "will be flying Flair from now on"
Speaking with Rick from Flair on a question I had as well as fee concern I had and he was great! Answered my questions and rectified the situation! Flair was great to fly with and so convenient flying into Kitchener instead of Toronto. Only 20 minutes away from my parents! I will be flying Flair from now on for my visits home.

### "extremely competent and responsive"
Not Verified |  Flair was extremely competent and responsive when I wanted to cancel a flight within 24 hours of booking. I submitted an online request and it was processed without issue. Their price point is wonderful, and I can't wait to do more travelling with them when I am able!

### "Overall, I like Flair"
My experience travelling with Flair had some moving parts. The customer service team that handles communications (likely their head office) is one of the best customer service teams I've every dealt with. They are so professional, compassionate, and willing to help. I've dealt with different agent via the chat system (JJ, Kristen, Maya) for different flights and they're so courteous and helpful and fast. I wish ALL the Flair staff was like the customer service agents. At the airport the check-in agents are also very helpful and patient I watched them operate under so much pressure, long lines or frustrated people and they keep their cool. The individuals who check your passports right before you get on the plane, I didn't have a good experience with them, I travel with 2 toddlers and those agents ar so dry and unwilling to lend just a extra hand (with my stroller). But that's a hit and miss. The flight attendants are fine. Sometimes they're all nice, sometimes you get some who are pretty dry. With Flair you already know that there no extras and even less with during the pandemic but I've been pretty lucky to get good flight attendants who can accommodate extra water when I run out. Overall, I like Flair, the customer service team makes up for anything the rest of the staff lack. Also, you can't beat the prices.

### "price discrepancies on their website"
Flying during COVID for medical procedure. This is a discount carrier and no food or beverage offerings were available. Flight cabin staff were great, but can't say they did very much cause there was nothing to offer the passengers. On flight "entertainment" consisted of poor quality apps and 10-15 minute video clips (No movies or TV shows were available). Called customer service regarding price discrepancies on their website, I needed to book a flight online and the pricing didn't add up correctly. Talked to a customer service agent on line and he was very pleasant at first. He tried to explain to me the price discrepancy, but after walking him through my issue he realized that I was correct that their website was messed up.He then called me on my cell phone and proceeded to lie to me saying the price difference is airport tax and fees, and again I proved him wrong by showing him the price breakdowns. He put me on hold for 30 minutes and afterwards he said he would call me back in 2 minutes. He never called back and/or followed up. I appreciate his efforts to help, but lying to a customer is not the right way to do business.

### "customer service has been by far the best I've ever experienced"
Not Verified |  I haven't had the chance to take this flight yet, as it was a trip planned for July 2020 - but the level of customer service has been by far the best I've ever experienced with an airline. They credited my original flight price and then extended my credit another year since I still haven't been able to fly - both done within minutes of calling / emailing them.

### "extended all vouchers for another year"
Not Verified |  I have been very impressed with Flair for extending travel vouchers due to the pandemic once again. I just emailed customer service to ask if expiring vouchers can be extended and got a very quick reply letting me know that they have extended all vouchers for another year!

### "fabulous representative for Flair Airlines"
I had an issue that was entirely my error when I booked my flights. I tried to utilize the reservation department number that I found on Google to make the correct changes within 15 minutes of booking-they were not at all helpful and somehow managed to screw up my booking even more by cancelling the 1st leg of my trip! Then wanted me to pay $182 to change the flights. I declined knowing that I could cancel the flights within 24 hours and get my money back and re-book. I reached out via email and Facebook messenger to try to find a solution. While trying to explain the situation that was now further complicated, I asked for a phone call-just easier to explain that way. Within a minute of giving my number I received a call from Maya - she understood what had happened and said that there is no issue at all with making the changes. She was pleasant, knowledgeable and a pleasure to speak with. She solved my issue and corrected it very quickly. Thank you Maya, you removed all the stress from the mistake I made. Thank you for understanding that human error happens. You are a fabulous representative for Flair Airlines and I hope they recognize how amazing you are!

### "Thank you so much Maya"
Not Verified |  I had a trip departing at 7:25 am on January 21. On my way to the airport I had the unfortunate event of getting in a car accident. With my Uber drive ( fortunately No one was hurt) but I had missed my flight. At 12pm I called the customer support of flair air and had the pleasure of speaking with (Maya) I asked her if there’s anyway I could get some sort of voucher of some sort. She replied by saying “ we could try but I can’t give you any promises, but you’d have to provide us with The police report”, she provided me with an email address etc and I said that I’ll see if I could get it to them. Minutes later while I was booking a new ticket with the same airline I got a call from Flair  Maya) who told me that she spoke to her manager and they’re going to refund me my money back, but I have to pay a minimal fee to change the ticket etc. Being a perfect timing I asked her if I could pay the The difference and book a new ticket on Sunday Jan 24 instead and have it a round trip ( unlike my original flight) She replied saying “ yes we could definitely do that “. We then booked the new flight and she stayed on the phone with me throughout the whole time, to make sure I get the email etc. Thank you so much Maya.

### "we were pleasantly surprised"
Wanted to acknowledge Flair customer service. They gave us a courtesy partial credit (after deducting $25/passenger) good until March 2022 on our flight. We had hoped to travel from BC to AB for the Christmas holiday but there have been COVID-19 travel public health orders/ restrictions so we were unable to (legally) travel. Wasn't expected any credit from Flair since their policy is pretty clear about no refunds so we were pleasantly surprised.

### "Flair is not worth it"
Beware of Flair! This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with. I fly frequently with all kinds of airlines, some better than others. To be honest, I am not picky. I have done it all. Flair Airlines mishandled my bags and ended up losing my luggage. I made a report right away, but honestly, there was no point. When they lose your luggage, don't even bother, they will just dismiss you and make excuses for why they really could care less what happens to you or your stuff. You trust that when you check in your bags with an airline, you will get your stuff back when you land. WestJet misplaced my luggage for a couple of hours once and gave me $100. Flair is not worth it. Pay a couple of extra dollars and take any other airline. At least you know you will have your things when you land.

### "satisfied with the service"
I flight to Vancouver 4 times during between August 2019 to April 2020 and I was satisfied with the service they provide cause its fair for the price. I booked a round flight to Vancouver on Dec 20 and 14 Jan and I wanted to change the return date to another day because I wanted to be with my sister on her birthday on 16 Jan and I talked to their customer service staff named Sindy and she was so nice and she changed the return date to 25 Jan and waived the change fee of $125. I am really thankful that they did that.

### "amazing service from him"
Not Verified |  Had a wonderful flight. I forget the mans name, but he was amazing, he helped me find my ID that I lost. He also changed my seat for me because I was worried of covid. Also made everyone on the plane laugh! He was great, amazing service from him.

### "fly with Flair Airlines again"
Saskatoon to Vancouver. My flight was cancelled due to weather and Melvin from Flair Airlines was quick to help me rebook my flight on a day that worked for me. I will definitely fly with Flair Airlines again.

### "provided outstanding service"
Not Verified |  Service representative, Cindy Kay, provided outstanding service in her handling of changes that were necessary on four purchased tickets. My concerns were understood and she acted quickly and effectively to remedy the situation to my full satisfaction.

### "will fly with Flair again"
Plane was clean, staff was exceptional, seats were normal, arrived early. Because of Covid we had no food but not airlines fault. The fair was very reasonable and the 737 800 series was better than expected. I am very satisfied and will fly with Flair again.

### "things became very straightforward"
Not Verified |  I was unable to make my flight and needed help for my next step and what that entailed. I thought for sure I was going to have to forfeit my money but after a very pleasant conversation with a woman things became very straightforward. I told her that my date of travel needed to be changed. I wanted to change my travel date for two weeks later, to which she told me that route will no longer be available since it is seasonal. I briefly told her how unfortunate that was and before I knew it she kindly told me “don't worry, I'll refund your full amount due to our scheduling”.

### "pleased with the customer services"
Excellent customer service! I had the pleasure of Mimi A assist me with rebooking a flight! I have had a bad experience with flair in the past but my most recent experience has changed my mind and I am so pleased with the customer services I was provided.

### "Thanks for a great experience"
We had booked a flight with Flair but since the pandemic hit, we were not advised to fly for non-essential matters. We asked for a refund and Flair was very willing to process that for us without question. It was just very nice to deal with this airline. When we are ready to fly again, we will certainly consider Flair. Thanks for a great experience.

### "Thank you for making the re-booking easy"
My son and his girlfriend booked a flight from Calgary to Victoria and the price was absolutely affordable! Sadly, Flair cancelled their Vancouver to Victoria leg of the trip so we had to re-book. I called Flair and left my number for a call-back and also emailed. I received a call back much later, but the re-booking was very easy. The following day, a staff member from Flair sent me an email to confirm that the flights had been booked and we were satisfied. She was so professional and kind. Thank you for making the re-booking easy despite the fact that the flight to Victoria had been cancelled.

### "staff were professional and pleasant"
All flights left on time, check in staff were professional and pleasant. Airline crew were professional and actually a lot of fun. Seats were basic. What else do you need in a economy airline?

### "my experience was alright"
I was quite nervous about the flight because I purchased tickets prior to reading any customer reviews. I have to say though that my experience was alright. Their crew was friendly and helpful. We got there and back no issues, only the return flight was delayed like 15 mins which I did not think was any big deal. Hey, for a budget airline, I was satisfied. And yes, they do charge for carry ons but hey, the other airlines just add that to their higher ticket price too. Overall was fine.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
I was able to get a fairly cheap flight last minute. I expected to pay for things like a carry on (maybe it was a little overpriced but it’s what I needed). The seat selection price was only $13 if you wanted to choose a window or aisle near your original assigned seat which actually is not to bad. I didn’t expect the plane to have outlets and because of COVID there was no on board food service but again expected. Based on other reviews I was expecting worse but was pleasantly surprised. I would fly again for sure. Also the staff were quite nice and I appreciated them being pretty consistant about making sure people were wearing masked correctly which made me feel a bit better .

### "find it unbelievable that an airline can and will do this"
Not Verified |  Flair cancelled the flight on August 13th due to plane issues. They gave out the wrong phone number in order to rebook and did not check their emails. When contacted they wouldn’t offer another flight until over a week later all with no compensation. I find it unbelievable that an airline can and will do this to their customers. I’ll never be one again.

### "poor customer service"
Booked a flight on Flair today and advised my kids and Grandson that I would be there at 8:20pm. Drove 45 min to the airport and was informed my flight was delayed almost 7 hours. Phoned my daughter and advised her that although she had to work tomorrow, pickup time was 3am. Told her I would take a cab, but she would not hear of it. Flight cost almost $400 return and I thought of cancelling, but couldn't do this to my Grandson. Phoned Flair and was on hold for an hour and a half .. and asked for a discount ... after driving 45 min home. Was told they could give me a food voucher or $20 refund. I am disgusted. This is the first time I've encountered the absolute lack of customer service. Was told by the customer service rep that they couldn't predict the future and what would happen. I wouldn't recommend Flair to anyone. They are just a cheap airline with poor customer service.

### "I cannot recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I purchased 3 unlimited go passes for my father to escort my children back and forth for custody exchanges. I was unable to use these passes due to Covid. I requested a refund but was denied and instead given vouchers. Because my children are minors, and they were each given individual vouchers, i was unable to do anything online and had to call customer service each time. I have been yelled at, hung up on repeatedly, simply refused service, told they just couldn't help me, cut off, condescended, and all manner of other behaviour by the utterly useless and rude customer service staff. I have spent so much time on the phone with this company trying to do simple things like book flights that they should have to pay me a salary. Also - while i was given vouchers in lieu of my unlimited Go Passes, the vouchers i was given did not have the same rights as the unlimited Go Passes did - they included no luggage and no priority boarding, which meant that it would cost me an extra $130 per leg of each flight to get the same rights I had before. I spent hours on the phone trying to get this fixed and was told it could not be done over the phone and would have to be done by e-mail. I sent the e-mail twice with no response. I called and got escalated to a manager who told me it could be done at the airport. I went to the airport not knowing whether my luggage would be included or not, where they told me they had no authority to make this change and it needed to be done over the phone. I asked to have all the passes fixed to include the original luggage rights and was denied. When you ask to get escalated to a manager, you have to wait 2 days for a call-back - they simply will not get you a manager on the phone, even after being on hold for 2 hours. When i finally got to fly - there was no food or beverage service, but no one advised of this in advance. (Covid). However, one of the stewardesses sat down beside an employee flying standby in the row in front of me where they did nothing but chat loudly for an hour and a half while the customers around them were all trying to sleep (early morning flight). When she finally got up, she offered to get him water in his own reused paper cup. In the middle of Covid. While there was no water being offered to customers. The seats are tiny, with the least leg room I have ever experienced. There is absolutely no in flight entertainment of any kind. And there are no charger stations for your phone or laptop. All this to save $30/$40 on a flight (unless you need luggage or even a carry on, in which case you will actually end up paying more than a major carrier for your flight.). Social distancing rules observed by the other carriers were not observed and literally every seat in a row was full (while the employee flying standby had a whole row to himself). I cannot recommend this airline to anyone. In fact, I highly recommend avoiding it at any cost.

### "rescheduled to an inconvenient date"
Not Verified |  My flight was rescheduled to an inconvenient date outside my consent and with no warning. I tried to call twice on different days to demand an explanation only to be put on hold for an hour. I also have gotten no reply by email. I was willing to accept a travel voucher or at least be able to speak with any representative–someone should know that this is not okay to do to their customers.

### "I am refusing the voucher"
I booked a trip leaving Friday night and back Sunday night (since I was working Friday during the day, and Monday). They switched the times to Depart on Friday morning (Which I obviously can't make) and return on Monday (which again conflicts with my work schedule). I kept on calling and calling requesting a refund on service not provider, their customer service was always reading off the same script : no refund, take your new flight, or a voucher valid for a year.They are now holding my money hostage, and wouldn't refund me a service that they simply could not and did not provide The CTA stated the following : "The Canadian Transportation Agency has now conceded that their statement is not a legally binding document and that it doesn’t affect the rights of passengers or obligations to airlines. It is a strategic move on their part to try and save face,” This shows that the credits and vouchers was merely a suggestion, and that airlines can still issue refunds for services not rendered, which is the case here. The service was not provided. And yet, when they got in touch, they stated that the CTA "Gave them the go ahead to issue vouchers instead of refunds", which is a lie With noting this CTA statement too (They very much conveniently left out this part) : "While any specific situation brought before the CTA will be examined on its merits, the CTA believes that, generally speaking, an appropriate approach in the current context could be for airlines to provide affected passengers with vouchers or credits for future travel, as long as these vouchers or credits do not expire in an unreasonably short period of time (24 months would be considered reasonable in most cases).” Here The CTA suggests that 24 months valid voucher. Flair airlines issued 12 months. We can now see that this airline only quotes the CTA when its suitable to their interested. Customers interest don't even come in consideration. Finally, I want my money back, not their 12 months voucher. I requested my money refunded for a service not provided. It's that simple. I paid for a service, and they couldn't provide it after all. I don't want my money held under the form of travels credits or vouchers. I am refusing the voucher or the travel credits.

### "a voucher valid for a year"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst! I booked a trip leaving Friday night and back Sunday night (since I was working Friday during the day, and Monday). They switched the times to Depart on Friday morning (Which I obviously can't make) and return on Monday (which again conflicts with my work schedule). I kept on calling and calling requesting a refund on service not provider, their pathetic customer service was always reading off the same script : no refund, take your new flight, or a voucher valid for a year. Perfect example of a company using Covid crisis as an excuse for poor customer service and money grab tactics.

### "outstanding customer service"
Not Verified |  Mary and Ann on flight from Calgary to Toronto in October 2019, delayed but such great personality! Great communication and outstanding customer service. Thank you for keeping me smiling during an extended boarding delay.

### "only option was for us was a single use voucher"
Not Verified |  Due to the pandemic a wedding we were attending in BC during early May was cancelled and thus we inquired about a refund for the 7 tickets we purchased for round trip flights (over $2000 was spent). As a family of 7 finances due to this situation are now tight and Flairs only option was for us was a single use voucher. All 7 of us will not be able to afford a trip this or next year as a result nor would all 7 of is likely travel together again in that time frame as 3 members of the family are in university.

### "absolutely no complaints"
Not Verified | Toronto to Vancouver via Calgary. Absolutely no complaints with the service I received on my flight this week. I half expected them to charge me extra, as I had more carry-on than I was supposed to, but no problem. The plane was clean. No food served due to COVID-19, which was understandable. Comfortable flight. I'd fly with them again. BTW, I saved $200 by booking with them, rather than Westjet or Air Canada! 👍

### "still waiting for a reply"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford. I booked this flight for my niece in Dec 2019 to fly on March 30th. Flair postponed the flight to April 2 - which was reasonable given the COVID situation. However, they later went on to cancel the flight leaving my niece stranded in Winnipeg with no way to return home. Other airlines were flying just fine. While Flair has a stringent no change policy without insurance, I wasn't expecting to cover their inability to fulfill their side of the bargain. I flew my niece out via Swoop Mar 30th since it was urgent for her to return home and it is now April 6 & we are still waiting for a reply from Flair as to whether they will refund my money. I hold little hope though because this airline isn't even on the scoreboard when it comes to customer service.

### "stuck in Abbotsford since yesterday"
I am stuck in Abbotsford since yesterday due to Flair Airlines cancelling the flight back to Calgary. I was in Abbotsford for a funeral and I went to the airport there was no one from the airline at the counter. The Flair system allowed me to pay for a seat and check in on line one day earlier. This is shameful unprofessional action from an organizational that should have the social responsibility to take care of the individuals affected by the current situation during their travels. I hope management/ employees realize the situation and do the right thing, instead of offering a voucher. (C$65)

### "made me pay for the backpack"
Due to the Corona Virus I went to stay with my parents in Calgary. I had to come back to Vancouver for an Emergency matter. I left my bags with them as Im going back to calgary. I left my Apartment Key. I called my mom She brought it to the airport. There was still plenty of time left. I asked the Girl from the counter if I can Go and get the Key from my mom, She was not responsive they held me there for 10 minutes Until they said that there is no time to go back and get the key through the security. I didnt have a baggage or any thing it could only take 5 minutes. They gave me lots of made up excuses and threatened that I might lose my flight. I faced a lot of difficulties  because of them not being Cooperative. I wouldn't even hold the plane. Also when I boarded (with out my Apartment key) They didn't let me sit on The Exit rows although the plane was empty due to Virus. The Attendant said They need to have Documentation! Also they made me pay for the backpack that I have been using for two years taking their flights and not paid anything for it even once. This is how they treat Customers. The head attendant came to me with explanations and not apologies telling me that the Girl at the gate is Upset.

### "non-accommodating staff"
Calgary to Winnipeg. It’s a wonder the reviews for this airline are over 2 stars .. terrible desk staff, no consistency with regards to what constitutes “personal carry on”, non-accommodating staff. This was my first and certainly my last, experience with the airline. It takes nothing to be polite.

### "Flair was awesome!"
Not Verified |  Flair was awesome! I flew to Edmonton for crazy cheap with my son. No issues at all and great customer service. I am so sad to hear they are leaving Abbotsford! We had a horrible experience with Swoop and was only ever going to book with flair.

### "no flexibility in travel rebook dates"
Not Verified |  My husband fell ill before our flight and I tried to phone 48 hours before departure but was placed on hold for several hours. When a service agent spoke to me, she indicated that we would could cancel but we would receive NO refund. She gave us a three month window within which we could rebook and travel but we would have to pay $150 each plus taxes for a "rebooking fee". When I told her my son was in school for the next three months and could not take time off until the following month, she told me that there was no flexibility in travel rebook dates; he had to use it within this window. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, she told me that it was moot. She explained that I would have to be placed on hold for another few hours and that the answer would be the same. I waited for the supervisor (for 1.5 hours) who literally laughed aloud when I told him that this was inequitable and that we could only travel the month following the allotted window. He told me there was no one else to whom I could appeal. He suggested I send an email to the customer service agent. He then told me that he had cancelled my flight but when I asked for a cancellation number, he said that there was none to share but an email would be forthcoming. No email was sent and I couldn't apply for trip cancellation insurance without it. Flair Air is a risky airline; I strongly caution anyone who is considering booking. Pay the extra money to book with a reliable and reputable airline.

### "lost all confidence in rebooking "
On March 10,2020, I received an email stating that my flight that I booked for march 26th, from Calgary to Abbotsford has been cancelled due to scheduling changes and I've been placed on the next available flight. Well not only does this not work for me, but I am now out $300 additional that I now have to pay extra to rebook my flight for me and my son so that we can be Abbotsford on time to Check into our event that we are attending for 4 days. This is my first time booking with Flair airlines. I took a huge change one month ago when I booked the 2 way flight for me and my son with Flair. I could have gotten the flight with WestJet for just slightly more, but I thought I would give Flair a chance, and now this has happened. I've already lost all confidence in rebooking in the future. I am planning a trip to Halifax this coming August, and was again planning to use Flair airlines, but after this cancellation, considering I now have to spend an additional $300 to rebook immediately, how could I chance using this company again? And with no compensation offered for the extra expense I now have incurred. To make this even worse, I called Flair today and they could not even tell me why the flight was cancelled. Again to top it all of, on both the flair website, and flight network, it currently says thay the flight that is supposedly cancelled is still available.

### "flight attendants were great"
Edmonton to Toronto. I would consider myself a fairly seasoned traveler. I expected a no frills experience, and I got it. With these low fare airlines, operations can be dicey, so I was expecting rough waters in terms of check in, baggage drop, boarding, on time departure, etc. Not the case at all! Every single person at the airline was incredibly friendly and incredibly accommodating. We were riding the line in terms of baggage drop time on the way to Edmonton, and the employee working the bag drop made sure everyone in line heading to Edmonton got their bags in before the cutoff, which we appreciated. The flights left on time. Boarding was quick and efficient. The flight attendants were great. They came around several times with the paid food cart and the flights weren’t full at all. We purchased their unlimited travel pass so just paid for taxes/fees and our seat charges (emergency exit row). There isn’t Wifi, there isn’t entertainment. Food options are sparse, which seems like a missed opportunity for Flair. Sandwiches or hot food (like in many Euro budget airlines) seems like an easy thing to do. But, for what it was, it was perfect. I’m excited to fly them again and will have no hesitation to book them again.

### "picture ID, had expired one month prior"
Calgary to Vancouver. Traveling with my 60+ blind father and my 13-year-old son, to visit my sister for her graduation in Calgary. We arrived at YVR to check in for what we thought would be an easy, quick domestic flight turned into a living nightmare and the Flair Air staff and YVR staff supervisor were the most unhelpful, unempathetic and rude people I have ever dealt with. My father's DL, his only picture ID, had expired one month prior to our flight. We pleaded with staff to help us, as turning around at this point to drive 2.5 hours round trip home and back to YVR to grab his passport which he only uses for international travel would cause all of us to miss our flight. A flight which only operates once a day to our intended destination. Not only did Flair Air refuse to accept his ID, they told us that they would charge us to book him another flight. This was our first and last time we will fly Flair Air.

### "ticket prices are much lower"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Edmonton. Flair is a good airline if you understand what its like to travel in Canada vs the rest of the world. Flair's ticket prices are much lower than the premium airlines especially because it gives you the option to save money. Bring your own entertainment device - no entertainment on board. Bring your own food too.

### "great experience"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Calgary. I was very nervous to fly with Flair air after reading  many negative reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth it went. Nice plan, friendly staff and great experience all the way around.

### "I had to pay for a new ticket"
Winnipeg to Toronto. When i got to the airport and went to check in, the lady at the counter had already left. A person from another airline said she had left an hour before. Due to her not being there i couldn't get my boarding pass and couldn't get on the plane. I had to pay for a new ticket. I chose this airline because it was the cheapest. Had i known this i could've paid a bit more and fly with a more reputable airline.

### "did not even help her"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Edmonton. Disappointed with the airline. Staff were very rude to my daughter who is carrying a nine month old. The agent at the counter was very rude to her and did not even help her put her stroller or car seat up to help her while she carried her baby and then when she got on the plane she had to ask for assistance by other passengers. The flight attendants would not help her whatsoever.

### "still they separate us"
Edmonton to Toronto. Two weeks before our round trip between Toronto and Edmonton they email and advised the return flight was cancelled and moved us to a two days later flight which is in conflict with our work schedule without any reason. Hence I email and ask if there’s an option to change to an earlier flight or to have full refund for the round trip. It charge 15 dollar to call the call center so we email instead. Automatic email reply said normally response will be within 48 hours so we wait, but of course no reply so I sent follow up email every 12 hrs. After 72 hours they sent a revised itinerary with changes made and charged the flight different. This is done without replying my original email if I can opt to refund. Thought ok as it was done already. Then unexpectedly the reply to my original email came in after 1 week after the original email was sent saying that I can opt to cancel or change with additional charge. Yet this was too late for I had made rearrangement according to new date. But replying after they changed and charged seems ridiculous. When I checked in online 24 hrs before departure, found out that even though we purchased the ticket together yet they placed us in separate rows and both in middle seats. Yet at that time when I do the online check in, they have at least 90% seats not selected. This is a away to force you to pay extra if you want to be seated together. Which is outrageous. I have flied with Air Canada, Westjet and Swoop and all airlines now are the same, which is to paid extra to select seats if u want to be seated together. Yet with the other airlines, without paying extra they will still arrange passengers to be seated together as much as possible, like if the flight is not too full or if u check in online much earlier. Since I checked in online right after they open for online check in which is exactly 24 hours before departure still they separate us and both in middle seat. My vacation mood is totally destroyed.

### "absolutely ridiculous"
Edmonton to Toronto. My entire experience with Flair was absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that went well was the plane took off and landed, great job you actually had a pilot. My entire flight was changed by days and they let me know a week and a half before by email (Good thing I checked my personal email) and I had to somehow pull a miracle to be able to make it work because they refused to do anything for me. How is that acceptable? They didn’t even offer a reason. Then I have to pay for carry-on. I have to pay for checked bags. I have to pay for water. I have to pay for my seat which apparently isn’t included with the actual ticket you buy. I had to pay if I wanted a coffee. I finally make it here with my five-year-old son. Go to check-in at exactly 24 hours before my flight and they decided to split up my 5-year-old and my seats. I had to pay extra to have my son not to be sitting next to strangers. I call them livid, because I changed my seat to be next to him (all the same row, wasn’t trying to get awesome seats or anything) instead of changing his seat to be next to mine, they can’t do anything for me. Literally, nobody had checked in yet and you couldn’t put my 5-year-old and me together? Had to have a reason to charge me again? They refused to give me better seats even as compensation. They can do nothing, there’s no one else to talk to. I wasted so much time on the phone with these people and actually received nothing but more up charges. I will absolutely not fly with Flair Airlines ever again, my mom met us in Toronto and ended up paying the same amount in the end. Budget airline is a lie. You will pay the same if not more as any other airline, but you won’t be cared for, your flight will be moved without warning, (it’s the first thing that the contact Center recorded message says when you first call them, “if your flight has been changed” how bad is that? Is happens that often and you will be charged an arm and a leg for choosing them. Go WestJet and save yourself the hassle. This airline will take advantage of you under the guise of being the “good guy cheap airline.

### "I won't be taking Flair again"
Calgary to Vancouver. I wish I read reviews about this airline prior to booking with them. I originally booked with Flair because they were cheaper. In the end, it would've cost the same amount to fly on a better airline like West Jet. They charge you for every little thing they can. After purchasing a 'cheap ticket' you then have the option to pay for a checked bag, which most airlines do, so no biggy, but they also charge you for a carry on bag which is $35+. Most airlines let you bring a carry on and a personal bag onto the plane for free. Not the case with Flair. So I opted to do neither, I was just going to Vancouver for the weekend, staying with friends so I had no issue fitting everything in a personal bag to put under the seat. After skipping the bagging, they make you choose a seat and charge for every seat! You think buying a plane ticket will include your seat, not the case for Flair. The cheapest seat you can choose is $11. Tickets bought, I was ready for my trip. I got to the airport and they charge $15 to print off your ticket at the airport which is unbelievable. All other airlines have no issues doing this for you. So that's another extra charge. (I was sure to borrow my friends computer on the way back to check in early) Once on the plane, they charge you for drinks and snacks. You know the cups most airlines give you for free during a flight? That will cost you $3.50+. I couldn't believe they charge for that, you don't even get the full can of pop. I was glad I brought my own drink. I will say, the stewardess was really nice and funny and moved people around to make everyone more comfortable (i.e kids) On the way back, the flight was delayed for 45 minutes, which I heard is common for Flair. All in all, I won't be taking Flair again. They make you think you are getting a great deal, but watch out for all the hidden costs! !

### "No white wine, no prosecco"
Calgary to Toronto. Ridiculous. Late leaving due to maintenance (fine). Arriving in Ottawa when you are on a direct flight from Calgary to Toronto because they "ran out of fuel" completely unacceptable. No white wine, no prosecco.

### "I was denied boarding"
Edmonton to Vancouver. Can't review the flight itself as I was denied boarding. My government issued ID was expired however I had my birth certificate and SIN card. Because my birth certificate said "Michael " but my SIN card said "Mike", I was not allowed to board. The same ID I used to fly return to Ottawa (Westjet) in September without issue. The check in supervisor was absolutely rude and unprofessional in dealing with the situation. She called her supervisor at my request and said nothing to help. She did say that my ID's were nothing alike, when the only difference was that my first name being shortened to "Mike". This after having to navigate through my browser in order to check in rather than a link in the itinerary email. They don't take cash. Was told in line the cost of two bags would be about $80. Hidden fees and lies. I wasn't the only one in line having issues with checking in.

### "service was excellent"
Not Verified |  Kelowna to Edmonton. The Flair service was excellent, the flight attendants were very friendly and everything went smooth. I don’t mind the fact that they charge for extras this is expected with a low cost airline. Great value.

### "extremely positive experience"
If you read the fine print and prepare in advance, you will have a fine time! I was a bit hesitant to fly Flair after reading mixed reviews. However, after my extremely positive experience I feel it’s important to share. I flew round-trip from Calgary to Toronto, both flights were extremely smooth with no turbulence & kind staff. We left the gate on time, and even arrived/landed early! Both landings were safe and seamless. I didn’t have any issues with check-in or baggage fees and this is majorly in part of reading the fine print; it’s much cheaper to pay for your checked bagged in advance on their website, and to check-in online 24 hours prior to departure. Also, be sure to download your boarding pass to your phone or print it at home to save on airport costs. Please also note that carry-on baggage is not free - but you can bring 1 free personal item/purse/pack sack. My large suitcase was only $30 online, (and up to 50 pounds which is a great deal). I’d definitely fly with them again, I saved so much money. Flair was half the price of Air Canada and WestJet.

### "have to pay for a carry on"
Toronto to Edmonton. You have to pay for a carry on, flight delayed, extremely poor customer service. How can you justify charging for carry ons?

### "I will never use them again"
Not Verified |  When leaving for the flight on January 10th 2020 it was delayed twice. I was suppose to land in Kelowna at 130pm didn't arrive until 430pm. Then coming home my flight was canceled due to weather issues which I understand the weather was horrible, but they made us wait to get refunded and/ or rebook for the flight on Monday January 13th and they were completely booked! They never informed us, never gave accommodations. The fact I waited in line for 45 mins and no one even told us the only flight for the next day was booked with no care in the world was unreal to me. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. You couldn't pay me to fly with them again. They then told me the next flight they had was Thursday! Its Sunday. So I had to book another flight and pay double the price then to be told that I won't have my money reimbursed for up to 5 to 10 business days! Horrible horrible experience I will never use them again. When you travel you should be secure I never felt this at all flying with them.

### "always trying to charge you"
Calgary to Vancouver in July 2018. Not happy with the customer service. I feel that they are always trying to charge you for something extra. I purchased carry on baggage and flew from Calgary to Vancouver without any problems or mentions of my baggage. Then on my way back home, they said my luggage was too big for carry on. I argued with them until they let me take it on the flight. It's the same size as when I came to Vancouver. I only came down for a funeral. Not happy with the airline. Having to pay $15 if you dont download your boarding pass. This is how they make their extra money off people. Might as well just fly Air Canada or West Jet.

### "delays and poor organization"
Vancouver to Toronto. On the plus side, due to the number of delays and poor organization your value in terms of hours spent sitting in a seat per unit dollar spent is amazingly high. The planes appear to have a lack of maintenance. They do give free water on the plane, which is nice. Because almost everything else (including coffee) costs you. They should change their ✅ Trip Verified |  schedule to estimate the dates you will take off and land, as that is the closest they appear to be able to manage.

### "Excellent customer service"
Not Verified |  Excellent customer service, very welcoming, friendly, fun and knowledgeable flight crew made it a pleasant flight. I was in a row that was full yet there were a few rows that were empty and the flight crew said it was ok that I took an entire row to myself. Very welcoming and accommodating.

### "I was very pleasantly surprised"
Toronto to Vancouver. I had low expectations having never flown Flair (or any discount carrier) before, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Flight was on time, comfortable (standard or better) legroom, smooth ride, and friendly crew at gate and in plane. When I booked, the flight was about $800 less than mainstream carriers ($650 v $1476 on Air Canada or WestJet). I paid extra for a carry-on ($35) and a coffee on the plane ($3 w free refills), but did so gladly given the huge savings on the fare. Because I had prepaid for my carry-on bag, I got called to board earlier than most people. The flight was about 75-80% full, I had a window seat near the front that I selected for free during check in. Obviously Flair is missing the perks of (a) loyalty points, (b) lounges, (c) inflight entertainment/wifi and an app to check arrival time and gate, and (d) frequent flights in the event of schedule changes, but of those the only one that matters to me is (d). As such, I will use Flair only when I'm not cutting it close with my timing and need confidence I can get where I'm going on schedule or close to it. For any trips with a bit of flexibility, if Flair flies there, I'm flying with Flair.

### "I highly recommend them"
Toronto to Calgary via Winnipeg. We had an excellent flight with flair. We were travelling with our almost two year old. The seats were comfortable. The staff was great. Our flights were all on time and the break in Winnipeg for our daughter to run around was great. It is definitely a no frills airline and you have to pay for extras but with snacks packed and minimal baggage it was super affordable. I highly recommend them.

### "delay after delay"
Toronto to Winnipeg via Calgary. I was scheduled to travel with my two 10 year old kids from Toronto - Winnipeg - Calgary on January 5, 2020 at 6pm. We were informed of delay after delay with our plane with no explanation from the gate staff. We were shuffled around to multiple gates at the Toronto Pearson Airport until 3 am the next morning for a plane that was never to come. We were unable to get a hotel room because we were constantly told the delay was just a few hours. The airline staff rarely gave us updates, and when they did it was that they had no updates. There was no communication between their Head Office and the staff and all of the passengers were left in limbo. There was no compassion on behalf of the employees; they seemed more interested in socialising with one another than trying to find answers for 60 passengers. Food vouchers were provided to us late in the evening which did no good since my boys and I just needed sleep at that point. Flair Air is a tiny privately owned airline with no partner airlines and so they will not help passengers to find flights on other airlines. They have very few planes in their fleet, so if your plane goes out of commission you could be stranded not just for a few hours, but for a day or two (the passengers flying to Winnipeg were stranded for up to 2 days in Toronto). There was a huge lack of transparency, accountability, and compassion by the airline. My experience left me feeling like we were all just treated like cargo. Yes, it is a discount airline and I'm all for a good deal as a single mom, but we have a right to be treated with dignity .. there's a fine line, and Flair Air does the opposite. After a total of 16 hours at the airport, we finally got on a different airplane the next day. If you choose Flair Air and things go wrong, just be prepared for extreme delays, no communication, and no assistance. They will offer you a refund for the leg you haven't used, but because it is discounted you will still be forking out hundreds more dollars per person for a last minute flight on another airline (For me it would have costed an extra $1500 just to get back to Calgary from Toronto). I tried to communicate my grievance to their support line and was told they were not willing or obligated to do anything else to remedy the experience we had. I highly recommend going with a more established airline that has more planes and partner airlines and that can accommodate its passengers adequately, and won't leave you stranded like Flair Air does when things go wrong.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Winnipeg to Calgary. I definitely do not recommend this airline for passengers who has a busy schedule. Most of the flights are delayed. I have not left for my flight coming up in a few hours. It was originally scheduled for 8:30pm. It was then delayed for an hour. Then i recently received a notification that it was delayed for another 2.5 hours. When I check the airport website to confirm the time, i was given a different time of 2:00am. Now this causes confusion. Tomorrow is actually a Monday and also my first day back to work after the holidays. It irritates me that it would be delayed for this many hours. I tried to confirm the actual departure time by calling the airline but then was disappointed because the hotline is closed. At this time I am furious, how can you be an airline that delays flights and your passengers is not able to contact you for questions. That is just ridiculous. I then contacted the airport and the staff I talked to told me that they were not given a lot of information either and that many passengers are also asking the same questions. He had told everybody that the flight time they were given was 9:00pm. To this time, I am still unaware of the departure time and I am not comfortable on waiting at the airport for 4+ hours when I could be waiting at home instead. Side note, you are only allowed to bring a personal bag that has to fit under the sit and you will have to pay for the rest of your baggage. Also, inflight food and drinks are not provided.

### "Awesome and super friendly"
Not Verified | Calgary to Abbotsford. Awesome and super friendly, thanks so much! Really appreciate the local service in Western Canada. I am looking forward to flying with you in the future.

### "pay for everything"
Toronto to Calgary. Not impressed. Small seats. Required to pay for everything. $50 checked bag, $50 carry on bag. No attention paid to kids that were travelling with us. It could have been a much better experience.

### "Worst airline ever experienced"
Calgary to Vancouver. Worst airline I’ve ever experienced. Tiny seats. Have to pay for water. Horrible service. Under staffed. $50 for carry on. Had to wait 30 mins at baggage claim for bags to arrive. Never again. Only bought to save money but ended up costing more for baggage.

### "Amazing crew"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford to Toronto. Amazing crew from the bag drop to the attendants. Travelling with three young kids is hard but all the staff was great and loved how we could push our baby right to the gate before loading and once we arrived it was already waiting as well. We would definitely fly with Flair air again! Keith and Alexi were our favourite flight attendants. Thanks Flair!

### "Not sure if it was worth it"
Toronto to Vancouver. Not sure if it was worth it. Nearly 30 mins late without explanation, communication or cause. I thought we were spending a lot of time on the ground at YYZ. I realized this myself as I’m looking at the time and wondering why we are not on the ground yet. Flair won’t tell you they are running late. The seats are noticeably shallow, as in the don’t really support your thighs. And  mine was broken and wouldn’t recline. I don’t really mind if they ask you to buy any beverage or food, or even a carry on. Not looking forwarding to my return flight.

### "attendants very friendly and funny"
Edmonton to Toronto. I had some trouble with booking through a third party. It ended up working it out after getting a credit card number from the third party who booked my flight but If I wasn’t able to get this credit card number they would not have let me on my flight. I would advise anyone booking through a third party to arrive to the airport early. Other then this the flight was good it left on time and arrived on time. Flight attendants very friendly and funny. I would recommend flying with flair.

### " I would not recommend them"
Edmonton to Toronto booked for 24 December. Flair doesn't do refunds even if it is well within 24 hrs it has to be more than 7 days from booking. Are you kidding me? Never again will I book with them. I remember booking with other companies that would allow you a refund if you are within 24hrs apparently not flair. They are horrible and I would not recommend them.

### "really can't beat the price"
Toronto to Vancouver. Thrilled by my experience flying with Flair, I was expecting the worst after some reviews, though. Flight left on time, plane was spotless, flight attendants were lovely, and you really can't beat the price.

### "definitely fly with Flair again"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Calgary. I was expecting a negative experience after reading many poor reviews. My round trip experience, however, was great! I booked online and added the option for a checked bag, seat selection and priority boarding. I found it to be very reasonable with the cost of the seat. Approx $100 less per flight than other airlines. There were no surprise charges. Check in went smoothly, the crews were very pleasant and Captains were friendly, flights were on schedule and arrived on time. I think the only difference is the complimentary drink, and for saving $100 I can happily do without! I will definitely fly with Flair again in future.

### "not worth the few dollars saved"
Not Verified | Winnipeg to Calgary. Agree with other passengers - it's not worth the few dollars saved to fly with this airline. With one of the smallest fleets in Canada, there isn't any possibility to provide alternate aircraft in the event of a problem. The size of the airline also results in challenges with airport services ranging from check-in (don't expect to be able to find a Flairemployee anywhere if there is a problem), access to ground services (Flair has limited access to aircraft services like refuelling and deicing). When there is an issue (see below for an example), Flair provides nothing (not even a bottle of water). We wish to inform you that Flair's flight F8133 from Winnipeg to Calgary on DEC 15, 2019 will be delayed due to aircraft fueling at Toronto Airport. Your updated departure time is now 21:15. Scheduled time of arrival changed from 2019-12-15 21:40 to 2019-12-15 22:25

### "just doesn't seem worth it"
Easily the worst budget airline that I've flown. I understand that when you fly budget, you shouldn't expect any perks, but the very least you can hope for is that the airline takes off and lands on time. - Flight was supposed to take off from Vancouver at 3:30 pm (22nd November). Get a message that the flight is delayed by 3 hours. Ok I can deal with that. Get another message that the flight is delayed by 6 hours! After calling 20 times, they inform me that the flight is now delayed by 11 hours! (now taking off at 12:20 AM the next day!) End up reaching Toronto at 8:30 am on the 23rd Nov (11 hours behind schedule) I basically lost the entire night I had planned in Toronto. On top of that, they refuse to make up for it in any way. No snacks, no check in bag, no flight credit, no partial refund. Absolutely ridiculous. Look I get it, flights are delayed, it happens. But that's when you help out your passengers right? These guys definitely don't get repeat customers. Honestly, loosen the purse strings a bit and fly WestJet. Way better, more reliable and worth the extra 100 bucks! After reading the other horror stories about people losing their bags and stuff with Flair air, it just doesn't seem worth it.

### "know what you are getting for the cost"
Not Verified |  Winnipeg to Toronto. Low cost, no frills airlines. I knew what to expect when I booked the flight and took the time to read and understand the baggage allowance and fees. The staff are professional and friendly and the crew aboard extremely pleasant. Key to flying Flair is know what you are getting for the cost, do your research ahead of time and you will not be surprised. I fly this airline on business between Winnipeg and Toronto twice a month and it is perfect for my needs.

### "a whole lot of nonsense"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Calgary. I guess hidden fees are how they make the money. I was booking through a 3rd party and there was an update on there from Flair. It said: in order for us to serve you better we now offer "free carry on and a personal bag". That was a whole lot of nonsense! Paid 50 dollars! For carry on. I gladly would have checked my bag had this information been on the website. The staff were taping temporary signs to the counter while preparing for boarding, which advised about the carry on fee. Staff need proper training! I will not be flying with them again, and will be discouraging people from flying with them.

### "a terrible experience"
Abbotsford to Calgary. It is a terrible experience choosing FlairAir. I would not recommend this to anyone as: Our baggage missing for 3 days - Delayed flight for 4 hours without any notification - Our baggage broken on the way back. And the compensation that I got is only $25 travel credit which need to be claimed thorough booking via a broken link.

### "wont be flying with them again"
Toronto to Vancouver. I decided to give Flair airlines a try and what a mistake that was. Our flight was supposed to leave at 7:05am friday November 23rd. The day before, I received a message stating the flight was delayed until noon. I arrived at the airport at 9:30am only to be told it was again being delayed until 3:00pm. Around 2pm came and we were again told it was going to be delayed until 6pm, and we were brought to the basement of the terminal to wait for a bus. This bus took us to an old terminal at Toronto  with zero amenities. Luckily they had a bathroom because our flight was delayed AGAIN until 9pm. 14hours after our original departure time we finally left. There was very little communication by flair airlines to help calm the many frustrated travelers. I only had 2 days to spend in Vancouver and this horrible excuse for an airline destroyed my weekend. If you're thinking of booking a flight, do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to fly with a real airline that doesn't charge for every little thing. We ended up spending much more being stuck at the airport all day. There were many travellers that missed connecting flights, busses and even a funeral because this airline doesn't have any extra planes or agreements with other airlines to get stranded passengers where they need to go. I will say my return flight went without a hitch, but I wont be flying with them ever again.

### "charged me 50 dollars for carry on"
Toronto to Edmonton. Worst experience ever when I was booking the flight they told me carry on bag is free. But on 24 November 2019 they charged me 50 dollars and staff on the boarding counter they don’t know how to talk. Specially the manager no cooperation with the customer. From now I would never travel by Flair airlines.

### "Zero customer service"
Toronto to Vancouver. Our flight was to depart at 7:05 am, we are currently in our 3rd gate, this time in the basement! We were told it was delayed until noon, then 3:30, now 6:00 pm. We have a funeral to attend and will more than likely miss it. There are passengers here from yesterday morning that still have not had any information passed along. You would think after 12 hours they would at least send a representative here to talk to the passengers! Zero customer service with this airline. Save yourself alot of aggravation and book with WestJet or Air Canada! When another airline has a problem with an aircraft they rent another airlines plane OR bring in another plane! They actually have us in the basement now! !

### "hidden fees and charges"
Edmonton to Toronto. I am frequent flyer both domestically and internationally. This is my first time to fly with Flair Airlines just trying to see how it is due to its cheap flight ticket. I was disgusted when they let you pay checked luggage for $45 and a carry on bag for $50. I was shocked with the huge hidden fees and charges. I am not happy with this airline. I will never fly with Flair Airlines again.

### "shocked with the huge hidden fees and charges"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver. I am frequent flyer both domestically and internationally. This is my first time to fly with Flair Airlines just trying to see how it is due to its cheap flight ticket. I was totally disgusted when they let you pay checked luggage for $45 and a carry on bag for $50. I was shocked with the huge hidden fees and charges. I am not happy with this airline. I will never ever fly with Flair Airlines again. Never!

### "Flair lost my bag"
Toronto to Vancouver. Flair lost my bag. We got the bag after two weeks of waiting. Flair never returned any of my emails, not one. You are not able to talk to anyone in the baggage department. I received one phone call saying they found my bag and it would be delivered the next day via Fed Ex. I asked if they can guarantee that it would be there the next day as I am leaving the country and need the bag before I leave. They said it would be there 100 percent. The bag did not arrive the next day it arrived four days later as Flair did not give Fed Ex an address for my bag. I luckily had a name tag on my bag which Fed Ex was able to contact me with. Flair lost my bag twice! They also lied about the delivery date. I will never use them again and do not recommend them.

### "Last time I book with them!"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Abbotsford. I booked a flight with this airline and had some technical glitches with the booking. I ended up booking the wrong date (Booked a friday and wanted a sunday). I caught the error within 3hrs of the original booking and called to have the flight changed. I was charged $150 change fee (not including the difference in price of the new flight which I expected to pay. They refused to reimburse this change fee. When I emailed support I received a response that didnt even apply to my situation. This airline is not in the business to create loyal customers, they are looking for a quick and dirty pay day. Last time I book with them!

### "great leg space"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Toronto. First-time flyer with this airline. On-time performance, excellent service and great leg space. Very neat and clean. Highly recommended. Would love to fly again.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified | Winnipeg to Toronto. This has to be the worst airline I have ever taken. My flight was at 1:40 pm but got changed to 6:00 pm. Their maintenance delay caused me to miss my non-refundable greyhound bus and pay for an expensive Uber ride to my destination. They caused my trip to be an extra 300$, and I only work part-time at Subway!

### "does not fix their mistakes"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Beware! Flair airlines charged my credit card five times for one flight! Since October 18th no rectifying the situation! There is no number to call to sort out the issue! Email only! Finally talked to someone who assured me that ten days ago it would be sorted out! Still nothing! Had to call three times today and twice after a long hold, they disconnected the call! Zero customer service! The only airline that does not fix their mistakes!

### "Do not fly Flair"
Toronto to Calgary. So to start. They changed my flight from November 6 to 7. Which is terribly annoying, but it happened in advanced of my trip so I could work around it. Unfortunately I had important plans for the 7th (like a responsible human, planned a day after arrival). But my flight that was changed from the 6 to the 7, would get me there at 950am. So still doable. However, the crew for my flight was careless and tardy. Showed up over an hour late for our flight so we couldn’t even begin boarding and they announced this issue to the entire airport. Ultimately we were delayed 2.5 hours. I ended up missing my connecting bus, spending 7 hours waiting in an airport. I asked for my flight to be changed to the same return flight one day later. Which is available still for 250 CAD. I was able to rebook my appointments for the original return date that I missed due to Flair. They refuse to do anything for me. Disregarding any acknowledgement that they cost me 2 days of my 7 day trip. No compensation whatsoever. No gift card, no apology. Do not fly Flair

### "there is no customer service"
Not Verified |  I was booked from Vancouver to Edmonton and from Edmonton to Toronto. Mere hours before my departure of the first leg I learnt of the flight cancellation and was given little to no option to resolve the situation. I arrived at the airport hoping to get the matter resolved, but the issue was further exasperated when I was ill advised by the front line staff. The staff advised to see if I can get a flight with West Jet into Edmonton after which I would then be able to reconnect with Flair for the second leg of the flight. This I later learnt is not the case as Flair's policy does not permit this. The staff then cancelled my ticket (Vancouver to Toronto leg i.e the entire ticket) and indicated in the system the client wanted a full refund, which again was not the case. I was stuck in Edmonton and was not able to connect on the second leg of her flight, leaving me stranded. With my ticket cancelled on the 08th November, the only option available was to re-book with Flair for a flight leaving on the 10th November 2019. That option did not work as I needed to get back to BC on the 11th November 2019. This service is poor, and to top it off, I lost my money for my hotel accommodation as well. This is the worst airline and there is no customer service.

### "impossible to get hold of their support"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Toronto. Used Flair for the first time on a short weekend flight over to Toronto. On the way back we checked prior to leaving for the airport for any delays and there were none, but when we arrived we were told there was a 2 hour delay and the plane still needed to go to Halifax and back first, which still wasn't mentioned online. Since we didn't have time to leave the airport again we checked in and went through security. We got a small amount of food vouchers. Knowing that the flight would still need to go to Halifax, we kept an eye on the Halifax flight. After 2 hours the flight to Halifax had still not even departed and they never updated the fliers that the flight was becoming more delayed. After our flight was supposed to take off the second time they finally adjusted the time to reflect the initial delay, but not subsequent ones. For an under 4 hour flight on a Sunday evening where we all had to work the next day, the total delay was from 8:00PM take off time to 5:30 in the morning take off time. I was late for work on a Monday from a flight I was expected to be home from by 10pm on a Sunday. This was in the summer and there was no inclement weather. Once I was home, it was impossible to get hold of their support, the line on the website did not work, and it took literal months for anyone to get back to me. When they did respond, there was no explanation, no remorse, and no concern over the affect on the passengers. At the end of the day, I hope nobody decides to fly Flair, or they are prepared for ridiculously lengthy delays no matter the distance they are flying. I'll cough up the few extra dollars to not miss work next time.

### "beyond my expectations"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver. Incredible ticket priceand reached destination on time. Great flight, great leg room, great staff. Unbeatable. I have to say I was not expecting much as i bought the tickets super cheap, but it was beyond my expectations.

### "By far the worst service"
By far the worst service I have ever had, on two separate occasions. Flight from Winnipeg to Calgary on October 6th was 2-3 hours delayed, getting us into Calgary at nearly midnight on a Sunday. There was no apology or consideration for the passengers and the fact that people have to work the following day. I was scheduled to fly with this airline from Calgary to Toronto on November 7th but became very ill the week before, was hospitalized and prohibited from travelling. I called to speak with a representative who blatantly ignored my situation and was very prompt to inform me of the $125 rebook fee. I accepted that I would have to pay this, as I did not purchase travel insurance. However, she then told me I would have to pay more for the new ticket (booked in January) because the outbound flight was more expensive, despite the fact that the inbound flight was cheaper and the overall cost was exactly the same. In her words, I would have to pay for a more expensive outbound flight but would not be given credit for the "much cheaper" inbound flight because I was rescheduling. In my opinion, stay away from this airline. Their corporation lacks compassion, empathy, any flexibility and human quality.

### "You won't get quality service"
Vancouver to Calgary. None of the attendants (at the front desk, or at boarding, and even while on the aircraft) seemed attentive to customer satisfaction and were not interested in gaining feedback. The attendants at the front desk seemed to be distracted, even when they appeared idle; I was told, "this is a budget airline" when I learned my flight would be delayed by four hours. Nonetheless, I was offered a full refund, which I do appreciate. I would not recommend this service to anyone, especially if you are able to purchase a flight with WestJet or Air Canada for a decent price just two weeks before departure. You won't get quality service or timely departures here! Please, just save yourself the trouble and book your flight with another airline.

### "experiences were top notch"
Calgary to Abbotsford. I have flown Flair about 10 times now, and all of my experiences were top notch. OK, there was a delay on one of the flights. On my last trip the plane hit a sudden downdraft as it descended causing some passengers to scream. This sort of turbulence stayed on the approach and at times it was like riding the roller coaster. The pilot aborted the first attempt and swung around for a second try, culminating in a perfect landing. I had the pleasure of seeing the same crew on my return to Vancouver, and the crew here was as good as they get.

### "Great experience with Flair"
Toronto to Calgary. Great experience with Flair. Great customer service. Stewardess Mary was a hoot. She made the flight pleasurable.We traveled round trip Toronto / Calgary. Bit of confusion checking in but was resolved at the airport. Was hesitant at first to travel Flair with all the negative reviews but everyone went smoothly. I would use them again.

### "A bad experience"
A bad experience, never ever again with Flair Airlines! It says that it is a non-stop trip but my flight from Calgary to Toronto airport stopped at Winnipeg airport! No beverage, they charged me for carry on baggage, plus they charged my visa a small amount after the price of the ticket that they never mentioned.

### "welcoming, knowledgeable, and pleasant"
Not Verified |  Kelowna to Edmonton. I’ve flown with Flair Airlines a few times now and have never experienced any delays or disruptions. All of the staff members I’ve encountered (from ticket agents to flight attendants) have been welcoming, knowledgeable, and pleasant. Snacks and beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) can be purchased on board for a reasonable fee. Wait time for checked bags is the same as any other airline. Prices are absolutely unbeatable! This airline makes it so much easier and more affordable for me to go visit my family and I will continue to book with them again and again.

### "is as budget as it gets"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Calgary with Flair Airlines. Horrible service tricks you into thinking it's a cheap flight deal but you get dinged with expenses, luggage and carry on etc.. And if you don't check in you get dinged too. Aswell with the boarding pass. Both flights were delayed, here and home airplane were dirty and not been cleaned. I would rather spend my money on a more reliable and quality airline. This one is as budget as it gets. And the worst part is, I could have bought a better serviced flight with what I have forked out on this trip with all "add ons. Carry on charge, checked luggage, inflight charge, boarding pass charge and check in charge and it's still not on time going to Calgary or back home. The cancelation is more than the flight was originally worth.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  The worst airline in the world! I have traveled many many times but this airline is horrible. We were traveling from Abbotsford to Calgary with 2 kids and got to the baggage check in within the hour, their counter was already closed and there were 15 other people waiting in the line up. When we called their customer service they said the only way to catch this plane is to leave your luggage behind. Horrible experience, this was my first and last time using Flair Airlines.

### "awful customer support"
Abbotsford to Winnipeg via Calgary with Flair Airlines. Awful. Nickles and dimes customers for higher rates than competitors and refuses any accomodation or leeway when it comes to flight cancellations. They follow the law to the bare minimum and have awful customer support. Avoid, avoid, avoid.

### "I had to pay again"
Recently, I have taking a flight from Toronto to Calgary on October 2, at 7:25 am Toronto time. However, dispute having a boarding pass,seat 15 E, I was denied boarding. The reason was my PR card name does not much my ticket name and my interim driver licence had an error in my name. To answer that I have produced my legal name change certificate, my SIN, my Alberta health card, my other IDs such as a photo student ID. And I pointed out that an error was made in my driver licence by Service Canada and I was not aware of it. However the docs I showed were enough to prove my identity. Regardless my boarding was denied and Melissa, person at check point, demanded 415.95 CAD for a new ticket! However, she did accept the payment for my baggage from my first ticket. So, why my baggage was ok to fly and I am a human was not and I had to pay again? I had not choice and I did pay again. I had contacted the web of the Flair Airlines and they briefly reversed the transaction and on October 4, 2019 they posted it again.

### "This airline is a complete scam"
Vancouver to Toronto. This airline is a complete scam! It appears cheaper compared to other airlines but once you add the outrageous check in fees, baggage fees, overweight baggage fees and carry on baggage fees and even water, you might as well have paid the extra dollars for an airline that treats you like a human being. I have never had to complain about an airline before and I will never fly Flair Airlines again.

### "Horrible just horrible"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Vancouver. Horrible just horrible. I am not from Edmonton. Came to Edmonton on bus. Flight to Vancouver was cancelled. They did nothing for me. Had no where to stay in Edmonton. I highly discourage anyone from using this airline. Fly with someone who respects you, your time, and schedule. Do no fly with this airline.

### "Very affordable round trip"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver. I'm very pleased. Very affordable round trip with an infant. Attendants were very helpful and accommodating. Purchased coffee/tea (with free refills) for $3 CAD which was very reasonable for service up in the air. Both flights were on time. Landings did not disturb our child and we felt safe and welcomed. Will fly with Flair Airlines again in March 2020.

### "You’re not saving money"
Toronto to Vancouver. Flight delayed by 3 hours initially, then delayed further by 1 hour to get a tire replaced on the airplane. The seats do not recline, and you need to know that with carry-ons, my flight ended up costing more than the price ticket of other respectable airlines like WestJet. I highly discourage anyone from flying with this horrible airline. You’re not saving money, and even if you did, you’ll be better off flying with another airline that respect their customers and their schedule.

### "they double charged me"
Abbotsford to Winnipeg via Calgary. I was giving Flair a chance. Never again. I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. My experience from the get-go. I paid $327 for a flight (which could have been the same with any other airline with the time I booked it at) and they double charged me. The day before my flight leaves at 6 am (and I work until 3 am so I’d have gone straight to the airport after work) it got pushed to 8:30 am. I was there within the allowable time frame to drop off my bags and get on my flight safely. They wouldn’t let me on and said I was “too close to the cutoff time” okay. Then I phoned Flair to try and get a resolution to this because it simply was not my fault. Did they maybe double book me and used that as an excuse? Anyways, most airlines would reimburse the customer or put them on the next flight out. Not Flair. Flair requires you to pay a whole new fee. I guess I won’t be going to a family funeral now because of Flair's audacity not to put a customer's needs first. 0/10 and I’ll never be associating myself with Flair ever again.

### "value for money was excellent"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Only fly if its the cheapest option. I flew and will fly again due to its cheap fares via its sales. The value for money was excellent. Absurd food/drink policies, it states "no outside food or drinks", and the onboard snacks are overpriced (way more expensive than Swoop). The menus were also missing from the aircraft. According to their policies, they will only allow 1 boarding pass per cell phone which is absurd. Nice that you can select seats for free during check-in, which almost all ULCC's won't let. The largest complaint I have: According to Flair Air's website, the personal item must fit under the seat in front of you. Ground crew at YXX let my specially designed "under-seat suitcase" on board. The gate agent at YEG stopped us because "it had wheels and a handle bar which means carry on"..

### "An absolute scam of an airline"
Probably the worst flying experience I have ever had. The first part of my journey was from Toronto to Edmonton. Scheduled departure was for 21.30, which got changed to 19.30 a week prior to flying. On the day of the flight I had to leave early from work to get to the airport on time. Once I got there, they rescheduled to 21.30 at the last minute and made me wait for 2 hours at the airport. On reaching Edmonton, the ground staff took forever to get the checked in luggage on the conveyor belt. But the worst was far from over. The second part of the journey was from Edmonton to Toronto. My flight back was on the Sunday morning at 8 am which a week prior to flying got changed to 7 am. Saturday evening I get an email from them about 'Flight Rescheduled' - an email you can expect every 2 hours if you book Flair. However when I open the email, I find out that the flight has been cancelled due to a 'bird hit'. Eventually when I dug deeper through some reviews on this website, it just so happens that every second Flair Air flight is hit by birds. It would be safer to travel with Tom Hanks in his movies then with Flair Air. I call customer care to book me on a different flight home, but they had shut shop for the day. I had to book a different flight for the 4 of us for an additional cost of $2200 and I still haven't seen a refund. An absolute scam of an airline.

### "this airline is a ripoff"
Toronto to Edmonton. After being 20 years in Canada I felt so bad that I had to write this review. I have flown many times in the past and never occurred this could happen to a customer. Recently, I had a return ticket booked and due to some unforeseen circumstances I needed to make a change to my reservation, 2 days later than the reservation. I had bought a $19.99 CAD Extended Cancellation Policy (ECP) thinking in case such a situation I would be able to change the date without a heavy penalty. However, that ECP was not for the change of date I was told and to clarify the matter I wanted to talk to the supervisor but I was denied access. I even suggested I will leave my number and they can call me back but the customer service clerk flatly refused my demand. I had to fly back with my return ticket and the flight was 3 hours delayed! I have lost an important meeting and this airline is a ripoff.

### "best flight I have been on"
Myself and husband were on flight 138 on September 29th 2019 coming back from our honeymoon in Vancouver. The flight crew were incredible, with a special mention to Peter and Taylor who were flight attendants. When they found out it was our honeymoon, they were incredibly kind very thoughtful there were a few seats ahead of us with more leg room they asked us if we would like to move up there. It has been without a doubt the best flight I have been on in my entire life and I will never forget

### "absolutely horrific experience"
This was the worst airline I have ever flown with. The flight attendants were cold and barely showed any signs of respect. I know I didn't pay for premium or first class, but that doesn't mean that they needed to disregard us completely. On the way back from Calgary to Toronto, there was an incident where an ignorant man leaned his seat all the way back to the point where it was sitting in my lap. When I kindly asked if he would put it up just a little so that I could have a little leg room, he began a big commotion about how he paid for the flight and he is allowed to recline his chair however far back he pleases. He then proceeded to call over a flight attendant. The male flight attendant validates that there was nothing wrong with the situation even though he was clearly reclined right into my lap. The rude passenger then begins to yell about how this is reversed racism and that we only told him to raise his chair because we were being racist, to which the flight attendant still said nothing about. After having me as well as my mom plead to have his chair put up slightly, he then proceeded to do it angrily. Instead of the flight attendant saying anything about how ignorant the other passenger was being, he then returns and offers the passenger a better seat at the front of the plane. I found this extremely odd. Sure the ignorant passenger had moved and wasn't in my space no longer, but it felt odd that the flight attendant was validating this rude passenger. However this wasn't the only incident. The flight attendants also were terrible at responding to me and my family, they were extremely rude when they would walk by and ask us to take off our headphones, but we noticed that they would more kindly ask the passengers in front of us to take off theirs during takeoff and landing. The whole experience on the flight just came off as very weird and borderline racist and I would advice everyone to never fly with this airline. It was an absolutely horrific experience.

### "definitely a price scam"
Toronto to Edmonton. This is the first time I flew with Flair. Never again. It’s definitely a price scam. But the worst is that they have one of the poorest customer service on the phone as well as on the ground. First the flight was delayed by 3 hours from Toronto and there wasn’t anyone on the counter before time to update passengers. The agent on the counter was giving hard time to an elderly couple since they had not checked in online so now they have to pay $15 each for the agents to check them in. The couple were not computer literate and spent half an hour in front of the counter. At last I helped the couple and still they were not able to check in online.

### "will not help its customers"
Abbotsford to Calgary. If you are frequent traveler knows that quite often there are delays, whether is traffic, returning the car rental, connecting flight was delayed, etc. Well, I missed check-in time by 10 minutes, the plane was sitting there and still had 40 minutes to get through security in a very small airport, they wouldn't help me at all and was informed I had just lost my flight and the money I paid. My meeting got rescheduled and when I call customer services to reschedule my return flight (I explained everything), I was told they wouldn't reschedule it, refund or give you a credit towards another flight. This is the first airline in my experience flying all over the world that will not help its customers arrive to their destination. Flair airlines, for a business person whose schedule can change on a dime this is not the airline for you, today my business will pay for my mistake...booking with a cheap airline, and it is not the dollar amount that bothers me, is the fact that they are not willing to help its customers at all. Will never do business with them again and I do not recommend it to anybody else.

### "card had been charged 5 times"
Vancouver to Edmonton. Absolutely hands down the worst airline. After having my flight cancelled after arriving at the airport I had to wait 4 hrs in line to find out my flight had been held over for 2 days, offering no compensation for rooms or food voucher. After this I noticed my credit card had been charged 5 times for a single one way flight! Customer service is a complete fallacy as they will never respond to an email or phone call. Just ridiculous, i am now out $1000 for a one way 250 ticket and seemingly have no options to deal with it. Dont fly with Flair, they don't care about their customers.

### "charging you more with other fees"
Toronto to Calgary. Do not let the slightly cheaper listed tickets of this airline scam you, they will end up charging you more with other fees. It is not a no-frill airline, it is a pricing scam. First, all carry-ons, no matter how tiny, cost money (at least $50 extra one way). Second, printing boarding pass at the airport costs $20 per person per trip, we wanted to go online at that moment to print the boarding pass ourselves to save some money. Check in attendant at Toronto told us that could only be done 24hrs+ before flight (she lied, we later found out, thanks to one kind attendant at Calgary airport later). Third, quite few of the check-in attendants are really rude and with bad attitude, especially the supervisor lady at Calgary airport. We know we didnt pay for premium service, but we don't deserve to be down talked either. She sarcastically laughed at our faces and told us to move off, when one of our friends couldn't board the plane because her wallet was stolen. Flair wanted to charge us $400 to reschedule in that situation. I hope no others would get the treatment we received.

### "recent flight was delayed 13 hours"
Calgary to Abbotsford. This budget airline will end up costing you more. I've flown with them a couple times because they advertise such low rates. By the time you add everything you have to pay for it's not much of a savings. Add to that, my most recent flight was delayed 13 hours and they refuse to pay any reimbursement for my hotel, I received no food vouchers, nothing. I tried to report them to the BBB but they already have an F rating ... they don't care. So that flight ended up costing considerably more than if I'd booked with a reputable company. Never again.

### "bag never arrived to the destination"
Calgary to Vancouver. Luggage issues. This company charges for luggage but they dont care about it, we checked in one bag for a short trip the bag never arrived to the destination. Tried their luggage counter, useless, they blame the checking counter at the departure city, and had us wait for the next fly to arrive, maybe the bag was coming on a different fly, go figure, it was not. They said could not do anything we had to email to lost luggage. 5 days later, many emails sent, zero replies. Phone calls absolutely useless, their contact number is for a travel agency, nothing to do with Flair, so they said. They lost the luggage and don't take responsibility at all. Bad idea to fly with Flair air, if you think you would save money. It could cost you more as you would never completely replace your belongings. The worse is that they don't care.

### "everything went smoothly"
Not Verified |  I booked with Flair before I looked at the reviews. I wanted to cancel but took a leap of faith. Only book if you're willing to take that risk - for context my partner and I have no kids, were going for vacation and had jobs that were flexible in the case trips got cancelled. Our flights were both on time in Toronto and Vancouver (Vancouver was one hour delayed). We paid for carry on. A surcharge of 60 dollars total. We printed out our own boarding passes saving 20 bucks each. We brought our own food and water onto the plane because they offer nothing, and no blankets either but who cares. The leg to Vancouver actually arrived 20 mins early. The flight attendants were all pleasant. The plane was small. All in all, we landed safely and soundly. For a budget airline everything went smoothly and I guess that's what matters. Would I book again? No. Was the anxiety and panic worth it? No. The price ended up being the same as any other competitor after the charges. Take this review as you will.

### "been charged twice"
Not Verified | Vancouver to Toronto. I tried to book for a flight through the website but there was an error with the payment. It asked me to refill the details but there was an error again. I checked my bank account and I have been charged twice. I sent and email immediately on the 9th of August 2019, sent 2 follow up emails and called 3 times. Each time, I have had long waits on hold, an operator who can barely understand my English, who doesn't know how to help me, except "try sending an email" and tries to charge me again! I just want my ticket and nobody can help!

### "had the worst experience"
I had the worst experience with Flair Airlines flying from Toronto to Edmonton. They charge the lower fare but they will let you pay for every single piece of baggage you bring at a very high cost! After paying for all the baggage, they will also charge you some other things. The services is so bad! I do not recommend this plane to anyone. You may pay lower for the fare, but they will also charge you on every single item you bring in the plane.

### "could not get on the plane"
Toronto to Calgary. I had my worst experience with this airline. My wife and kids could not get on the plane as a result of issues with their boarding pass. Myself, my wife and kids ended up been stranded in Calgary and their customer service people were very rude and could not offer any help. The funny thing is that we were tagged as "no show" even though were present at the airport and checked in our luggage. Our luggage ended up in Toronto while we were in Calgary. I will never take this flight again until something is done about this.

### "Not a good experience"
Not Verified |  Not a good experience. I travel a lot and their little policy differences like when you can turn on devices or wear headphones are irritating. The stewardesses really enforce these things which causes arguments because customers are used to less restrictive policies at other airlines. Seats, even the plus seat I paid extra for are small and don't recline. Flight was an hour late of its arrival time and they didnt explain what the problem was even though it boarded pretty much on time. Finally it wasn't even cheaper so there is no point in flair existing

### "worst experience I have ever had flying"
Halifax to Toronto. The worst experience I have ever had flying. Flair Airlines has no back up plans, terrible customer service, and laughable communication skills. Do not fly with this airline. Completely cancelled my flight with very little information given as to how to rectify the matter. Took weeks to finally get a response. Missed a friends wedding due to their lack of care and service. Wasn’t offered any type of compensation for the flight missed back home after they cancelled my flight to the destination. Prices aren’t worth the off chance your flight is completely cancelled. The one lady I actually talked to at the airport was more concerned with delivering ice to who knows what or who then with actually helping me at the counter. Swoop attendants were more helpful then her and I wasn’t even flying with them.

### "cost them a repeat customer"
Calgary to Abbotsford. This was the first, the only and last time flying this airline. Flight was delayed countless times, It was a short haul flight Calgary to Abbotsford. No initial check in email. On website they had multiple departure times (after delay), phoning the company on it's limit time is stupid. Should be 24x7, does not do much good when the "office" opens only after your flight "may have left". After at least 4 delays so that the same flight number had at one time 2 different actual flights with the same flight number, on the phone even the person could not figure out which actual flight to get on. The "answer" was "I guess try showing up for this one". Then the flight leaves middle of the night, they give you a $10 voucher only good at the airport shops that day. Yah but the plane left before the shops open. So, cost them nothing. Well it cost them a repeat customer. Folks, if you use this airline, certainly be flexible to leave and arrive whenever. The savings will most certainly be spent on additional hotel, food etc. Fly either Westjet or Air Canada, same price in the end.

### "canceled our flight  last minute"
Toronto to Edmonton. Very disappointing, they canceled our flight  last minute, we are already in the airport to check in, and the lady in the counter told us that our flight was cancelled with out any notice. Very disappointing, horrible airline, unprofessional. We end up buying a ticket on that day at the airport and cost us fortune, no choice cause we have a wedding to attend, the next day. Lesson learned, go on a legit site to book your flights in the future. What a nightmare.

### "What a waste of my time and money"
Not Verified |  Aug 8 2019, Flight F8134 flying from Calgary to Winnipeg. Schedule departure was suppose to be at 9.45 am. Got to airport only to find out it was delayed by 4 hours. As time went by it was delayed yet again to 6.30 hours. Then again another email saying 8.30 hours and then again 9 hours. All of this due to Unscheduled Maintenance. (made me wonder if I even wanted to get on the plane after all). Ended up having to purchase another airline ticket with WestJet to get to my destination. Will never book tickets with Flair ever again or should I say 'ended up not flying with them anyways at all'. What a waste of my time and money. They never answer their phone or emails.

### "by far the worst customer experience"
I was flying from Vancouver to Toronto with a connection at Calgary. The flight from Calgary to Toronto got delayed by 10hrs. The actual flight got canceled due to technical issues and they arranged a separate aircraft with a different flight number at 12.45 am the next morning. As a result, they are offered "10$" voucher for each passenger - hilarious ain't it? Alternatively, they were offering a refund of the flight but you had to find a flight with another airline yourself - needless to say - with their refund value no other flight could be booked. With 6 other fellow passengers, when I raised the concern to the Flair supervisor on site (Calgary airport), who by the way was very uncooperative and rude and said there is nothing to be done and was even unwilling to call Flair office. Flair customer center was not picking up any call during this time - all of us tried calling. This is by far the worst customer experience I got from an airliner. Never flying with Flair again.

### "worst possible experience"
I had the worst experience in my flight history and that of my friends where we had checked in, finished with security checks and were waiting to board the flight. We traveled as a group of four and one of us was not allowed to board the plane. The initial reason given was that she was told she had to pay for her baggage for which a personal item is allowed free of charge of the size that fits under the seat. Since her bag could fit under the seat, there should not have been a problem. She mentioned it to the gate agent that she had made inquiries before leaving Winnipeg and was informed that she did not have to pay for her personal baggage. When she challenged the decision to pay on this premise, she was asked to stand aside. After waiting a while in the plane and not seeing her, we decided to pay since that was the agent's reason for not allowing her to board. When we were about to pay, the agent refused to charge the card of the leader of our group who was giving the details of his card from aboard the stationary plane. The leader of our group then decided to get off the plane and go with his card but was stopped from getting off the plane. I noticed that this female gate agent who prevented my friend from getting aboard her flight with no tangible reason got annoyed when some of the passengers she had asked to wait behind got past her to board the plane when she was busy attending to other passengers. In the failed attempt to identify the passengers who evaded her, I believe she decided to pour out her anger and frustration on a passenger who had obeyed her instruction to wait behind. The pilot waited a while and communications were sent from the plane of our concerns for our friend to which we got a negative response because the gate agent had decided to take matters into her own hands. Are the employees of Flair Airlines allowed to treat their customers in such a rude and unprofessional way? In the end, the flight took off without my friend and she was left stranded in Abbotsford. In order to get to Winnipeg today to go to school the next day, she had to book another flight, which is really unfair. This is the worst possible experience for a passenger who is not a first-time traveler by flight and her group who obeyed all the rules of aviation. Has the discrimination of dark-skinned people crossed over the border into Canada?

### "highway robbery"
Very disappointed it’s a highway robbery business. Booked a flight from Abbotsford to Winnipeg via Calgary. Early morning flight got delayed three times then cancelled flight due to unscheduled maintenance. Tried to email them multiple times and called their hotline no reply from email that same day no idea what was their plan for their unhappy customers. No answer from their hotline they just left their customers hanging robbed their money and until now a week after no communication from them. From their unprofessional business, I spent a paycheck just to take another flight to Winnipeg. Don’t fly Flair Air. The government should check these airlines that take advantage and steal hard-earned money of customers.

### "my flight is delayed for 9 hours"
Toronto to Calgary. I wish I had read the reviews before I booked with this company. They already have bad scores and I also want to add another bad review. My flight to Calgary was delayed for 3 hours while another one for Vancouver was cancelled in the peak of season. Now on my way back, just 7 days later, my flight is delayed for 9 hours!

### "staff knows nothing more than the passengers"
Calgary to Vancouver. It took them 3.5 hour to fix a mechanical problem with the aircraft and the flight was delayed due to this problem. No staff were helpful and friendly and when passengers voiced out their concerns about the delay, Flair staff at the boarding gate provided no service and a completely rude attitude to their passengers regarding the delay. Their staff knows nothing more than the passengers regarding the schedule of their company’s flight and all their response was “we know what you know” when passengers were going up asking about the delay. Poor service, extremely poor attitude staff, huge delay with flights. No more Flair.

### " my flight is cancelled"
Calgary to Abbotsford. I have flown with Flair numerous times. The flights are affordable when you book weeks in advance. I was upset this past flight. I received numerous email about my flight. First is was delayed and then it got cancelled and pushed to the next day. The next day I get to the airport and check in. We are delayed by 90 minutes. I'm okay with that, but then I get an email (while at the airport) and have learned that my flight is cancelled. Now I want a refund. Agree with other posts - it is hard to get through to customer service. The phone just rings and rings. I finally spoke to someone and she said she could not offer a refund, then I needed to email customer service. Still waiting for a response. My recommendation is - if you have a meeting or event that is important. Please choose another airline. Don't expect a refund of any kind.

### "likely never fly Flair again"
First, our flight from Toronto to Calgary was moved a full day. Then our return flight from Calgary to Toronto was delayed 5.5 hours and the reasoning gave us to us was there was a flight from Calgary to Vancouver that had to take place first (as it was the same aircraft), but the Vancouver airport was too busy to have that flight land (is that a real reason? This kind of story was happening for several days with several different flights. Will likely never fly Flair again.

### "that gets delayed as well"
Calgary to Vancouver. August 10th 2019 Flair Air flight F8525 has been delayed for 120 mins, then I get another email where it’s says it’s delayed till tomorrow 15:30 and I have work that I have to attend. Then I get another flair air flight which is supposed to fly to Vancouver at 10:30, but that gets delayed as well. So I paid another $400 to get another airline (Westjet) and now finally I’m home never going to fly with Flair again. I’ll pay $200 more but get a better airline.

### "my last time with this company"
Vancouver to Calgary. After waiting for more than 3 hours without knowing for how long more the flight will be delayed, the staff Chris  just see he don't have time to talk to me. For sure it's my last time with this company!

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  When we arrived for our departure flight from Toronto to Calgary they were over an hour late checking everyone in, making an easy process extremely stressful. Bathrooms on the flight were disgusting and the sink was broken. Our flight home to Toronto from Calgary was delayed from 3:20pm to 1:45am with no email notification. When we tried to call customer service there was no answer, so we had to drive to the airport to get answers. We called the customer service number numerous times, hanging on the line for more than an hour without ever getting a hold of a customer service agent. The phone number was not a 1-800 number, meaning we were charged long distance rates for being on hold. 5Our rescheduled flight was over an hour late. This airline made a standard trip from province to province extremely stressful. I will not recommend this airline to anyone and I will not fly this airline ever again. I recommend paying the extra money and flying with a reputable airline to save yourself a lot of problems down the road. You honestly get what you pay for!

### "not fly on Flair Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford BC to Winnipeg. Very disappointed and will not fly on Flair Airlines again. Flights get moved or cancelled a lot. Flight itinerary at 6am, they send email at 1am, of course I don’t check my email at midnight because I’m sleeping. Read some reviews and they’re true about Flair. Very bad airline, should think of selling it or merging it with a better airline so they can do their job properly.

### "never fly Flair Airlines again"
We received an email the night before we were to fly out that there would be a two and a half hour delay due to pilot fatigue and required a mandatory rest. Arrived at airport the following day and found out the flight would be a delayed another one and a half hours for an unscheduled maintenance repair. After four hours waiting and no updates passenger were becoming angry. Finally a pilot came out and told passengers the aircraft we were to fly out on was over fueled and to heavy to fly and we would be taking a second aircraft. Another 45 minute delay and we finally left Toronto. Arriving back in Calgary Six (6) hours late. We will never fly Flair Airlines again. And I would NOT recommend anyone else too. The extra money you would pay for the other airlines is worth it

### "has been delayed twice"
F8462 on August 10th, 2019 from Edmonton to Toronto has been delayed twice, total 5.5 hours and now still waiting to get on board for schedule departure at 20.50.

### "They cancelled our flight"
Toronto to Calgary. Avoid this airline at all costs. They cancelled our flight and didn’t let us know. It took us over an hour on the phone just for them to pick the phone up. We lost lots of money rescheduling our trip, it was a nightmare. When we wrote a letter of complaint they lied again and again. They offered us nothing. Do not fly with this company they are an absolute nightmare.

### "They lost our luggage"
Not Verified |  Abbotsford  to Toronto via Edmonton. They only had one customer service rep so it took us over an hour to check in. Which I need to add none of us could check in via online, so made the line up go even slower. They lost our luggage. I couldn't find a rep to get any answers and we searched all over the Toronto airport. After over an hour of not finding anyone I got on the phone to try and reach someone only to be not able to reach one for almost 3 hours, so gave up and went to bed. Then woke up and then tried calling again....finally after an hour got thru to someone who took my info and then said I should hear from someone within 72 hours. Seriously my trip will almost be over. I will add that the flight attendants were amazing so that helped with our travels.

### "I have zero complaints"
Toronto to Edmonton. I have zero complaints about this airline. And will use again. It’s a discount airline, so you are paying a lot less money for a reason. There was no on flight entertainment but bring a book and problem solved. They offered food and beverages that you pay for but I paid for the same things on Air Canada and paid less for them on Flair. You pay for your luggage ahead and it’s cheaper then the luggage I had to pay for on air canada. You print your boarding pass at home like it says and you don’t have to pay the $10 at the airport. Flight was great had no issues. Smooth. Now on the way back our flight was delayed due to aircraft issues. Read the details when you book. You can pay extra for coverage to change flights, etc. These cover you for flight changes out of their control such as weather, etc. If it’s in their control it is their responsibility. Now if you talk to them like real people with respect they will do the same. The flight back was delayed and we wouldn’t be arriving back home till the following day. There was no space on the earlier flight so they refunded me the flight and I booked with air Canada. I had to pay a bit more, but that’s expected. They were kind about it, answered me and refunded as the aircraft issues is their fault.

### "service could not be any worse"
Calgary to Abbotsford. The service could not be any worse. My flight was delayed 7 hours then cancelled. No other flights were available to get me to my destination in time. It was impossible to speak with an agent on the phone line. I would either get disconnected immediately, or put on hold until the call centre closes. I takes up to 4 days for them to respond to their support email messages and the responses are unintelligent form responses. No compensation for my delay or cancellation was offered. I still cannot get a refund for the ticket they cancelled. I will never fly Flair Airlines again and recommend people avoid it at all costs.

### "family event all messed up"
A well planned weekend and major family event all messed up. Flight changes departure time at will. We arrive early for a 9:10 am departure and are told it has be delayed until 3:15. (original departure time) and now a second delay. Who knows when the plane will be available. The 4:30 am email confirmed that our flight would be departing at 9:10 am! On the other end, they have added 12 hours to our flight departure time and again I wonder when the plane will actually leave. According to airline regulations a passenger is entitled to a $125 reimbursement when a flight is delayed more than 4.5 hours. I have customer service phoning about this because i have no confidence they would respond to my phone call.

### "I would recommend it"
Calgary to Vancouver. Flair is a ULCC which basically means that they will charge you for everything. This includes carry-ons, priority boarding, snacks, ect. When I booked I got the basic bundle which comes with a checked bag, priority boarding, and "travelFLEX" (the option to change your flight if you want to.) I'd recommend purchasing this bundle as it has pretty much everything covered in it. Since Flair is a ULCC, I was expecting to be cramped in my seat the whole way. However flair does offer a pretty generous amount of seat pitch on its seats. I'm 6'2" myself and I was able to stretch my legs just fine. For whatever reason, all of the inflight menus were missing on board however the flight attendants were helpful in telling me what was offered. I got a can of Pringles and a can of Pepsi which ask together cost $6.50. Personally I thought that this was a little overpriced, however they do offer some vegan options onboard. Overall I had a great flight! Flair has had some issues in the past with customer service and baggage handling, but I do think they are improving as an airline. The bag I checked was not damaged and the flight I was on was only delayed for 30 minutes. If you are considering flying flair, I would recommend it but make sure you know what your getting yourself into.

### "Flair Air are the worst ever"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Toronto, They have the rudest, most unhelpful, horrible staff I have ever had the displeasure to come across. We tried to change our flight from Vancouver to Toronto to an earlier flight. We asked were there any spare seats on the earlier flight to see if we could go on. We have done this before with other airlines. We were told there were some free seats and that it was $125 each to change. However the girl at the counter said she couldn’t process the change but her colleagues at the next flight at noon would do the change. We waited 4 hours there until noon and then went to the counter. We asked the guy could we change and take one of the spare seats. He again said there was a $125 fee to change. We said “sure” to go ahead and change our flight. The guy at the counter who was not at all friendly, asked for our passports and credit card. He started typing and we thought everything was good. Then he said it would be another $1200 each to change. We said we had not been told that earlier at 8am when we initially went to the counter. We told him we had waited for 4 hours for this flight and he had confirmed there were empty seats, so why were they now asking for an additional $2400 as well as the $25 each. He was so so rude, and there was no way he was going to let us change without paying. I asked for his name, he refused to give it to me. I asked for his supervisors name and again he refused to give it to me. I told him I wanted to speak to someone else and he said no. We said there was no way we were paying that amount. We told him we would just fly on our original flight and asked for our passports and credit card back. After we left the counter I called Flair customer service and spoke to someone there. He told me our flight had been changed and we owed $1200 and our original flight was gone! He said there was a note there that I had refused to pay! The guy at the desk had put through a payment on my card without  my authorization. We were shocked and went back to the desk. He said he would change it back to the original flight. So we left and got a hotel. Then an hour later we checked our reservation online and there is a $1500 charge for changing back to our original flight! So, we go all the way back to the airport, back to that guy at the counter. We asked him what was going on. He said he didn’t have time to change it but would “do it later” and then walked away from us! Well, he did NOT change it. Our original booking was gone. We ended up booking another flight with Air Canada. We tried to call Flair Air customer service over 20 times that evening and could not get through. I have sent them multiple emails and have had no response. I have to say the way we were treated is shocking and unbelievable. He charged our credit card without our permission and lost us our flight. This is unacceptable. Flair Air are the worst ever. Would never ever ever book with them again and will do my best to make sure nobody I know does either.

### "they won't refund or reimburse"
How would you feel if you get delayed for more than 24 hours with rude staff who don't even know when the flight will depart . We were told that the flight has been cancelled at 11pm which was due to arrive at 830 PM rescheduled from 7.30 am originally. Then we were put in a Hotel at 3 am at night after arguing with the staff. Next day at the airport they told us if is again delayed for 2 hours and then canceled it again. We had to buy WestJet tickets at $723 per person which for 4 people came to $2896 after taxes. Flair said they will only reimburse $618 fare for the return journey and won't even reimburse checked in baggage money for which I spent $30 extra. Gave their call center in Edmonton so many calls... nothing happened. Only got a letter from flair yesterday that they won't refund or reimburse money spent in buying tickets from West Jet.

### "extort fees arbitrarily"
Abbotsford to Winnipeg. The fees for carry on, luggage are actually published if you look, however the fee for printing your boarding pass, or even worse , over 109% no show fee if you miss the plane on a connecting flight. Save yourself problems, support a airline that treats you as a paying customer, and does not extort fees arbitrarily, may I suggest flying with west jet or any other airline, you will be happier for it !. I fly on average over 39 flights per year, first and last flight with Flair.

### "budget customer service"
Vancouver to Toronto. Budget fare doesn't have to mean budget customer service. Flight attendants were extremely rude. One dropped their demo seatbelt on me and didn't even apologize.

### "difficulties doing online check in"
Calgary to Vancouver. Book the flight much before through ONE TRAVEL, and my departure date is changed to next day, which i booked. and was not updated to ONE TRAVEL. Online check in is not at all user friendly, if traveler has already paid for check in baggage, it do not show , and if traveler try to show check in baggage (as traveler is carrying ) it charge again for that baggage. Traveler if already selected the seat, is not able to change it, face much difficulties while doing online check in. Staff is friendly and co-operative.

### "worst ever travel experience"
Not Verified |  Our family recently had the worst ever travel experience with Flair Air. I booked in February 2019. I received an e-mail about 3 weeks before my departure date in July saying that you had cancelled that flight. You had me trapped in Edmonton for 24 hours until the next flight the next day. I sat on hold for 2 hours with your company to have this changed, and was forced to say an extra day (again, because you canceled the flight). Then, days later, I was charged a "change fee" for having my flight changed. I sat on hold again for about 90 minutes to get this fee waved. When we arrived at our destination (Toronto), after a single stop in Edmonton, you'd lost our bag. The lady at the desk assured me that they would be in on the same flight, same time, the next day, and also assured me she would call me. The bag didn't arrive, and I never heard from her again. She did tell me, before I left that night, that Flair doesn't deliver bags, and it would be my responsibility to pick them up in Toronto. We were already booked into our hotels in Ottawa and Quebec, and I wasted our single day in Toronto trying to connect with someone at Flair Air (which is  impossible to do). The days and hours I wasted trying to get a straight answer from someone on your "help" line ruined a huge part of our vacation, as did the fact that we were without clothes, my daghter's scooter, bathing suits, medication etc. You did not find our suitcase until 11 days later, at which point it arrived at my Aunt's house in Kitchener. The suitcase was destroyed (handle torn off and missing, 2 of 4 feet bashed off, and zipper broken). When I asked to see a manager (the only way I was going to speak to an actual human being), when we finally arrived in Toronto to fly home at the end of our trip, the person checking me in said he wasn't around.

### "the negative reviews are valid"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Edmonton. Upon checking in, I was told my 90 minute flight would be delayed for 5 hours. I asked the woman at the gate if I was eligible for a refund, as I needed to book with a different airline. She told me this was not a problem and that she had issued my refund, to expect it in about 7-10 business days. 4 weeks later I had not received any money, so I spent an hour on hold with customer service, and was unable to get through. I sent in an online request (as they recommend this on their site for any customer service issues). They responded and apologized and let me know they were looking into it. Have not heard back from them since, with multiple emails sent from me to try and connect. It has now been almost 2 months, and I cannot get ahold of this company at all. Please beware that all the negative reviews are valid.

### "I had absolutely no problems"
Toronto to Edmonton. I had absolutely no problems with this airline. My flight left and arrived on time both ways and the crew were very friendly on both flights. I would most definitely fly with Flair Air again.

### "absolutely livid with this airline"
Calgary to Toronto. I am absolutely livid with this airline and I will never fly with them again. My fiancee and I need to travel to Quebec for a medical appointment. We decided to make a trip out of it and visit my best friend in Toronto for two weeks and drive to Quebec for the appointment. We booked our travel tickets through Flair Airlines. There was a change in my fiancee's university exam schedule and we found out we had to move our plane tickets. When I called them to do this, I was put on hold for 50 minutes before my call was answered. I am a teacher, so I have summers off and I phoned at a time where many people would be at work. When my call was finally answered, I couldn't understand anything the agent on the phone was saying. She constantly made mistakes while I was talking to her and she had zero customer service skills at all. Because we are travelling for a medical appointment, it is very important that we get there for a specific date/time. They had no flights that could accommodate our schedule and we are being forced to go 2 days later. When I expressed my concern with their service and with this entire process, she said nothing and changed the subject. She then quoted me that the charge would be $133 per person. I chose to only change one ticket, as it is my best friend and I could simply spend the extra week with her while my fiancee stays home to write his exam. She also told me she could "not guarentee" how much it would actually cost to change the ticket, as she could only give me a quote and not the real price. Huh?! How is it that I am calling you, with my credit card in hand, saying I will make this change now, and you cannot tell me what it is going to cost until you submit the irreversible changes?? That is absolutely ridiculous. When she hit the "change" button, the price magically jumped to $188. She told me that the charges were because of "tax". I live in Alberta and the tax rate is 5%, meaning tax should be no more than $10 on a $200 purchase. This purchase wasn't even for $200, so there is no way that was adding up. When I questioned her on it, she noticed that I had been "mistakenly" charged for the $15 change fee that isn't supposed to apply to ticket change requests. She then put me on hold for 15 minutes while she called to get support to change that. She could not explain where the rest of the charges came from and when I tried to question her, she answered every single question with "would you like me to proceed with these changes," regardless of how many times I asked her to explain it to me. Eventually, as we didn't have a choice, I paid it out of frustration. In total, the call with her trying to get a simple time change applied took an extra 27 minutes, meaning it took almost an hour and 20 minutes to do something that should have taken no more than 5 minutes. After reading everyone else's reviews, I feel lucky this was the only issue I've had so far. Now, we are terrified that my fiancee's flight may get cancelled at the last minute (which we have seen has happened to other people) and the medical appointment is for him. This is a specialist appointment we have been waiting for for several years and it cannot be moved. I am at a loss to explain the amount of stress and upset this has caused us and I will never fly with Flair again.

### "It’s a farce"
Not Verified |  Halifax to Toronto. The flight started out with a one hour delay. It turned into two, but we were boarded. We were then told to get off the plane. Since then, they kept saying it would depart in half an hour. It’s now been six hours all in all, and they won’t tell us that it’s cancelled. Some of the passengers waited all evening yesterday - for the same plane, with the same technical issue - and it was eventually cancelled. They don’t make announcements, people take turns at asking and are told, that the staff don’t know when the plane will be ready. It’s a farce.

### "loss for words and soon money"
❎ Not Verified | Edmonton to Kelowna. I am currently at this moment about to lose my entire fare for a flight I have been trying to change since yesterday morning. I have submitted 2 fast track forms from their website to change my flight. I am aware of the $125.00 charges to do so, this isn't an issue for me. The website says that once the form is submitted you will receive an email that confirms your change and to then view the changes made in the "YOUR TRIP" folder online. I have recieved nothing. I then tried to call the customer service number listed on their website. I was greeted with "The number you have reached cannot be completed as dialled". I am at a loss for words and soon money.

### "service was extremely poor"
Vancouver to Calgary. Originally I chose to fly with them because the cost of the flight was very low, but in the end, it has cost me more money and stress than any flight I’ve ever taken. My incoming flight was cancelled and rescheduled to a new flight a day and a half later then what I booked. The airline did not notify me of this change. I found out when I went to check in online for my flight 24hours before departure and saw that the flight was leaving a day and a half later. Cutting my trip short, costing me money in accommodations and altogether ruining my plans for those two days. I called the airline to discuss this and they said there was nothing they could do. They offered to cancel and refund my flight all together but that is beside the point because I still have the intentions of taking this trip! The only other option they said was to change my return flight to 2.5 days later then I planned on returning, which is also fairly useless because I planned my trip around specific dates for a reason. According to Flair, there were “no other available flights” whatsoever. After being thoroughly disappointed by the conversation with the Flair agent, I hung up and waited until I could do the online check in for my flight. Upon filling in the online check in, I see that they are trying to charge me for a carry on bag. Apparently this was in the fine print when I booked the ticket - which I did not see. Also, on every flight I have ever taken, the carry on bags have been free. I had to pay $35 for a carry on bag, which now tacks on an additional $70 to my flight fee for the trip, along with the wasted money for arriving a day and a half late. I called a second time to talk to someone about the situation. I discussed my previous phone call about my flight getting cancelled and rebooked without notification and then the fact that I have to pay for my carry on bag as well. The agent explained the rationale behind charging for a carry on and fuel costs and cabin space. I told him I understood however I was dissatisfied because of all these out of pockets expenses I now have from arriving a day and a half later and having to pay for a carry on. He transferred the call to a “financial assistant“ of some kind - whom I waited for for nearly 20 minutes. After explaining my situation to her she simply says “no ma’am, there’s nothing I can do”. Refuses to offer any sort of compensation, compromise or any assistance whatsoever. After being on the phone another hour with zero help at all, I hung up the phone. For return trip home, I checked in online for my flight 24 hours prior and on the form I fill in 1 carry on bag for the $35 fee. I complete the check in and arrive the next day at the check in counter and the woman informs me I have not paid for a carry on bag. I discuss that I did indeed put 1 carry on bag for $35, just like I did on the way here. She looks and me and just says no. I tell her again, the process I took when booking it and am not sure why it did not work. She now says I must pay $50 for a carry on bag! At this point I am absolutely fed up with the service but I remain polite and calm and tell her that this airline has been absolutely horrible to deal with and hand her my credit card. She does not say anything to me at all, offer any apology or sympathy or understanding. The customer service was extremely poor. They would not accommodate or reimburse me in any of the situations. Nor did they display any genuine regard for the situation.

### "avoid this low cost airline"
Vancouver to Toronto. Please avoid this low cost airline if you value your time and sanity. The delay was known already a day before the departure as the airline kept sending email with updated time of departure. When I arrived at the airport everything seemed to be fine. Right now, they’ve announced the 3rd delay which is already 4.5 hrs. You get $10 voucher for food and non-alcoholic beverages for hours and hours of your time. Also note that their call centre operates only 9-5 so you won’t be able to get hold of anyone. And the funniest thing? It’s not even cheap.

### "the worst level of service"
Vancouver to Toronto. Flight was originally scheduled to depart at 3pm PST. I arrive at airport 1.5 hrs in advance as required. Display board shows flight delayed 1.5 hrs to 4:30. (By the way you have to pay extra to get text notifications). One hour later, it now shows another delay to 6:30pm. At 5:50pm board gets changed to show a further delay now to 7:30pm departure. Unbelievable! Speak to gate agent and when asked why another delay, they say originally due to mechanical issues. Am told plane is in Edmonton and currently in air on way to Vancouver. When I asked why we are only told of another delay now, they say “ this is the information ground control gives us”. This is the worst level of service ever. I thought I saved $400 buying a last minute ticket to Vancouver vs Air Canada or Westjet. Turns out not getting to Toronto until 2am and no sleep to work tomorrow isn’t a good deal at all. This is the 2nd time I’ve flown Flair. First time had major delays due to mechanical issues. I should have learned my lesson the first time. This will be the last.

### "Flight was delayed by 12 hours"
Toronto to Vancouver. Worst Airline and service ever. Flight was delayed by 12 hours because they said crew had to rest but this seems to be a normal excuse so that they don’t have to pay compensation due to passenger safety. Then when we finally boarded 12 hrs later aircraft had changed and so did our seating. It was absolute chaos.

### "don’t care about your time"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Toronto. We arrived at the airport for our flight scheduled to depart at 3:00pm. We were told that the flight was delayed until 8:00pm. When we arrived for our 8:00pm flight we were told that the flight was now delayed until 10:45pm. I noted that the new rules meant we should receive $125 per passenger for the delay and they advised the new rules only come into effect on 15JUL2019. Instead of stepping up to do the right thing, they gave us two $10 vouchers for food. They seemed completely unsympathetic and didn’t offer any alternative options. I wouldn’t recommend that anyone ever fly with Flair Air as they don’t care about your time.

### "the delays seem to be a common occurrence"
We wanted to try Flair Airlines because it was a short flight from Calgary to Vancouver and it would have been about a 20% savings. Big mistake, the flight was delayed because they did not have the flight attendants there. The frustrating aspect was the fact they did not know when the problem would be resolved, so the passengers just waited aimlessly. The delay ended up being almost 2 hours (twice the length of the flight). There was nothing offered in return. After reading other reviews, the delays seem to be a common occurrence, so please take this into consideration before booking. I'm sure many of their other flights go fine but this experience has turned me off Flair Airlines.

### "helpful and accommodating"
Toronto to Kelowna. Just wanted to say how helpful and accommodating the flight attendants were on this flight. My girlfriend has back issues and they were extremely caring and made her comfort at top priority. Thanks again ladies.

### "screwed up our flights so badly"
Toronto to Kelowna. This airline screwed up our flights so badly. It ruined our vacation and caused unbelievable stress for my family. Customer service agents sound like they are not even trained. No apology just "wow we've never seen that before". I cant believe this company is still operating. I will never use this airline. I'd give the details of what happened but I'm too tired from spending hours on the phone with them trying to correct this.

### "delayed for 5 hours"
Halifax to Toronto. The flight was delayed for 5 hours. If your hand luggage is more than 10 kg or bigger than an average backpack, you’ll pay 35 CAD, plus checked in luggage 30 CAD. No complimentary drink.

### "pretty disorganized"
Toronto to Calgary via Winnipeg. Wack. Old plane with no chargers. Felt grimy. The staff was friendly but the whole ordeal seemed pretty disorganized. I bought my flight for a 18:55 departure. When I arrived at the airport the departures screen said it was delayed from 17:55 to 18:56, meaning they didn’t tell me the departure time changed I guess? I’m not sure, but either way, I don’t plan on flying with them again. It was only slightly cheaper than Air Canada or WestJet and the quality was far lower. Would not recommend

### "avoid this airline in the future"
Vancouver to Toronto. Initial flight delayed twice, for 10 hours altogether, with minimal explanation or compensation, besides the $30 meal vouchers. But to even get the vouchers proved a difficult task, as there was a huge line and only one person dealing with the mess. There was another huge line to process refunds, but that too was a mess. Another issue: getting refunds from them is beyond difficult. I initially booked on a wrong credit card, so applied for a refund within their 24-hour window. I had to call and email to confirm that they even received my application. Then, when a refund didn't materialize within the 7-10 day window they promised, I had to call again. Now the wait became 3-4 weeks. When a refund still had not materialized after that, I went ahead and disputed the charge on my credit card (by the way, that process took 2 business days). I suspect there is something fraudulent going on with the airline, as it makes no sense why it should take 3-4 weeks for a refund to occur, especially after it had already been processed. As for the flight itself, it was average. The plane was dirty and old, but the service was quite good. The attendants were very apologetic about the delays, and gave us the basic teas and juices for free. Otherwise, even water would have cost money. I would avoid this airline in the future. I actually suspect they won't survive the new rules being implemented in July, with how much compensation they would have to give out under the new legislation.

### "I strongly recommend another airline"
Flew June 21 form Edmonton to Halifax. Staff are great! Plane is disgusting. Washroom smelt of urine, the floor was sticky even the door to washroom was gross. This plane was sitting so first flight of the morning. It should have been cleaned. My next flight was from Halifax to Edmonton on June 30th. Again the flight crew were pleasant. The plane on the other hand should not have been Flying. The front washroom wasn't working, the rear washrooms were filthy and there was no water to wash your hands. There was a broken seat at the front of the plane with a passenger sitting in it. I understand Flying on a budget. I'm a truck driver and hauled cattle ànd these animals were in better travelling conditions than what was on that plane. I strongly recommend another airline. Stay away from Flair.

### "made the trip very unpleasant"
Winnipeg to Toronto. This airline is not for individuals travelling with small kids. They made us walk with the stroller and car seat all the way to the door of the aircraft instead of checking them at the counter. This made the trip very unpleasant as we had two small kids, two car seats and two strollers, plus three carry-on bags and the baby diaper bag to carry among two adults. I am pleading with the airline to listen to the customers, and do like the other airlines, and allow us the check the baby equipment at the baggage counter.

### "It was a terrible experience"
It was one of the worst experiences. The flight was delayed by 7 hours and there were no proper answers provided on what was going on. We were made to sit in the aircraft for 4-5 hours without proper service. There was no sense of responsibility towards Customers and even with the delay of 7 hours we were not provided any proper meal. It was a terrible experience and airlines should take more responsibility. 0 ratings

### "Booked with a different company"
Vancouver to Edmonton. Flight delayed for 6 hours, 1st delay. No heads up of this prior to arriving 2 hours before original departure time. Staff gave $10 food vouchers to "compensate". No good for alcohol or the convenience stores, or for about half of the restaurants at the airport. Spoke with Flair via phone, waited almost 30 minutes. Was told this company would comp my flight with a different company (i.e. WestJet) if the flight was bumped again. Around 3pm, asked employee and was told flight was still good to go. 2 hours later, and 45 minutes before rescheduled departure time, flight got bumped again. Now it was a 10 hour delay from original departure time. Asked about compensation but was told the employee who told me this was wrong. Call center closed when I tried to call them again, even though it was still within their business hours. Booked with a different company because I wanted to arrive in my destination that day, and it was possible I would have to wait the entire weekend if the flight was bumped again. I still don't know if this flight ever left the airport. Was told the refund would appear within 3-7 business days. It is now the 8th business day and no refund. Called Flair again today to inquire. Waited for 40 minutes on hold before I spoke with someone who has now (re)processed my refund. It will be another 7-10 business days before it comes through. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to know that your flight will actually leave. It was not worth the stress and nightmarish wait to save myself a couple hundred dollars. Had to wait for almost an hour before I could get a refund at the Flair desk. Meanwhile, I had to get my luggage from Flair and drop it at the new airline's desk, as well as, go through security again. I had 2 hours to do all this, and I almost missed my new flight because I had to wait for my luggage for almost 35 minutes.

### "don't recommend this airline"
Toronto to Vancouver via Edmonton. Bad experience Jun 14, 2019. Flight to YVR cancelled. Perfect weather, no plane problems. An employee told me there were not enough crew to work the flight!! I received no email or text notification that the flight via Edmonton to Vancouver was delayed from 7am to 2pm, so arrived at the airport at 5:30am just in case. Their call centre doesn't open until 8am so I had nobody to check with. At the airport, I happened to see a lady with a clipboard who said I had been rebooked on an Air Canada flight at 5pm at another terminal. Although I appreciate promptly being rebooked, I never received any notification of my flight change...what if I had not found the lady? What if I stayed home and returned closer to 2pm for the Edmonton flight? They expected me and others to sit at the airport for 11 hours and wait. I took a short taxi ride home to sleep and came back again later. After multiple emails, the airline refuses to reimburse me for the 2 taxi fares which would not have been incurred if I was notified to stay home until the evening flight, and I paid a baggage fee for a flight my bag never went on. Company refuses any reimbursement and I lost a day of vacation. People meeting me in Vancouver had to change all their plans. Not happy about this experience. I don't recommend this airline at all.

### "the airplane had already left"
Vancouver to Calgary. I originally bought the round trip flight tickets for my husband, my 2 year old son and myself on May 10, 2019 for an 11:55 am departure from Vancouver to Calgary. On the day of departure, we realized when we got to the airport that the departure time had changed to 10:30 am. We got to the service counter at 10:35 am and the airplane had already left. The agent told us no other flights were available that day and that they had also automatically cancelled our return flight as their policy. How is this fair? We called the customer service line a few times as directed from their website but was on hold for more than 20 minutes each time. A couple of times, we got hung up on. When finally getting someone on the phone, they said they cannot do anything. The only offer they can give is for us to pay for new return flight tickets or pay $150 on top of what we already paid, plus the price difference for the tickets for that day. When asked if we can speak to management, they said no one was available and we would be on queue. However, three days passed and no one called back. We, of course, had to book another flight with another airline, which cost us over $2,000 but was treated much better. I was appalled with the way we were treated and no fair resolution was offered. This was also our first time booking with Flair Airlines and I do not recommend it to anyone

### "don't bother with this airline"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Calgary. Probably the worst airline experience I've ever had. I checked in the night before, paid for my baggage fees the night before. I arrived at the Flair Airlines booth at 10:45 AM when my flight took off at 11:55 AM hoping to just drop my bag. Sadly there was a huge line up of people waiting to check in and no bag drop. I waited and waited. Finally at 11:25 I noted I needed to get my bags to Calgary and two other families (who were ahead of me in the line) popped out with the same request. We all were heading to Calgary and couldn't drop our bags cause the counter folks were taking forever to process people. The counter girl told me to just leave my luggage and go get the plane. Where? She offered no secured locker. Then a manager came and said the same thing and told us we all missed our flight and there were no options to get our luggage to Calgary. They also had no other flights going to Calgary that day and our only option was to book another flight for another day. I tried to call customer service and they have an ongoing message that they're receiving higher than normal call volumes. I waited for 30 minutes and in that time booked another flight to Calgary via WestJet. I hung up and wrote customer service an email to get this sorted out. I still haven't heard back from them. Two days later when I tried to check into my return flight from Calgary to Vancouver with Flair Air, the counter ladies informed me because I missed my flight on Saturday, my Monday flight was cancelled. No call? No email? So I had to pay for another return flight back to Vancouver with Flair Air. Honestly I'll never fly with this airline again. They're processes and procedures for quick check in are terrible. Why is there no bag drop so you can avoid having to go to the counter line up? They nickle and dime you at every corner and aren't really that much cheaper. I've been on hold with their customer service again for 45 minutes and still no answer. don't bother with this airline.

### "Worst airline ever"
Vancouver to Edmonton. Terrible. Cancelled flight after they have conveniently closed their call center for the day. Emailed through web site. Have yet to get a reply. Sent note through face book page. Have yet to get a reply. Called in and they just offer refund and no reason for delay. I mention new federal rules coming out July and December 15th about airline and compensation they just play dumb and say not aware of any rules. Worst airline ever. Not to worry as this airline will be defunct soon. Ended up costing me 150% more to fly one way just get home. worst part is that they don’t care and couldn’t wait to get off phone with me. Never fly.

### "Terrible service"
Edmonton to Toronto with Flair Airlines. Terrible service. Unpredictable. They changed the flight status at the last minute without any information. Surprised at the counter today by a rescheduled flight 2 times with a more than 10 hours wait at the airport. Avoid if possible.

### "Bad customer service"
Toronto to Winnipeg. Bad customer service. Would not help us at the check in and when I called the person over the phone, the agent has the worst service I have ever heard. I would never want to deal with her again. She said she was the highest supervisor in the company and wouldn’t give me a name to speak to another one. They talk to you as if you’re a child and just tell you you’re wrong without trying to help. If I could rate them 0 stars I would.

### "Great customer service"
Edmonton to Kelowna. 2 front fight attendants were great. Caitlyn was one of the names if not mistaken and the other I can’t remember. Great customer service. Honest and respected woman. So thanks for a great experience and I do recommend this airline to whoever’s travelling near and far. Thank you

### "both flights pleasant"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Edmonton. Great flight, we were on standby. Service agents on return from Edmonton were excellent very accommodating. Flight comfortable lots of leg room both flights pleasant helpful crew, would highly recommend.

### "think twice before flying with them"
Vancouver to Calgary. Just have to give a quick shout-out to Flair Airlines and their terrible customer service! My bag was damaged to the point of needing repair while in your hands and basically telling me it's of no fault of theirs. I think it's great that you post on your website how you will fairly compensate anyone for damaged baggage, requesting me to fill out a massive form, and then having the audacity to tell me after that you actually do not compensate travellers for damaged baggage (which I had to pay $60 to check because they charge $70 to carry on a bag.) I advise everyone to think twice before flying with them. Even though you save money on your initial purchase with them, it costs you far more in the long run.

### "They lost one of my luggage"
Winnipeg to Vancouver. Dont even bother booking your flights here. It’s cheap but you get what you pay for. First, during check in the attendants in Winnipeg were very rude and unprofessional. The flight wasn’t delayed which was the only good thing that happened that day. But the problem started once I landed in Vancouver. They lost one of my luggage which had all my important clothing and basic necessities. The station attendant in Vancouver wasn’t very helpful finding my luggage either. I called their baggage department and it took them a week to finally get my luggage back to me. I had to purchase new clothing which wasn’t in my budget because they couldn’t do their job properly. Apparently, instead of them delivering my luggage to my address in Vancouver, they tried to deliver it back to my address in Winnipeg. Like seriously why would they deliver it back to the city I’m trying to get the luggage out from? They promised me reimbursement for the amount I spent and for the baggage fee, but its been 2 months and I haven’t received a dime from them. The baggage department have also stopped replying to my emails. Like really I cant emphasize enough how much this company have given me stress trying to locate that luggage and getting a reimbursement back.

### "never fly Flair Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Edmonton . Terrible. I checked-in online and tried to prepay for my checked baggage and got an error message saying the my ticket could not be check-in online and that my boarding pass could not be printed. I removed the checked baggage and I was able to check-in online and was able to print my boarding pass as well. Their "online check-in" to save money on baggage fees is just a front. I still had to pay for my checked baggage at full price at the airport instead of the "discounted" price online. Will never fly with Flair Airlines again.

### "having to pay $50 for a back pack"
Edmonton to Kelowna. There is no consistency! I flew with the same sized regular back pack as my personal item for 4 flights in 4 days & on my last flight they wouldn’t accept my bag as fitting in their ridiculous (no bag is ever shaped like) sizing thing. $53 later! The reason I flew with flair is their cheaper flight, not really any cheaper with now having to pay $50 for a back pack! Not to mention my first flight they had double booked the seat next to me & my current flight initially had a 5 year old & his mom in separate seats at opposite ends of the plane! It’s not worth the cheaper fair, I will just fly the usual WestJet or air canada which makes my destinations direct & my back pack on board is free! Oh & the customer service at the front counter, I wish I had ascertained the lady’s name, she should not be in customer service.

### "recommend Flair Airlines"
Not Verified |  I flew from Toronto to Edmonton and back to Toronto. Great staff during the check-in and while onboard. Everyone was friendly and the flight left on time and arrived early on the trip back to Toronto. I highly recommend Flair Airlines to anyone looking to travel while saving some money. Great job to Flair and the crew and staff.

### "time is not acceptable for us"
Flight booked is a return from Edmonton Alberta to Abbotsford BC. Booked in April for flight on July 8th 2019. Informed today May 26th 2019 that flight and time has been changed to a time that is not acceptable for us. Tried calling them to see.why and what can be done about this and have now been on hold for 2 hours 7 minutes and counting. Unbelievable that they treat their customers this way. Do they only have 1 person in the call center? Makes.me.wonder if they only have one pilot and.one mechanic to service their planes. Does not instill confidence in this company. Repeating message " by now you've guessed we have higher than normal call volumes and longer wait times. Your call is important to us so please continueto hold.." For how. long? People have limited lives you kno,  far too short to waste on service like this. I will never use Flair again.

### "been an awful experience"
Not Verified |  Bought a round-trip from Toronto to Vancouver. My initial departure flight was great, no issues there. However upon arriving to the airport for my return flight to Toronto, I was told by the supervisor at the check in station that I was not in the system for the flight that day. Both my online itineraries, Expedia itinerary, and emails show that I purchased a round-trip and was scheduled for the return flight. The supervisor told me that there was nothing she could do and that it was an issue with Expedia, who I'd bought my flight through. Without any options, I was forced to purchase a $600 flight home, despite having already purchased a round-trip. To make matters worse, since making it home I haven't been able to contact Flair's customer service. Hold times are upwards of an hour without speaking to a real person, and no one has responded to my email complaint. Expedia has been much more helpful. The agent I'm speaking to as I type is also on hold with Flair, struggling to find a real person to speak to as well. I'm never one to complain but this has been an awful experience, this is the first airline I can rightfully say I will never fly with again.

### "ignore calls and emails"
Calgary to Vancouver. Originally had booked a fight in January for a time in May to see my friends wedding. I had booked an evening flight so I could finish my shift at work that day and still make the flight. I had booked time off work around this timing. What happened next was that the flight time of my flight was completely changed. Instead of an evening flight, it was changed into a morning flight. At my work I cannot take off an extra day without proper notice. Because of this, I had to miss my flight in the morning, and then had to find a last minute one-way flight to my destination. The cost of the missed flight was $100, then the additional last minute flight was $400. Trying to get a refund for just my missed Flair flight has been a joke. They ignore calls and emails regarding the issue. I will never fly with them again over this problem.

### "extremely disappointed"
Halifax to Toronto. I'm extremely disappointed with Flair airline. First, they charged my credit card 7 times! I had to spend so much time speaking with Flighthub, Flair and Visa to get this mess sorted. Then three weeks after booking a flight, they changed my departure and arrival time to times unacceptable for me. I have been waiting on their customer support line for 1: 04:10 and counting! I have never had to waste so much time to deal with any company. This is ridiculous.

### "definitely not worth it"
Calgary to Vancouver. They might have cheap flights, but definitely not worth it. There is a carry-on fee for going to your destination, and back. With the exempt of a small purse that is gratis. Be very careful when paying for it online as they have made it tricky in the options to purchase a Carry On bag. Everything you pay for is non refundable, and they have no shame being rude to you on the phone. Never again will I fly with this company.

### "I felt manipulated"
Abbotsford to Calgary. Very rude staff at check in. I was late and couldn’t check in as needs to be done an hour before departure which I did not know. No one at counter. She came out after I complained to someone and said I couldn’t board the plane as she was unable to check me in that late. Other people came as well and she was rude to us all. She said she would not print my pass because I was rude. I said I just need on the plane.. It’s mothers day and I’m going home to my kids. Finally she says ok I’ll print your pass just stop crying. I got on the plane but felt like I’d just been traumatized. Do not fly with this airline. If you do follow their rules. Btw I was there 50 minutes before my flight. I did record her being very rude to another customer. She said I was going to check your pass but not now because he was asserting himself. I felt manipulated, harassed and not valued as a customer.

### "staff were great"
Kelowna to Edmonton. I've flown with Flair 5 times and never had any issues, staff were great and on time performance was on point. Best part is a saved a bunch of money also.

### "Very unfair, Flair Airlines"
Winnipeg to Calgary. Spent considerable time checking in online from my smartphone. The last page was frozen, I couldn't click on "send boarding pass by email". I thought all was good, as the screen confirmed check in. I also paid for baggage during that process. At the airport I found out that I was not checked it. It took a very long time to check me in (agent did not how to do it and required assistance). They also charged me $10 for the check in service. Very unfair, Flair Airlines.

### "cost becomes similar to WestJet"
Not Verified |  If you have anything more than a backpack the cost becomes similar to WestJet as they charge for anything more than a personal bag. On my flight, the plane was having maintenance issues so it was delayed three hours while they flew in a different plane from Edmonton (a problem that I have not experienced with WJ or AC as they have more flights throughout the day to move to). When I asked the front desk staff about the delay they were apathetic and rude about how I was missing a very important meeting and could not change flights. Flair charges you for any beverage including water, has no in flight entertaining, and costs the same as other carriers. I tried to leave a complain and even their website was broken and buggy. I don't see any reason why anyone would fly with Flair.

### "not friendly at all"
This customer representative person was not friendly at all. I was asking how to check in, but he was not energetic at all, leaning on the counter, looking at me with impolite look, and told me “Don’t you know that you can just check in online and go to the security? You don’t have to be here.” I understand that we fly with very low fare with them, but I don’t think that they can treat customers like that. I hope that they smile, talk nicely, and treat people equally.

### "Bad customer service"
Winnipeg to Vancouver via Edmonton. Flair rescheduled my flights two weeks before departure date. They offered a refund on the unused legs of the flight but failed to mention if you reschedule one leg, you have to tell them you might reschedule the second leg otherwise you forfeit your right to reschedule again, even though they originally rescheduled both legs of my flight. When I called to ask about a refund, I was trying to tell the agent someone should have told us we can only reschedule once despite Flair rescheduling both our departing and returning flights, and the agent hung up on me. So unprofessional. On my departing flight the flight attendants recited a script “If you enjoyed flying with us leave us a good review.” Probably because they know all they have is bad reviews. Bad customer service, won’t be flying with flair again.

### "1.5 hours for luggage pickup"
Edmonton to Toronto. Waited 1.5 hours for luggage pickup, no explanation just announcements every 10 minutes saying luggage would arrive soon. Paid $50 for the privilege.

### "Very unimpressed"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford. Flight was canceled without telling us. If I hadn't called for something eles we would of never known. A month later and we still haven't gotten our refund. My husband called to find out why and was told they refunded it already but we only got the insurance back not the $1700 for our flights. Horrible service, never again. This flight was for our wedding. I'm just glad I called way ahead of time so we can make other plans or we would of missed our wedding. Very unimpressed and I plan on telling everybody how horrible it was.

### "They changed my flights"
Toronto to Vancouver. Terrible airline. They changed my flights a few weeks before departure. They offered a refund to me and I asked if it would be a full refund and they said yes. I only got half of my flight refunded. Now I have to pay for the other half of the flight (that I don not need) when I already got tickets from another airline. I would not recommend them. Bad business operations and high risks. I ended up wasting time and money for nothing but frustration. Not to mention they're not even cheap. Other airlines prices are comparable. Definitely not worth trying this business.

### "extremely disappointed with Flair"
Review on Flair Airlines: I am extremely disappointed with Flair, I flew with Flair to Calgary from Toronto for a business trip for 8 days and Flair had changed my return flight date a day earlier with little to no notification that it has been changed. I now have had to spend $1000 to buy a one way ticket back to Toronto due to their inconsiderate way of running business. I suggest other flyers to not take Flair Airlines, I have never had so many inconveniences flying. Due to Flair being understaffed caused my flight a 4 hour delay, they changed my flight with no notice no email no call, and Flair could not give me any resolution after the 12th representative that I have spoken to and could only refund $300 after having to spend $1000 for a one way ticket back home for their inconvenience. This is ridiculous.

### "the worst part, not one apology"
Our family travelled Abbotsford to Winnipeg via Edmonton. About a week before we travelled we received notification the flights would all be delayed by hours but by then we were already committed. Instead of an 8.30pm arrival in Winnipeg it was closer to 11pm. We had another hour to travel which was tricky with tired kids. Coming back to Abbotsford on the Monday morning was even more exhausting. A 9.30am departure Winnipeg with a 4 hour layover in Calgary getting us back to Abbotsford for 4.30pm. This is a 2 hr non stop journey in the summertime - we could have gone to Europe with this travel time! We would never have bought these flights with these delays across the board. And the worst part, not one apology. Not a single complimentary cup of coffee. Unbelievable. If I treated my customers in my business lie we were treated - I wouldn't have any.

### "child in emergency row"
From YWG to YVR. Online seat selection allowed us to book a child in emergency row, which we should not be able to do. Flight attendants were courteous but claimed that we should not have done it. We would not have done it if we had known it was an emergency row or if the rules were clearly posted about eligibility of those seats of if the Flair online system automatically prohibited a child from sitting there (we are required to enter chilren's ages). Flair also triple booked our seats on flight from YVR to YWG.

### "Can’t beat the price"
Edmonton to Vancouver. Awesome airline. Can’t beat the price. No issues and this is my 5th time flying. No frills airline, great service, always has been in time. No issues

### "definitely fly with Flair again"
Edmonton to Vancouver. Amazing Deal and flight. My flight from Edmonton to Vancouver was only $108.50 which included a checked bag! Flight arrived on time, seat had lots of leg room and the crew was friendly. I would definitely fly with Flair again.

### "cancel my return trip"
Flair Airline cancel my return trip from Toronto to Edmonton did not send any confirmation of cancellation, not even offer for a refund whatsoever. No clear communication, nothing at all. There customers service are awful. They are not even helpful instead of giving sh.t and blame on you. There customer service are not even open at 8 pm on Sunday. So I call in the morning asking questions about my flight and what they can do for me. They told me there is nothing that they can do. I am on my own. Flair Airline are very unethical. I have heard bad things about Flair before but never believe it until is happen to me. I will never ever travel with this airline. Is not worth the trouble headache and stress that they bring on you. It will end up cost you a fortune like me and my family we have to come up with $1680 for the three of us to fly home. How Flair Airline can still allowed to operates business with no set of standards. Better off to pay a little higher price with a reputable airline that they don’t screw you over and rob your money during day light.

### "you get what you paid for"
Flair is a budget airline so you get what you paid for. You have to check in online before you get to the airport and there is no complimentary food or drinks on board. There is also no inflight entertainment so you must provide something yourself. I read all of this online before my flight so I was prepared. I got my bag fully checked through quickly at the airport. My flight ended up leaving early and landed 20 mins early as well. Inflight staff were lovely and funny. The plane is old but again, it's a budget airline. 2nd time I've flown with them, the first time the flight was 2 hours late due to weather which was not their fault.

### "last time we fly with Flair"
My spouse and I decided to try Flair for the first time to save about $150. It will be the last time we fly with Flair. The inconvenience was not worth the money we saved! We booked our flights with Flair from Edmonton to Abbotsford as well as return flights back in Jan of 2019. Our flight to Abbotsford was scheduled for 10:25 on 5 Apr with our return flight scheduled for 13:25 on 8 Apr. On 29 Mar we received an email stating our return flight was changed from 13:25 to 16:25. This was a large inconvenience but we were committed at this point. Fast forward to 5 Apr, the morning of our scheduled departure. We wake up early to get ready for our flight and I see an email stating our flight will be delayed by an hour or so. We decided to get to the airport early regardless as it’s an hour drive. Everything seems fine according to the board for departures and at the gate. 30 mins before our scheduled departure they announce we will be boarding immediately. Nothing happens. When we should be taking off they announce at the gate there was “unscheduled maintenance” and we would be delayed another 30 mins. This again changes to 1.5 hrs. Then we are told we will be getting a different plane. Then another delay, and another. We eventually depart at approx 18:15, almost a full 8 hours later on the original plane we were supposed to fly on. Needless to say this was a massive inconvenience and ruined our trip. Flair gave us a $10 food voucher for the inconvenience! How kind! That doesn’t buy you a pretzel at the airport, and it also couldn’t be used for alcohol. So we saved $150 on the flights but spent over $300 on food and drinks as we were in the airport for so long. On 8 Apr we are ready to board and again find out as we are supposed to be boarding there is “unscheduled maintenance”. Fortunately this ended up being only about an hour delay. I’m speaking with others at the airport who flew from Winnipeg on Flair their flight was cancelled outright until the next day. Read the reviews...this is a theme with this airline. Major delays on flights and constant cancellations. The only positive were the crew. Never again will we fly with Flair.

### "insurance was useless"
Customer service does not give me the proper information and retract what they had originally told me in regard to flight changes. I purchased insurance through travel company which was useless as they don't hold up to what their selling. I had to pay almost 300 to change flight. I rescheduled the 2nd flight and they wanted to charge me again for a full flight fare. Basically over 1300 dollars to fly return from Vancouver to Winnipeg.

### "Do not fly them"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. Do not fly them. Cancelled my Edmonton to Vegas flight that is less than 3 weeks away. We had to rebook hotels and all new flights for inflated flights with another airline due to the timing. Also my friend that came back just recently on Flair roundtrip from Vegas had a 5 hour delay and no compensation. I guess you get what you pay for with this airline. Just pay more and rest easy. If I could rate 0 I would, but the option is not possible.

### "poor customer service"
Flew to Edmonton from Toronto to pickup my children who live there, we were heading to Mexico on another airline. This trip was to a golf resort so I took my golf clubs. My clubs never made it too Edmonton and the next day when we were delayed by more than 12 hours, by weather, another Flair flight arrived from Toronto, still no clubs. At this point the Flair baggage rep said they didn't know where my clubs were, Toronto, Edmonton or possibly Vancouver. Flair told me to keep my golf expense receipts and they would reimburse me. The resort graciously lent me clubs for a round and I only bought golf balls, not shoes or gloves which I could've used. My clubs showed up 4 days later on yet another airline and Flair told me I'd have to pick them up as they didn't have reps at the airport to deliver the clubs. I explained that the airport was an hour away, we'd already lost a day to weather and I wasn't going to spend 3 hours travelling back and forth to the airport looking for my clubs while trying to enjoy my vacation with my children, they responded with sorry. Now that I'm home and have submitted my lowly receipt for $80 they are not reimbursing me and keep throwing up road blocks as to why they are not. They claim they need a larger photo of the receipt, I've provided it yet they ask for an even larger one when the one I supplied is clear as day. Very frustrated with the poor customer service. Why would I fly with them again? !

### "They switched the airport"
Toronto to Edmonton. They had a 4 hour delay because one flight attendant called in sick last minute. They switched the airport me and my husband were going to arrive and they said they will pay for a taxi ride to the correct airport. When we landed at the new airport there was no one on the counter and we had to wait an extra hour for someone to show up, after we had 3 different people on the airport page someone from the airline. I sent an email to their customer service and they just said they are sorry but they won’t do any compensation. Wouldn’t recommend this airline.

### "much more than I expected"
Vancouver to Edmonton. My first trip on Flair was much more than I expected for a discount carrier. It was perfect. I travel twice a month on the non-discount carriers and I have been getting use to their poor service and late flights (my April anniversary trip has been changed so many times I am not sure when my flights are). So happy that there is another carrier to compete with the other carriers.

### "Was pleasantly surprised"
Was very sceptic before undertaking this trip, specially after reading all the negative reviews of the airline. Was pleasantly surprised on my actual experience, actually was better than a lot of low cost experienced earlier. The ground staff was very pleasant to deal with, on time performance, huge leg room on regular seats and an ultra smooth touch down at both instances. Just one issue, one of the cabin crew member was not only kind of rude but was also wearing a very strong and irritable perfume. Overall, a great value for money.

### "abysmal at best"
I booked a flight through Flair to Phoenix in mid February. The original flight time change twice after I booked the flight. Just an email saying the flight time changed, no attached updated itinerary, no explanation. I called to ask why the constant changes and if the flight time would change again, they said not likely. Then they cancelled the flight a week before the scheduled date. I then had to book another flight, which would be considered last minute so the cost of a one way ticket was $700!! I also had to change my rental car reservation because I now have to fly out of a different airport. Their compensation? $50 flight credit. The service and run around I received were abysmal at best, they should be embarrassed by their customer service and "compensation".

### "don't seem to have a clue"
Abbotsford to Calgary. I have not flown with Flair as yet but my review is about the customer service recieved when trying to change the date of my departure. Upon phoning their customer service and asking to make the change I was told that there was a charge to make a change to the flight $125 but it may be less to cancel the flight and re- book. Also a $15 fee to do this with the customer service rep. I agreed to them cancelling the flight and re-scheduling. The fellow told me I would get a new itinerary and a bill for the change.The next day I got a new itinerary but there was no change at all. Upon phoning again I was advised that nothing was done at their end and I would have to re-book myself. That meant the flight had gone up overnight by another $30 and from the previous booking $70. So I am out of pocket $210.50. The original price was $110.50. I will not fly with Flair again. Now I read these reviews I am afraid the actual flight experience will be a disaster too. I can see the demise of this company coming. Their customer service don't seem to have a clue.

### "stranding us in the USA"
Canceled our flight - stranding us in the USA without giving an alternative flight. They had nothing available. Offered a 50 travel voucher which was unacceptable. Will never travel with Flair Airlines again, need a flight home to Canada.

### "just cancelled our flight"
They just cancelled our flight from Edmonton to Phoenix over Easter 3 weeks away, booked it way back when they first opened for a great price. They emailed a week ago and changed the flight time so thought we were good. Had read some of the bad reviews and now I understand why. Will not recommend or use this airline. And as others have said why would I use the $50 voucher... they will just cancel again. Not to be trusted only book with them if your willing to take the chance on flight being cancelled!

### "cancelled my flight"
Winnipeg to St Pete Clearwater. Beware flair. I should have listened to the reviews. The only positive ones are non confirmed. They cancelled my $200 per person flight leaving to book with Westjet for $550. I should have done that from the start it would have been less.

### "conduct is completely unacceptable"
Booked a return trip to Phoenix for a friends Birthday party there. After initial booking in January, I received an email 2 weeks later saying they had cancelled my outgoing flight and that they had re-booked me 2 days later. No call, no one asking me if that would work and no reason given. I was able to call and have my return flight rebooked 2 days later so I could enjoy a week at my destination. Today, 2 months after I had originally booked the flight, I received an email cancelling both legs of my flight, again, no call and no reason given. Don't book with Flair Airlines unless you want to risk disappointment. Poor customer service and how can any one have any confidence with them. They did send me a code for $50.00 off my next trip with them which is of no value as I personally will never attempt to use their unreliable service in the future. Far too risky. As a former (7 year Major Airline Employee), their conduct is completely unacceptable.

### "it’s not worth the stress"
Do not fly this airline. First off, I booked a flight for 3:30 pm, and when it got to the day, it said the flight was at 12:05, but they didn’t send any type of email saying it was delayed, so I had to call them and confirm it was at 3:30. I finally get to the airport and it is delayed even further. Most of the people there were waiting since 11 am when they were instructed it was a noon flight. Terrible communication to relay to passengers. On the flight back from Abbotsford bo email was sent saying it was delayed until midnight when it was a noon flight also. They were literally no help in trying to help accomodate people to try and get home, instead they told us to come back at 11 pm when we can board. No thanks. Never flying flair again and it’s not worth the stress whether or not the plane will show up

### "wait more than 8 hrs"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford via Calgary. Worst airline traveled ever with. I have to wait more than 8 hrs in Calgary. They didn't gave any appropriate prior notice for the delay and no compensation at all. I will never travel with this airline in future and will not recommend.

### "causes very real problems"
Winnipeg to Vancouver. This airline is too small to operate. The customer service line is not 24/7 and this causes very real problems. I had a flight scheduled for 8:10 am departure time. At 12:19 am that day, less than 8 hours before take-off at a time that any normal person would be asleep, they sent a delay and reschedule e-mail with an itinerary. The itinerary was impossible - requiring a 13-hour delay in departure time from Winnipeg to Edmonton at 2100 to catch a connecting flight that departed at 10:25 am, 12 hours before I would arrive at the airport. The reschedule also changed airports from Vancouver to Abbotsford, an unacceptable change for the ridiculous and uncertain delay. It should have been to the same city, at least.

### "unorganized, confused,"
This airline is an absolute nightmare. I booked a return flight with the wrong date, and called to cancel. I was told that since I called to cancel within 24 hours that I would receive a full refund within 10-15 business days. I booked another return flight for the correct days, and there were no real issues with that flight. The in-flight food offerings aren't really appetizing at all, but the staff were friendly. The aircraft was not at all clean, and the seats and aircraft as a whole were showing their age and wear. A couple weeks later I booked one way flight with Flair. Due to some meetings being shuffled around, I called to inquire about changing the date. I was told the fee for changing the flight was as much as the flight itself cost. I also inquired about cancellation, but was told I would forfeit my payment and my seat on the flight. I told them I didn't wish to transfer or cancel. I showed up to the one way flight and at check-in I was told that my ticket had been cancelled. I was told I could purchase a ticket for that flight at almost twice what I had paid originally. I opted not to fly. I called customer service and was told I had asked to cancel it. They told me they would call me back after they reviewed the call. I called back a few hours later and had been told that it had been reviewed and that I had asked for it to be cancelled. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and they denied to let me speak to one. I asked to hear the recording (so that if I was wrong, I could leave it.) and was denied. I decided to look into the first flight, and saw it still hadn't been refunded. I called Flair again and was told it would not be refunded because the cancellation had been requested within 7 days of the date of the flight. I had booked the flight originally within 7 days, so that checks out. The issue here is that I did have cancellation insurance, but I did not file a claim since Flair said that they would be refunding me. Now I have to fight the agents because of the mistake that Flair made in telling me that they would be able to refund me. This airline is a mess. I wouldn't fly with them again under any circumstance, and I would advise others to avoid them as well. The customer service agents are unorganized, confused, and frankly very rude.

### "experience was terrible"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. My experience with Flair Airlines was terrible. They had delayed the flight going there and back by 2 hours and more. My baggage was lost for 7 days, I was staying in Winnipeg for 8 days and had received my luggage the day before my departure home. Horrible experience, I've learned to not fly with them. I also emailed Flair many times during my stay and called them over 10 times and I've either been told that they cannot assist me or I've received no reply. Once I had gone into the airport to directly resolve the problem, I was told that Flair does not have a baggage scanner, therefore, they are unaware where my baggage is. I am still struggling to get a reimbursement from Flair from all the items I've had to purchase as a result of no baggage. My ticket price was around $500 and was not cheap to begin with, you're better off going with West-Jet or Swoop for a much cheaper price with extremely incomparably better service.

### "never fly Flair Airlines again"
Edmonton to Toronto. I had a flight leaving Edmonton airport which I booked last minute due to the sudden death of my Nana. I had booked two seats for my bf and I with one checked bag between the two of us. We made it to the airport on time however with the shuttle wait we were cutting it close. As we arrived to the baggage line to check our bags, the staff told us that the belt shuts down at 4:00 and there was nothing that they could do for us. The time was 4:03 and after letting the staff know that I am going to a funeral and need to get my bag on that plane (as my luggage was filled with memories photos etc and we were 3 minutes after 4 -Surely they can show some compassion!) The staff then got the supervisor and she was absolutely no help. She kept saying that it was policy and there was absolutely nothing she could do. But as customers we've paid for that checked bag and I have never had an issue on any other airline. Even at busier airports- they usually have options and compassion and solutions. Flair did not! All she suggested was to make a carry on with what was most important or book a flight tomorrow. I was super frustrated and emotional and could not stop crying. This lady wasted 20 minutes of our time arguing instead of trying to help her customers like a reasonable person would do. My sister is a flight attendant and I had called her for help on what to do. She said they should be able to walk the luggage and stow it where the wheelchairs and strollers go. After making this suggestion the lady got aggressive saying they're a different airline and theres nothing she can do. After a half hour of this nonsense she gave my boyfriend a garbage bag to make a carry on and suggested he leave with the luggage and can get on a flight the following day. I was distraught thinking "now I have to go through this alone? After leaving my luggage at the airport and only bringing a pair of pjs and my funeral outfit, we made it through security together and onto the plane within 10 minutes. And once we were on the plane it didn't take off for another 10. Plenty of time to get my bag on the flight. Sitting on the plane I was clearly upset. All I could think of was what I had in my bag and how it wont be making it to my hometown with me. A flight attendant  approached me to ask if I was okay and what had exactly happened. After explaining the situation he was shocked. He could not believe how ignorant this supervisor was. He even asked why she didnt stow it underneath just like my sister had suggested. Or suggested to send the luggage on the flight after. The flight crew was very nice and understanding and comped a drink and food for our troubles. They even kept checking on me assuring me that I was treated wrong and they would make the flight a better experience. I was very thankful for that however knowing that she was in the wrong and I was basically being picked on during this sensitive time was frustrating and unacceptable. I wasnt able to get a refund for my checked bag either. They also would not give me her name to make a complaint on my experience. I will never fly Flair Airlines again.

### "surpassed my expectations"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Vancouver. I was greeted by friendly people at check in. My flight was on time, the on-flight drinks and food were cheaper than any other airline I’ve been on and we arrived 40 minutes ahead of schedule. I understand that some people have bad experiences with airlines, and upon reading the reviews I was very nervous about my trip. However, I think someone should give Flair the credit they deserve. They surpassed my expectations and have far surpassed the service on other airlines I’ve been on.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Edmonton to Mesa with Flair Airlines. Do not fly with this airline. They will cancel your flight without notice or less common just move it. They will not get you a replacement flight. They will refund your ticket price and give you a $50 voucher for future flights with them but it is going to cost you hundreds or thousands extra to get a flight with no notice on another airlines, if at all possible. Of course if your flight is on a holiday and you need to book with no notice after they cancel at the last minute you won't find a flight and your holiday is gone as well as any rooms and activities you booked that are not refundable. It is not worth the price difference when using this airline and this is common practice for them and they have no remorse.

### "friendly and informative"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver via Edmonton. 30%-40% cheaper compared to Westjet and Air-Canada. Has a bit of delay but that is winter flying (mother nature) so nothing to do with Flair. Crew are friendly and informative.

### "Never again Flair!"
Calgary to Winnipeg. Avoid this airline - they are cheap for a reason. I gave them a second chance after an 8 hour delay the first time I flew with them and this is what happened on my second trip. After about 30 minutes in the air we turned back for an emergency landing due to the smell of smoke in the cabin (pilot announced it had an electrical smell to it). Fire and emergency vehicles welcoming us in the runway and escorted us to the gate. We deplaned and waited in the terminal for answers. Kept being told by staff “give us 10 minutes” for an update but, they just kept putting us off & were given little Information .. just a lot of “I don’t know.” Finally overheard that our plane was not fixable but, a new plane was in the Calgary hangar .. except there was no crew. They apparently searched for a crew - with no luck - and our new plane never arrived. We were told 4 hours later (more than 5 hours after our original departure time) that our flight was cancelled. They scrambled to book hotels & told us that Flair would rebook us and send an email with the flight details. We could not contact Flair customer service, as they were already closed for the evening. The email never came. I called Flair the next morning & they had not rebooked me but, managed to get me on a flight, with Flair for that day. I arrived at the airport only to find out my flight was already delayed for 6 hours. I called Flair and received a refund so I could book a flight home with Westjet. I didn’t care that it was $300 more .. it was well worth it. Never again Flair!

### "disappointing customer service"
Not Verified |  This was our families first and last time ever booking with Flair Airlines. We booked our flight from Edmonton to Kelowna for March 8th back in January for a couples weekend away. On March 2nd we received an email saying that due to scheduling changes they moved our flight a day ahead to March 7th. Unfortunately due to work commitments and child care arrangements myself and my husband did not have the flexibility to fly a day ahead. Flair were unable to book us another flight on the day of our scheduled departure or the day after and refused to consider booking us on another airline. Although they did offer us a refund, at that short notice it did not come close to covering the cost to fly on our own with another airline. Very disappointing customer service and lack of regard for customers travel plans.

### "horrible customer service"
Toronto to Edmonton. Lost my luggage and it's been three days now, they still have no clue where it is and have horrible customer service. It's like they don't care. What ever you do, no matter how much money you save flying with these guys I suggest you don't do it. They're horrible.

### "cancelled that flight"
Edmonton to Phoenix. I am writing this review for my mother. My sister-in-law booked her to fly out of Edmonton, Saturday, March 9. About three weeks before the flight, FlairAir decided they didn't sell enough tickets so cancelled that flight. Of course, they never notified anyone. We just happened to see the news one night that talked about how flights were cancelled without notification. So we checked. Sure enough, her flight was cancelled. So my sister-in-law booked another flight the next day as that was the earliest she could now fly out. She was going to lose one day of her trip. Now it is about one week before the new booked flight. Just got a notification from my sister-in-law. They cancelled the new time on the flight. Now my mother has to fly out at 8 in the morning instead of 3:30 in the afternoon. That might work out fine if we lived in Edmonton but we live an hour and a half away. Now, I have to pick her up at 4:30 in the morning in order to get to the airport 2 hours before departure. Either that or she has to pay for a hotel at the airport. And there is still a week to go before the new booked flight. Who knows if that one will be changed as well.

### "a super discount airline"
Edmonton to Phoenix. Flair is a super discount airline. First time we’ve used it, we booked our Feb trip about 4 months previously. Price was pretty good, but I continued to monitor the prices and this flight just went up & up, to approximately double what we paid. You pay for all baggage including carry-on, but you do get to have a personal bag (purse or computer bag) that fits under the seat. The seats do not recline. They have a little bit of snack food available to purchase on the plane, but it’s like Pringles and Goldfish crackers. Best to bring your own snacks if you want something more substantial. Both directions, they had to move a bunch of people up to the front of the plane to even out the load. All in all, not a bad flight, but without the reclining sears I really wouldn’t want to take a much longer trip than the 3 hours to AZA. Not particularly comfortable.

### "no customer service"
Calgary to Winnipeg. We were flying first time on Flair yesterday. Worst airline ever. Flight was cancelled after whole day at the airport. Kept telling us its delayed and then eventually its cancelled. They had no crew to take us. Plane had mechanical issues. And this is second day, Flair hasn't rebooked Our flights yet. Seriously how come you can stay in business if you have rude staff, no customer service, broken planes, no crew and no access via phone to speak with someone at Flair. Thank you for not even flying us at our destination.

### "charge you for your carry on"
Winnipeg to Toronto. Out of 3 Trips with Flair airlines, 2 were delayed because of maintenance issues. They uses old used airplanes which are not reliable and not comfortable too. They charge you for your carry on (7kg) luggage bag then your check in bag. Avoid flair air by selecting others by paying few extra bucks.

### "Do not fly with Flair"
Toronto to Vancouver. I got to the airport for my flight and was told that my 7 am flight got delayed to 3:45. The attendant told me that a good option if I wanted to get back home earlier would be to get my flight refunded and just go with another airline as my refunded amount would cover the cost. I got refunded $200.85, and went to another airline to find out the flight would cost $1900, so I went back to flair to stay with my original ticket 30 mins later only to find out I have to pay another $515.95. This is not only very frustrating as I have now gone around the whole airport for no benefit, actually costing me another $315 because of their employee. On top of that amount I also had to get a $50 cab to the airport thinking my flight was still at 7 because public transit opens at 5 and I was told to be at the airport at 5. And further, now I have to get a hotel because I won’t be able to catch transportation until the next morning which is another $150. Flair Air as costed me an extra $500 to my trip. Customer service at the terminal and over the phone has been awful. They claim that because of their policy they can not refund me the difference of the charge. Do not fly with Flair.

### "extra $73 for a carry on"
Edmonton to Toronto. I probably won’t ever fly with Flair again. I saved $0. I may have even spent more than if I would’ve flown with WestJet or Air Canada. Not impressed. I specifically bought and under-seat bag to carry valuable work equipment in. They double checked it at the gate and made me pay an extra $35 each way for the bag because they thought it was too big, making it an extra $73 total for a carry on stowed bag which should’ve been free. I got on the plane, and it sure enough did fit under the seat with plenty of foot space and room. I was not impressed.

### Flair Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver. I am so impressed with your agents and flight attendants. Trying to make arrangements was on was a challenge both coming and returning but your people definitely made up for it. The price was great and the comfort level was fine. The flight was comfortable. But the people were great. Especially on my return flight. I will definitely use Flair Air again.

### "flights have been cancelled"
Edmonton to Orlando. After seeing a news article that Flair was cancelling flights because they can't continue on to "just to keep customers happy", I called in and waited 2.5 hours on hold to find out yes both flights have been cancelled. Apparently they were calling everyone , didn't get a call or an email. Refund promised in 7 to 10 days? Weird it didn't take 7 to 10 days to pay for. No solution or help was offered. Do not risk time and a headache free travel for a cheaper flight. It will cost you in the end. I will be flying WestJet for now on. I always have. Its quite ironic that I book with a company who re-brands themselves as "refreshingly honest". Refreshingly honest your flights will not be cancelled and we will state we will be calling and also helping you out for a new solution. After still not receiving any phone call or email to confirm the cancellation, I phoned back to inquire about the assistance Flair claimed to be provided. The call center lady said they are not able to do that because they are only a call center. I then asked speak to the actual owners and I was told that they don't even know who that is or how to contact them.

### "avoid this airline"
Toronto to Miami. I checked my booking online the night before my flight to Miami and found out that my flight back to Toronto had been cancelled. I was quite surprised as I had not received any notification from the airline so I called their customer center. Their customer representative barely apologized, said the flight had been "for personal reasons" (whatever that means). He told me I only had two choices: I could either ask for a refund or book the next Flair Air flight from Toronto to Miami (which was a week later than my original return date!). So I asked for a refund and booked my flight home with another airline. I later finally received the cancellation notification from Flair Air which was stating that a travel agency would contact me to arrange a replacement flight with another airline at no cost. That agency contacted me but as I had already asked for a refund, I was told I could not get take advantage of that offer. I would advise you to avoid this airline. You think you are saving money but you don't know the problems you'll have to face and the extra money you'll have to pay eventually. The only positive thing was the service of the crew onboard but they were actually from a Czech airline that Flair Air contracts.

### "Can’t say I’d book again"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Calgary. First time flyer. Flight delayed 8.5 hrs, no given reason. Lots of long faces around here. Vacation negatively impacted, less fun and more cost. Can’t get my rental car, do activities today, or get to the ski hill tomorrow thanks to this blunder. To top it off it was $90 to pack my bag and snowboard. Can’t say I’d book again.

### "definitely fly Flair Air again"
Toronto to Calgary via Winnipeg. My family had a wonderful experience with Flair Air. Despite snow falling in Toronto, the plane left on time to Calgary. Staff were friendly, lots of leg room, no problems checking in and no problems with our luggage. Flying back to Toronto from Calgary a week later went just as well. Again, cold snowy weather did not cause any delays. We packed food for the flight and downloaded Netflix movies on our devices. No need for on-flight entertainment. We will definitely fly Flair Air again.

### "Highly recommend Flair"
Toronto to Calgary via Winnipeg. A great experience from start to finish. All legs of my flight from Toronto to Calgary were not only on time - they were early. All the staff were super friendly, helpful and professional. They took safety more seriously than other airlines I have been on as well. The planes were all clean and there was a good range of snacks and drinks for purchase on each flight. Seats were leather and very comfortable and there was plenty of legroom. The only (minor) gripe I have is the shuttle bus you have to take to a far away gate at Toronto airport, but that is a small price to pay for the huge savings compared to what the other airlines wanted to charge me for this trip. Highly recommend Flair - give them a try!

### "Most bizarre experience"
Most bizarre experience ever: My father and I were booked on F8766 on 19 February Phoenix/Mesa Edmonton. Not only was the flight two hours late to depart (10 pm) but there was a sudden, unscheduled stop in Palm Springs which none of the passengers knew about until it suddenly landed. It was unbelievable. People were in shock. When we asked why the stop, the airline crew said they had to pick up passengers who had been stuck there since 7.30 am. People blurted out 'is this a bus?'. This incident with the protracted flying time and uncertainty, threw my father (who was turning 90 two days later) into a state of anxiety which only increased as the plane sat on the tarmac for hours, further delayed by an elderly passenger who soon after boarding, had a sudden medical condition (probably from having had to wait at the Palm Springs airport for most of the day due to another Flair mess up). We finally arrived in Edmonton to minus 20 degree temperatures at 5 am. My father was extremely anxious the whole time, and has remained so ruining his 90th birthday party, which I flew to Canada for from my home in Sri Lanka. I am now delaying my stay in Edmonton to care for him as such, when I requested the airline today to cover my flight change, they gave the lamest, poorest excuse I have ever heard, that the diversion (which was clearly deliberate and sneaky on their part as none of us were advised before or during departure about the Palm Springs diversion) was 'beyond their control' - I wouldn't even call what they said an apology - the minimum expected - nor of course any cost consideration (for me it was the principle to request). I work for the United Nations and as such have been living and travelling internationally, including in many weird places on small airlines, for more than 30 years. But I have never experienced anything of this sort and would not expect this experience in Canada, my home country. I had welcomed a low cost airline option in Canada which was long overdue but it is not worth it - certainly not at this kind of cost to people's health and wellness.

### "100% recommending them "
Toronto to Vancouver. I was really skeptical with having to take Flair Airline for my birthday trip from Toronto to Vancouver (heading to Whistler.) After reading a ton of reviews I took the leap and my husband and I flew with Flair Airlines. Amazing experience! We got to the airport - checked in, boarding passes printed prior to service, bought baggage ahead of time as well. (This alone saves you ($20 for printing boarding passes at home, $140 buying baggage ahead.) READ THE FINE PRINT even in the emails they state to buy baggage ahead half the reviews on this site is how they charge for baggage! It isn't that bad my husband and I brought 1 carry on, 1 personal item and 1 checked bag. All in round trip no hidden fees was around ($830) WHICH IS A STEAL ! ! As for the flight itself the staff were friendly, very knowledgeable. We had a 40 minute layover in Edmonton to allow people who were flying to Edmonton to get off and the people flying from Edmonton to Vancouver. So efficient and quickly done WE LANDED 40 MINUTES EARLY!! The price of food is relatively good (we brought our own snacks) but bought 2 Tall boys of Heineken for $16.00 ! I could not have had a better experience with them. I will 100% be recommending them to friends and family. So pleased to know we have a trusted airline in Canada to fly!

### "a great trip especially for the price"
We booked a 1 week return trip to Palm Springs to go visit my parents and the Flair trip was really good. (Especially since for my wife and I it only cost $500, where as WJ was $1600). We left at 1:45pm on Saturday on time, the check in staff were very friendly and helpful and the flight attendants were as well. The plane wasn't very full so we had an entire row to ourselves. The plane left on time and the seats were very comfortable with almost a little more legroom than WJ or AC (We were in row 4). Landed in Palm Springs and our bags came out in no time. The return trip was 1 hour delayed due to weather in Edmonton (the inbound flight). The airport staff kept us updated and boarded us as soon as they were able. The inflight crew was great again and so were the seats. Again we had an entire row to ourselves and so it was a great flight north. Once we arrived we only waited maybe 2-3 min before our bags came down the belt in customs. I have to say that since you have to pay for overhead bin space and not many people did as you could easily just put it under your seat, the boarding and deplaning was way faster than WJ or AC. All in all a great trip especially for the price. When you go on a super budget discount airline you can't expect much and I was impressed overall by the experience. I will fly Flair again. I know there is a lot of bad reviews, but like any airline it depends on the day and whats happening with the weather. Good job Flair! I was impressed!

### "inexperienced crews"
Edmonton to Palm Springs. Terrible flight. We were suppose to land in Palm Springs only to be diverted to Las Vegas because the pilot was not experienced enough to land in low cloud or raining condition. Then we had to ride a bus for 5 hours from Las Vegas go Palm Springs airport. Not a word from an airline representative, not even a complimentary meal along the way. Lessoned learned is you get what you pay for. Cheap flights = cheap airline = inexperienced crews

### "Horrible experience"
Toronto to Vancouver. February 9, 2019. Flight out of Toronto was scheduled to depart for 7am, with boarding at 06h15. At 7am we still had not boarded and had not received any announcements fro the gate crew. A few minutes after 7am, the gate crew announced “unscheduled maintenance of the plane, we will update you every 15 minutes”. Two and a half hours later they were still repeating the same message and they still provided no information regarding the nature of the problem, any approximate time when we could expect the flight to be leaving, whether the flight would be cancelled, if we should make other arrangements, nothing. The gate crew knew nothing, they didn’t know what the issue on the plane was. They could not provide any number to call for updates or any help. I called the customer service number from the website and they told me according to their systems the plane was still showing as scheduled to depart at 7am, this was at 10am! Through customer service I had my flight cancelled, and rebooked with Westjet at a large extra cost with their next available flight at 4pm. On the phone again with Flair customer service, the agent said their policy is to not provide money for flights rebooked with other airlines. She said they have a new plane arriving and leaving at 12 noon (this is 5 hours past the scheduled departure time). As we waited for our Westjet flight, we watched the flight information board to see if the Flair flight would in fact leave at 12 noon. At almost 1230pm the flight board updates to say the Flair flight is now delayed till 2pm (7 hours past scheduled departure). A few minutes after 2pm, the flight info board showed that the flight had been cancelled. On the phone with Customer Service with Flair, I was told by customer service they don’t have a complaints department and she had no idea if or when anyone from the company would respond to my complaint. In fact the woman was quite antagonistic, there was no feeling of them trying to help me at all. A couple days later, I called back to Flair customer service to see if they could provide some refund for the extra 800$ we had to spend to leave the airport that day and they said they will not provide a refund. The only option they provide is to book the next flight with Flair Air. In this case, that flight was leaving at 07h00 the next day, but we didnt have anywhere to stay and didnt want to take the chance of another 7 hour delay and cancellation with this airline. Horrible experience.

### "never fly Flair Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Winnipeg via Edmonton. Well we had a great week. Snagged a great deal for a week in Las Vegas and took it. On the way to Las Vegas we had a scheduled layover in Edmonton that ended longer than expected. Flair Airlines had initially informed us that it was a crew rest issue, then it was that they were waiting for a co-pilot and the stories kept changing. Initially our flight was to be a direct flight from Winnipeg to Las Vegas and return but 11 days before departure they notified us that we would be going to Edmonton due to a change in the winter schedule (only to find out that they had not sold as many seats as expected). The layover of 3 hrs ended up being 5 hrs plus. Arrival at the Macarran International Airport was just as chaotic. The flight crew didn't say anything and the gate crew only mentioned that we could pick up our luggage at carousel 25, no terminal number or which shuttle to take. Many of the passengers including us ended at the wrong location and had to back track. Now for the return flight, this is where it really got frustrating. Prior to packing and leaving we get an email that there would be a 1.5 hr delay. It was assured that the connecting flight would be held for us. This was again stated very clearly at the gate that we would have our connection flight to Winnipeg waiting for us. Again every excuse about the delay. From what was conveyed to some travellers was that there were about 45 passengers connecting. Keep this in mind that there were 45 passengers deplaning, having to do a 5 minute walk to the customs hall, clear customs, wait at the wrong carousel that the agents had announced though it was minor, to exit customs and lug our baggage to the Flair counter who appeared to be unaware of our situation (in retrospect their doe eyed response most likely due to the plane preparing to leave without us), to then just clear screening to have final call be announced. That was just wrong, we had to run to the gate, others contemplated running in their socks from screening to make up time. No one took their time, we didn't even have time to take a washroom break unless you were waiting for your luggage in the customs hall. There were no agent to answer questions at the customs reception, passengers were given the impression that their luggage would be transferred to the connecting flight. I had to inform a select group sitting next to us in Las Vegas that we would have to hump our luggage to the check in counter. They confirmed this with the gate and were also angry that this was not being relayed to the rest of the passengers. The travel was an adventure and an example of how not to succeed in business. After reading other complaints we will never fly Flair Airlines again.

### "My experience was very good"
Abbotsford to Calgary. Just returned home from Calgary after 4 days. I read the reviews for Flair after I already booked . Based on the majority of reviews I was quite concerned i had made a bad choice. My experience was very good. Both segments were on time with regards to departure times.All staff i dealt with were courteous and friendly.. people need to understand this is a low còst carrier , they have the company policy regarding baggage and other services on their internet site. Yes they are rigid about charging for oversized or overweight dags. However, don't complain because you have to pay for things that you may have gotten away with on previous flight . I paid less than half what westjet charges for the same flight. I am sure Flair Air does need to address how they deal with the issues raised by others regarding delays. I am also sure we need Flair to succeed. They are what will keep other airlines from inflating their fares without consequences.

### "The worst airline ever"
Toronto to Miami. The worst airline ever. I would never deal with it. The first flight was delayed due to airline incompetence. And flight back, my family was left at the check in counter with out any assistance from airline. It forced us to miss our flight and book another flight with another airline at a much higher rate .

### "stressful and uncomfortable"
1:30 PM Flight F8-416 from Vancouver to Edmonton. The flight was a little bit late taking off, no big deal. Then when we were almost halfway to Edmonton, the pilot announced that the engine was making funny sounds and that he had turned us around so we could go back to Vancouver to (hopefully) land. There were fire trucks waiting there for us when we landed. When we got off the plane, they made it clear that they had zero idea what was going on. They announced again that they had zero idea what was going on. 4PM: They announced that they would be coming by and handing out beverages to everyone. 5PM: They gave us an update saying they still had no idea what was going on but that a mechanic was looking at the engine. 6PM: I had an important class starting the next morning, so I went up and asked what would happen if they couldn’t get the plane working soon. They said I had to two options: Get a refund from Flair and go book with another airline for $300 more on my own dime. Wait until the next morning for them to figure out a flight arrangement for me. 6:30: I went to WestJet and they said they could not book me a flight until Flair returns my luggage to me. 6:45: I waited in a huge line to talk to Flair to get them to pull my luggage. I asked what happened to the beverage they said they were giving out a voucher instead. I said oh great, I would love one of those. And the man told me I would have to go wait in ANOTHER lineup of 40-50 people, even though the vouchers were sitting there right beside him. 7PM: They announced that the flight was indeed cancelled as the engine was deemed unfit for flying. Good thing I already got a seat booked with WestJet, but I had to run to the luggage carousel, grab my stuff, and go back through security again, barely making it on my new flight. I realize some things are out of everyone’s control, but there are a couple things here that really irritated me about this situation, and about Flair:  It seems that over half of their flights have some serious technical issue that prevents take-off, or landing at the desired airport. They do absolutely nothing to compensate their clients for serious inconveniences such as this. I didn’t even get the drink they promised me. They don’t have backup planes, so if the plane is screwed, you’re screwed. They seem to get away with charging people ridiculous amounts of money for a CARRY-ON. Plus they put a weight restriction on a personal item. They just really want to make your flight as stressful and uncomfortable as they possibly can. The guy didn’t even want to give me my full refund because I booked through a third party. I looked at him square in the eye and told him that he was going to give me every last penny that I paid for the flight, including bag fees, and he finally agreed to give me the refund. They kept lying through the whole thing and emailing out new itineraries saying the flight would depart at a later time, for example 6PM, when they knew darn well that was simply not true. They sent that out right after they said they had no idea when or if the mechanic would be able to fix it.

### "Couldn’t get more frustrating"
Toronto to Vancouver. Couldn’t get more frustrating sitting at the boarding gate for almost 4 hours. No regular communication with delay updates to the passengers.  Mechanical Issues” was their only disclosure. The costs are hidden and the quality couldn’t get shabbier.

### "horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Winnipeg. Absolutely horrible experience. On the night before the flight we received an email from Flair advising that the flight would be delayed by 3 hours. Then a few hours later we recieved another email saying nevermind and that the flight was on track. On the day of the flight, we were held in the plane for nearly 3 hours without being told what was happening. When asking what was going on the staff just said that they were waiting for instruction from the captain. However, instead of speaking with us to calm the situation they were on their phones and laughing with each other while we were all stressed, worried, and confused about what was going on. After a significant amount of time we finally started moving and then as the plane looked like it was about to take off on the run way it just stopped sudden. And the pilot then told us that the plane was not operational. We sat again frustrated and confused for about an hour asking for them to let us off but they refused. Once they finally let us off, we had to wait another hour before they told us the flight was delayed. During all this time we were given no food and no water. After almost 2 hours they decided to give us a $10 meal voucher which wasn't accepted at certain restaurants. It wasn't long until they told us the flight was cancelled and we were then instructed to grab our checked bags at the baggage claim. There we received accomodation at different hotels and were told that he next flight would be at 5am the next morning. By the time we reached the hotel and after an hour long wait to check in due to the rush of the hotel manager getting the rooms ready, we weren't checked in until after 10pm. Since the shuttle didn't run until 5am we had to get an Uber to the airport. At 11pm we received another email saying the flight was delayed until 7:15am. Some chose to just stay at the airport overnight since the flight was so early. While waiting we then found out the flight was delayed again until 7:35am. The plane did not leave until around 8am. Never flying with this company again and would recommend.

### "Terrible customer services"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Edmonton. Terrible experience flight. F416 was delayed more than 8 hours from Vancouver to Edmonton. Terrible customer services - staff at the waiting area kept suggesting us to sing birthday song, have a drum and gymnastics party. It affected people who really wanted to sit and rest. She also suggested us to gather upfront partying. What about the baggage left behind? Should security and safety be the first concern within the security area? Should the staff be more professional in managing this kind of situation?

### "went above and beyond"
These guys were amazing. I had to take a sudden flight out to Calgary from Vancouver due to family death. I had a hard time containing my emotions or even thanking the staff as I flew with them. However, the staff went above and beyond what was expected of them. I regret not being able to thank everyone of them on flight F8138 from YVR to YYC on feb 8th 12ppm flight. Thank you friends, continue exactly this. I’m amazed and so incredibly thankful.

### "3.5 hours late"
Kelowna to Edmonton. Best punishment for losing a fantasy football league would be a trip with Flair Airlines. Only 3.5 hours late. Doesn’t have the ability to communicate with third party booking companies (Expedia, Travelocity etc.) booked via one of them and had no ticket upon my arrival at the gate and had to pay double my round trip rate for a one way flight. Don’t even want to get into the fiasco of having two extra people on the plane when it was just their computer malfunction. (1.5 hour delay).

### "Horrible customer service"
Edmonton to Orlando. Flown with Flair in two return journeys. Both times flights were over an hour delayed in all directions with zero communication to the passengers. Extra hidden charges everywhere that make it no cheaper then Air Canada or West Jet. Horrible customer service (they’re numb to hearing complaints because they hear them so often). Do yourself a favour and book elsewhere. I would never use them again.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Vancouver to Toronto. On Jan 8th I flew with Flair Air from Winnipeg to Miami. The flight was scheduled for 9 am departure. They had mechanical problems and informed us during the day we would be leaving within an hour. We departed at 7 pm. I was 12 hours in WPG Airport. When we arrived in Miami they flew into domestic instead of international and when we got off the plane we all went to the luggage carousal. 3 Custom officers came to us took our passports and lined us up against a wall. We had to follow them to customs as we were in USA illegally. This was midnight and they detained us until 3 am. At 3 am I went to get my luggage and it was not there. I waited until 3:30 am no bag so I had to take a shuttle to pick up rental vehicle or it would have auto deleted my car rental booking . I got car drove back to airport by 4:30 am to get my bag. No bag so I walked the airport looking for Flair air employees. They all had gone home and wouldn't be back until 7 am. I waited until 7 am as I had a 2 hour drive to the Miami house. At 7 am I was told Flair Air would not be in the airport until 11 am. I drove in my winter boots in Miami to the house - 2 hour drive. Called Flair and they delivered my bag the next day. I went to eat in my winter boots and same clothes I slept in in Miami. They would be giving no refunds I was told, no baggage charge reimbursement and I would get a $100 voucher to fly with them again. Stupidly I was going to Toronto on FEb 3 so I booked Flair for Vancouver to Toronto for $380 including a $31.50 bag fee. They took the $100 voucher off the fare. We got in the air half hour late in Vancouver, departure was 1:45 half way to Edmonton the plane turned around due to problems with one engine. We were met on the tarmac in Vancouver by 4 fire trucks. I was back in Vancouver and they said they would give us an update in an hour. The start of a very long day. I waited until 6 pm and then booked a flight the next day with Air Canada and booked a hotel for the night on my credit card. When I finally got in Toronto the next day I contacted Flair air and then said there would be no compensation for my Toronto flight and no baggage fees refunded as they had booked an alternate flight for me but they did not send me an email to notify me of this. They said the voucher from Miami of $100 would not be reinstated as it had "a one time use". They would not pay for my hotel. They said we apologize - goodbye. I may be out $1000 and I may have been beyond frustrated with this airline. I am a senior and on a fixed income and the money part hurts but hopefully people will decide on another airline. Do not fly this airline, their planes don't appear to be maintained and you will for sure wait a long time and take two days to get to your destination. You will not be compensated for anything

### "do not book Flair Air"
Calgary to Vancouver. I arrived at the Calgary airport at 9:45am (2 hours prior to departure at 11:45am as requested by Flair Air) for a short 1.4 hour flight to Vancouver. At the Flair Air departure desk, I learned that my flight departure would be delayed for 5 hours to 4:45pm. The reason provided: the pilots are sleeping and had not had enough sleep due to Prior day flight delays. At 2pm, I learned from the Flair Air departure desk that my flight would be further delayed an additional 3.5 hours (ie a total of 8.5 hours from the original planned departure) to 8:15pm. Apparently the pilots must have been very tired. Barring any further delay and assuming the flight departs at the currently revised 8:15pm departure, I will have been at the airport for 10.5 hours (2 hr early arrival + 8.5 hr delay) and this is for 1.4 hour flight. I saved $50 by selecting Flair Air over its main competitors (west jet and air canada). If you value your time, do not book Flair Air. This is my first booking with Flair Air and it is also last. I am sure the larger competing air lines have a greater complement of flight personnel to draw upon thus avoiding such delays. As a side note, the Flair Air departure desk staff indicated that they had been on duty for 18 hours (some sleeping over at the Calgary airport) and they were tired and very disappointed and unhappy about the flight delay. Anyway, it seems that Flair Air is run on a shoestring budget and that as a consequence they cope very poorly any unforeseen contingencies. Be forewarned and book your flight accordingly.

### "It was a disaster"
Never fly with Flair Airlines! It was a disaster. On our way to Vegas, our flight was delayed 4 hours. Took away a whole day of our trip. There was no complementary food or anything for the sudden delay. Emails were sent an hour prior saying that “cabin crew needs extra rest”. On our way to Winnipeg from Vegas, we were again delayed for 4 hours. Flair staff did not even know whats happening. It was a very painful process. I feel bad for the infant and kids on board as they had to wait for so long. Again, we weren't offered any compensation for such inconvenience. Not enough staff scheduled for flights. We were supposed to land at 11:45 but didn't actually land till about 3am!

### "Hidden fees"
Edmonton to Orlando. Worst ever! It's a cheap airfare, but yes, everything else is cheap! Unexplained delay! Hidden fees! Rude ground crew. Terrible. I will never fly Flair Airlines again!

### "a whole lot of stress"
Booked a direct flight for cheap to Phoenix to attend a work function. They changed the direct flights to layovers in Edmonton. Needed to book an extra day off work. Received $50 voucher on next flight to be used by June this year. Each flight was delayed a couple times each before we even got to the airport and a couple of times more once we arrived. Both delays affected the connection flight which we were told would not be held for us and that we would be redirected to another airline to arrive at the final destination. Since half the flight was going in the same direction, this was worrisome. Each time we made a mad dash to the gate, stressed through baggage pick up, security and customs, only to board the plane (which did not the other passengers know it was going to be delayed and boarded at the original time) to wait on the tarmac for 2 hours before the plane took off. They ran out of food and the flight attendants hid from everyone. All customers on the flight were irritable and shared their own horror stories. My quick cheap flight ended up by been full day flying and cost me an extra vacation day, missed work events and a whole lot of stress. Not worth the money.

### "would have been faster to drive"
After both flights being delayed 3 hours on the way there and back for an hour flight. They had cancelled planes and set new routes from Vancouver. So they canceled the flight and rerouted. We had a 10$ voucher for food but really this flight should have been refunded. $385 for flight $120 for bags. It would have been same price to fly with west jet and after watching almost 40 west jet planes land we know who to use! Never again flair air we tried to once and I’m going to sign up for west jet rewards today. It would have been faster to drive.

### "delayed for 5 hours"
Toronto to Calgary. First flight was delayed for 3 hours. Return flight back to Calgary delayed for 5 hours. No email what so ever that it's going to be delayed, they usually do email. The website flight status says it's on time. Before we left at 4am it says flight is on time. Then we arrived at 5am at the check in and they said its delay. We checked the website at 6am and it still says it's on time. This airline is a joke and a waste of money and time. The gate number on your ticket is not the same. Doesn't make sense how a Westjet flight at 7am is not delay and this flight at 7am is delayed.

### "advise not booking with Flair"
Vancouver to Toronto via Edmonton. Flown with them twice now, both nightmares. Never cared about airlines before but I really would advise not booking with Flair, even for a leisure trip. It will throw a wrench in your accomodations and itinerary. First time- they pretended to delay our 7am flight from Toronto to Winnipeg. They kept saying "we'll update you in 15 minutes" and "corporate hasn't told us anything". Eventually people caught on that they did not have a backup plan for the plane (which had some sort of mechanical error) and started getting refunds. Horribly- they did not cancel the flight, just kept delaying it. This way they wouldn't have to reimburse for hotels or do the work to book us with another airline. They gave us $10 meal vouchers for the wait. They didn't even work, it looked like they had just printed it themselves and no one officially recognized it. Then when I got my refund and rescheduled, they took 6 hours to give me back my bag. Which was sitting right there the whole time. Me and the other customers were beyond frustrated, we thought we had lost our luggage, and there was no Flair official at Pearson to help us- even though the airport baggage officials called them on the Public Announcer! I had changed to a WestJet flight instead, but ended up missing a couple of those too because I hadn't gotten my luggage back yet. Thankfully Westjet was great and I got to Calgary at 1am that night (after leaving home at 4am). Unfortunately I had already booked a round trip, so I didn't change my return flight home, hoping it would be fine. But I'm sitting here right now after my flight was delayed 1 hour, then we got in and it was delayed further, then we finally got up in the air and they turned back 20 minutes later because of an engine light. Because of their incompetence I was actually scared in an airplane for the first time with all the turbulence. Anyways now they're doing the indefinitely long 15 min updates with no information again. Really frustrating and way too sketchy to justify a flight, even if its at half-price. WestJet all the way now.

### "times may be significantly changed"
Edmonton to Las Vegas. While you will get a good price on your flight with Flair Air, beware and know that there is a probability that your flight times may be significantly changed a week prior to departure. We received and email of a change on the return flight, but no notification of a change on the flight there. If we had not opened our attachment in our travel confirmation we received one week prior to leaving we would have had no idea that our flight changed by 8 hours! When you speak to a customer service agent to complain-they could care less. I asked for someone higher up to call me and have heard nothing.

### "money grab type of airline"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Kelowna. Besides approving my pet travel at the termial then charging me $107.00 at the gate before boarding, they also charged for regular size carry on luggage. If I would have known they charge for regular size, approved by majority of airlines, carry on luggage I would have combined my cases into 1. They are a nickle and dime scheming money grab type of airline. I will pay more to take a professional airline compared to these clowns.

### "I was cheated and lied too"
I was initially excited about flying with Flair Airlines. After an extensive search for a direct flight from Winnipeg to Las Vegas for myself and my 81 year old father, I finally booked Flair (2 months prior) joining extended family for the weekend in Las Vegas. Much to my disappointment, a week before our flight, I received an email from Flair informing me that my flight had been changed, and was told my originally booked flight was no longer available and that I would now be leaving 8 hours sooner on a flight through Edmonton. I live in the country, so to be able to accommodate this new schedule, I was forced to take an extra day off work, travel the night before and pay for a hotel. Flair generously offered a $50 travel voucher! (sarcasm). So, what seemed like a great deal and a great schedule, now became a 2 day travel experience for what should have been a 3hr flight, and indirect costs that will easily exceed what I would have paid for a direct flight with WestJet or Air Canada. The whole flight cancellation seemed fishy to me, so I checked the departure schedule the day before and was able to confirm that the flight I had originally booked was still offered. I also confirmed that the price to fly from Winnipeg to Vegas had more than doubled! Wow, I was cheated and lied too! Flair is the "Donald Trump" of Airlines! Good luck getting me to ever cash in that Generous $50 voucher!

### "had an extremely positive experience"
Calgary, AB to Toronto, ON via Winnipeg, MB. Exactly as advertised. Excellent price - On Time - No issues! I had an extremely positive experience. No bells and whistles airline and over 50% savings verses Air Canada and WestJet. Flight crews were energetic, helpful and very pleasant. Definitely would fly with Flair Airlines again.

### "please advise your customers"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Abbotsford. When the flight is running late please advise your customers that you are sorry for the inconvenience and if there is a consideration given as a token, please do so in a sincere positive manner. there are of course many reasons for delays and a notice at check-in as to the real reason will give your customers a heads up and relieve your personnel of some of the tedious interaction that often results. Its rather difficult when your check-in personnel have to deal first hand with customer dissatisfaction and maintain a positive attitude. and a real nice touch would be a plane that is cleaned and detailed so as to represent an airline that cares.

### "Poor customer service"
Edmonton to Phoenix. Flight was delayed by 7 hours leaving Edmonton. Realize this happens, but given small airline had no alternate aircraft and had to wait from something to fly in. Prepaid for baggage a month early, and then didn't use on of the prepaid. At airport the staff told me they put a note on file and I could call and get refund. Head office informed me that you can't get refund on bags paid for but not used. No warning on website to inform you of this, but I did look again and in the fine print you can change bag count prior to check-in. Remembering the online check-in process I tried to deselect the extra bag, but it did not allow bags to be removed. Any other airline I have ever flown with gives you a refund if you don't use prepaid bag fees. Wasted $70 CDN as a result. Not a big amount, but users need to ensure they don't prepay for baggage when they first book, rather wait until you are checking in online and know exactly what you are bringing. The website will try to get you to prepay when you book the ticket, implying that you miss out on the discount if you don't prepay at that time. For $70 the airline has lost me as a customer. Poor customer service.

### "will never fly with Flair again"
Toronto to Vancouver via Edmonton. On my way to Vancouver in November, we were scheduled to depart at 7am, so we arrived at 5am (Flair has a 2 hour checkin policy even for domestic flights!) and we saw when we arrived that our flight was delayed. Long story short, it wasn't delayed, there was not a Flair airplane in Toronto at all. By 8pm, yes we spent all day sitting on the airport floor!, we were put on an Air Canada flight. We missed our ferry to Vancouver Island so we had to pay for extra accommodations at Vancouver Airport since we couldn't get across the water, not to mention we were exhausted. We were not handled well all day, no information, just waiting and trying not to stress. They tried to get us on a 4pm West Jet flight, but screwed that up. Even though we paid to check bags with Flair, we couldn't get on Air Canada without paying AGAIN to check our bags. The Flair rep on the floor said Flair would refund us for the double charge. But they haven't. On the way home we literally crossed our fingers and were so grateful when our flight left on time. Except on our stopover in Edmonton, we were asked to get off of the plane and sat for an additional 4 hours not knowing if we would be getting back to Ontario that night or not. We arrived in Toronto so late that we had no choice but to stay again. Flair has responded to my emails twice saying: "Thank you for your e-mail and we apologize for the late response. I have escalated the matter however due to the holidays please be advise it can take up to 2 weeks to receive a response. We will contact you once we have received more information. Again, I apologize for this inconvenience. Thank you for your message and we apologize for the inconvenience, it shouldn’t take long to our team to reach out regarding your flight delay. Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience caused. But I have emailed them eight times. I have upgraded my credit card to include flight delay and cancellation insurance, but I will never fly with Flair again regardless, and I don't think any of you should either. I hate to wish a company ill, but this is not a company that deserves to stay in business. I would feel terrible if any of you had a similar experience and I didn't warn you. I'm letting it go now. I'm just flabbergasted that a company could care so little about customers. Maybe I'm naive. I'm a small business owner and I screw up sometimes, I miss emails or make mistakes. I take my owning, apologizing and making it right very seriously.

### "a terrible company to fly with"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. Flair Airlines is a terrible company to fly with. They changed my parents flight on them at the last minute. They booked a flight from Edmonton to Abbotsford. The morning of travel Flair Airlines changed the flight times to leave 30 mins earlier and they changed the destination to Vancouver. They notified us via email. They offered no compensation for increased costs associated to the change in destination. Nor did they offer any compensation for the inconvenience. It was a nightmare to change all the rentals etc to Vancouver. Thankfully Hertz Car Rental company is understanding of the situation and worked with us to change the rental pickup. Saves us the $150 taxi ride. Never flying with Flair again.

### "5 out of 5 for their service"
My wife and I flew Flair Airlines from Vancouver to Toronto in September 2018. When we arrived in Toronto and collected our luggage, we discovered a pocket has been ripped off my wife's roll-along. When we returned to Vancouver 3 weeks later, we put in a damage claim. Flair was very reasonable about compensation for the damage even though they state on their website a claim must be made with 7 days of the damage or loss occurring. As we were on the road for 3 weeks, we could not do this. I sent photos of the damage and at their suggestion a quote for repairs and quotes for a new case. Though it did take them over 4 weeks to pay the claim they did so with good grace. Having dealt with this type of issue a number of times over the years with different airlines with very different results, I give Flair a 5 out of 5 for their service.

### "I recommend Flair Air"
Phoenix to Edmonton. Booking our flights online was easy as the website is straightforward. Online check in was effortless as well. The price was great; total cost round trip per person with seat selection (first row seating) and checked baggage (2) and all taxes and fees was $280.00. Other airlines were charging double or triple this amount for the same dates. Both flights were on time; counter staff were pleasant and efficient; and the flight crew were professional, welcoming and humorous. I recommend Flair Air and suggest you don’t base your opinion of this airline on a few negative reviews. Remember that some people create their own problems.

### "gate agents should be trained"
Edmonton to Vancouver. I took the outbound flight (YVR-YEG) On Friday Jan 11 and we were delayed an hour due to a light out in the flight deck. This morning I show up at the airport for a 10:25a departure F8415 from YEG to YVR. The flight comes in from Toronto and disembarks. Gate agents are reading prepared announcements on cards (poorly). They advise us that our flight is delayed due to unscheduled maintenance. They'll let us know in 15 minutes what's going on. 15 minutes later they read the same prepared announcements. This happens two more times. Then they announce a gate change and the delay has gone from 10:25 to 10:55 to 2pm. Yes my flight was $108 all in. Yes I expect minor inconveniences. But gate agents should be trained in how to deal with issues like this. There were a lot of upset passengers. Flair Airlines provided little information for both flights I took Of the almost 2 flights with Flair, 100% of them had issues.

### "for the price we are very happy"
Vancouver to Calgary. Overall for the price we are very happy that we chose to fly Flair. Everything was very easy and simple. The only couple small issues were we had some trouble checking in with our laptop on the way there, but worked no problem with our smart phone and the way back we had no problems using a computer. There was also a 2 hour delay for our flight to Calgary which is hard with 2 young kids. But the way back they actually left 10 mins early and we got back to Vancouver 15 mins ahead of schedule which was amazing! The staff was wonderful with everything! They were super friendly and let our son (1st flight!) take pictures with the pilot and see the cockpit. One attendant gave our son some free snacks on the way home and was chatting with him alot, made him feel very special. We had paid for our checked bags online and there was no issues, some reviews we read said they charged extra even for people that already paid online, but we had no problems. They were amazing with the priority boarding for us (we had 2 kids and a stroller). The leg room was slightly less than other airlines but wasn't too bad especially for such a short flight. No provided snacks or drinks but that was fine, we brought a bunch of our own. I would definitely fly Flair again and recommend it to others. It was the friendliest service I have ever had with any airline.

### "I was extremely happy"
Abbotsford to Calgary. For the money I paid, I was extremely happy. The ground staff in Abbotsford were direct, and attentive. The flight attendants on both ways were helpful and pleasant. The ground staff in Calgary however, seemed a tad unorganized and seemed not to care. Plane was old, but it got us from A to B. Bring snacks, and some movies and you’ll be fine! For the price and convenience of flying out of Abbotsford, I would fly this airline again. An average sized backpack was okay for me to bring on the plane without paying additional fees.

### "hasn't been a great experience"
Toronto to Winnipeg. Flight was delayed three hours because of an issue with their flight plan. They lost my luggage and was told they'd get back to me the next day and they still haven't. I waited for an hour on the line before getting a customer rep who directed me to e-mail them instead. It just hasn't been a great experience. And I had a lot of valuable items in my luggage so this is pretty annoying. I really wouldn't recommend these guys even with their budget prices.

### "extremely polite and friendly"
Edmonton to Miami. Amazing experience. I would love to thank the team for a very professional yet kind individual approach. I am a service dog owner and need my puppy 24/7 around. The staff was understanding and helpful in every step of my journey. Pilots and flight attendants are extremely polite and friendly. The aircraft is nicely maintained and clean. Thank you very much for comfortable flight.

### "suit case was cracked"
Flew with them on Dec 27 to Las Vegas to Edmonton. Pulled out suit case off and it was cracked. Filled out the forms at the airport. Contacted them Dec 31 when we arrived home. Contacted them again Jan 4. Still nothing!

### "Smaller underseat allowance"
Vancouver to Edmonton. Rude gate and check in staff. Always delayed a minimum of 2 hours. No official under seat bag fits in their 6" wide under seat bag checker. Smaller underseat allowance than any other airline, even though you can fit almost 2 of there 6" bags under their seat. Will easily end up costing you more than non budget. Maybe if they flew on time it might be okay but since one flight a day and they therefore have to wait for other flights to move passengers around they are usually a few hours behind by noon.

### "worst customer experience"
Edmonton to Toronto. The worst customer experience. I had checked in through online already, and during the day I was flying, the scanner was not able to capture the checkin details, they had to send me to the counter where i had to wait for an hour (when I didn’t need to), which completely doesn’t make sense especially when you’ve checked in online. Then i had to wait again to pass security. On my way to Toronto via connecting flight, flight was scheduled to take off at 5pm, and it is now 8:30 pm as i am writing this message while on plane, they don’t take care of their customers, they don’t offer anything. Very dissatisfied and i will never ever fly with flair Airlines again!

### "absolute garbage airline"
My partner and I had a 10:25 departure time out of Edmonton to Vancouver. We arrived at our gate and the plane was deemed on-time. The plane arrived 10 minutes late from Toronto. After 30 minutes the gate crew notified everyone that we are delayed boarding due to mechanical issues. Another hour passes and no update other than repeating that are mechanical issues. Another hour passes, we are still delayed because of mechanical issues. We asked the gate crew an estimated time of departure so we could wander for lunch. They said they had no update. And no time frame. We went for lunch 50 feet from our gate and watched the departures screen attentively for an update. The screen continued (after 3 hours) to say the plane was departing at 10:25am. When we returned to the gate 40 minutes later, the plane had left without us. We heard nothing over the intercom. When we approached the front desk, the manager claimed to have called us personally on our cell phones. Neither of us had missed calls or voicemails from Flair Airlines. The manager was smug and lied straight to our face. When we asked about our luggage, they told us that our luggage went to Vancouver on the plane we were not on. They said we could pick up our luggage when we arrive. They transferred us to a flight to Abbotsford that was also suppose to leave at 1030am. It was also delayed due to “mechanical isssues” until 430pm. When we finally reached Abbotsford at 630pm we had to drive an hour to pick up our luggage at Vancouver International. We reached the Flair desk at 8pm. They told us that no one was available to help us. They said we had to wait until 1am for the next flight to arrive before there would be an agent to help us. We spent 300 dollars on a rental car and motel for the evening. More importantly we lost 36 hours of our trip . Flair Airlines are an absolute garbage airline.

### "we had zero issues"
Edmonton to Palm Springs. We had our first trip to Palm Springs with them and we had zero issues. Plane left on time, in fact, 10 minutes early, deiced and we were on our way. Arrived early. Just remember, you only get what you are paying for, so read up and come prepared. It was actually nice to board and deplane in less than 20 minutes, no endless parade of carry on bags, half of the overheads were empty! The plane has a pretty stark appearance, both outside and in, but I'm OK with that. seats do no recline. Just load up your tablet with a movie or two, buy your own bottle of so or water to carry on, and away you go. Flight seemed very "westjetish" at 1/2 the cost.

### "are is very cheap"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Abbotsford. Flair fare is very cheap, I was able to fly to Abbotsford to see my family every 3 months. For passenger knowledge please read and review their policy and charges. First boarding pass, you need to check in online and download it or print your boarding pass for savings. 2nd personal bag is your bag where cellphone, make up fits, a small bag that fit their into their personal sizer, they charge for carry on bags( those bag you put under the seat in front of you). A duffle bag and backpack counts as a carry on if it's full. The only free bag is a personal item! If you pay all your baggage online it's a savings for you. Delays? It happens to all airlines! seriously guys. It happens. Just be thankful that we have now the option of cheap fare. Just please read their policy. In all airlines if it's a 4 hour delays you get a $10 food voucher, (not enough but at least they have something) keep in mind that the airfare you paid has airport terminal charges etc. so if you think of it you only pay like $50 to Flair and if it's delay you get $10, so they just get $40 times how many passenger. I've heard they pay per minute at the airport for delays so I guess they dont earn anything. I am just grateful that Flair helps us to be with our loved ones.

### "Horrible customer service"
Vancouver to Winnipeg. Never flew with Flair Air. Flight was cancelled without any notice. Ended up on Air Canada. Trying to find our way home now. Return flight also cancelled. Does anyone know if Flair Air actually has planes? Worse airline ever. It will be 1 day after our attempt to return home. We are trying to fly WestJet. Do not try and fly with this airline. Horrible customer service. Feel sorry for their employees.

### " did not expect to pay for carry on"
My wife and I had a round trip from Calgary to Vancouver and had a horrible experience facing a very rude behavior of Flair Air staff at the boarding desk on December 28. There was a simple misunderstanding but the staff made a big deal out of it and acted unprofessionally and made flight to have an extra 30 minutes delay (the flight had 2.5 hours delay originally with this extra delay it had 3 hours delay in total). We did not expect to pay for one carry on each. We went from Calgary to Vancouver on December 23 2018 with Flight F8137. There was no announcement regarding paying for carry on and we were not asked if we paid for our carry on or not. Each of us had one carry on and we did not pay for any of them and we got to Vancouver with no issue. Considering this experience we would not imagine we should pay for carry-on on our flight back to Calgary. Vancouver to Calgary the staff asked if we paid for our carry-on then we said no and we mentioned that each of us has only one carry on so why should we pay and we came from Calgary to Vancouver with the same airline and same carry-ons and did not pay. I clearly asked if the rules are changed from Sunday to Friday, the staff could have easily explained that there is a fee for carry on and she could have asked us to pay but instead she decided to punish us by saying that you cannot go and stand by side. My wife a couple of times asked if we can pay now and the flight attendee said "a second" but she basically ignored us and boarded others. Then she said since you did not care about our announcement now you have to pay $80 for each carry on. We told her that considering the fact that we did not pay for carry-ons on our first flight we would not think if the announcement would be applied to us. Also the announcement was not clear to us because they said "if there is unpaid carry-on you can pay now" we thought they meant extra carry-on.

### "tiring and unprofessional"
Edmonton to Vancouver. Still waiting to board as I type this. none of us were updated on the plane, and never added a delay status to it, so the digital status ended up being departed and we weren't told what was going on until 20 minutes after the plane was suppose to leave. We just got a update right now that there is a mechanical issue. This is tiring and unprofessional. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm travelling with a cat so it's already tough enough.

### "nickel and dimes ruined my experience"
Sadly there is no such thing as "low-fare" airlines. It was the matter of nickel and dimes that ruined my experience with Flair Air. The flights were booked by my older brother for our visit. I had no additional funds for add-ons. He informed me that I was allowed two bags free of charge. (This was incorrect but the itinerary shows one included bag twice, causing the confusion.) I boarded the flight in Calgary without issue. We waited longer than usual before take off. If you had headphones in or your nose in a book, you were told to pay attention because a continuously delayed safety demonstration was always about to start. Once in the air I was disappointed to be served only about half a cup of water free of charge and nothing else. These were all minor inconveniences, though. The decision not to fly with Flair again was made on the return home. I approached an agent for my gate number immediately upon arrival at the airport. Instead of answering my question, he told me I was only allowed one bag. Despite my explanation of the confusing itinerary and not having been charged on the previous flight I walked away defeated and began to condense my two bags, including giving away the small Christmas gifts from my brother since I couldnt afford to pay. When I returned to the desk a different agent further explained that that bag itself was still too large and would require a fee regardless. I had given my gift away for nothing. Both agents told me the cheapest solution was to pay online. I wanted to do so at the gate though and it took some pressure for the agent to finally disclose my gate number. When I arrived at the gate I found out the agents were wrong, as I had already checked in online which includes an option for purchase. I was faced with calling customer service or surrendering my bag (or now paying $80 for the bag). Luckily, the agent I spoke to on the phone was wonderfully helpful and pleasant. This included informing me my flight was delayed as Flair doesn't send notifications. After all of that, would I spend an extra hundred dollars or so to fly with an airline with good customer service, included carry-ons, complimentary in-flight snacks and notifications of delayed flights? Absolutely. Would I fly with Flair again? Absolutely not.

### "Brutal communication"
Not Verified | Abbotsford to Edmonton. Apparently I am not the only unhappy customer by the looks of previous reviews. We were flying to Edmonton on Boxing Day and when we arrived at the airport, we found out, via the bulletin board, not an email, that our flight was delayed til 5:30 p.m. for maintenance reasons. Unsure how true that would be. We were given a $10.00 voucher for a meal which barely covered a snack and drink, let alone an actual meal. Then another 2.5 hour delay without noticer. Brutal communication and another delay for unknown reasons. After calling reservations to ask for compensation, they were unable to do anything yet Westjet gave my parter a full refund and still put her on they’re flight. My recommendations to others is fly Westjet, Air Canada or other airlines as Flair Air is a terrible airline. Good luck, you will need it.

### "delay times kept changing"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. There was a 6.5 hour delay and the delay times kept changing and I had to ask the Flair counter to get updates. By not keeping your client informed of the changes just makes people more upset. I understand mechanical issues arise however keeping people informed is key. They won’t be happy however speaking with them makes it better then asking people that don’t even know is a bigger issue.

### "flight from hell"
Winnipeg to Edmonton. Total disaster: We arrived at the Winnipeg International Airport at 7am, ticketed, went through security and boarded by 8:15am for a 8:20am flight. We were then told aircraft would not start so we deplaned and waited as Flair Air kept changing the departure time. To make matters worse they kept changing the story on whether a new airplane would arrive or ours repaired. We finally started to board again at 4:32pm for a 5pm departure. This has been the flight from hell! I will never!! And yes, never is a long time, I will never fly with this airline again!

### "Worst airline ever"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. Worst airline ever, spend the extra money on air Canada or west jet, plane was to leave at 445pm, got delayed till 700pm didn't get on the plane until 1230am, no reason why, awful customer service did offer any consolation for the delay. Theres a reason why they are cheap you definitely get what you pay for, spend the few hundred and get a reliable established airline.

### "fly AC or WestJet"
Not Verified |  Flight out of Calgary to Vancouver scheduled for 7:20am. We arrive to the gate at 5:30am and are told we'll be leaving at 2:30pm if we're lucky. Flair states that operational maintenance is the reason for the long delay. So basically, the plane broke down and we have no idea how long it's going to take to fix. Can't wait to finally board it! Hopefully this airline is out of business by next Christmas. Pay the extra money and fly AC or WestJet, there's a reason why Flair is cheap.

### "Big mistake"
Toronto to Calgary. Haven't even dropped my bags and I already have crossed them off. I typically fly Air Canada but decided to check out the newcomer Flair. Big mistake. Preface: I am a fairly frequent flyer. As a result, I have my ID ready, know the weight limits, wasn't surprised by the charges (purchased the max fare anyway, so everything is included), suitcases all fit in sizers, etc. I am currently sitting in the departures area of Toronto and having not even dropped my bag off, I have already decided that I wish this airline a quick demise. The experience started out with a glitchy website that made checking in require a lot of extra clicks and several attempts. Fine, I can forgive that as they are a newcomer. But their one get out of jail card is gone 24 hours before the flight. Arriving at Toronto Pearson, I had a difficult time finding the Flair desk because they are so cheap that they don't even splurge on a sign. Numerous passengers for the flight had to ask for directions to where Flair was after marching up and down the departure hall in futility. In addition, they seem to only check in one flight at a time. After waiting in line for a while (as they don't have fast bag drop, automated ticket printers, or anything else really), I was told to come back later for when they were done with all the passengers for the other plane. Went back after the line had cleared and at the time they recommended I return. Was again sent away. Well, away from Flair I shall go. Hope the flight is marginally better.

### "Really disappointing experience"
Vancouver to Calgary. Really disappointing experience and won’t be flying again. Flair Airlines checkin charges for carry on without explicitly stating that personal items are allowed on. I paid for a carry on and then at the airport was told that I didn’t have to pay for it and that by contacting support I could have it refunded. The support rep refused to refund the charge, wouldn’t transfer me to a supervisor and told me that I would only be contacted if the supervisors had a different answer then he did, even after I explicitly requested that I receive a call back no matter the answer. The amount of nonsense that they threw at me for $35 was insane. I spent hundreds of dollars on this flight and I can’t even guarantee a call back? Terrible service and I will actively never use this company again.

### "airline has lost his bag"
Not Verified |  I am writing this on behalf of my son Who flew Flair Air on Dec 17th from Calgary to Abbotsford BC flight #8385. We paid to check a hockey bag he had with him with tools for his job. The airline has lost his bag and despite all the calls, emails and Facebook messages we have had not received any correspondence in return. To say that I'm mad as hell is a drop in the bucket to how my son feels. He was to work back home in Vancouver and now is jobless until he can replace his tools and work gear. So if you want your livelihood ruined and a pile of unneeded stress the Flair air is the one for you! Bravo Flair air you're officially worse than Air Canada.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  I will never use this airline again. I would rather pay the extra money and fly WestJet. I booked a ticket for my mother, and had to cancel it for other issues. Called customer service, placed on a 25 min hold, then told I cannot cancel my mother has to call To authorize it. Even though it was paid for on my credit card! My mother is an elderly woman. It was not within her means to planning her trip, it was my responsibility. Dumbest rule that I have ever encountered.

### "the savings aren't worth it"
Abbotsford to Edmonton. This was my first time flying with Flair Airlines. I had the worst experience, my plane was 5 hours late. And my baggage was lost. I called to inquire about my bag and they said I should receive an email within 5 business days to give me an update. Never fly with Flair, the savings aren't worth it.

### "staff just seemed to shrug their shoulders"
Not Verified |  First flight was delayed an hour and 45 minutes from Vancouver to Edmonton. When I arrived in Edmonton, I expected to be boarding my connecting flight only to find out that it was delayed from the original 5.05 pm departure time to 9.15 pm. No reason given and staff just seemed to shrug their shoulders. I dont think I will be flying Flair Airlines again.

### "Worst customer service possible"
Abbotsford to Edmonton with Flair Airlines. Worst customer service possible. Repeatedly lied to about delays. Five hours late and nobody cares. Standard operating procedure for this joke of an airline. Never again.

### "there is no customer service"
There are many reviews stating that there is no customer service when they screw up. This is true — I have attempted to pay for baggage, check in, and print my boarding pass for two days prior to my flight. I have received nothing but error messages on their website, one of which message that stated “Online check in cannot is not available for this reservation. Please go to the airport to complete your check in.” The other stating “Cannot check in this passenger. Boarding pass can only be printed at the airport.” Upon arriving to the airport, I was forced to pay an extra $20.00 for my boarding pass plus a service fee for my luggage. When I explained my issue, the level of customer service capped at “You should have just called customer service.” Why would you refer me to the airport if that was not where my problem would be solved? It seems silly and such a simple error to which could be easily fixed by reimbursement as it is clear with the screen shots that I have shown the teller along with her trying it out herself via my phone that the website was experiencing technical issues. So far, I have called to receive a reimbursement, but was told that there was “nothing they could do.” ... Anything more than “nothing” would have been better - such a stupid issue

### "Personal bag not accepted"
Edmonton to Winnipeg. Personal bag was not accepted. We were coming back from our trip. Ended up paying $50, no dimension changed. At the gate Flair air staff measured bag in Air Canada rack. However, at the check in counter the rack was vertical and the bag went in like nothing. At the gate the rack was horizontal. If Flair Air enforce $50 fee they should also invest into their own racks. Tea is not free.

### "Zero customer service"
Toronto to Kelowna via Edmonton. Zero customer service when they screw up! Out $1300 to book alternate flight to get home and had to wait 5 hours for my luggage that was loaded onto their plane without me in Toronto. Yes I was denied boarding after my luggage was loaded because their reps at the check in desk failed to ensure we had proper boarding passes and refused to print one upon return from security. And then was repeatedly told the flight was cancelled by their phone reps when it was already in the air. The flight was not listed on any airport web site (departures or arrivals) nor was it on their website listing. Beware of Flair Air. No customer service and who they do have, know nothing. If you want to waste your money, get stranded or delayed and have to spend more to get where you need to go then by all means book with Flair. No better place to spend your booked holiday you paid thousands for than in an airport away from home with no luggage and no answers to when or where you will end up with Flair. A joke at best.

### "not a great experience"
Calgary to Vancouver. Nice staff but otherwise not a great experience. Delayed flight and hit with a $50 fee for my very small carry on luggage. I probably should have paid in advanced (apparently only $35) but wasn’t aware there would be a fee. It felt like getting a bad parking ticket. The extra fee was disappointing and I missed my son’s 5th birthday party. So, I’ll never fly Flair Airlines again.

### "Worst customer service"
Do not fly with Flair Airlines. I tell this to every family and friend I know. Worst customer service. 6 hour delay and then a cancelled flight resulting in a cancelled trip where I was supposed to attend a friends wedding. Vacation days at work wasted. Staff were not being honest. I put my name down for a refund and waited the 5-6 business days, I never got it. Just called them and waited 40 minutes for them to take my call. Refund request was never submitted so I now have to wait 7-10 more business days. No compensation and very little apology. Worst airline I have ever experienced.

### "not impressed by this airline"
I am not even on the plane yet but I can already say I am not impressed by this airline. This is my first time using this airline and all I am hearing are prices been shout out. Our flight has been delayed for 40 minutes but no one has apologized but they have the audacity to say if you have more than one boarding pass on your phone you will be charge $2, you are charged $10 for printing your boarding pass at the airport, $50 for carry on($35 online). I was told this airline was meant to be cheaper compare to the others, but I am saying it is better to pay extra to the competition than to pay for every bit on your way to your destination. $2 because someone has more than one pass on their own phone, all this is ridiculous to me. No carry on in 2018, who does that? I am so shocked by what I am seeing and hearing right now.

### "onboard staff are great"
Edmonton to Vancouver. I have flown with Flair Airlines every week for a few months now. I have no luggage just a small day pack which fits in their personal luggage rack. 18 Liter size is about as big as you can get if you don't want to pay extra. I save thousands of dollars with Flair Airlines. The onboard staff are great and having been on a few delayed flights we were always advised on changes. I do not want to have to return to using Air Canada or West-jet as they will really increase prices if Flair Fails. Clear announcements from Ground Staff would go a long way towards allowing customers to remain informed and or make timely decisions if changes need to be made.

### "I would recommend Flair"
Toronto to Calgary via Edmonton. It was a last minute flight, I was scared after reading feedback from the reviews. Flight is an older aircraft I believe its from 1985. Its Boeing 737-400. Staff were very friendly and courteous. If you want to save some money make sure you print your boarding pass from home so you don't pay extra in the airport to print the boarding pass. Check your luggage from online where you'll be able to save some money as well. Our flight was delayed but not because of Flair Air's fault it was because of snow. I would recommend Flair Air.

### "I was very disappointed"
Calgary to Winnipeg. I was very disappointed with the service this airline provides, they have poor communication skills and are not honest to their customers. I was aware that my flight was delayed until 8 pm (originally departure was suppose to be at 315 pm) I go back to the airport, check in, wait 8pm comes around no announcement that it is now delayed until 9 pm then 1030 pm then 11 then 12 at this point I chose to rebook for the following days flight, well get there everything was going ok from the looks of it online, it showed that flight was on time, we were told told be at gate by 230 to board plane - no plane, no employees, no communication! After about 30 to 40 mins they come and make an announcement that the plane in Vancouver is boarding and will be on their way shortly 15 mins later we were informed that the plane is on its way - about about 30 mins later we were told the plane had to turn around in Vancouver! No one there knew anything (apparently) they couldnt put us on a different fly from a different airline they could not do anything but give us a refund which takes 5 to 10 business days! We sat and waited only to be told after many many hrs later it is cancelled! I then call customer service to see what other options they can offer what a joke they "dont know anything". Never will fly with them or recommend them to others! Now my trip is cancelled I was on my way to meet my new grandson, they ruined that for me.

### "never been so dissatisfied"
Calgary to Toronto. This was my worst flight experience ever. Sure you save $50-100, but they delayed my flight 10+ times, eventually to the next day, only to delay it further. They kept saying “maintenance”. Eventually, I took the L and booked with WestJet for like $500 one way. The fact that I was willing to spend that much goes to show how frustrated I was with Flair. Hopefully they actually give me the refund they promised me. Do yourself a favor, just spend the extra cash to go on a reliable airline. I’ve never been so dissatisfied with a service in my life. How do they get away with this?

### "no accommodating for delays"
Calgary to Toronto. Flight delayed by over 8 hours. They have no realistic plan of accommodating for delays. No hotel accommodation, no rebooking, no appropriate refunds.

### "Absolutely awful company"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Winnipeg. Absolutely awful company, arrived at the airport at 1:00 PM for my 3:00 PM flight, then the flight was delayed until 8:00, and later again to 10:00, and then finally they informed us the flight was MIA and would have to reschedule the flight for the next day. I sat at the airport and wasted my whole day. They claimed there was a problem with the plane, but this was a lie, they were literally just trying to sell more tickets as the plane wasn't nearly sold out.

### "not recommend flying them"
Edmonton to Vancouver. Terrible service flight was initially delayed 3 hours received email morning of to expect 3 hour delay, fair enough showed up 3 hours later then initially scheduled to find flight is actually closer to six hours delayed. Get 10 dollar food voucher. Coming back flight is now 7 hours delayed, we board the plan sit on the tarmac for another hour while flight attendants trying to figure out who the missing passenger from the flight passenger list is. Flight attends now manually check people ID and tickets. Flights total of 8 hours behind schedule. None of the staff seem to have any idea why flight is delay or what the plan of action is. Would not recommend flying them. Calling there customer service desk is a whole other story I won’t get into. Spend the extra money fly with someone else.

### "Avoid this airline"
Winnipeg to Kelowna. Missed my first flight and was not allowed on my connecting flight and would not also honour my flight home. I dont understand how a modern airline can have no customer service and why they would cancel every other flight of a long trip. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "was a good airline"
I bought a round trip from Winnipeg to Abbotsford. I thought it was a scam because the low prices but it was a good airline. I bought my tickets a week before departure and the price was still very low compared to other airlines. The flight attendants were really nice and met whatever needs you asked. The only problem with this airline is that the leg space is pretty cramped and during connecting flights the wait is really long to get back into he air. They only offer water and coffee for free so be sure to bring a snack with you.

### "beyond unacceptable"
Las Vegas to Edmonton. Flight 777 on my way to Vegas on Friday Nov 9th delayed twice. Flight 778 coming back last night Nov 12th, was delayed 3 times for a total of 5 hours. Couldn't leave Vegas because they couldn't match passenger manifests for 45 mins on the tarmac. Landed in Edmonton and waited again on the tarmac for baggage services to be ready. Connected flight to Kelowna cancelled with no warning. This is beyond unacceptable! Not one apology heard the entire time. Their only response to my complaint: Flair Airlines Hi Paul, We apologize for your experience. Unfortunately, delays do happen and we do our best to get you on your way as soon as possible.

### "disappointed by this airline"
Kelowna to Edmonton. I usually do not contribute reviews on airlines based on the philosophy that one experience, good or bad is not necessarily an accurate depiction. In this case, I have been disappointed by this airline on every single flight for a variety of reasons. The most important being that they have not once been on time. The second most important being the extra charges for basic services such as carry on bags. I do not find them to be particularly cheap when all things are taken into consideration.

### "lets me see my family"
Kelowna to Edmonton. I would like to thank Flair for charging what they do. Today my flight was late and I heard a ton of passengers complain about being late, extra charges, customer service - blah blah blah. I paid $118 there and back. This lets me see my family every couple months without breaking the bank. Even if they are are a little late sometimes I appreciate they are here otherwise I could never afford to go home as often as I do. I feel the complaining will eventually reuslt in more things being included but higher prices for things I dont need. So please people enjoy the fact you just paid half the cost of a normal ticket!

### "Good airline and cheap"
Flair Airlines was surprisingly good. My flight was from Calgary to Toronto with a stop in Winnipeg and vice versa for the return. No delays from Calgary to Toronto. For the return flight reached both Calgary and Winnepeg half an hour early. In my opinion the 30 min break in Winnipeg was nice. You got to stretch your legs, use real bathrooms and breaking the flight into 2 hour intervals made it much more bearable. Good airline and cheap. I'd definitely recommend, but on that note, I didn't have to go through customer service which is where most of the problems seem to lie.

### "get very small seats"
Toronto to Edmonton. Charged for no boarding pass for my young daughter. Paid 25.00 to get better seats only to get very small seats with just extra leg room. Moved my seats because of my little one and did not indicate that I was not allowed to sit there with a child online. Not a cheap flight at all. Everything costs way too much. Never flying with Flair Airlines again!

### "Overall, very pleased"
Not Verified |  Flew from Calgary to Vancouver today. At first I was worried after reading the reviews but the experience was contrary to what I read. I travelled with husband and daughter. We paid $100 each for our fare. Each of us had a backpack full of our clothes. We didnt get charged for it. We checked in online a day prior so we read that there is a $10 charge if you print the boarding pass at the airport. So we had the boarding passes emailed to our personal email and off we went. When we were in the security area of the calgary airport, the guard scanned the 3 boarding passes and accidentally deleted my husbands boarding pass. We didnt rralize this until boarding but when we showed an ID, they let my husband in without the boarding pass no problems. Theres no entertainment or free food, but neither does westjet and yet you pay more for the same flight with westjet. Overall, very pleased. Everyone got out of the plane quick cause no one had to grab their carryons which i like. Flight was on time too

### "leg space is very cramped"
Vancouver to Calgary. Go Westjet and save you the hassle. I arrived at the YVR service desk two hours early and was told that my flight to YYC at 6:00pm was cancelled. They said they emailed me three times to inform me (which I never received). And because I never reply to their 3 emails, they considered me as a no show, therefore I forteited my ticket, no compensation. I then had to scramble to Westjet and paid over $300 for a last minute ticket to YYC. Made it home to YYC and the day after, I was still very annoyed over this Flair incident. So I called their customer service line. Now they told me a different story. They said my flight home was actually changed to an earlier flight -- to 8:20am of the same day. Meaning it was changed to 9 hours and 40 minutes earlier on the same day. That was very weird. You're telling me that I had to cancel my business meetings on that day just to catch an earlier flight home? Still no compensation. Third day: I was still very annoyed over it. So I wrote to their customer service and explained the whole situation in writing. Two days later, they emailed me back saying they would refund my return ticket of $79. But I paid $308 to Westjet just to come home. Fourth day: I did some digging around and found out that on Flight Stats website, the original flight from YVR to YYC took off on time and landed on time in YYC. Verdict: Flair screws around with customers that paid lower prices. Most likely they want me on an earlier flight (9 hours earlier) because there were extra seats, and the original flight was overbooked and sold at a higher price. Very nasty. Other note: the leg space is very cramped. Seats are not comfortable at all.

### "Unbelievable worst experience"
Unbelievable worst experience. Flair airlines who will try to dupe you on every possible point. Everyone be aware if you think you got a deal, it wont take long time before you realize that you will have to pay 100-400 dollars based on the luggage you are caring - any thing other than your purse is going to be charged by airline. This is the way they are going to put dent on your pocket despite having stuff well within the limit. Super rude staff wont care if you are senior citizens or going with family - all they care how to bring airline money.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
Not Verified |  Kelowna to Edmonton. My original flight was to leave at 2:25 on Thursday Oct 25, 2018 and you're required to be at the airport 2 hours early to check-in- for a domestic flight, which I find is way too early. The desk closes an hour before take-off which I also find unreasonable. Anyway, I'm there early with enough time for any unforeseen traffic delays as I have to drive 1-1/2 hrs to get to Kelowna airport. Flight gets delayed til 5:30pm due to a cracked windshield on the plane. Great. Things happen but I have an event that evening that I do not want to miss. So here I'm at airport for 7 hrs. I just make it to my event on time. Now to come home on the Sunday Oct 28; flight was to leave at 5:30pm so I'm at airport 2 hours early to be informed that the plane is delayed til 10:30pm because it hit a bird. Like really?! Here goes another 7 hr delay. No food vouchers available. They offered refunds but what good does that do when you go to book another airline for that day for $325 return and I only paid say $130 for that leg back. Then come the complaints. Another couple was there for 24hrs waiting to get a flight back as their flight was delayed then cancelled then delayed then delayed again. This airline only has 7 older planes so its difficult to get a back-up plane with such a minimal fleet. Another Flair plane was there on the tarmac but it required maintenance too. SO if you have nothing but time, and no deadlines, then please chose Flair Airlines. I finally arrived home at midnight, thanks to my awesome friend who waited to come get me or else I wouldn't have had a way home. Worst airline experience ever. They wouldn't even cover a glass of wine for the inconvenience. And don't forget to book your luggage online first or it will cost you almost triple to pay at the airport.

### "my last flight with you"
Winnipeg to Abbotsford via Edmonton. Booking: Found my way through booking as they appear to be cheaper at the onset, which is true if you do not travel with anything basically but you still have to figure out what your basics are up front. Paid my way through it all checked bag, carry on, seat selection all good and easy and is when I realized I should have just booked with a major airline. Day before flight: Checked in online easy enough but you have to watch what you are doing as it appears you can double pay for your checked, carry on etc. Day of flight: get to airport and check in and check my bag as normal. I go get a coffee and sit and wait to board. I was paged to the counter and was then asked if I had changed my seat, which I paid for in row 3 window so I could exit the plane quickly upon landing. I said no but confusingly accepted my new boarding pass and sat back down in the waiting area. When I realized I was in row 14 middle seat I went back up to say I had not changed my seat and why would I go from the front way back there? They put me in the exit row aisle, good enough I guess, still no reason? I was pretty much okay with everything until I filled out a complaint form online. The response I got was this "I can see your frustration on the seat selection change, Sometimes the flight director needs to make changes to either a broken seat or for a mother and a child. This dose not happen often. Load of crap, I have never been bumped from a paid seat, and they make it a priority to ensure you are paying for every last droplet of service you ask for upfront before you get to the airport only to just take it away? Not acceptable. All I needed was a we double booked your seat due to a system error. I did not see any mothers and children or broken seats where I paid to sit. Sorry Flair, this was my last flight with you. The majors cover your service and do not boot you to the side.

### "demoralizing customer service"
Winnipeg to Calgary booking for January 2019. I found the Flair Air website to be manipulative and deceptive. When you research a flight, you are given a list of 3 or 4 "options". The way it is presented makes them appear to be set prices. There is nothing on the page to indicate they are variable and will go up. You can find that information buried in the huge FAQ section, but their is nothing on the actual page with prices. Nor do they say how many tickets are available at that price. Essentially they are creating a fear based reaction response. As well, when you book your ticket, you are given all the options for baggage purchase right then. Once again, it does not inform you on the actual purchase page that you have the option to purchase later (you have to dig that up from the FAQ). So they worry you into buying a ticket quickly, throw all the purchase choices at your without properly informing you of your rights, and if you are panicked into buying too much luggage, will charge you to refund them! I learned this all the hard way. I was online and purchasing my ticket, and was quoted $992 for my flight of 4 tickets. I got to the luggage choice, couldn't find the information on the fly that I could choose to book luggage later, but clearly understood that I'd have to pay to cancel luggage, so I called the centre to get the answer. By the time I got back to the website the 20 minutes window timed out. The next chance I had to start all over to purchase, the price jumped up $350! This is despite the fact that visually the flight looked equally half empty both times (you see the map when being offered the seat selection). I called the support line, and the response was "nothing i can do, and no there is no manager here to talk to. I emailed the support email, and "sorry, nothing we can do" was the repeated response. No name attached to the email, no one else to further discuss the situation in. The most demoralizing customer service I have experienced.

### "still waiting for my luggage"
Flew from Vancouver to Toronto. Checked in 3 pieces of luggage only got 2. Flair Airline said they outsource luggage to Swissport and does not know what happened. There is no one to call or to locate the luggage. I moved cities for a new job all my work clothes and documents are not that luggage and I don’t have it. You cannot speak to anyone only communicate by email. Flair Airline said they a low cost carrier that’s why they don’t have personal services. Lost cost carrier not a free carrier I paid for a ticket and my extra luggage. If they cannot get simple operations as luggage how on earth do they expect to run an airline business. Im still waiting for my luggage.

### "Never flying with them again"
Winnipeg to Edmonton. We encountered a major delay, instead we were transferred to Westjet in which our boarding pass encountered a spelling error. We were denied entry on the aircraft because of Flair Airlines mistake. We rushed to get the name changed quickly but to no avail. We have now been in the airport for 12 hours and were given a 10 dollar voucher. Not happy. Never flying with them again.

### "get charged for everything"
Where do I start with this Arline. Coming to Winnipeg from Hamilton it was good until it wad time to board, my personal item the time of check in the was fine, We get to boarding now they tell me to put it in the measuring bin and then they say it’s too big i will have to pay, I was very upset for even more upset when I found out the price I have to pay for the personal item $90.00! Winnipeg to Toronto delayed flight 6 hours. So until the next day 2:55AM - now sitting at the airport as I type I looked at the time boarding time has passed and so is the take off time - delayed again to 3.15am - my original flight was for 8PM. The lady at the front tells me the flight coming here was late and it just landed! I would probably never take the airline again especially because you get charged for everything, the cheap prices get you until you want to add luggage, or a carry, seat selection -  so everything basically adds to a regular flight on westjet or even air canada.

### "still grounded in the airport"
We boarded on time 6.35am and left Hamilton International Airport to return within an hour for maintenance! We're still grounded in the airport with the latest update showing departure at 1.00pm! Let's hope this 5th departure update is final! I mean I appreciate the Captain decision to return for maintenance but they could have brought another plane by this time. Imagine the lost business for lot of travelers today!

### "such unnecessary fees"
Edmonton to Victoria. Paid for such unnecessary fees. I feel really ripped off. Why do we need to pay these ridiculous fees that I've never seen before. It's supposed to be a discount airline but that's far from.

### "Extremely annoyed and frustrated"
Booked flights to Edmonton for Thanksgiving weekend back on June 18th. Recieved an email last Thursday that due to fall schedule changes, my flight back to Victoria was canceled and would be rescheduled automatically for the previous day or I could contact to cancel for a full refund. Ok, kind of annoying 2 weeks before my flight but I understand. Flying home a day early for me however, is not an option so ok no problem I will take the refund for that trip. Try phoning, get told that in my situation I am to go on the website and fill out the form to get reimbursed. When I go online and type my reservation code it brings up both flights (roundtrip) so I make a note that I only want the second leg of the trip canceled as there is no other place for me to select only one leg of the trip (Unless I am completely blind and missed that.) Phone in and explain the situation and what I have done and would like to just clarify that my flight going to Edmonton would not be canceled and get assured it would not be. Get an email last night that both trips have been canceled and refund will be available in 7-10 business days. Try phoning today to get the flight to Edmonton rebooked, no answer. Write an email and no response as of yet. Extremely annoyed and frustrated as I am now 10 days from when I need to fly. Don't think I'll be be flying with Flair again.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Like most, I was wary of using this airline because of all the negative reviews. I arrived at the airport with no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were courteous and professional on all flights. It truly is "no frills", like every other ultra-low-cost airline out there, so bring snacks and something to do on the plane and you're set. I would gladly recommend this airline to anyone looking to save on airfare.

### "the savings are negligible"
Calgary to Vancouver. They would not accommodate a change in my family's flights due to a death in the family without charging me the full cost for new tickets. Flair Air markets themselves as a low-cost airline and they certainly are cheaper. However, if you add up the TravelFLEX fee, paying for all your baggage, carry-on bags, snacks, check in fees and all your other fees, the savings are negligible. The fact that their customer service is so far behind the other airlines and they nickel and dime you for everything certainly seals this decision for me in the future. I was nothing but patient and respectful when dealing with them and the fact that I was not treated the same by the company who I paid to provide me a service is just wrong. Quite simply it is very clear that Flair Airlines doesn't care.

### "hope they stay around"
Flying with Flair Air was excellent. Plane was supposed to leave at 11:05 and literally left at 11:05. We were supposed to land at 11:40, and I walked out of the plane at 11:42 (was last row!). Tickets were very good price, better than I'd ever seen before in Canada. This airline is really a dream come true for the avid and budget traveler, hope they stay around!

### "a horrible experience"
What a horrible experience, I booked from October 25th to October 29 Abbotsford to Winnipeg for a medical appointment. I received an email reflecting September 25th to October 29th. This was changed without my consent - an entire month difference. I was flabbergasted. I called the customer service agent, very rude voice, zero communication skills saying I had to pay an additional $125 to make any changes, plus an added $30 dollars for speaking to him. I asked to speak to a supervisor, -he said that the supervisor was not available to speak to me because she was dealing with another phone call, and even if she was available she would tell me the same thing. In the end he did not help me and told me to go to the website to make changes. Thinking that this was a joke I called again, this time I spoke to a female customer service representative who sounded just as ill equipped to deal with the public - she was equally unhelpful, lacked empathy and told me she could not help,  I needed to pay more money for a change, additionally, there was no flight on the date I chose to fly. This is horrible. In the end I abandoned the flight, took a hit as I realized I would not get either my money back or any help and booked with another more reliable airline. I guess you get what you pay for.

### "That was a nightmare"
Calgary to Vancouver. That was a nightmare！The fligt departure time was 5:45pm. I received an email notice me the flight will delay for 1 hour. When I got the borading gate，the staff told me the boarding time delay to 1:00am tomorrow and asked me to be here at 12:30am. When I came to the counter at 12:00am，they said it flight was canceled. The option was change my filght to 5:45pm tomorrow. And now，I am at the boarding gate waiting for the plane arrive，the boarding time is 5:00pm but now is 5:40pm.

### "website was not working "
Hamilton to Edmonton. Night before flight trying to check in. Couldn’t print it or download the boarding passes as the website was not working properly. Paid for one extra bag, once reached at the counter had to pay for each boarding pass, even though it was their system problem. Plus had to pay for the extra bag which I already paid for, and my card was already charged too. They made me pay for the extra bag again.

### "do not book with this airline"
Winnipeg to Calgary. I should have totally read all these reviews before booking ticket for my vacation from this worst Airline ever. My flight was scheduled for 3.35 PM on September 12 2018. Airline have sent an email notifying flight is 60 mins late, but upon reaching to the airport, we found out that flight is delayed for 2 and a half hour. We waited at the Airport and when it got close to the new time, they have changed time again for another 2 and a half hour, still waited at the airport and then they changed it for another 2 and a half hour. All these changes apart from the first delay of 1 hour were not informed to us, we just find that out when we reach to the counter to hand the check in bag. Upon the last delay i lost confidence that this flight will take off today so went back home. Called airline to confirm 1 and a half hour before the new scheduled time, they said yes it will depart at 11 and if i don’t show up or miss the flight i will lose the money. Left home and reached to the airport and found that flight has been cancelled. The staff at the airport were not answering properly and arguing with us rather than explain the situation. I felt like they were highly unprofessional and kept on saying we can not do anything and we do not work for flair air, we are just third party contractors. There is actually no one from airline working there. They do not care about you. Now they are saying they have arranged new flight for us who missed today’s flight at 7.15 in the morning, but when i asked for the confirmation that they have re booked us for that flight, they said they do not have any information on flight yet because it has not been set up yet, so i highly doubt that there will be any flight tomorrow morning. We tried to making it cheaper but it is costing more money now, we have already spent $50 on taxi and lost our rental car reservation which we got for $107 for 4 days and i want to rebook the rental car it is going to cost my $250. We lost money on our hotel reservation. So trying to make it cheap can cost you even more money. The service we got from Flair Airlines is worst ever. I really wish i read these reviews before booking. I have seen delay word in each and every review, so it is not just today that the flight got delayed or cancelled, it is their everyday thing. Please do not book with this airline. Highly not recommended.

### "charged $100 for each bag"
Worst airline ever. We flew from Vancouver to Calgary and had no issues with bringing bags/personal items on board. We then returned two days later to fly from Calgary to Vancouver and were charged $100 for each bag. The girl at the desk was extremely rude towards us. By far the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. The planes are also very dirty and old. I would never fly with flai rair ever again.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Victoria to Edmonton. Poor customer service. Got an email saying a 1hr delay only to get to airport and was 2 hr delay and then staff stood around gave no info - had to read on departure screen delayed another hr. Was suppose to leave Victoria at 1230 but never left until 1650. Thanks for the offer of coffee and tea for free mighty generous of you. Better customer service would have been an explanation along with a voucher. Won't be my first choice when flying again. Staff on plane were also rude.

### "by far the worst airline"
Winnipeg to Edmonton. This is by far the worst airline I have ever had to deal with. It seems they get all the flight attendant rejects that have no people skills. My flight is delayed by 35 minutes because there is a problem with the engine and they are "fixing it right now" no thanks, maybe get a different plane.

### "non working seat belt"
Edmonton to Halifax via Hamilton. I was flying with grandson and daughter. Discover before takeoff that grandson who was in middle seat 6B..(i was in A and daughter in C) that his seatbelt would not stay tight after buckled and strap pulled snug. That was ok as flight attendant moved us to seats directly behind us, all was good. We landed in Hamilton Ontario airport for a crew change. We were all instructed to move back to original seats. I asked attendant what about our non working seat belt she said she would inform next set of flight attendants of the problem and they would rearrange us before take off. We were ready for take off and i thought ok no one has said anything to us about moving so i told one attendant she said she would speak to other attendant. She came said she was not aware of this issue moved us to seats across isle where again we discovered 2 of those seatbelts would not stay tightened after strap was pulled tight. This is now seat E & F...by time i got her attention again we were moving out to runway he proceeded to say to daughter move back over to seat C and told grandson to move up an row into a seat away from me...he was reluctant as this was only the 2nd plane he'd been on and first trip away so he wasnt secure about moving...and said come on you can do it..as we were taxing down run way...was not a comfortable experience for grandson of 6 urs old but i talked him thru it. My whole point was the number of non working seatbelts which are a very important piece of equipment on flights. And how people feel that separating young children from adults during a very already nervous situation. I will say the seatbelts and the non communication from crew to crew will cause me to not ever fly flair air again or recommend any one else to. My grandson talks of all his wonderful adventures this summer but the one he tells first to everyone is how he faced his fear of heights and flew in an airplane but his seatbelt was broken in airplane 2 times and was scared to not be beside my grandma and auntie. Not a very satisfied customer.

### "a very positive experience"
Hamilton to Halifax. For the price I paid, the airline was great. To get a return flight from Ontario to Nova Scotia, during the summer, including bags each way for less than $300 is unheard of with bigger airlines. The flight wasn’t the most spacious, but for an hour and 45 minutes each way, its a no-brainer to just deal with a bit of a squeeze for that fare. Most economy seats aren’t the roomiest anyway, so it really made very little difference. The flight was delayed due to weather (nothing to do with Flair - all flights were grounded because of lightning) and the captain updated us frequently while the flight staff walked the aisles offering water and checking on patrons. The check in was fast and efficient and my bag made it to my destination without any issues. Make sure you read the details and the fine print, and show up early as they will close the counter at exactly the stated time (which to me is perfectly acceptable, even if people are in line, as they very clearly say what time the counter closes). All in all, it was a very positive experience and I will absolutely fly with Flair again.

### "Will not fly again"
Hamilton to Edmonton. First, when I went to check in there were about 6 employees standing talking looking at me yet continuing their personal conversation. I waited for a few minutes before saying “hello?” this prompted the lady to check me in. She made me pay to check my normal size back pack and bring nothing on the plane with me. Upon boarding the plane, obviously many people had backpacks. It is a personal item - every other airline deems a backpack a personal item. The staff on the flight came across rude and the seats were insanely uncomfortable. I paid extra to check a bag when I could have just flown Westjet or Air Canada for the same total as they would have let me keep my backpack - as well as kinder staff and much nicer planes. Will not fly again.

### "Overall very bad experience"
Not Verified |  Travelled from Vancouver to Calgary. Flight was delayed so cabin crew rushed everyone in the aircraft repeatedly telling us to get out of the way so they could take off quickly. Waited at the baggage carousel for half an hour just to realize our baggage was lost. Flair Airlines representative was impossible to find because they were sitting in a different companies office. When confronted with my situation, the representative claimed that they will only refund our baggage fee when online it says they would refund our losses as well. Very bad customer service and not helpful at all. Did not reply to any emails sent. Went back to the airport the next day to talk to a representative to find my bag was there and that they had purposefully left my bag at Vancouver and had not even informed me. Overall very bad experience and don't recommend flying with this airline.

### "going back to Westjet"
Not Verified |  Victoria to Edmonton. I've heard some horror stories about this airline and guess what they're true. Our flight was supposed to take off at 12.30pm so we arrived at 11. Only to find out that our flight is delayed until 645pm due to mechanical issues. They said everyone was supposed to have been emailed new boarding time but nobody received one. There planes are old  and apparently this is a regular thing with them. I'm going back to Westjet.

### "purposely hassle travellers"
Edmonton to Toronto. Personal bag - under seat. Their website shows measurement of 15x33x43cm but their unit at the airport is much smaller in size. Their staff insists that the bag has to fit in the unit placed at the airport to be allowed without charge to be carried on. They purposely hassle travellers to get extra money out of customers between $52.50 to $57.50. When you show them the measurement on their site, they insist that the site measurements are wrong and the unit at airport are the correct size. After too much argument, they allowed us to take it on board without charge. The ironic thing is it happened to us boarding from Toronto airport too to fly to Edmonton and without much hassle they allowed us to carry the same bag on board. Why is this airline troubling passengers when they do allow at the end to carry them on. This airline is like a 3rd world country airline were they try to squeeze as much money from passengers as they can.

### "anger and uncertainty"
Not Verified |  Terrible Customer Service! 4+ hour flight delay and Flair would not accommodate any of the passengers with vouchers nor updates. They would however consistently deny any inquiries made by the passengers leaving them in a state of anger and uncertainty. Flair’s policy only reimburses value to customers after a delay of 4+ hours which is completely detrimental to federal transportation policy of 2 hours before value reimbursement. Because of this, Flair Airlines is subject to fines and should reevaluate their customer service policies if they intend to remain a company. Discount airfare should not come at the expense of limiting customer service. I will not book with Flair Airlines again.

### "really poor customer experience"
Not Verified |  We booked our flights online and departed with no problems at all from Winnipeg to Hamilton a week ago. Our return flight was scheduled for 06:35am in Hamilton this morning September 2, 2018. The flight has now been delayed for over 4 hours due to mechanical issues and the airline has done nothing to accommodate travellers to get them to their destinations. They advised the next flight available is tomorrow morning. This absolutely unacceptable and really poor customer experience. I understand things can happen but they should make better effort to get travelers to their destinations! This airline is good to save money that’s for sure if you’re a flexible traveller!

### "flight was delayed 2 times"
Avoid Flair at all costs. Flew Edmonton to Abbotsford. The plane was so dated it left you feeling unsafe. Our flight was delayed 2 times without any communication to the passengers via email or other, and when asked why the delay, they said “issues with the Kelowna crew”. Also they knew the flight would not arrive at 7:30, (3.5 hours later) the initial delay but posted it as such to avoid people bailing to other airlines or flights. Not worth any savings.

### "bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Kelowna to Hamilton via Edmonton. I didn't even take the flight. A month before they sent me an email adding a stop in Winnipeg. I cancelled and filled out refund form on the June 21 2018. Now 2 months later still no refund and can't talk to them only agents who only book flights. And that's after waiting 45 minutes on hold. Finally got email today August 29 it will be sent to accounts department for refund and another 6 to 8 weeks of waiting. This is unbelievable and bad customer service which is none. Do not fly with this airline. Hopefully they don't close their doors before I get my money.

### "I would not get a refund"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. My experience purchasing checked baggage was very much like that of another customer. There was no indication of having purchased a checked bag for my return flight so I called to verify. The service representative said I hadn’t and it was advisable to purchase it prior to getting to the airport otherwise the charge would be higher. Turns out I had paid already, but after speaking to another service representative as well as emailing I was told I would not get a refund. Also, expect to be on hold for about an hour when you call. The airline is always experiencing a “higher number of calls” than usual.

### "frustrating customer service"
Edmonton to Halifax via Hamilton. Incredibly frustrating customer service experience. Me and 2 of my siblings (with our families) have flown with them this month and all have had a very awful inconvenient experiences- with very unhelpful customer service when calling in to the contact number - and no response to email contact. So disappointing, as I believe Canada is in need of low cost air carrier - unfortunately- sacrificing customer care isn’t the way to go about it.

### "encountered no problems"
Vancouver to Calgary. I have to be honest; after reading the reviews on this airline made me want to refund my ticket. However, I wanted to fly with them to see it myself. At the check-in, the lady is nice and approachable. She made sure I knew the gate number and where to board. The cabin crew is friendly enough to answer my questions. Additionally, the plane left just in time and arrived earlier at destination. I have encountered no problems with my trip.

### "does not list purchased bags"
I booked online and it asks you to purchase your bags (carry on and checked bags). I purchased one each. It was listed in my final price which I paid by credit card. Later, I went online to check in as the flight was that night. I entered my reservation number and it brought up my information (name, address etc). Then it asked if I wanted to purchase carry on or checked bags! It did not list the bags I already thought I’d purchased, so I entered one each. It charged me $55 (and I never received an email receipt for that purchase!) I called them later to check and it did charge me twice! They said to email the support to request a refund. The answer I got back was “Bags are not refundable!” Their website is not clear and does not list purchased bags when you are checking in - be careful! The flight was 2 hours late leaving as well!

### "definitely use them again"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Vancouver. Was sceptical at first, as the ticket price was incredibly inexpensive. But Flair proved to be a great airline to fly with. The crew was very good natured and helpful. As long as you don't have a ton of luggage, it is extremely affordable to fly with them. I'd definitely use them again.

### "will never fly with this airline"
Edmonton to Hamilton. Sent my nephew home yesterday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, he was 5 minutes late for checking in. Was told by CSR that there were no exceptions. Talked to a supervisor and managed to get him checked in for the flight, but long story short he missed it. That isn't the complaint though. His luggage ended up going ahead of him and was waiting at the Hamilton Airport. The flight was a late one landing around 11:30 pm but the Flair Air counter was closed so, he couldn't get his luggage. When my sister got home, she had a phone call from Flair Air saying they had his luggage and were waiting for him to pick it up. From who? There was no one at the counter! My sister was told she could come back the next day to pick it up between 10 am and 2 pm. So, she took the day off work so she could travel back to the airport where she had to wait another half an hour while they unloaded a plane. Not sure if they shipped his luggage somewhere where it had to be unloaded again or what?? To top it off, she could see the luggage behind the counter with no one there to speak to, not one person. When she finally got the luggage, she wasn't even asked for ID. Based on this experience alone, I will never fly with this airline.

### "not worth the hassle"
Calgary to Hamilton via Winnipeg. Extremely disappointed with the service of the gate crew whowere rude and attitude of the flight crew matched that. Family traveling together the online checkin issues the boarding pass to a single mobile device but the gate crew had other ideas. They threatened travelers with extra charges for their system being down and that resulted with some inconveniences on them. The discount is not worth the hassle and all the inconveniences. I would not recommend to anyone.

### " Flair was incredibly good"
Vancouver to Winnipeg. For a 'no frills' airline, Flair was incredibly good. I have read the negative reviews and I just can't relate. Direct flight from Van to Wpg was perfectly on time with no issues. I was able to check in online and get boarding pass emailed to me without a hitch. On the way back, the flight stopped in Calgary before continuing on to Vancouver. Again, checking in and getting boarding pass was easy peasy. Flight left a few minutes early, was early to Calgary, left Calgary early, and was in Vancouver early. Of course there is no entertainment and of course you have to pay for larger carry-on luggage, but so what! This is something that you plan for when you book. And assigned seating is actually cheaper than most major airlines. Last but not least, the flight attendants were personable, friendly, fun, and professional. Maybe I was just lucky, but this Flair flight was better than most Air Canada flights I've taken in the last 10 years. Better on-time performance and more personable and helpful employees. Way to go!

### "lost my sons car seat"
Vancouver to Calgary. My son and I flew with Flair on July 31st returning August 3rd, 2018. Flair lost my sons car seat on the way to Calgary. Did not give us a car seat to use in Calgary. Had to find one ourselves to rent. No custom service line to call and no answer to emails. Got back to Vancouver expecting to find my car seat because the agent in Calgary said it was there. No Car seat! They gave me a booster seat. My son is 2 and a half. Legally can not seat in a car seat. They called me this week. They have found my car seat and I can now go and pick it up. But they can not guarantee that nothing happen to my car seat. It would be unsafe for me to use it. I have asked them to replace my car seat and I have had to answer. They will not pass the message on to the manager. Im not sure if a manager exists. Extremely poor custom service. Not with the cheap prices. Do not fly with Flair.

### "Worst experience ever"
Winnipeg to Hamilton. Worst experience ever. My personal item was just 1-2 inches bigger than the dimensions they specified. They charged me for 23 kgs checked bag while i was having a small trolley with 6 kg. This was unacceptable. I always carried this small trolley bag in every airline as it fits properly under the seat. Though i explained this to their crew member but they were sticking to their laws and no cooperation was done at all. I mean paying charges of 23 kg luggage for 6 kg cabin bag is because it was marginally bigger.

### "unethical business practices"
In April 2018 I purchased a ticket from Toronto Pearson to Halifax with Flair Airlines. The day before my flight (July 8) I looked up the reservation details and was floored to see that the flight was departing from Hamilton, about two hours away. I looked back in my email inbox, thinking I had accidentally booked a flight from Hamilton, but the original confirmation email indeed said Toronto. I spent hours trying to get in touch with the company, both through their general hotline and their "dedicated itinerary hotline" -- to no avail. Thankfully I managed to find a drive to Hamilton in the end. The flight was 75% empty (see attached photo). Afterward I managed to get in touch with a company representative. They said that they had "consolidated" their flights and mine had been "consolidated" to Hamilton, and that my notification email must have gotten lost in the spam folder. I am used to airlines changing the time of the flight, but I find it completely acceptable that they would sell me a ticket for one airport and then swap it out for an airport two hours away without my consent. I don't think this company will last long. I've left out a lot of details for brevity, but in a nutshell: unethical business practices, near-nonexistent customer service, and generally seems like a train wreck of a company. Worst travel experience I have had in a long time. Avoid.

### "a horrible experience"
Vancouver to Calgary. From the dirty plane to the terrible customer service this was a horrible experience. You definitely get what you pay for and then less. Hands down worth the tiny bit extra to fly Westjet.

### "Not one word of apology"
Halifax to Hamilton. Was supposed to leave Halifax at 5:35 pm and flight left Halifax after 2:00 am. Horrible! Not one word of apology. Not only are passengers inconvenienced, but the people waiting on the other end. The arrival time was not updated on their website after the 19:05 departure update. It is 7:15 pm and I am still not physically well after this ordeal.

### "an awful experience"
Not Verified |  This was our first time flying with flair air, and I guess it is true, you get what you pay for. Our flight from YEG to YHZ was an awful experience. The bathrooms had toilet paper all over and urine all over the seats and were clearly not being looked after. The debit machine was down so we were unable to purchase any food during our six hour flight. We hoped that our flight from YHZ back to YEG wouldn’t be as terrible but our flight was delayed and flairs website didn’t have this information posted, it showed on time even four hours later as we were boarding. No airport announcement was made advising of the delayed flight either. Overall, extremely disappointed. I don’t recommend anyone to fly with this company. Extremely unorganized, and not worth saving a few bucks.

### "you've lost me"
Halifax to Hamilton. Awful, just awful. Flight scheduled to leave Halifax at 5:35pm. Flight is delayed due to mechanical issues. I tried Flair but you've lost me.

### "Disappointing experience"
I booked a flight for my 12 year old niece to fly home alone for the first time. I called and was told I could get a gate pass when arriving at the airport to go through security with her and sit until her flight boarded. When I arrived I was told Flair does not have gate passes and the information I was given was untrue. So I had to let my 12 year old niece go through security and find her gate without a family member. The flight was then delayed twice for a total of 3 hours and their website was not updated with the flight times and when I called the rep didn’t not have correct information about when the flight would leave and arrive. Very poor customer service and reps who are not accurately informed, leaving a 12 year old waiting alone for over 2 hours. Disappointing experience.

### "this was perfect"
Winnipeg to Victoria. I needed an inexpensive flight to visit family and this was perfect! After reading all the airline's rules and regulations, especially the baggage rules, I took up the challenge. I took up this challenge to only pay for my flight, no extras, no frills. I must admit I was a tad anxious having read so many negative reviews. The flight went as expected. It was on time and without incident. The landing in Victoria was a bit heavy but I have experienced worse with other airlines. If you know what you are purchasing this airline was amazing. Remember no frills, just your ticket to your destination. Thank you Flair Air. I got to visit my sister one last time.

### Flair Airlines customer review
Abbotsford to Edmonton. Today's flight is delayed. Unless you like to be delayed and deal with a airline that don't know how to run. Also you cannot get through to customer service and they send emails that they have changed your flight a few times before your flight. And you might get a email 5 hours before your flight to remind you and it will say, your upcoming flight in 2 days!

### "worst customer service"
The worst customer service I have ever experienced. After having my flight changed to over 24 hours later last year I was provided with 300$ in credits to use toward another flight. When trying to use these credits this July (2018) I spent a total of over 3 hours on the phone and used the online booking form. They never even answered my first request for a flight and then on the second request booked me on a more expensive flight that went through a layover in kelowna. When booking this flight they also only used half of my credits and tried to charge me another 250$. I called the airline several times to talk to a supervisor who was always unavailable and then after leaving my information for him to call me back never received a phone call. I never was okay with this change in the amount to pay or the flight but according to the emailing service (which literally ignored half of my questions/requests) it didn't matter and now I have no credits despite never using them in the first place. The reps that answer the phone are impolite and dishonest. The management does not take responsibility and would not even speak to me on the phone. I have never been so dissatisfied with an airline and would never reckoned it.

### "Low cost means exactly that"
Not Verified |  Our experience with the Edmonton and Victoria agents exceeded our expectations. The agent in Victoria put us in the exit aisle and blocked the middle seat so we had the row to ourselves, and all at no extra charge. Lets face it, the travelling public wants the cheapest airfare possible but expect the top level service. You get what you pay for. It is spelled out pretty clear on their web site what the costs and restrictions are, so if you aren't looking at the site properly then you will get tagged for $$$. Where Flair did fall down is on the baggage handling side. We waited for nearly an hour to get our baggage in Edmonton. The Edmonton Information desk said, "Flair is a low cost airline. They don't have anyone here right now to unload the plane and we have tried to contact them. Later we were told by an EIA rep that the baggage handler off loaded the baggage onto the wrong carousel. Several people on our flight called Flair with not much luck. Somewhere between EIA and Flair there was a miscommunication on the baggage delivery. Take the baggage issue out and all in all it was a good flight. Remember to read the web site and don't expect anything different at the gate if you don't. Low cost means exactly that - low cost, no frills.

### "unacceptable customer service"
Flair Air is by far the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Absolutely unacceptable customer service. Inconsistent answers to my queries. Extremely long wait times at the call center. A broken online system for changing flights. Unorganized and unprofessional at the ticket counter. Weather delays and unserviceable aircraft are forgivable but the dealings I've had with Flair are not. Pay a little more money and fly with the competitors and save yourself a lot of grief.

### Flair Airlines customer review
It was worst experience travelling recently with Flair airlines.We took same bags for free (max.7kg ) from Edmonton to Abbotsford with no issues but these bags (about 6 kg but under 7 kg, got rejected by the staff at Abbotsford airport when coming back to Edmonton and asked us to pay for it. Later,inside the plane unfortunately we family of 4 got our seats in different rows out of which two were together and other 2 were in different rows too. My 6 year old kid started crying as she wanna sit with me thus i thought we can request the respective passenger to switch the seats. The passenger was ok with it but the air hostess standing nearby yelled at us and rudely asked all 4 of us to get off from our seats and asked us to show her our boarding passes. Well there was an issue of only one seat but she targeted all 4 of us. Another air hostess came and she said its ok your kid can sit with you but that rude air hostess showed silly expressions to her too. Later after couple of minutes she again came and compelled 3rd passenger sitting with us in our row to go to special seat and she included "Let them have full row". Why she was giving special treatment to other passenger and being very very rude with us including my little kids. Just my little girl changed her spot and sat with me. We paid for our tickets too like other passengers. It is to disrespectful and worst experience i had on this flight.

### "I didn't even fly"
Edmonton to Victoria. They took my money and I didn't even fly. I booked a flight 14 hours prior to departure and they did not answer the phone, nor respond to my online requests to cancel it prior to departure. It is always possible to cancel within 24 hrs, however they didn't even give me the chance, or respond afterwards. 3 days later I submitted my 4th attempt and they said sorry its now 3 days later, no refund. I responded with the pertinent details and they don't even bother to reply. . I should have booked with a regular carrier which I ended up flying anyway just a few hours later. When you book 14 hrs prior, they aren't even cheap.

### "the worst experience"
This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. The company is very poorly run. Their online check in site did not work. The other guests in line verified that the online check in did not work as well. Gate agents in Abbotsford were rude and barely knew how to work their system. Also their system treats all connecting flights as one unit. So if you miss your first flight, or any connecting flight, you lose your money on all of them. Do yourself a favour and do not fly with Flair if your life depends on it. Better to rent a car and just drive it.

### "I would not recommend"
Edmonton to Hamilton. The website is very misleading when it come to baggage allowances. It specifies weight requirements for carry-on but says nothing about dimensions, and charged me $50 to store a bag in the overhead. The staff at check in were not helpful. It should be noted that this flight is maybe 30% full and there is ample room in the overhead compartments. Very poor customer service. I would not recommend this airline and all the perceived savings are gouged from your wallet by this joke of an airline. Truly horrible.

### "rude and absolutely unhelpful"
Check in staff were condescending, rude and absolutely unhelpful. They will mock you while on the phone and laugh at you in front of other members of staff. They will not be apologetic, or sympathize with you in any way. There is no clear indication of where the check in counters are in the airport, no clear signage, nothing. No employees at YYZ airport have any idea where these counters are either, and aren't very familiar with Flair Airlines. Beyond disgusted with the joke of "customer service" that I was given. Flight from Vancouver to Edmonton, to Toronto was smooth and easy. Fix your Toronto station immediately and re train your staff. The young check in girls are great, it's the higher up customer service representatives that need a reality check. Unacceptable behaviour towards customers/passengers.

### "don't recommend it"
I bought this ticket since it was the cheapest from Vancouver to Calgary and then when I came to the airport I had to do a 20 minute line to get to the counter just so the woman could tell me that it cost 10 dollars to check in with them. So I decided to do it online at that point I checked in online as normal. Then at the boarding gate they told me that they charge for every carry on (30 dollars) but since I didn't do it at the check in it cost 105 dollars and they did not even count it as a baggage it was still a carry on. I will never again travel with them and don't recommend it to anyone.

### "Thank you, Flair!"
On Sunday, July 22 , I was running late when I arrived Calgary Airport check-in for Flair Airlines. Because I was just an hour before flying, I needed to pay $10 to check in online. My MasterCard has recently been hacked and so I only had cash. An agent was so helpful in securing my check-in. She agreed to take my cash and put the charge on her credit card, so that I could get my boarding pass. They assisted me by taking me to security and helping me get through promptly. The flight was such good value for the price. It departed and arrived on time, and staff were friendly. Thank you, Flair!

### "not worth the problems"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Toronto. Checked in online and was supposed to receive an email confirmation with boarding pass. Four hours later still had not received the confirmation. Went back online and it indicated I was checked in. Had to click the option to re-issue boarding pass and then it sent the email. Plane left Edmonton on time and arrived in Toronto on time at 10 pm. At 11:15 still had not received luggage. The airport wasn't busy. Planes that landed after us got their luggage before us. No one at Flair to talk to and find out what was happening. The cheaper price on the flight is not worth the additional problems with flying with them.

### " last time for Flair Airlines"
Not Verified |  Arrival at airport In Winnipeg for flight leaving at 20:00 and was informed that the flight will leave at 22:25. With no explanation other then there was a problem with the plane. I was not offered anything for this. Remember you pay for what you get. Instead of arriving in Hamilton at 23:35 we arrive at 02:45. I normally Fly Air Canada and West Jet all the time and this has never happened First and last time for Flair Airlines for me.

### "a wonderful service"
Calgary to Vancouver. The service from the check in counter, boarding, inflight service till we landed was awesome. I did not encounter any problems at any stage. My family flew from Calgary to Vancouver and from Vancouver back to Calgary. The agents did a great job. I will definitely fly with Flair in the future. Only thing which was not right was one of our bags was open and my daughters perfume bottle was missing. I would not care much after a wonderful service but will appreciate if this could be looked into.

### "We were very satisfied"
We were very satisfied with our experience with Flair Airlines. We booked flights for our family that gave us free flights for our kids. We were initially concerned after reading negative reviews, however we had no difficulties with our trip. I read through the website and understood in advance that I would need to pay for carry on or checked luggage, and that we would need to print the boarding passes in advance. I also understood that the airline counter closes an hour before the scheduled flight and made sure we left plenty of time to check in. With this being a discount airline, people need to be prepared that you pay for a seat - that's it. Anything else you will need to pay extra for - that's why this is discount. We found the staff to be pleasant, and the pilots talked to our kids and showed them the cockpit before the flight. Our son left his tablet on the flight and the airline was able to locate it and returned it to us en route home, which we were really appreciate of. I think the airline could make improvements to it's website to be clearer when booking, and it is difficult to connect with customer service.

### "Don't book with Flair"
Don't book with Flair. Was booked for 7:30 leave Abby, 11:30 arrive Hamilton direct. The day before when you are allowed to check in electronically, found out flights had been changed to 8:30 stop in Edmonton at 11 till 4pm then stuck on the plane till 11:30 stopping in Winnipeg where they don't let you off to eat then finally destination Hamilton at almost midnight--12 hours later than promised doing the milk run! Get this - return flight wasn't even the direct cities promised. Changed to Toronto and Vancouver, waited hours on phone to speak to anyone even slightly helpful and after four agents tossing you to transfer to the next guy and then the next guy ended up with a meticulously spelled out email itineraries at flair to send an electronic message. PS this email bounced back as invalid. This was the result after two and a half hours of phone time being tossed and transferred from four different agents. Fun stuff. Begging for partial refund for return flight or explanation has gotten me nowhere so far. Still waiting for 72 hours for different route electronic response, sad sad system.

### "horrible customer service"
Hamilton to Abbotsford via Edmonton. Absolutely horrible customer service. Do not fly with Flair. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I missed my first leg of this flight and managed to miraculously book a separate flight to make it in time for my connecting flight in Edmonton. I was informed by Flair Airlines that because I missed my first flight, even though there is a 5hr 45min layover in Edmonton my ticket was void. Absolutely abysmal customer service. Incredibly disappointed that they couldn't get me on the flight in Edmonton.

### "had to pay for carry on"
Vancouver to Toronto. This flight charges for carry on, the 7kg that they allow is only for the bag you are allowed to keep under your seat. Any carry on to be placed in the above cabin is charged 35$. I had booked a ticket for my cousin and she had to pay 35$ on the airport for the cabin carry on which is normally free with other flights. In no way is this a cheap airline. Would never recommend this airline.

### "disappointed and frustrated"
I flew from Calgary to Vancouver and Im really disappointed and frustrated. First, I coudn't do my checkin online all the time the system gives me error. At the airport the customer service  charge me for my small luggage even it was under 7kg, $52.5. When I call them there is no customer service - Ive been waiting for more than 1h to talk to someone and he told that he can do nothing for me. If you have to pay for a luggage make sure to take a receipt.otherwise you will be surprise when you check you visa.

### "they have no customer service"
I see how Flair is able to provide such cheap flights now - they have no customer service. I purchased check-in luggage at the time of booking and when I got to the ticket counter at YVR, the agent told me they had me marked as carry-on (I was flying to Kelowna). I told them that wasn't correct because I was flying to San Diego (with a different airline) and was gone for two weeks (i.e., I needed a proper suitcase). She said it wasn't a problem, but she would have to charge me for the check-in bag and gave me the customer care line and told me to call in and they could refund it as she had placed a note on my reservation. So I did and I waited online for well over an hour, only to find out the call centre cannot issue a refund and they would escalate it and I would hear from a manager within three days max. It's been two weeks and I've emailed them but no reply, so I called again, waited on hold for 20 minutes and was told the same thing. I complained that I hadn't heard back and had already been promised this call from management and was not satisfied with that answer. I find it very hard to believe that a) they can't issue refunds and b) there was no manager to talk to nor was there any way for her to transfer me to the 'refund department'. I'm livid. I'm a working grad student and have been double charged for my bags because the original agent promised me a simple refund process.

### "get a way to trick you"
Took Flair Airlines from Edmonton to Hamilton, everything was great, however when I was printing tickets and there was a choice to check in bags. ( I had only one bag I needed to check in). I was about to choose 1 bag but down below all the options says “keep existing bag ?” (for witch I paid fo ), so I chose this one and continued, got my e ticket and click gone. Got to the airport and they asked me to pay 35$ for my check in bag! Which is suppose to be 25$ when I booking online (I did everything online! ). so disappointed that this airline hiding details. (Why would they ask me to keep my existing bag to over charge at the airport?. Quite disappointed that this airline will get a way to trick you.

### "we were very pleased"
Not Verified |  Hamilton to Edmonton. We had read so many negative reviews about Flair. But we decided to take a chance because the fare was unbeatable and made it affordable to even go. We were so skeptics after all the reviews but we got to the airport, check in was so smooth. We waited for our flight, boarded and took off on time! It was an older aircraft, no bells and whistles (but that is the point of affordable flying!) but the leg room was awesome! Older planes had more room before they figured out they could pack everyone like sardines! My husband is 6’5” and was so happy his knees did not even touch the seat in front. The crew were awesome!! They served water twice and offered other drinks and snacks for purchase. One of the flight attendants was so kind. There was a 16 year old boy sitting behind us, flying alone to go see his grandma. He didn’t have a credit card and all the airlines only take CC these days and he really wanted a bag of chips. I was going to buy to for him but before I could even offer the flight a attendant told him it was on her. So kind. We landed, got our luggage within a few minutes and we were off. No complaints at all. For an economy 4.5 hour flight, which was truly economy, we were very pleased.

### "a huge disappointment"
Calgary to Vancouver. First time to fly with them and it was a huge disappointment and very frustrating! It’s not cheap at all, I just gave them a shot since they are new, but their policy, if you have a small luggage you must still check it in. There was a lady blocked me while I was going in line and asked me if I have checked in online and I must pay a fee for my small bag! I told her I travel with that small luggage all the time no problem, and her response was, ‘those are different airlines’. You pay extra $45 for that luggage which is such a money grab! Also, flight was delayed for over 2 hrs due to crew rest if they can’t handle how much guest flyers they book in, then they should not operate at all. Which they only have 1-2 flights in Calgary. This is the last time I will book with them. I am better off booking through Air Canada or Westjet. Never will I even look at flights through Flair Airlines. No star if possible in this review!

### "never made it on board"
I booked in March to fly to Vancouver fron Kelowna on June 29. The morning I was to depart, I tried to check in online, but there was no Flair flight to Vancouver that day. I went to the airport, because I could not get through to the customer service line. I was told at the Kelowna ticket counter that my flight had been changed to June 27 (two days prior), and there was no flight to Vancouver that day. I received no notice of this change. After escalated tempers because they offered me unsatisfactory alternatives, they booked me on an Air Canada which was flying direct to Vancouver. The other alternatives were flying to Edmonton and then back to Vancouver, or flying to Abbotsford and taking a taxi to Vancouver. I was going to a celebration of life and neither of these options was going to work, as the arrival times would get me to Vancouver AFTER the celebration. I managed to get to Vancouver, but the flight they booked me to return was three days AFTER I needed to be back. After numerous hours waiting to get through to the customer service line, and numerous emails to the "consolidation department", nothing was done and I was stranded in Vancouver. As it was the Canada Day long weekend, I was stressed for the whole duration, wondering how I was going to get home and back to work on Tuesday. Finally, after hearing NOTHING from the consolidation department, I booked a bus ticket home. I have never had such terrible service in my life. They ignore, refuse to offer any assistance for the screw-up they caused, recite the same unhelpful rhetoric no matter what you say to them, and are completely oblivious to decent service. No "discount fare" is worth the hell this airline caused me. What was supposed to be a family weekend to say goodbye to a beloved family member turned into a total farce, trying to get answers from a company that clearly doesn't care about it's customer base. And as for the rating out of 10, mine is a ZERO, except the indicator won't let me select that. Value for the money is also ZERO, as I am now out of pocket the return flight AND the bus ticket i had to purchase. Ground service? ZERO. Why was I not notified of the change in my flight? Because they didn't bother. Seat comfort? Never made it on board. Cabin Staff service? Again, never made it on board.

### "a constant headache"
I flew from Edmonton to Abbotsford and then back with Flair Air. Utter mistake. I have had nothing but problems since choosing my itinerary. I paid for “flex” at initial booking. They would not answer the phone lines they had provided to me. I spent hours on hold on the 1-800 line and was told I could only do things online. So I did that, still not correct. After 5+ emails, my itinerary was finalized. Checking in at Edmonton, they do not tell you that if you don’t check in online, they charge you. So I was shoved off to the side of the line until I checked in, like many others. It was complete chaos. When we finally boarded, we could not take off because they had screwed up their manifest. Even the pilot was extremely annoyed. Checking in at Abbotsford was better but now I’ve been waiting nearly 2 hours for my flight, as it’s not even here. Every time they make an announcement, they add another hour. Their staff are unorganized, not at all helpful and uncaring. Yes, you save a bit of money but you get a constant headache. Never again will I fly with this airline.

### "our luggage never arrived"
Not Verified | Flight was Victoria to Winnipeg, via Edmonton. My seat from Edmonton was so small, my knees jammed into the arm rests of the next row. At 6 foot 1 am I now required handicap seating? On all flights (there and back) attendance was done after we had already boarded. They seemed to lose track of who was on the flight regularly. First bag, and carry-on cost an arm and a leg. No snacks given on the flight, and were outrageously priced. After delays in Victoria, we arrived just in time for our connecting flight in Edmonton. Arriving in Winnipeg, our luggage never arrived. We have now been told we may need to wait up to 5 business days upon them finding our luggage (no time table). A number of important items were in the luggage, not only will we have to purchase them at our cost to replace, it has set us back weeks!

### "I missed my flight"
The girls were on their phones, couldn’t get checked in so I missed my flight, no refund and they were so rude. When I called the number they gave me they said sorry can’t help you but you can re book for 290. Would not fly Flair Airlines again, would rather drive next time. Ended up booking with Westjet much better to deal with and friendly.

### "would not accommodate us"
Edmonton to Kelowna. 24hrs before our flight we went to check-in only to find out the flight we had booked, paid for, and received an e-ticket for would not be taking 2 members of our bridal party to our group event. Flair Airlines then told us that they would not be able to get them there until 26 hrs later. They did not have any flights of their own to to put 2 people on to arrive in the same day nor would they get us on another flight through a different airline. As a large party of people we had to book many other accommodations that we’re dependent on our group size which we now do not qualify for and must bare the financial burden of. Flair Airlines would not accommodate us onto another flight subsequently purging us of hundreds of dollars in other planned event expenditures. Spend the extra $50 and get your flights through a different airline if you intend to experience the once in a life time events you had planned with your family and friends.

### "No frills = no service"
Not Verified | Hamilton to Winnipeg. I've been trying to reach the baggage department since my flight. They can only be contacted be email. No phone number can be supplied by Flair staff. They don't respond to inquiries. Extremely frustrating. No frills = no service?

### "Would 100% recommend"
Flew Vancouver to Calgary with Flair Airlines. Great experience. Would 100% recommend. The more support this airline gets the better for us all as they will get even better which will make travel more affordable in Canada. We have been ripped off by the airline monopoly for way too long. Make sure you read and follow the terms and conditions and you’ll have a great experience with no need to complain about fees that is your own fault for not reading. Flair has full disclosure there are no hidden fees.

### "Unacceptable customer service"
Winnipeg to Vancouver. Unacceptable customer service. Trying to rebook for a funeral. On 3 different phone lines over 2.5 hours and still waiting for a customer representative. Had to pay for carry on luggage. When booked online they did not disclose this! Will never fly with this company again!

### "delay is over an hour"
Edmonton to Vancouver. I was here an hour before my flight but if I was 1 second late like 59 min before departure they would deny me to fly. But since a YWG flight left late out of YWG 25 min and they have 18 passengers connecting they held our flight to wait for them to land, disembark, board, then we need an updated clearance for take off delay is over an hour. So good to know if you are late for your flight you can still board 20min after the plane was suppose to leave. I also would like to know who to charge my time to because if it was me holding up the plane they would be looking at me to cover extra expenses. Seems a little one sided and it is time for us to stand up and be heard.

### "had the best of service"
Hamilton to Winnipeg. We booked with Flair many month ago, then two weeks prior to flying I decided to read some reviews, not the correct order to do so. I am so happy to write that our flight was completely on time and we had the best of service. Polite kind caring people who seemed to want to make our trip pleasant. It was clearly stated with our great prices for flying, there were no extras included, so we did pay for our checked bag (before arriving at airport as was suggested by flair air) we did pay for coffee or food on board if we wanted it. The boarding was very fast, starting with last rows first, excellent idea. The cabin staff was friendly, offered help even asked us to let them know if they could make our flight more pleasant. If you are thinking of flying with Flair air please don't let the negative comments discourage you. If you are looking for great prices and have realistic expectations you will be pleasantly surprised with flying with Flair air. We will not hesitate to use Flair air on our next trip.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed in this airline. We initially chose this airline because of the price but it I feel so ripped off! My husband left the house at 6:30 am to be on time for this 9:00 am flight, no one was at the counter, no one to help him. He was there within the “60 min cut off” time and ended up getting very poor customer service and he was not able to board. No refunds, no other discount or later flight nor any apology was given, will never fly this  airline ever again. Save your time and money - fly with the big names!

### "horrible service"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Winnipeg. Horrible service. No idea what they are doing at the check in. Wanted to charge us extra for the hockey sticks with our hockey bag despite me showing them their own policy. Could not have two electronic boarding passes on Saturday my phone despite one being for a 10 year old. Wanted to charge us an extra 10$ for the paper boarding pass. Complete joke.

### "clearly don't value our time"
Kelowna to Vancouver. It felt like forever, waiting in that small airport. In the end, I could have driven there before I eventually arrived. I am not even sure why I chose to fly this airline, it was a good deal, but I would have rather paid to fly Westjet and make it there on time. I waited on hold for over an hour this morning (June 5th) to speak to someone who was incompetent. Did not understand how to refund me, I don't think he even knew what I was talking about. He advised me to fill out a form for a refund, which I doubt I will get. This airline needs all the money they can get to stay afloat. I think what irritates me the most is that they clearly don't value our time. Sure the flight was only $125, but 6 hours of my time was wasted. They don't know what I missed out on in my final destination nor do they care. If this were an airline with any sense of integrity they would refund rightfully unhappy customers, and ensure they will do better next time. However, the flight attendants were nice, that was the only upside. If you fly this airline be cautious of the potential delays and dissatisfaction. If you have nothing but time, you should definitely give them a try, as for me, never again.

### "Worst experience ever"
I was on the same flight as the person below me on May 25, except I was stuck in Kelowna airport for 5 hours and on the Tarmac in Vancouver for over a hour. I was stopping in Edmonton but the flight was continuing on to Toronto. I was supposed to get in at 5.35 and I got in at 11.30 with zero explanation and even after I had emailed the company, they said they could not offer any compensation. I never even got the $10 food voucher. Worst experience ever. Not only that, the flight was rough and the plane seemed rickety to me. On my way home, I had paid for the bundle that gave me a checked bag and priority booking. If I hadn't had all my printed documents, they would have charged me the $36 for a checked bag again. Then I was told by the supervisor I had priority booking, so when we were boarding I went when they called priority booking and the same lady said I didn't have priority booking and I just paid for a carry on (which I obviously didn't have). I finally told her I paid for the bundle (again) and she let me on. I have never felt this way after a flight and will never fly Flair again, it's not work the cheap fare.

### "no refunds given at all"
❌ Not Verified |  Kelowna to Vancouver. Prepurchased my tickets for my holidays in July. Was planning on driving to BC and then flighing to Vancouver. Due to holiday changes I needed to change my departure date and departure location. Called to change ticket and got informed that it was going to cost me 125.00 on top of ticket price to change it. Then got informed that Flair Airlines did not have any flights leaving from where I needed to leave from then or anytime close to it. Asked them to then refund my ticket so could book with another airline and got told it was going to cost 125.00 to cancel and that no refunds given at all for any remaining money from the ticket Do not use this company ever! I wish I had checked reviews before trying this company!

### "Never ever fly with Flair"
Flair is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Every single time I have flown with Flair, I have faced delays of more than 8 to 9 hours. Currently, its 11.16 pm (25th May) and I am waiting in the lounge at Edmonton airport for my Toronto flight at 12.15 am (26th May) which was originally supposed to take off at 6.15pm (25th May) and then at 10.15pm and then at 11.00 pm and now at 12.15 am. Flair has no respect for others time. Even the staff at the Flair counter seem to be highly arrogant and unapologetic. Needless to say, I would like to be heavily compensated for my lost time and energy. Lesson Learned: Never ever fly with Flair.

### "was delayed 6.5 hours "
Kelowna to Vancouver. Flight was delayed 6.5 hours on a flight of 45 minutes. I spent almost 9 hours of my life waiting for a 45 minute flight. The YLW website was updated saying we departed 40 minutes before we actually did -  ridiculous. Never fly with Flair. Spend the extra $100 to fly with a trusted company.

### "flight kept being delayed"
❌ Not Verified |  Vancouver to Toronto. I have never experienced anything like this. From the moment at check-in the flight kept being delayed from 3 PM departure it finally took off at 9 PM. There was no explanation given and the only compensation at the airport was a measly $10 food voucher. One stop in Edmonton where we sat for two hours on the tarmac. The only explanation given was that the mechanic had to go back to his shop for a manual! Finally we were exited from the plane and our options given were a flight that may take off in the next 36 hours or a full refund. No-brainer rebooked with Air Canada.

### "lost my baggage"
Kelowna to Winnipeg via Edmonton. Flair Airlines lost my baggage, even though it was a domestic flight. I have not even heard from them since landing in Winnipeg. I am waiting in a hotel since this isn't my last stop and they haven't been in touch with me to even let me know if they have found it. Do not fly with them. Terrible service. They won't even pay for my hotel which I am only staying in because they have lost all my baggage.

### "say that Flair did a great job"
I flew with Flair for the first time today. I fly a few times a year between Kelowna and Edmonton, a short flight but I have had issues with other airlines departing on time. The flight was very cheap and I figured to give it a try despite the negative reviews I had read. Well I would like to say that Flair did a great job! Yes it was a no frills flight but we departed and arrived on time. No issues, the staff were courteous and friendly and the plane was clean. I would say overall that is was $50 very well spent and I will plan on flying with Flair in the future. It’s nice that flying can be so affordable. Hats off to Flair and their staff/crews.

### "they refused her to board"
Edmonton to Hamilton. I booked a ticket for a friend, coming from Edmonton to Ontario for a week-end in Niagara through an online travel agent and made a minor one letter alphabetic error in her surname. Called the traveling agent, 5 weeks before the flight to correct the error, sent them a mail - they responded that they've instructed the airline to effect the correction. Called Flair same day for hours unending no customer service representative picked. My friend did same no customer service picked our several calls. On the day my friend was to travel she got to Edmonton airport 3 hrs before the flight to see if this could be corrected, they checked her in from the front counter and gave her boarding pass with the error not corrected, she got to the gate, during boarding they refused her to board, theirs is nothing she didn't tell flair representative at that point with all evidence. she went home crying, as all her initial engagement for that weekend in Ontario was messed up, accommodation reservation paid for went to waste, and till now nobody had gotten back to either my self or her self.

### "I want to change my flight"
Edmonton to Vancouver. My boyfriend booked a flight for me and after his booking we discussed I want to change my flight and fly a day earlier. I know we were out of the 24 hour "free cancellation" period so I had called to pay a 125$ change fee. I was on hold with flair air for 25 mins no answer so I decided to email to change my flight and pay extra. Still no answer. Again today my partner called, they picked up, and as he was almost done changing the flight when the representative hung up on him! Then again he called, was on hold for an hour and 45 mins and they also hung up on him. We accepted the fact to pay extra, but we can't even be helped to change our flight? What kind of service is this?

### "2hrs trying to check in"
Edmonton to Abbotsford. They are the cheapest, beats out westjet by usually $30-$50 per leg. But spent 2hrs trying to check in online. Does not work. This is basic for airlines - online check in? Phone call to customer service was useless. They just point you to the Help site again - futile. Then they said I have to pay to check in in-person tomorrow. Ridiculous. Cannot wait for Swoop and WestJet to match their prices.

### "definitely not recommend this airline"
Edmonton to Hamilton via Winnipeg. I flew out of Edmonton to Hamilton. The aircraft was unkept. Debris and garbage on the floors as well as seats. I found the flight attendants to be very rude. I wasn’t aware of the over an hour long stop the flight was making in Winnipeg as when I booked it wasn’t mentioned as well as said direct flight. This also caused my flight to land an hour later causing my ride to have to wait around for my delayed arrival. A couple days into my holiday I received an email saying they were changing my flight home to depart from Toronto instead of Hamilton. I had no means of transportation to Toronto. I called Flair and waited on hold for several hours without ever getting to speak to anyone. I emailed them and requested to fly out of Hamilton a day early. I also requested for someone to call me back. Over 24 hrs later I received an email of an updated flight itinerary. Thankfully they changed my flight but I was hoping to speak to someone or have my concerns addressed. Neither which happened. Now I’m sitting at the airport and just heard that my flight is delayed. I would definitely not recommend this airline. Their cheaper price tag doesn’t make up for the horrible service as well as the charge to have coffee and snack during the flight.. In addition there isn’t any electrical outlets for phones/laptops and no entertainment available.

### "Customer service did not exist"
Kelowna to Edmonton. On January 11th I had the unfortunate experience of flying from Kelowna to Edmonton with flair airlines. While the staff were kind, the communication was extremely poor. While waiting in the Kelowna airport we were advised that there was a delay with our flight and that we would perhaps be rerouted and might be home in Edmonton around 1930hrs. They announced they would be updating the awaiting passengers but failed to do so. Any announcements that were made were very quiet (as opposed to all other airlines who announced very loudly and clear), and the information was very unsure and did not provide very important information to the passengers. In order to obtain any important information, passengers were forced to approach the desk to ask the staff. I found staff to be unprofessional in their communication with passengers. Some passengers boarded our plane in Kelowna, which got rerouted to Edmonton via Abbotsford, and didn't even know it was going to be making the additional stop. Passengers behind me thought they boarded the incorrect plane because it was not explained clearly what was happening. In addition to that, seating turned into a "free for all" as it was open seating. Something that was again not announced to passengers and so an unnecessary amount of confusion ensued. Again proper communication could have alleviated a lot of these frustrations. Ultimately the goal is to get to your destination on time, and not to get any "free flight" or "travel voucher", but I do have to say that I was very surprised and unimpressed that nothing was offered to passengers to apologize for the supreme confusion and significant delay in flight (we got into Edmonton almost 7 hours later than we were supposed to). When we landed in Abbotsford, flight crews switched out and all seemed confused as to what was happening. Passengers boarded in Abbotsford and were told to look for their assigned seats, while passengers from Kelowna were still sitting in the "open seating" seats from the previous flight. The flight attendants changed their minds multiple times as to if it was going to remain open seating or Kelowna passengers were to move to their original boarding pass seats. Mass confusion ensued and oncoming passengers began getting angry with Kelowna passengers that were told to remain in their open seating seats. It was terrible. Flight attendants stood by watching passengers getting yelled at by other passengers and failing to explain clearly to people what was going on. I have been flying regularly since I was 5 years old (and am now 33) and this is hands down the absolute worst flying experience of my life. It was disorganized, miscommunicated and not even and apology was said. Customer service did not exist in this airline today and it was such a shame.
