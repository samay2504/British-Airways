### "They Simply cancelled the flight"
They Simply cancelled the flight. Which affects all my vacation plan. No proper response from the airline team. When I tried to change the date of they are asking for fresh payment.

### "I have never had this kind of experience"
Not Verified |  Pathetic front desk, impolite and worst staff experience at Mangalore airport. Feels like we are approaching a local bus station. Need to review, change your staff or else continue having these arrogant, rude staff. As a frequent flyer on other airlines I have never had this kind of experience.

### "take 30 days for the refund"
Worst Airline ever I have come across so far, extremely disappointed with the service. I had to travel to Patna on Monday 09/08/2021 for which the ticket was booked 1 month in advance. The day of travel, I visited the Airport by spending Rs.1000 in Cab for 50kms. After reaching the Airport the authorities said flight has been cancelled by the Airline. It was so shocking for me that how irresponsible the Go First airlines are to not even having basic work ethics about informing the customer about it. I was told they had sent email, now tell me person who need to reach the airport at 8:00 in the morning will sleep by 10pm to wake up early or be waiting and reading the emails and messages till late night. No concern to at least call the customer and inform about the cancellation. Secondly, I was informed at the Go First counter on the same day 09/08/2021, that full amount will be refunded within 5 days which is yet not over for them I think. Today I happened to call them and check the refund status they said it will take 30 days for the refund and will go to MMT then I need to contact them to get the refund and there will be service charges it seems.

### "treat their passengers like fools"
I arrived early for my scheduled flight Kochi to Srinagar via Mumbai. It was scheduled at 1030am but I landed at Mumbai 1030. Due to that I couldn't board my flight. The airline clearly knows the landing time and I'm going to miss my connection flight, but I have not received any single call regarding this even your staff could have inform me during checking. I visited the help desk for the issue they said no more flights for today, and tomorrows flight's also cancelled. Next day I booked indigo flight to the destination from my pocket. Go Air is worst airline, they treat their passengers like fools.

### "last time I travelled on GoAir"
I booked a flight on August 2nd for 4 members (Myself, wife, 2 kids). I was very happy to see a fight which was departing early from Bangalore to Jaipur. However 3 days before travel, the flight was rescheduled at 11:30 AM. After a day, It was rescheduled for 11:00 AM. Actually, I booked this flight so that I could reach Jaipur early and then drive from Jaipur to Hanumangarh. One day before the travel, it was rescheduled at 3:30 PM. In the airport, Flight was again delayed and left around 4: 20 PM. Because of this inconvenience, we had to stay in Jaipur and leave next day morning. I had specially spoken to Customer care regarding travelling with 2 small kids and they agreed to put our cabin baggage to checkin baggage as one luggage by hearing about our travel. However, on the airport counter, the lady said i cannot do so and need to speak with customer care. Sir, if you have issue, you need to submit a complaint. From my side, I was totally helpless by hearing from their side. Frankly, they need to have a uniformity regarding their rules and regulation. If they agreed anything through customer support, they need to update that on my booking. Anyways, after a long struggle and repeated requests, they agreed. Personally, This was my first and last time I travelled on GoAir.

### "refund pending from January 2020"
Worst Experience Ever! I am a frequent traveler and this was my second time with this third class airline. Last moment they cancel your flight and no refund at all. No customer support at all. I have my refund pending from January 2020 for the flight which was cancelled from their end, i wrote several emails but no reply.

### "they cancelled my direct flight"
Not Verified |  Worst airline. This is my third experience with the airlines where they cancelled my direct flight and changed it into flight with many stops the day before the flight. Highly unprofessional and confused airlines. Don’t choose to travel by them

### "No professionalism at all"
Not Verified |  Worst service ever. Rerouted my direct flight to Lucknow, made my journey 2.5 hours longer, add to that another 1 hour for operational delays. Charged for web check in done online or at the airport both. Bad service. No professionalism at all. No COVID safety precautions. Sprayed disinfectants right next to where passengers were seated. Never flying with GoAir again.

### "won't be giving me my partial refund"
Probably one of the worst airlines to travel. They called me 2 hours before my flight to inform me that my flight is canceled when I was on my way to the airport and upon asking for refund they told they won't be giving me my partial refund for the flight that got cancelled by the airline. I'd honestly request everyone not to ever ever travel through GoAir.

### "refund not yet received"
Ticket cancelled Automatically and refund not yet received. Very poor service, no one to answer customer service in UAE and called Indian number many time and wasted my money. I will never use Go Air service in my life.

### "I have not received any refund"
I would not recommend this airline. I booked my flight from Delhi to Pune for 5th June, 21. They canceled the flight just one day prior to the departure. I tried to call them so many times for rescheduling. First of all they have a long process that you need to follow before you can connect to their executive. You need to press various numbers. Then they’ll tell you that their executives are busy and if you want them to call you back, you need to press 1. Its been almost a month and even after a couple of calls that I made to them, I’m still expecting a call back from them because I have not received any refund from their end. They didn’t even have the courtesy to offer me an option of rescheduling the flight when they had canceled the former one. Infact, they asked me for more money to reschedule.

### "cancelled flight without any information"
Worst airline company. They cancelled my flight for July 2021 without any information to passengers and no refund of the money. They are cheating customers with a foolish contact centre system, always saying it is busy and all call centre staff are busy even call at midnight / 2'o clock.

### "not providing full refund"
Me and my husband booked air ticket from Sharjah to Kannur and flight got cancelled. The airline is not providing full refund instead deducting around 300 AED For their fault.

### "You cannot cheat your customers in this manner"
My original flight was scheduled for 23/04/2021 at 7.50am from Chandigarh to Mumbai which got canceled. I was told I have the option of either a full refund or a free rescheduling for up to 4 days. I rescheduled to 27/04/2021 for a 7.50am flight again. Seeing that this flight was getting canceled so often, I called GoAir yesterday (26/4/2021). Upon asking the agent what would happen if the second flight got canceled too, I was told I will get the same options - a full refund or a free rescheduling up to 4 days. Well, to my surprise, my second flight got canceled again. So I called customer care again and now I am being told that either I have to pay a price difference or a cancellation fee. This is utter nonsense. The flight was canceled on your end due to your operational errors. I did not willingly cancel this flight. It is not on me to pay any fare differences or cancelation charges. Rather, I demand a compensation in addition to the full refund that I rightfully deserve. The compensation should take into consideration the fact that I have needed to reschedule my flight twice and it has already disrupted my trip. As well as the many hours I spent talking to your customer care agents. Your official clearly states that in case of a flight cancelation, GoAir will bear full responsibility for the cancelation and assist their customers with either a rebooking free of charge or a free cancellation and full refund. Your agent blatantly lied to my face about a "new policy" requiring me to pay a price difference or a cancellation fee. This is absolutely intolerable. You cannot cheat your customers in this manner.

### "polite and were really helpful"
I would like to thank Sandeep and his team who were so polite and were really helpful throughout the flight. Sandeep also offered me a tea for which he did not charge anything even after i tried paying it. The team was so polite and helped him each time. I Thank you for making my this journey so amazing.

### "my worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  It is my worst airline experience ever. I was booked for 04:50 flight but the flight was rescheduled to 08:10 but no prior information per mail or message was provided. Due to Corona and Current Lockdown i came 3 hours early but now i have to wait for 5 hours. The waiting area was not sanitized as well as dirty. PS: Please provide prior Information or at least have a sympathetic staff.

### "customer liability to contact airline"
One of the worst flights. had booking in 8:25am in morning from LKO to DLI. GO air has preponed it to 7:00 am without informing me.. I had missed the flight as I arrived at 6:30am in morning. When I talked with GOair attendant, they said it customer liability to contact airline. They also had refused to provide any refund or reschedule.

### "Till date not got any refund"
Very pathetic customer service My travel was unfortunately was in Lockdown period, so flights got cancelled. However GO Air has promised me in December 20 to refund the amount within 10 working days. Till date not got any refund neither they give proper answers regarding my refund status. I am still following up with customer service every time they are extending dates Very Unprofessional staff, lack of training and lack of Knowledge as well.

### " Very unprofessional"
Not Verified |  I had booked a direct flight from Pune to Lucknow which was due to depart on 11 March 2021. The flight was cancelled just one day before of departure. After the cancellation, they gave very few options for the flight which was taking 10-12 Hrs to reach to Lucknow which was on 12 March. since they don't have any options for flights to Lucknow I requested them to accommodate me in some other flight to Delhi and thereafter i will manage my journey to Lucknow, initially they told that they can't do the sector changes and after some time they said just for me exceptions are made but will have to pay the difference in fare and an additional 3000 Rs as rescheduling charges. I was not ready to pay the fare difference since the change was due to their flight cancellation. Weird policies and Poor customer service. Also they didn't refund me the full amount as well. Very unprofessional from their end.

### "Such a bad experience"
Not Verified |  Not the best airline to book flights. I had never traveled Go Air but booked flights for BLR-SXR flight and 2 days before departure they cancel the flights for operational reason. I had to either cancel my 10 year wedding anniversary trip of 8 days to Kashmir or book paying 3 times the original price on another airlines. They said they can reschedule the trip only after 4 days from the journey date. Such a bad experience, lost peace of mind and money for booking GO Air, lesson learnt and lost money.

### "never going to travel by GoAir again"
Very bad experience. Their customer support is very unfriendly. They claim to be the cheapest airline. Also due to COVID, they say it's mandatory to do the web check-in. At the time of web check-in, they charge you for seat selection. They claim that middle seats are free during the certain time window, and between some rows in the plane, but ultimately when 3 people are travelling, you can expect two of them to have to pay for the seat selection - which comes to around 500-600 at least. Their customer care says it's by the policy they don't provide automatic seat selection, and the customers have to do the seat selection, which is a paid service! A quite cunning way to fetch extra money from customers, while still claiming to be the cheapest airfare airline. Very disappointed. I am never going to travel by GoAir again! !

### "Poor customer service"
I had booked a flight to Coimbatore from Mumbai which was due to depart on 4th feb and return ticket on 7th both the flights was cancelled but the airline didn't inform me of this by mail or message. I came to know about the flights cancellation by luck as i was confirming about my web checkin details. If i hadn't done this i would have been in the dark about the flight cancellation. Highly unprofessional behaviour of this airline and when i called the airline they told me yes the flight is cancelled . When i requested them to accommodate me in some other flight whether Calicut or cochin they told if i want they can reschedule the flight but will have to pay the difference in fare and an additional 3000 rs as rescheduling charges. I was ready to pay the fare difference but why should i pay the rescheduling charge when the rescheduling was due to their flight cancellation. Poor customer service.

### "sheer Unprofessionalism from them"
On 27th January 2021, I booked 6 tickets (DEL To GOI Via BOM) which was scheduled at 0800 today. Despite doing the Web Check-in and printing the Boarding Passes, I suddenly get to know that the flight has been cancelled and that too without any prior notification from Go Air. I have travelled 500 KMs with my wife and 4 years old daughter to catch the flight and now when I have reached Delhi after travelling the entire night, I get to know that the flight has been cancelled and that too when I proactively checked the same. The worst part is that Go Air is refusing to make any sort of adjustment despite such behaviour. I requested them to shift us in another flight which reaches Goa at the same time, but they denied to cater this request upfront. We are also willing to travel separately in different flights, but Go Air still did not agree. Go Air is offering us to shift us in a flight that departs at 2000 and reaches Goa at 0700. What am I suppose to do with my wife and 4 years old daughter for 24 Hours? You will be furious to know that Go Air has several flights from DEL To GOI today, but are still not willing to assist despite the blunder and sheer Unprofessionalism from them.

### "Her conduct towards me was compassionate and considerate"
I recently travelled with GoAir from Srinagar to Chandigarh. My review of the flight experience would be highly positive. The flight was comfortable and the food available was fresh and tasty. I would especially a cabin crew member, I was scared of the turbulence and I conveyed my fear to her. Her conduct towards me was compassionate and considerate. She made me feel less anxiety and helped me relax. Her explanation of aircraft turbulence helped me overcome my fear of flights to a large extent. I would be especially thankful to her.

### "Highly disappointed"
GoAirs website being horribly designed got me to book a connecting flight with long haul when there was direct flight available. I cancelled my flight with 60 seconds of booking because they said I would get a 100% refund. Of course this wasn’t the case. They still haven’t provided me a full refund 2 weeks later. Highly disappointed.

### "Worst experience ever"
Delhi to Bangalore. Worst experience ever. I had 1 stop flight. First flight delayed for like an hour. Next flight delayed for 6 hours without any further notice. This is my first and last time going with this company

### "We as passengers expect some amount of certainty before our travel"
Not Verified |  Flight from Srinagar to Mumbai was cancelled arbitrarily due to poor weather and passengers weren’t informed until they reached the airport. Flight kept getting delayed and eventually got cancelled. Airline offered accommodation for 7 days (which we didn’t take) and agreed to defer our tickets to a later date. We were supposed to travel on 7/1/2021 but we got our confirmed ticket from the airline for 12/1/2021. Apparently, flights for an earlier day was unavailable. On 8/1/2021 in the evening, we get our confirmation tickets from the airline for our upcoming journey on 12th. However, this changed real quick as a mail was sent by the airline at 10.30pm on the same day saying that we have been allotted seats in the following day’s (9/1/2021) flight which was scheduled at 11.40am. Due to unfavourable weather conditions in Srinagar, there was heavy traffic outside the airport which could take up to 2-3 hours to clear. It is important that passengers are informed much ahead of time so that they are prepared and have sufficient time in hand. Minimum of 24 hours prior notice should be given to the passengers in case of any changes so they can plan their day accordingly. What was done by GoAir is extremely unfair as passengers cannot be taken on a ride like this. We as passengers expect some amount of certainty before our travel. Airline cannot change the date of departure as per the whims and fancies and should be considerate of their fellow passengers. The call centre staff are most unhelpful of the lot. They fail to provide basic information regarding the flight. There are no possible ways by which you can put forth your grievance. As passengers, we expect service for the price we pay. Attitude of the airline towards customers is very poor. Will strongly dissuade people from flying this airline unless they want confusion and uncertainty until the very last moment of their travel.

### "have a really bad service"
I had a flight on 24 May 2020 from Delhi to Phuket which was cancelled by itself due to pandemic, but i have been calling and sending mails since last 7-8months now but they never respond to any of my mails. They even booked my flight on 13 dec 2020 which they didn't inform me about. GoAir have a really bad service.

### "unprofessional and unacceptable"
Highly unprofessional and unacceptable. Today was my flight on 4:30pm Delhi to Ranchi and they cancelled my flight. And you haven't informed me. I reached to the airport asked you to do something. It's an emergency I have to go. You guys should learn from indigo. Very bad experience I ever had. I will never take your service.

### "don't pay the cancellation fee"
I had a flight from Ranchi to Delhi on 12/12/2020 at 20:25. My next flight was from Delhi to San Francisco on 13/12/2020 at 4:30 am in morning. My layover was 6 hours. On 8/12/2020 afternoon, Go Air agent called informing that my flight is cancelled and I have two options to choose from: Option 1. Cancel flight and get full refund of 2700 INR. Option 2. Book another flight with Go Air which departs at 8:00 am in morning on 12th and arrives Delhi at 9:45 am (it is only flight which helps me to board my international flight) . Which leads to layover of 17 hours during COVID at Delhi airport. This flight cost 8000 INR I requested for hotel accommodation(inside or outside airport, not a lavish one) 2. to pay the difference amount, if I book the flight with different airline. The cost of other GoAIR flight offered now is 8000 INR. So the refund is 2700 plus the remaining amount to be paid by Go Air. A supervisor to come on the call. The agent called on 8/12/2020 and said I will get call from supervisor but that didn't happen till 10/12/2020, 6 am. Finally I called them and after 2 hours of being in the queue, someone answered the call at 8ish am. I explained whole scenario and requested for my requirements. The agent denied to give call to supervisor for different reasons and neither provide me any solution. On top of it the agent gave me a deadline to cancel or reschedule the flight on 10/12/2020. If it was that strict why nobody bothered to call and tell me this for 2 days while I was waiting for a call from supervisor. So here I am concluding to the irresponsible service airlines Go Air. These airlines refunds you in penny if you cancel the flight as they charge the cancellation amount and convenience fee. However, they don't pay the cancellation fee when they cancel it. In those cases they are only liable to pay full amount but not the cancellation/inconvenience fee. They are ready to give a Go Air flight worth 8000k but not ready to pay 8000 if I book flight with different airlines which reduces my layover time. They are cancelling a flight and in return of it I am getting a layover of 17 hours during pandemic and they are not ready to provide accommodation. A worst airline which is not at all concerned about customer health and behaving with zero responsibility in the name of customer service. Thankyou for the inconvenience and your service

### "irritated with your careless attitude"
Very bad service to deliver baggage. Its been 5 days after arrival, and still not yet received baggage from airport. As per the airport staff, baggage was supposed to be delivered on third day of travel. From Go Air, its a big shame and careless for customers and I don't want to travel with you anymore. At least you need to answer the phone or contact me for the update. Very poor, bad service and irritated with your careless attitude. No one responsible for customer queries and baggage, and I don't know how you can run the airline in this way.

### "Their rating should be in negative value"
Not Verified |  Short and crisp review : Experience a turbulent drive from the time of booking in this flight till the time you board the flight if it isn't cancelled by then somehow. Moreover, if you call the customer care department, 24 hours will be inadequate for them to receive the call. Their rating should be in negative value. Zero is too respectful for them.

### "Worst experience ever had"
My Flight in May 2020 was cancelled by airlines due to lock down and then after they are not even picking up the call. No refund option. Contact details given are of not use because the never reply and never pickup calls. Worst experience ever had. They just eat my money, from last four months I'm calling them for refund but they not picked even single call.

### "They should issue a credit note"
Flight were cancelled. Running behind them for refund as two of the traveller were kids and we didn't want them to travel in this pandemic situation. But they are so worst that they have stopped responding to my emails, calls, twitter etc. They are the worst and doesn't want the Safety of your kids. They should issue a credit note so that any adult from family can travel but they don't support / don't revert.

### "cancelled without any notice"
My husband was supposed to fly with GoAir on 1th of November. He's been waiting for this flight for more than a week in hotel. Because there are no ferries running in between the island of Andamans. To avoid any complications and unnecessary cancellation he's been waiting in Port Blair (where the airport is) since 22 of October. Now, I was doing his online check-in just to found out that his flight has been cancelled without any notice. The only option for him is to reschedule the flight, conveniently there is another flight he will just have to pay another 7,5k to reschedule! What is wrong with these people? He is waiting for a week for a flight that was financially acceptable for us instead of flying the same day he reached Port Blair with another flight provider for 15k just to pay even more waiting, flying with GoAir!

### "No refund option"
Not Verified |  My Flight cancelled by airlines and then after they are not even picking up the call. No refund option. Contact details given are of not use because the never reply and never pickup calls. Worst experience ever had. They just eat my money, from last four months I'm calling them for refund but they not picked even single call.

### "a highly unprofessional and unacceptable approach"
I booked a seat on flight no. G8-175 on 31 August 2020, scheduled to depart from Lucknow (LKO) to New Delhi (DEL) at 18.35. On 17 September 2020, I received an email stating that for your GoAir flight G8-175 from Lucknow (LKO) to New Delhi (DEL) on 01 Oct '20 at 18.35 hrs has been rescheduled to depart at 22.10 hrs on 01 Oct '20. That means the flight has been postponed for 3 hours 35 minutes. That's okay because amid this COVID-19 Pandemic, many things are beyond our control so little bit adjustments are acceptable. Again on 30 September 2020 at 11.55am, I received an email that: GoAir would like to inform you that your flight G8 175 on 01 Oct '20 from Lucknow (LKO) to New Delhi (DEL) is scheduled to depart Lucknow (LKO) at 09.20 and arrive New Delhi (DEL) at 10.30. That means the flight has now been preponed for 12 hours 50 minutes. At a short notice of less than 24 hours, it was informed that an evening flight has been rescheduled to a morning time. October 01, 2020 (Thursday) was a working day, so it is common sense that a person is booking the evening flight so that the work/office may be attended during the day time. Without the consent of the passenger, how can the airlines decide that someone will be able to skip the office. It is a highly unprofessional and unacceptable approach. Due to the negligent policies and incompetent services, I was not able to reach Delhi on the night of October 01, 2020.

### "Never trust this airline"
I booked my flight before Covid. From March end onwards I tried calling the airline for cancellation. Since there was no response I cancelled it online, which is an email confirmation as per Goair before my scheduled flight date. No answer until July. Never answer call. Now offering credit shel. Since I am a Canadian, I don’t wish to fly anymore in next two years. Asked for paid cancellation. My ticket was for 200 USD. As refunds they are offering 19 USD. As per my ticket, I was having free cancellation. Now they don’t want to pay my money. Never trust this airline.

### "cancelled the flight for no reason"
They cancelled the flight for no reason when all the other flights from other airlines were functional. They just get your money pay themselves and say they had to cancel it when there was no lockdown. In fact this is second time.

### "never refund your money"
I will suggest not to book your flight with GoAir as they will not inform on time about the flight cancellation, they never pick customer service helpline no and will never refund your money. If you mail them for refunding money, you will get one automated answer saying "we will get back to you soon" & that "soon" will never happen. Be careful while booking your journey with GoAir as it will be a nightmare for you.

### "Very unprofessional"
Not Verified | Mumbai to Delhi. Very unprofessional will never recommend anyone to travel by GoAir. I have done booking for 18th July 20 they have rescheduled it to 19th July without intimating me , they don’t even answer any call or reply any email which is really disappointing. Worst airline and customer service.

### "They just kept the money"
My flight was scheduled on 14th June. The didn't even had courtesy to inform my flight was cancelled. As I was unable to check out, it was written my flight has been cancelled 6 hours prior to departure. I tried to call the customer care several times but no one picked up the phone. I mailed to the nodal officer and appeal authority but no one replied back. Neither did I get the option for rescheduling or refund. They just kept the money and are not even returning back. I will not suggest these airlines to anyone. I have tried contacting them and I still have not gotten any reply. It's been a month now and I am still waiting for the reply.

### "Worst airline service possible"
Pune to Delhi. My flight was cancelled by the airline. There is no option to rebook, reschedule or refund on my booking. Worst airline service possible. If you cannot operate, don't list your flight for booking. Pathetic.

### "the most unprofessional"
The worst, the most unprofessional, it is all a big scam under the shade of corona and govt lock downs. Tthey are displaying and taking the bookings of flights which they don't plan to operate. I had a booking for 1st July which was cancelled by airline, then i rebooked it to 2nd by paying extra, it was rescheduled by airline to 3rd July ,and as of now it is again rescheduled to 4th July,. No one to take calls at customer Care, it just keeps ringing and ringing. No mail id mentioned any where on website to drop a mail to. No refund options provided.

### "flight has been cancelled twice"
My flight has been cancelled twice by the airline, there has been no amount credited into my account neither are they refunding the money. Below is the email received from goair: Warm Greetings from GoAir. Your GoAir flight G8-116 from Bengaluru (BLR) to New Delhi (DEL) on 07-06-2020 at 09:35 hrs is CANCELLED. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. These changes are due to issues beyond our control. If you wish to avail the option of a full refund or a flight for the same sector on the previous day, same day or next day at no extra charge (subject to availability), we request you to call us up to 2 hours prior to departure. Thank you for choosing GoAir and we look forward to serving you. Regards.

### "do not want a credit note"
My flight G8-2519 from New Delhi (DEL) to Nagpur (NAG) on 30-06-2020 was cancelled by GoAir. I asked for a refund. But they haven't replied yet. I even forwarded the email to the GoAir Nodal Officer but haven't heard from them. They forwarded me a tax invoice and a credit note, I do not know what to do with it. They do not have even the basic courtesy of at least responding. I have been waiting for the last 10 days. I do not want a credit note/voucher, I just want my refund amount because the flight was cancelled at their end, they failed to provide me a service which they charged me for.

### "they do what they want anyway"
Male to Mumbai with GoAir. Terms and conditions are useless for this airline as they do what they want anyway. Don't book with them. They cancelled my flight, didn't advise me and now will not refund me the money I paid. Instead they issue me a voucher which I can't and will never use.

### "requested for an immediate refund"
I had a booking for 2 between Bangalore and Ranchi on 1st April 2020. The journey could not be undertaken as the flight was cancelled by GoAir in view of the lockdown imposed by the government. Subsequently, as per the advice of GoAir I had, on 20th May, rescheduled the booking for the same sector for a flight on 2nd June 2020, as per the attached ticket issued by GOAIR. However, on 30th May while attempting to do web check in for this flight (to be done 72 hours before the departure) I was surprised to receive an online message that the flight has been cancelled. As this was an unilateral cancellation by GoAir without any prior intimation and as there are no flights being offered on the same sector, I requested for an immediate refund of the entire amount paid to GoAir, without any further delay. I have repeated my requests several times and even written to the Appellate Authority but yet to receive a reply.

### "The crew was very caring"
Ahmadabad to Bangalore, I thought the flight would be cancelled and I would have a bad experience. But it wasn't. I went to airport 4 hours before the departure. The check-in, boarding everything was smooth. I had an infant with me so they gave extra attention to me and made sure my baby was comfortable. The crew was very caring. This was my first flight and my experience was really good. Definitely going to consider Go Air for another trip.

### "pathetic customer service"
Delhi to Guwahati via Aizawl. Pathetic Airlines and pathetic customer service. I booked my travel on 1st June 2020 from Delhi to Guwahati. This Airlines had always kept me in confusion. Somehow, I reached customer care 3 days before my travel date and they assured me that my flight will not cancel that day which eventually got cancelled. However, after that they never messaged or emailed me telling what's the next I can do. I've been trying to reach customer care many days and finally I got connected to one Rep who do not have any idea about what happens next and kept me on hold 4-5 times and at last he disconnected. I emailed to the nodal officer 3 days back and still waiting for reply. This is the first time I booked for GoAir and definitely this is the last time.

### "no alternative travel option"
My Go Air flight G8-118 scheduled to fly from Bengaluru to Delhi on 5th June 2020, was cancelled and was intimated to us 24 hours before departure. There was no alternative travel option provided and neither the refund is initiated. This airlines can cancel the scheduled flight anytime and deny the refund. Their customer service does not answer the calls.

### "is this some kind of joke?"
We have booked this airline on 24th May for june 5th as due to covid we are stuck in Bengaluru. We receive a sms stating "your flight is cancelled due to unavoidable reasons" so understood same and rescheduled it to 7th june by making additional payment of price differential of ticket. Guess what we again got the same message so we decided to call customer care. After several attempts we were lucky that we finally got connected to them, their representative picked up the call and he had two option either you can keep the PNR and use it to travel via Goair anytime between 1year or reschedule the flight and again pay differential. We asked refund that was a clear "NO". The representative promised us that if you reschedule for 8th June their will be "No Cancellation". What option i had to again reschedule for 8th June. I again received that magical message" your flight is cancelled due to unavoidable reasons ". When we again called customer care after several attempts they gave two most amazing Solutions : Option :1 you can keep the PNR and use it to travel via Goair anytime between 1year, Option : 2 Reschedule the flight and again pay differential. Really is this some kind of joke?

### "no one pickup the call"
I called the airport authority as well as the customer support service, it gets connected but no one received the call. I'm trying to contact for the last 4 days and same thing is repeated. This is how the customers of GOAIR is treated. I give a full ring and no one pickup the call and suddenly they get busy. Then why ain't they receiving my call for the last 4 days. Ridiculous service.

### "the flights are cancelled"
Not Verified |  Goa to Chandigarh. All people are saying the flights are cancelled but we don't receive any massages from airlines the flight was cancelled so what we do we need to go tomorrow or not. We are calling our agent who booked our flights he says that your flight are going but all people says it’s not going. And also trying to context with GoAir helpline number but they dont receive our call.

### "they are not refunding me"
Not Verified |  I booked my ticket on 28th January 2020 for 6th April 2020 I paid Rs 7863,  GoAir canceled my flight and rescheduled on 5th April 2020 and the amount was 7478 and my remaining amount was also not refunded. After lockdown this flight was also canceled and when I call GoAir about agin reschedule my booking on 15th April to 1( april in between he is asking me to pay Rs 29000. So I request please return my money and they are not refunding me.

### "a delightful experience"
I was flying from Ahmedabad to Chennai I really had a delightful experience with GoAir one more time during the flight. The Crew were really good to help customers. It was good to know the efforts they were putting to prioritize customer concerns.

### "by far the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Hyderabad to Kolkata via Aizawl. They cancelled flights before any lock down was done by the Government, that was understandable due to the current situation, but the fact that they do not reply to any email about refunds, or their customer care number which doesn't get through even after multiple calls per day. This is by far the worst customer service.

### "Such a pathetic customer service"
Not Verified |  I have booked a flight from Delhi to Patna departing on 23 March 2020 at 1.55 am. On 20th March early in the morning I was watching the news of the Delhi Lockdown. How can I reach the airport so thats why I immediately called the number provided. But after the long wait time of 1 hour the call was disconnected. Again by 4.10 am I called up the airline and was connected after 50 mins of being on hold. An agent answered the call. And the moment I started giving her my PNR details she disconnected the call and didn’t even bother to call back. Such a pathetic customer service. I have to call up the airline again and need to wait for another 1-2 hours to get connected. Infact I decided to one thing let's call on customer care number at night. But it's all vain. How can I get my refund?

### "1-2 hours to get connected"
Not Verified |  I have booked a flight from Pune to Bangalore departing on 22 March 2020 for 2 pax. On 20th early in the morning by 1:30 I received a call stating that my ticket is canceled. I immediately called on the number provided. But after the long wait time of 1 hour the call was disconnected. Again by 8:10 Am I called up the airline and was connect after 56 mins of hold. An agent answered the call. And the moment I started giving her my PNR details she disconnected the call. And didn’t even bother to call back. Such a pathetic customer service. I have to call up the airline again and need to wait for another 1-2 hours to get connected.

### "GoAir didn't even regret"
Ranchi to Bangalore. Worst service I have ever experienced. I had scheduled to travel from Ranchi to Bangalore. They have cancelled the flight just few hours before departure when I was traveling to airport. I asked them to arrange any connecting flights as it is really important for me to travel that day, they replied with a smile. When I asked for next available flight they replied after 30 hours. Without any other option I had to cancel the ticket and counter booked a ticket from indigo. GoAir didn't even regret for the caused inconvenience. They just told we nothing to do with this. I frequently travel in AirAsia and indigo but my first experience with Goair created such a bad impression that I would never book GoAir in future under any circumstances.

### "Worst customer service!"
Worst customer service! Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, I had to cancel my travel plans from Kolkata to Delhi on 17th March, 2020. The customer service rep told me that no cancellation fees would be exempted, and he hung up on me. Ultimately, they charged full penalty for this flight cancellation knowing the fact that it has been declared as a Pandemic situation by WHO. I don’t know what the authorities are waiting for. Most pathetic customer care, and a ridiculous airline.

### "not thinking of the discomfort"
As I am unable to travel on my main ticket from Bahrain to India due to coronavirus, hence was to cancel or reschedule my onward flight Delhi to Ranchi on GoAir. However the airline has used this time to earn money and not thinking of the discomfort to its passenger and they denied to make any changes without levying fee which was 3000+ difference of fare 738 + miscellaneous that too per person. They said that free rescheduling is for tickets issued from 8 March onward.

### "twist is there is no window"
Kolkata to Bagdogra. My flight was at 10:15pm evening and I reached around 7.05 pm to check in. I asked for window seat she smile gave me the seat and I wait for more then 2 hours and when i reached to my seat I see is its a last row corner window but the real twist is there is no window. The seat does not adjust. My last experience goair, seat comfort 1 star, even I don't want to give that.

### "should waive cancellation charges"
Bangalore to Jammu via Delhi. I had booked GoAir flight to Jammu via Delhi for my family of 4 Pax, the booking was for 13 March 2020, and i had booked it on 19 Jan 20 under PNR -E735MM. Due to corona virus , we decided to cancel our trip. I called GoAir and they said that cancellation fee waiver is offered for only those bookings that were initiated between 8 March and 30 April, but not for those bookings initiated prior to it. Now tell me why would one book amid a full blown Corona virus threat and intend to cancel it later, If these airlines were genuinely sympathizing with buyers affected by Corona virus threat then they should waive cancellation charges for people travelling between 8 March and 30 April, and not for bookings made between 8 March and 30 April.

### "no support from GoAir"
Not Verified |  My flight was on 3rd March in the morning 6:40 from Delhi to Lucknowbut it was cancelled with out any prior information to me, after requesting them they issued ticket of 4:40 of evening same day but that flight also was delayed by again another 50 minutes and it flew at 5:30 pm. I was coming from Africa and I had a domestic flight I had to spent whole day with my family and two small kids and there was no support from GoAir.

### "two hour delay with no explanation"
Delhi to Mumbai. Our departure carried a two hour delay - with no explanation and no information provided. The flight, however, was good but the cabin crew seemed friendly but didn't say very much. Our two hour delay equalled a late arrival (which was a shame) but there was no apology and still no explanation as to the lateness of the departure.

### "basics of customer service isn't met"
Not Verified |  Bangalore to Pune. Somehow the basics of customer service isn't met by this airline. Try to web check in - it returns a 404 error. Try downloading itinerary it returns 404 error. Customer care number (option 1113) to book special service, it puts you on hold for over 8 minutes and then it gets disconnected. Why does it have to be a nightmare for a customer to get the basic services? Is there anyone (if) responsible at Go-Air to do these checks? This has been happening for way too long a time now.

### "service gives you headache, stress"
Not Verified |  First the Direct Flight from Hyderabad on which i had booked two seats (by paying extra charges) to Patna was cancelled. Then the airline re-booked the flight on an indirect sector (Hyd to Delhi) and increasing the travel time to 6 hours from 2 hours. Then on re-booking they allotted me one seat on sector (Hyd to Delhi) and second on Del to Pat flight. I called then to rectify this and they booked two seats each on each flight. Then i realised that the two seats on Delhi Hyderabad route were allotted on two different rows. I called them and this time i was told that if i wand seat in same row i will be pushed to later rows. With two infants travelling with me, it was to be very difficult if i got seat farther away from entrance. The Goair customer care staff went on making mistake for 4 times before i got get a aisle and middle seat in the same row although much farther way from exit, Each time their call takes 20 minutes to connect, the understanding of their staff is horrible and the phone connectivity is worst. Their service gives you headache, stress and blood pressure rather than even the slightest convenience.

### "cancelled without any reason"
I was travelling to Kolkata to Aizwal,  first they delayed flight without any reasons and while returning they cancelled it on 1st March without any reason. Customer support in no where, and staff is no so much cooperative. However other flights like air India and Indigo operated from same place. I would suggest avoid fly with this airline, had a bad experience

### "not allow 2 kg extra baggage"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Pune. The guy at the luggage counter was very rude, he did not allow 2 kg extra baggage and said we will have to pay. I made a mistake this time by choosing Goair as they are not at all customer centric.

### "flight was good enough"
Mumbai to Bengaluru. As we were carrying a lot of extra luggage, we purchased 15kg extra luggage from the website which costed around 5k INR however, during check in we observed that we were still carrying 15kg extra and as we needed to take the trip, we had to pay the excess baggage which came around 6000 INR. The seats were quite decent and had better legroom compared to some low cost carriers. The crew appeared welcoming. Departure was a bit delayed but time was made up for en-route. We ordered some daal rice but couldn't order any tea / coffee as the flight was about to descend but the food was quite nice. The crew did not have the change but as we were de-boarding, one of the crew members remembered the change and returned it back to us. Luggage was swiftly received. The flight was good enough although if one is travelling with extra luggage, care should be taken.

### "airline misleads it’s customers"
Not Verified |  Pune to Delhi. This airline misleads it’s customers. The experience they present on their website and charge extra for does exist. I’ve been flying in India since 2007 and this is officially my worst ever experience. When you bring it up with the flight crew they seem to be resigned to the fact that this happens so often that there is nothing more they can say or do. Don’t bother there are so many other options.

### "Worst experience ever!"
I was traveling from Ranchi to Bangalore on 19th Feb, 2020. My check-in baggage was 14 kgs and my hand baggage was 7 kgs so in total 21 kgs. I got the boarding pass and proceeded for security check where I was told that my hand baggage has food items so it needs to go in the check-in. GoAir charged me Rupees 2400 for it even though the total weight was less than allowed weight (cabin luggage was Zero kg). I was getting late so I had no option but to pay the amount. Worst experience ever!

### "so much chaos at the airport"
Mumbai to Lucknow. I guess this is the only flight in the world which does not allow web check-in until you pay a minimum Rs 49 for seat selection. Can they not even offer random selection and confirmation of seat 2 hrs before? It causes so much chaos at the airport. We do not expect a fancy seat for free but at least middle seat is one which no one is interested to pay for. Looking at city like Mumbai which has the most foreign passengers and travel via connecting flights, this flight is the worst option. If you are stuck in traffic and then a huge queue at check-in and baggage drop, it’s like hell. I got to know about this policy just 15hrs before and did not expect this kind of service

### "Seats are comfortable"
Mumbai to Delhi. Seats are comfortable, boarding and check-in staff helpful. The boarding started on time. There is no delay. Cabin crew is polite. Overall good.

### "avoid using this airline"
Jaipur to Bangalore. Just before 4 days of journey, we got message that the flight got cancelled. For further processing, we tried to call their customer care numbers. But as usual, there is nobody in other side to receive the call. Now because of their worse response I am forced to book ticket in another flight by paying three times of actual cost. But still so far there is no call or mail from GoAir about apologize or sense of fault. Consider if customer is in some critical situation, how would he reach for help. As per me, if possible, we should avoid using this airline, who doesn't care for their passengers.

### "Worst customer support"
Delhi to Ranchi. I wanted to change my flight date. I had paid for the flexible date option. Though, no one helped me changing the flight date. After calling to custom care I was pUt on hold for hours and nothing happened. Worst customer support experience. I am never traveling again with Go Air.

### "Never flying this airline again"
I had booked individual tickets for my wife and myself to fly via GoAir direct flight Bangalore to Jaipur. The flight date was 7th Feb and GoAir decided to cancel the flight on 1st Feb. They refunded the amount because they didn't have any other options to fly in the sector. We later realized they did not have any operational reasons "beyond their control" as stated in their system generated "inconvenience regretted" message. They had just reassigned the flight to Bangalore to Lucknow sector. We had to book tickets on Indigo at the last minute for more than double the amount we had initially paid. And this is not the first time I have seen such stuff happen. They do this more often than you would think. The entire process was a mental harassment. Never flying this airline again. That is for sure.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Hyderabad to Guwahati via Kolkatta. Goair cancelled the flight just one week before the scheduled departure date. They didn't have any alternative flights on day day, previous day or next day. I had booked the flight 5 months in advance at a cheaper rate, now I had to take a refund, and book a new Indigo flight at the current flight rate which was more than double. Goair customer care is very pathetic, I called on their no, they played the waiting tone, no one received the phone for 8 minutes, after which the call for disconnected automatically. It happened for the second time, no one answered the call for 7 minutes, and then the call got disconnected. The call got connected only in third attempt, after a waiting of 5 minutes. I had already wasted 20 minutes of my time before I could get their executive on call. Then also in the middle of the conversation, the executive i think just kept the phone on side, I was not hearing anything from the other end, and I had to disconnect the call. After this pathetic experience, I have decided that I will never fly with this unprofessional airline again.

### "staff members started shouting"
Mumbai to Lucknow on 8 Feb. I was gobsmacked with the way I saw Go Air staff talk to people in general. First, there was no announcement or guidance for business class passengers. Then there was no clarity as there were two very long queues. Suddenly the two staff members started shouting. When I clarified the issue, they understood the problem. Then they started talking to a girl in a way that I am shocked how Go Air management allows this behaviour. Shocking! Something tells me you can buy a good seat but how can you buy quality service or basic professional behavior.

### "Very poor customer service"
Our flight from Delhi to Kochi on 20/01/2020 has been cancelled without prior information. When we check in they told like they had sent text message to the passengers before 2 days of departure, but we didn't receive any message. Also they have not rescheduled the flight or didn't make any necessary arrangement to drop us. We have booked the tickets around 2 months before for an amount of RS. 9,248/- Due to the cancellation and miscommunication we didn't get a chance to book another flight on that day and we got stuck in the Delhi airport for one day. The next available flight at a reasonable charge was on the next day and we booked the tickets for RS. 15,880/-. It causes around Rs. 6,632/- needs to pay extra from our pocket and we strongly believe it is their responsibility to compensate the extra payment which we made. We had communicated the same with the representative and they informed as to send an e-mail to refund the loss occurred to us. Till now I haven't received any update regarding my refund and compensation. I has been almost 15 days and still have not received my cancelled ticket fare. Very poor customer service they are providing.

### "never travel with GoAir"
Mumbai to Muscat. Got two days delay in receiving luggage, no customer care, just list of phone numbers. No response on mails, took two power banks to add it to the luggage, not added and lost. Very very bad experience, never travel with GoAir.

### "The flight was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Bengaluru to Nagpur. I booked a flight a month prior seeing prices were low. The flight was cancelled and I got a mail with no solution for the inconvenience. Also for refund they have given number to call at that too before 2 hrs of departure and I don't know if they are giving refund or not. None of the contacts were having any query related to canceled flights. Worst service and worst experience.

### "Allen key not allowed on board"
Mumbai to Goa. Did my check-in and proceeded to security check only to be told that I have an Allen Key in my back pack which is not allowed in hand baggage and will have to be put into the checked baggage which was not told to me at the time of check-in. So i went back to the check-in counter to get some help and assistance. I relayed the incident to the'service' rep  and told him that since my bags are already checked i would like to check my hand bag. He turns round to tell me that if I check the hand bag I will be over my baggage allowance and will have to pay excess baggage. Clearly the man doesn't know anything about the meaning of service. Instead of helping me out or finding a solution he wanted me to pay for their mistake of not informing me that the Allen key was not allowed on board. I had to leave the Allen Keys at the check in counter because if I asked them to bring my bags back I would have missed the flight which I'm sure they would've put down to me as well.

### "their horrible service"
Not Verified |  Bangalore to Kochi. I did not fly at all because of their horrible service. First, they cancel the flight and notify with just an SMS and email. No calls. Second, they give you 2 phone numbers and ask you to call. No matter how long you hold the call, they won't receive it. I even tried their airport numbers. They just ignored the calls. Third, they mention in the email that they can rebook the ticket for us but the reality is different. They just refund you the amount and we have to start looking for another flight. And because the flight was cancelled just 36 hrs before travel, I had to cough up 5 times the money I paid originally for this budget airline. There goes my budget.

### "recommend not to fly GoAir"
Bangalore to Delhi. Flight delayed more than 5 hours. 4 times rescheduled. No one from Airline bothered to offer tea/coffee. No Correct information was passed on to passengers. And one more dangerous thing was before takeoff the engine developed snag. I recommend not to fly GoAir.

### "an extremely risky option"
Hyderabad to Delhi. I had booked a ticket with GoAir and paid a total amount of Rs 6,403 for the round trip. Four days before my flight from Hyderabad to Delhi GoAir emailed me that they were cancelling my flight for "operational reasons. My flight was at 10:25AM from Hyderabad, landing at Delhi at 12:45PM in the afternoon. The only options to rebook the flight that they gave me were a 5:30AM or a 11:30PM from Hyderabad (the former means I would have to leave for the airport at 3AM and the latter meant I would land in Delhi at 2AM). As a young woman travelling alone, neither of these options was conducive to a safe or comfortable journey and I was forced to cancel. They said they would only refund Rs 2,600 (much less than half the amount for the round trip) and also refused to refund the convenience fee charged by the agency. I had to pay an amount that was more than 400% higher to buy a new ticket with AirAsia (given that the trip was only four days away). Reading other reviews I see that GoAir has clearly made it a commonplace occurrence to cancel flights on short notice without offering reasonable or comparable alternatives to rebook. GoAir may be cheap, but it is an extremely risky option.

### "Worst experience"
Not Verified |  Chandigarh to Hyderabad. Worst experience, flight cancelled and no one wishes to inform though i got to know they have official working hours 9am to 9pm. You cannot reach to anyone from authority, you cannot seek compensation. They just intimate you on email, operations error flight got cancelled that 24 hours before your journey. No alternative they have. Don't get attractive by there fare price, they are harrassing customers.

### "Pathetic customer service"
Not Verified | Bhubaneshwar to Mumbai. Pathetic customer service. The helpdesk people have no idea hot to talk to customers and listen to their problem. We tried to prebook the excess baggage international, but the payment did not go through under my name. We rechecked the booking several times for any link to appear through which we can complete the payment. We also waited for an email, but did not get any. In the booking it did not show anything neither did it informed us to pay at the counter while boarding. Then, we again prebooked the excess baggage international. This time the payment went through. Then we went to the airport for taking the flight. The helpdesk people said that we have to pay 2500 for the pre baggage under my name which we did not need at all, as we already had it under her name. They were not at all helpful to us. They did not listen to what we wanted to say and were rude also, their argument was the following. The extra service once added can't be removed. To my defence, I had not completed the purchase. So how can it be mine until I buy it. Just because I see a product and like it you can't force me to buy it. His argument holds true if I had paid for it and then asked to remove it.

### "no type of first aid"
Port Blair to Chennai. I faced the worst experience with this flight. My Wife travel with myself and she feel a heavy ear pain during take off and her ear was bleeding. However the cabin staff had no type of first aid.

### "cancel my second flight"
Not Verified |  Jammu to Lucknow via Delhi. I think i had a worst experience with Go Air which was earlier one of my recommended airlines. Firstly they shift my flight to the next day and then on that day again cancel the flight. They cancel my second flight few hours before the flight. I had booked the tickets so before so that at the end moment i will not experience any problem but they cancel my flight at last moment which create a huge loss to me. Such a poor service and they just say simple sorry.

### "airline is ignoring request"
Pune to Nagpur. There were multiple delays and none of them were communicated well ahead in time. People report at least 1 hr earlier and assuming it takes about an hour to reach the airport the communication should have been done at least 2 hrs before the departure but it never happened. Delays happened multiple time and there was no other option than to spend time on airport since the delay was not communicated on time. We bought 3rd party insurance which covers for delay of more than 6 hrs but in spite of > 6 hrs delay the airline is ignoring request to provide a letter stating the same. Even the escalation to appellate authority has fallen on deaf ears. This is causing me loss since I am unable to claim the insurance amount. It's shameful that airline is ignoring request to provide simple letter. Pathetic customer service. Will never fly with this anymore.

### "no announcement or updates"
Not Verified | Bangalore to Hyderabad. Flight delayed by 2 hours no announcement or updates. Horrible service! Never taking this airline again. I should have seen their online reviews. No support staff here to give us an explanation. Looks like they are notorious for delays. Avoid booking.

### "I lost two working days"
I had booked a ticket from Cochin to Delhi on 27.09.2019 for traveling on 31.12.2019 with my family, three months in advance however on 27.12.2019, they informed me though SMS that they had cancelled that booking and as per the message they were supposed to contact me. But nobody contacted me then I contacted them and requested to re book the ticket but there was no direct flight available. After much discussion they arranged a connection flight on 01.01.2020 11.45 pm from Cochin. Below is the analysis of my itenary As per Booking- Cok (20:30 hrs, 31 Dec) to Delhi (23:40 hrs, 31 Dec) As per Revised booking- Date Flight From To Stops Departs Arrives 01 Jan 2020 G8 510 Kochi Bengaluru 0 23:45 00:40 02 Jan 2020 G8 403 Bengaluru Delhi / 1 04:50 09:25 Actual - Date Flight From To Stops Departs Arrived 01 Jan 2020 G8 510 Kochi Bengaluru 0 23:45 00:40 02 Jan 2020 G8 403 Bengaluru Delhi / 1 06.00 11.30. Finally I reached Delhi Airport after 2 working days of actual scheduled I lost two working days.

### "never ever travel by this airline"
Delhi to Bengaluru. Guys, yesterday was the first and the last time that I travelled in GoAir. It wasn't the worst, it is the most third-grade airline I have seen yet in my life including the ground staff and onboard staff. The staff is horribly horrible both at the boarding counter and in the flight. If you dont have an option, better travel by train or bus but not by GoAir.

### "One of the worst flights"
Bangalore to Delhi. One of the worst flights ever! The customer service is terrible and the flight is never on time. No announcements or communication given out properly. They close the gates in a short period of time even when you go there on time and are never accommodating to peoples’ needs. They overcharge customers with hefty penalties and blame the customers for their poor service.

### "it was a big mistake"
If your trip is important, never ever fly with GoAir. This was the first time I chose this aircraft and it was a big mistake. I booked my tickets from Hyderabd to Kannur via Bangalore (round trip) for 29th of Dec to attend my cousin's wedding on the 30th. This was our family's last wedding and everyone has traveled even from abroad to attend this event and I'm sitting at home. Thanks to GoAir for cancelling the flight on 28th night and leaving me with no other option to travel with my 1.5 year old child. I strongly suggest, this aircraft (GoAir) should be black listed/Banned, as they do not value customer needs. Their services should be stopped immediately as it could put lot more people in serious trouble.

### "worst flight I have seen"
Not Verified |  Bangalore to Hyderabad. The worst flight I have seen in my life, zero management always delayed also the staff is no so polite and proactive, you only get to that the end moment if the flight is getting delayed. I never suggest any of the passengers to choose this service.

### "very bad experience"
Very bad experience with Goair. I reached Goa airport on 15:00 and My departure time was 17:35 on 25th December 2019 from Goa to Delhi but flight was delayed 3 hours. When i ask around 20:30 to departure, Goair replied that the flight will fly on 00:45 on 26th December 2019 and they don't have any arrangement for waiting. It's very bad experience.

### "avoid travelling with GoAir"
Not Verified |  On 22nd December I had planned for a trip to Goa with my family. When we were on our way to the airport (5 am), we received a call from GoAir about our flight being cancelled. They assured us that they will arrange a connected flight via Mumbai to Goa at 10:40 p.m. When we reached the airport at night we got to know that the flight was delayed to 1 a.m. however it took off at around 2 O'Clock. Again as we reached Mumbai a helping staff told us that we have to collect our luggages from belt no.5. We waited for about 20 min and then the same person told us that our luggage was on belt no.3. We proceeded towards our flight to Goa,excited obviously, just to hear the guard telling us that this flight too stood cancelled. They did not even care about the time that the customer had lost ,they just cared about money. They did not compensate us ,in fact anyone, for the money spent for 5-star hotel bookings. I would recommend to avoid travelling with GoAir in whatever situation.
