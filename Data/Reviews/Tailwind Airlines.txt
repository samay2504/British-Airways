### "Zero interest for clients"
3 times delay more than 5 hours, no food compensation, after last delay mid stop in Dresden. Suitcase destroyed and after 8 months I got confirmation that they will pay for it. Now I’m waiting another month for payment! Zero interest for clients, because they are a Turkish airline you will not get compensation for delay so they can treat you like the last of the last! Never again.

### "waiting at the airport for 6 hours"
Not Verified |  My review for this company is very bad, their flights are late. I have been waiting at the airport for 6 hours. When I wanted to contact them for compensation, it was not possible. Very irresponsible of an airline. A disaster.

### "Nobody even gave us a bottle of water"
We booked our holiday via agency and we choose flights that will be the best for us taking in consideration that we have a 3y old son. Our flight was scheduled on 26th of July 2023 at 8am from Vienna to Antalya. We paid for direct flights of course. But what happened? One day before our holiday we received email about changes which said that we will arrive to Antalya 1:40pm so we were thinking it was a mistake. We arrived to the airport 6:00am and we realized that our flight had changed and we will stop at Dresden. What you can do on that moment? We just took the flight full of people, because some disembarked in Dresden and new passengers came in the plane. We spent around 6 hours on the plane. Nobody even gave us a bottle of water. We were able to buy food and liquids but they accepted only cash. Can you imagine long trip with small child without water and food? This was really the worst experience ever. I really don’t recommend anyone to travel with Tailwind Airlines not even for short flights, because they can make you lose your flight or to spent whole day at the plane without any refreshment.

### "the plane was outdated"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Eskisehir with Tailwind Airlines. Nice flight. The crew was okay, the plane was outdated. The food was okay too, not free or included though. There wasn’t any kind of inflight entertainment. Great if you don’t want WiFi connection or when you don’t want to know where you are.

### "Nobody has ever replied to me"
Antalya to Prague. I tried to claim compensation for the delay and issues that happen on 29th August with flight no TWI757. The plane was supposed to depart on 13:00. Instead the departure was delayed to 16:50. Due to technical issues we landed in Burgas and were not properly informed about exact procedure and next steps. Moreover we didn’t get any refreshment while staying almost 5 hours in Burgas. The overall delay was 8.5 hours which is over 5 hours according to passengers rights document of Tailwing. Nobody has ever replied to me after sending emails and reminders.

### "staff were very friendly"
Brussels to Antalya. Positively surprised, okay we have been on a more recent airplane, but it was certainly ok. The children were well taken care of and the staff were very friendly. Of course there is always one grumpy one, which was also the case during our flights. Closing off the curtain right in front of you while you want to bring your children to the toilet without any apologies, not very polite! The words ‘just a second madam’ would already have been perfect. Besides this we had nice flights.
