### “They have to be more customer-centric”
Not Verified | They have to be more customer-centric rather than themself. I flew from Lagos to Accra by AWA and lamented from where I entered for checking. Ground staff kept asking to pay money, and most of them did so. It begins with weighing the baggage to the porters, to the ground staff over there, then to the counter while collecting my boarding pass, to the person who will transfer my luggage to the transfer belt, and many others. Also, when I paid 1 staff and not the 2nd one, They started saying I was not a good man, stingy, and many other things which made me feel like that is it a professional airline or the other way around. They are not ashamed of their act that also in front of their seniors and surprisingly they also keep mum. I felt like falling victim to their demands and ended up paying more than 5 staff. That two hrs I spent to do checking was terrible and turned horrible. I was traveling with extra luggage and paid a handsome amount for the extra luggage which is an additional income for the airlines and this kind of treatment I received. It's a SAD and disappointing. I have boycotted AWA and will encourage my friends and family and all known persons to me, to boycott this airline who don't care for their regular customers. In one word It's pathetic.

### "unclean, unsafe, unpunctual and unconcerned"
Africa World Airlines is unclean, unsafe, unpunctual and unconcerned. My premium economy flight from Kumasi to Accra was delayed by 2 hours after checking in but nobody from the airline told us any reason. All the passengers were crowded into a small area with no social distancing as if there was no pandemic happening. When we finally boarded the flight, the hostess was constantly removing her nose mask to flirt with some politician in the front seat. I asked her for a cup of coffee and was refused because she said only water is allowed due to COVID. For the extra price that we are paying for premium economy and the number of hours that they hold us hostage we deserve better! The seat was dirty and the armrest plastic was chipped, while the signs on the ancient noisy plane were all in Chinese. You could feel the plane shaking the whole time during the flight which makes you wonder if they even do proper maintenance. We finally reached our destination nearly 3 hours late but my baggage did not arrive. There were people from earlier flights also waiting there for their bags so this seems to be a very common thing. The airport staff were rude and told us to wait and maybe our bags would come, maybe not. I wound up missing my flight on Turkish Airlines while waiting for the bag and had to pay for a hotel and to get a new PCR test to travel the next day. I will never fly with this airline again even if it was the last airline in the world and nor will I allow my loved ones to risk their lives. Next time I will just take the VIP bus from Kumasi to ensure I arrive in comfort and punctuality.

### "Needs to hold itself accountable for their actions"
Not Verified |  Needs to hold itself accountable for their actions. Arrived at our destination only to realize about 99% of passenger's luggage was not on the flight. Only one passenger had her luggage, how was this even possible? Had to wait for about 2 hours more without any form of compensation. What was even more annoying was the fact that they didn't seem to care much about it as many clients were frustrated with the situation. They need serious competition from another domestic airline in Ghana.

### "They have never been on time"
AWA needs to be held accountable for their bad service. They have never been on time ever in all the times that I have flown on their planes. The planes are small and old and dirty and staffs are rude and arrogant. It is normal for your flight to be two or three hours delayed every time. But if you come even one minute late for checking in they will sell your seat to another person and make you buy it again. During the flight they used to give sandwiches and pastries and juices but now only water is given for flights of almost one hour. Also during the Covid times they are not maintaining any social distancing on the plane.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Africa World Airlines is the worst airline in the world. I was supposed to fly from Lagos to Accra on the 3rd of September, but my flight was cancelled without notice. I tried to travel again on the 7th of September but this was also cancelled. They have no office in Lagos so I had to drive all the way to the airport every day, only to find that they were closed. I was finally able to book my flight after paying 20,000 Naira to one of the airport workers who knew someone who worked there. They also require you to pay 50,000 Naira to take an expensive Covid test before they allow you to board their flights. When I reached the airport for travel, they refused to check me in because I was wearing a face shield instead of a mask and they made me pay extra to buy a mask from one of the airport shops. Then when we arrived in Ghana, they charged me another £120 to take another test at the airport there. Why can't they just charge one single price for their services instead of advertising one price and then trying to squeeze more money out of their poor customers? The Covid tests should also be free for their passengers instead of trying to make even more profit from us who are struggling with reduced income in the pandemic. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "not worth the cheaper fare"
Accra to Freetown. Terrible service. 4 hours before our scheduled flight and cancelled our flight. There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, "do you have a place to stay here in Ghana? This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying "Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!". When we were never told of such thing at all. Overall, a frustrating experience and not looking to book with Africa World Airlines ever again. I would hope to be wrong and they improve, but the stress and risk of surprise cancellation are not worth entertaining the cheaper fare. I cannot comment on inflight experience because - well, I didn't fly with them.

### "cancelled three times"
Not Verified |  Accra to Kumasi. The flight was cancelled three times. I book the flight 2pm which was more expensive than travelling in the evening, but at long last I travel in evening which I don't like. And when I was coming was the same cancellation also three times cancellation

### "not use this service again"
Kumasi to Accra. Very bad service, my flight was delayed over 2hours and there was no communication from the staff as to the time we will board the flight. Neither did they show any sense of sympathy towards our being delayed. They completely ignored us knowing that there’s not much we can do. It mess up my business trip . I will surely not use this service again.

### "call centre is so shocking"
Tamale to Accra. Good onboard service, juice snack and a meat pastry. Thing that let it down was pre flight experience. Their online card payment system for the flight never works. It charged me twice for my flight and their customer service call centre is so shocking that after one month of trying they didn’t refund. Had to do a charge back through my card. They then cancelled my booking although I had still paid. They didn’t tell me they had cancelled it. I luckily checked my booking 2 hours before the flight.

### "An excellent service"
Domestic flight Accra-Tamale. 1hr flight. One time in both directions. Water, juice and snack (fish or meat pie, savoury biscuits) provided on this short flight (more than you get on BA domestic/European flights three days). Friendly and very polite cabin crew. Marvellous captain who gave great information about the flight. Joint venture between Hainan Airlines (China), Hahn Airways and Ghanian investors. An excellent service which makes domestic travel much easier in Ghana
