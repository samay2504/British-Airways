### "obscene baggage fees"
Absolutely obscene baggage fees at the airport. Instructions for extra baggage on website are not sufficient. They charge 8X the online baggage fees when at the airport. My extra baggage cost more than my flight. This is criminal and unacceptable. They also only allow one carry on bag. Only fly this airline if it is your only option.

### “Worst airline ever”
My trip from Auckland, New Zealand to Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, included flights handled by Qantas and Air Niugini, all of which were booked through a travel agent in New Zealand (Flight Centre). The issues began when my flight from Port Moresby to Rabaul was canceled with only 13 hours’ notice. By that time, we had already checked in at Auckland and were boarding the plane, leaving us with no other option but to continue the journey. Air Niugini’s only resolution was to offer us a flight the following day, advising us to simply "turn up" at the airport. Upon arriving at the domestic check-in the next day and waiting for over an hour and a half, I was informed that I wasn’t on the flight. Despite this, I was told to speak with customer service, who initially showed no interest in resolving the issue until I had to raise my voice and explain that I was traveling for a family death ceremony. Magically, tickets appeared only 30 minutes before departure, even though I had been told the flight was full. Upon boarding, it was evident that there were at least 10–15 free seats. The lack of communication, transparency, and effort from your staff was shocking and unprofessional. But that was only the beginning. The return flight from Rabaul to Port Moresby, scheduled to depart at 7:00 AM, was abruptly canceled the night before at 11:00 PM via email, with no alternative options provided. The two phone numbers provided in the email for assistance were not even connected. Left with no choice, we arrived at the airport, where we finally received an email at 5:00 AM informing us of rebooking on another flight. However, upon arrival at the airport, the staff could see this new booking but were unable to check us in for over 45 minutes, requiring a phone call to head office to resolve the issue. Adding to the stress, I was traveling with my mother, and being in Rabaul—a remote part of the world with a tiny airport and only one other local airline—we had no real alternative options. The worry of being stranded caused a huge amount of anxiety for both of us, which could have been avoided with better communication and service. This experience has been beyond frustrating and entirely unacceptable for an airline that charges full-price fares for services that you clearly cannot deliver. The rumor that fuel shortages are affecting your ability to operate flights as scheduled yet you continue selling tickets without disclosing these issues is both deceptive and unethical. I expect a formal apology and explanation for the appalling service, as well as reassurance that other passengers won’t have to suffer the same treatment in the future.

### "A disgrace of an airline"
A disgrace of an airline. Arrived at check in three hours in advance of departure time just to find out that they had bumped me off the flight. They essentially killed off the second half of my holidays. Check in itself was a farce. Although at the top of the queue, it was a very long wait as counter staff and security let selected people through first who then also make their friends jump the queue. Staff is not very friendly and unapologetic. No explanation was provided why it was me who was there well in advance and had purchased the ticket many months in advance cannot fly. A promised refund can only be requested by email apparently. I am sure I have to fight for that too.

### “no communication on the delay”
Not Verified | This airline is a complete mess! I flew Air Niugini from Honiara to Nadi and oh boy! I have never come across an airline as unreliable as this one. I was initially meant to fly the 737-800 which comes with IFE and charging ports but a day before our trip our aircraft got downgraded to a Fokker-100. When I asked why the aircraft was downgraded they had no answer. The check-in took AGES! A good 10 minute per passenger. The flight was scheduled for 2pm, a day prior I got a text saying the flight will no will leave at 3.40pm. This was updated on the Fiji Airways app but not the Air Niugini app. Anyways to be on the safe side I went to the airport at 12.30 to check in by 1pm. When I got to the airport the screens read 2.55pm as departure. The flight actually left nearly 5pm because of which I missed my onward connection in Nadi. All this while there was no communication on the delay and the reason for the delay. No ground staff in sight in international departure except when it was time to board. I had requested a special meal, that was not loaded so the poor crew had to put something together for me. The crew are literally the saving grace of this airline. They are genuinely passionate about their jobs and they went above and beyond to make every passenger feel welcomed. I give 5 stars to the crew, only to them. Literally the only good thing about this airline.

### "Terrible to fly with"
Not Verified | Terrible to fly with. 4 of 4 flights delayed on 1 trip. Lied to by staff AND management. Lost hundreds of dollars, thousands If you include work, all cos of them. There's a lot more but in a nut shell, save yourself the trouble - DONT FLY WITH THEM

### "this company is totally unreliable"
I have booked many flights with Air Niugini. In the specific case, my flight from Honiara to Port Moresby has been Rescheduled (2:30hrs later). Because of this reschedule I will not be able to catch the last flight from Port Moresby to Goroka, and also be obliged to pay an Hotel in Port Moresby. I have written 6 times to AirNiugini Customer Service for a refund: no answer. I was told by friends that this happens very often. We are big travellers (EPS) and it’s important to give the message that this company is totally unreliable!

### "Staff were amazing"
Flew Air Niugini because of the B767, very nice cabin in a 2x1x2 configuration. Took seat 2A, bulkhead seat, very comfortable with heaps of leg room. Staff were amazing and very attentive, food was OK, entertainment was enough for this flight of approx. 6 hrs.

### "Absolutely disgraceful service"
Not Verified |  We flew from Brisbane to Port Morseby and while in POM we had several flights delayed and then completely canceled. We had to stay in POM for two days before finally flying out. We had relatives waiting for us in Popondetta during this time who had to travel a long distance to meet us and wait. Now coming home our flight from Popondetta was over two and a half hours delayed. This means that we will miss the flight from POM to Brisabane, and probably staying another night in POM. Absolutely disgraceful service from this company. Also seems like theirs no way of contacting any of the Air Nuigini offices by phone as you will just sit their on hold like I did today for 40 minutes before I gave up.

### "staff have no compassion"
Air Niugini has ruined my Easter holiday. I have a holiday reservation at Walindi Plantation Resort, Kimbe, from 7-10/4. I have booked Air Niugini domestic flight from Port Moresby to Hoskins on 7/4. The 7/4 is canceled with a SMS notification at 10am on 7/4, and rescheduled to 8/4 3.25pm, which is fine as it's only one day difference. I check in again for 8/4, and this flight is further delayed to 4.45pm without any notification during the dropping of my luggage at counter, well, which is also fine for me as it's only 1 hour plus delay. Finally when we are supposed to queue up for boarding, at 4.45pm sharp, the airline makes announcement to cancel the flight, and reschedule to the next day 9/4, for departure at ridiculous 4.55am. If you can't afford to operate the flight, just don't take my booking or notify earlier in case of flight change so that we can manage our travel. For what that you still check us in, and get us waiting in the boarding lounge just for your cancellation announcement, instead of a departure. The customer service counter is full of chaos with the staff having no compassion to comfort the frustrated crowds.

### "Delayed my plane by 36 hours"
Manila to Brisbane via Port Moresby. Delayed my plane by 36 hours. Wasted 2 days. Had paid for Business class upgrade but “they couldn’t find it in the system. Had no problems keeping the money.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Terrible service. Well over 2 hours to check in, queues have no seats, not even been through security yet. Not a single apology or justification from a member of staff. Oh and they made sure the business customers pushed into the economy queue stands to be seen first.

### " the most appalling airline"
Without any doubt this is the most appalling airline I have experienced. Think Jetstar and it's even worse. 3 hours sitting on a dirty run down aircraft before we could get a glass of water. That of course included sitting in the heat on the runway for an hour before leaving. I've now just experienced their check in a return flight. Only 2 people waiting and it took 30 minutes before I got to the counter. If you have any option choose that, even if it is Jetstar.

### "lack of alcoholic beverages is sub-par"
Flew Wapanamanda-Port Moresby-Singapore on 20-21 March 2022. The domestic leg was on an old Dash8-200 aircraft always used on this route. It became the noisiest flight I have had for many years. Service on board given (juices and biscuits). Half load. Free seating. Allowed to check in 30 hours in advance. Flight delayed 25 Minutes which is bearable. Smooth check-in, and very fast luggage delivery in Moresby. The international leg was eased by the airline’s Helpdesk who advised promptly on corona and other documents requirements/changes to avoid any check-in panic or denial. Check-In took long time due to loads of document checks. 3 counters open was hardly enough for the only 60+ passengers, e.g. it took me alone 25 minutes to get a BP issued. Lack of a full alliance with e.g. Oneworld, complicates things – Qatar, who issued my ticket, including for onward flights, is only a partner. Lounge access in POM were generously given to all the airlines’ frequent flyers. Their lounge was good in terms of hot foods offering, view, and space (we were only 5 visitors to fill 145 chair-spaces). Drink offering were shockingly poor; absolutely no alcoholic beverages beyond milk and sodas - and the coffee was burnt to the level to call the fire brigade. The actual flight was on an aged, noisy, but well refurbished B767-300. Flight punctual and even early in both ends. FAs were kind and informative. The complete lack of alcoholic beverages is completely sub-par: it was apologized by FAs and said to be temporarily and change back by April 2022 to be re-instated. Only 1 meal service on a 6 hours’ afternoon flight is scarce. Food offerings were 2 options, beef and chicken – that complemented the offerings from Paradise lounge well where we had fish, fish-balls, lamb, and cheeses. No WiFi nor IFE onboard – but flight monitors at every seat made us know the name of all Indonesian islands passed. Power outlets provided at every seat. While business class was full, there were only a 10% load in economy which gave us all the space in the world to flat out. Can only rate to 7 of 10 but will add 1-2 more when the full drink repertoire returns.

### "Mediocre on board services"
Singapore to Wabag via Port Moresby 2-3 March 2022 on B767-300 and Dash 8-300, respectively. Flights on time. Transit in POM was 3 hours which was just enough time to fully disembark, tests, transit, luggage, and check-in onward travel to remote provinces. Old aircrafts, both of >25 years of age but well taped together. Ground service and Helpdesk excellent, prompt and cooperative. At a certain stage the airline allowed me to keep the domestic ticket open as they realised the numerous changes: I had to change ticket 4 times due to strict and changing travel/entering regulations to PNG - all worsened by Corona and transit variations (first 2 legs from CPH via DOH to SIN) in Singapore including “transit clearances”, immigration’s approval, tests, visa, criminal record certificate, vaccinations, etc. What happened to all the fun in the World? Gate pass and Check-Ins were easy in SIN as well in POM. The airlines’ cooperation with Qatar Airways is smooth and ease procedures as reduce ticket price. Moreover, their Oneworld Cooperation granted me free access to Qantas Business Lounge in Singapore which was a great relief and a pleasure of some luxury. The first flight was a night flight and a fully acceptable hot dinner was served. Could stretch out and sleep even in the very noisy B767. No inflight entertainment (just map tracking). No alcohol offered on board on any of the 2 flights. Ample seating space. Mediocre on board services - but somehow OK. Airbridge only provided in Singapore - had to walk while disembarking in POM and onwards. Domestic ticket was reissued with ease in the international airport, and thereafter allowing me to check-in before entering the very crowded domestic airport 400 meter away. Baggage allowance followed the internal flight, otherwise only 16 kg, which is half. Domestic boarding gates were in the open under an open roof. It was clear and easy. Onboard, catering was minimal (juice and snack), but appreciated. The sole FA was well-groomed, effective, and took well care of my bulky hand-luggage put into a front cabinet. Underway, a ceiling panel dropped half-down in the cabin and was then hold up by passengers for 30 Minutes. FA tried to tape it up, but failed. The destination WBM has 2-3 flights per week and the trip took 90 Minutes over hostile, forest covered mountains. Would fly again.

### "bump passengers off because of overbooking"
You can wait in a line to checkin, for hours, and get little to no customer service because the airline overbooked. They process executive “priorities,” and leave ordinary people to wait. In queues with no social distancing. There is no communication by Customer Service staff to help explain the situation. Sometimes they leave the desk, and disappear. Leaving us looking at each other, wondering what is happening. There is no empathy. These are trying times to say the least with Delta on the rise, but these situations can be avoided if airlines operated with compassion. It is unethical to overbook. It is unethical to rebook for flights knowing the airplane is undergoing maintenance. It is unethical then to provide no water or refreshments onboard a later plane - after passengers have been waiting 8 hours. We arrived in Port Moresby, exhausted, hungry, thirsty and traumatised - 9 hours later. Customers deserve better service. I was later told that this is the new normal for Air Niugini and that has been occurring for the past three weeks and is expected to continue right up until Christmas as the airport gets redeveloped. This practice, on early bird flights to bump passengers off because of overbooking will continue. Air Niugini's Dash-8 fleet are old and in desperate need of repair.

### "I was overweight on luggage"
Not Verified |  Port Moresby to Hong Kong in December 2019. I was overweight on luggage. But the airport treatment I got, was traumatic. The power was off. The internet was off. I either had to pay $800 or leave my bag behind. I wanted to pay the fine, but the power was off for hours. I could not change currency. I could not pay the customs, because they could not give me a receipt. I almost missed my flight.

### "pay a bit more for another airline"
Not Verified |  My itinerary was Manila - Port Moresby - Honiara - Port Vila - Fiji (plus some domestic). Several flight was with Air Niugini First they cancel my flight from POM-HON, which they of course never told me anything about. After today I realised that I shouldn't even have expect that. I then after that realised that I would have to stay 2 weeks in PNG to be allowed to go to Honiara after visiting the Phillipines because of the coronavirus. My next plan is to book a flight direct to Vanuatu. The flight is listed as direct but at the last step I notice a 50 min stop in Honiara for dropping of / unloading passengers. (No disembarking.) I decided to contact air niugini just to make sure this wouldn't become problem. 9-10 days later I still dont have a answer after emailing with 5 people via 8 different emails in 3 different countries. And yes, of we tried to call but never a clear answer. One even said we would be fine but another one said not possible. When checking in at Manila airport for the POM flight I'm almost denied boarding since my onward ticket is cancelled and I couldn't book my next flight because I never received an answer about transit rules. When arriving in POM I ask the Air Niugini office (they are actually friendly when explaining that they cant help you with anything.) They printed loads of the IATA travel restrictions rules that I already have on my phone and I was explaining them about. They said I would not be allowed to have any kind of transit in Honiara. (The Virus is a new thing so that most likely the reason we received so many different answers and no answers from most of them. Then I decide to just skip them both and go to Fiji. I have to choose the more expensive option to stop over in Brisbane. With Carry on 7kg I dont need any tra sit visa since I'm not leaving international gate. My backpack is 9kg. Checking it in (free) results in leaving international gate for re checking since they dint ha e sharevmcode with the next flight and this would result in me having to get a transit visa that obviously would take 8-12 days according to my application. I then asked the counter during one of my domestic flights if they could be so kind to let me go with 9kg and the entire problem would be solved and the guy said ofc, after all this trouble that should not be any problem. Just go over to the sales counter and get it confirmed. Nope, big no. Of course I couldn't bring a 9kg carry on. So now I'm stuck here forced to throw away 2kg of personal stuff to be able to get out of here. I recommend to pay a bit more for another airline.

### "bumped onto flight tomorrow"
Not Verified |  What a joke, i had just arrived from Perth via Brisbane to land in Port Moresby for my connection to Rabaul. When i arrived in Port Moresby i proceeded from the international terminal to the domestic to check in for my next flight to find out i had been bumped onto the flight tomorrow due to the plane being downsized from the Fokker 100 to a Dash 8. They were not willing to compensate my accommodation costs for a night in Port Moresby, even though they have now just cost me my transfer and first nights accommodation in Rabaul. So demanded to be placed on standby for the flight in case nobody showed up on the flight. The check in staff had the worst attitude i have ever come across in aviation. I got lucky and was able to board the flight for it then be diverted to Hoskins, we then had to wait at Hoskins for Air Nugini to organise accomodation for our flight, this took them nearly 2 hours. I wont fly this airline again unless absolutely required.

### "a pleasant surprise"
Not Verified |  Fly from Brisbane to Port Moresby with Air Nuigini in Economy class today. Leg room in economy was a pleasant surprise! Food was first class. Cabin crew were very friendly & helpful. Let's be honest, no-one really likes flying economy, but it's so much cheaper than Business Class! But over all, I thought the trip was excellent! The only 2 negatives I have are: 1: Only 3 check in staff to book in a plane load of people. (There were 2 customer service staff working, well one was working & the other was surfing the web) 2: Excess baggage charges. You get a 30kg limit in Economy, but if you go over that they charge $21.00 per kilo.

### "flights were very nice"
So we first had some trouble as the airline told us that we wouldn't be able to get our original flight but after some over the phone conversations with a very helpful woman in the Air Niugini base in Cairns we were able to get on another flight which was a day earlier. We were desperate to make it to Honiara so we agreed to taking this flight although it meant staying overnight in Port Moresby before going to Honiara on the original second leg of the journey the next day. We arrived in Port Moresby a bit confused and unsure as the what was going to happen, luckily we met a lovely woman who works for the Air Niugini airport team in Port Moresby airport. She was incredibly helpful, she sorted out our free overnight accommodation in the holiday inn which included two free meals and a very nice room and also shuttles to and from the airport. She helped us get out some money and advised us on how much we would need. She even helped us see the town because we wanted to have a look to see what was there so her friend showed us round in her car. Thank you! The flights were very nice with TV's and food and drink served on a flight as short as two hours. This was a plus but was unfortunate that we were delayed on the way there and that our flight got cancelled on the return journey.

### "an epic disappointment"
Not Verified |  I was so looking forward to traveling with Air Niugini and not having to transit via Australia to get to the Philippines from Vanuatu. Unfortunately it turned out to be the worst airline travel experience to date. First our flight was cancelled after sitting at the boarding gate for 2hrs with no info other than 'there is an indefinite delay'. Then the flight was rescheduled for the next day, no info on our connecting flight was given until we arrived in Port Moresby from Vanuatu. The flight from Port Vila to Port Moresby was on a very old looking ATR aircraft, with no entertainment. Aircon was turned off for the 30 minute stopover in Honiara. Promises made by the Air Niugini ground staff to rebook my connecting domestic flights in the Philippines were not honoured and I was only advised of this after the scheduled domestic flights were missed, and only 5 minutes before boarding to Manila. No compensation was offered for the missed domestic flights or even an apology for providing the wrong information. Our baggage was then lost on arrival in Manila. 23 days later, there is still no sign of it and no compensation for lost bag to date. No response recieved to complaint email sent via website. Also no answer on phone numbers listed on website. Another complaint sent via agent in Vanuatu and response was simply 'fill out a form about your baggage' and 'our contract of carriage was only for Port Vila to Manila, no interline agreement'. So why did the staff advise otherwise? After losing baggage, buying new clothes and domestic flights (approx. $500), we requested an upgrade on return flight to have some positive experience with Air Niugini to look forward to. There was no response to this and the request at check in was rejected despite half of business class being empty. The airline also rejected the carriage of my traditional lanterns because Air Niugini exceptionally does not accept the carriage of any items that contain lights that aren't LED lights (I've successfully brought these lanterns in to Australia, USA, Vanuatu - never a problem). I requested they hold them until relatives could collect them the next day and was advised no storage space was available. After spending half a day driving to purchase them, I had to throw them away at the airport (another $100 lost). Air Niugini, you were such an epic disappointment and your poor service ruined our vacation. I understand flights occasionally get cancelled, baggage sometimes gets lost but your responses to customer issues relating to these things were inconsistent, incorrect or inadequate. In the future, I will avoid Air Niugini unless there are really no other options available. Don'tempted by their cheap prices! Like me, you could end up paying more than the cost of flying with a decent airline and have the added frustration and stress of having to deal with an airline that has no interest in resolving customer issues when at fault.

### "don’t trust the airline to compensate"
The outbound journey was delayed 10 hours in Port Moresby. The delayed flight was organised to leave at 2am, however no ground staff at airport were organised, so we sit on tarmac until ground staff arrive at 5am. The return flight from Pohpei was supposed to leave Pohnpei at 2 am and actually left 9.45am. I turned up to airport at 2 am and found out the flight was rescheduled to 9.45am. I contacted AirNuigini twice via email prior to departure to confirm that no changes had been made. I received an email saying that your servers were not working. I was not contacted about this change, but others on the flight all new about this change a week before, as they had booked flights only a week earlier. Therefore, you new about the changes a week earlier, did not advise me or even book me on the forward leg of the journey. The flight leaves Pohnpei at 9.45am, but we are not booked on the continuing flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane. This flight leaves half empty, and several passengers are not booked on this flight because Quants reservations are not open on Sunday. People who booked the week earlier are however on the flight. We were then sent to Sydney Airport and a connecting flight arranged to Brisbane. When we land in Sydney, Qantas advise us that Air Nuigini connection to Brisbane is illegal because there is less than an hour between flights. The checkin had closed and there are no more flights that day. We are then stranded at Sydney Airport with no contact available from either Quantas or Airi Nugini. We then go to Flight Centre and are told there is only one flight left to Brisbane at a cost of $800. Some passengers take this option, but I don’t trust the airline to compensate me. So I am stranded with nobody to contact In Sydney at 7pm at night. Luckily some stranger took pity on me and let me sleep on their couch for the night. I contacted your airline in the morning and I was rebooked to Brisbane at 11am with Qantas. Qantas then advised that my 2 bags of 15kg were subject to excess baggage fee of $70. Eventually I got home at 12pm in Brisbane.

### "domestic side is an absolute joke"
Bali to Madang via Port Moresby. The domestic side of this airline is an absolute joke! I spent 12 hours in the POM airport yesterday after arriving on the red eye from Bali. There was little to no info given and now I am back at the airport at 4am this morning and have been waiting for an hour with no check in line available yet.

### "waited 2 days for cancelled flight"
Hoskins to Port Moresby. Waited 2 days for our cancelled flight to be reinstated even then we had to continually ask ground staff what was going on or for information. Eventually told 6 hrs later our plane arriving from POM was experiencing technical issues which was a total fabrication and lies, I received a phone call from a pilot friend who said they didn't have a captain available. I have been flying in PNG for 30 years and this has been the worst experience. By the way PNG Air managed 5 trips into Hoskins in a 10hr period and all their customers are enjoying Christmas with their families. Guess who I'm flying with in future. Way to treat your valued customers.

### "a very pleasant surprise"
Singapore to Port Moresby. Given the limited choice available on the market to reach Port Moresby (only Qantas and Air Philippines travel there) I was forced to take Air Niugini. It was a very pleasant surprise. Plane was not too old, cabin was very decent, clean, entertainment somewhat limited but of reasonable quality. Food was ok, plane is almost always empty, which means lots of space also in Economy. Board personnel is not as shiny as you could see on Emirates or Qatar, but kind, gentle and professional. A surprise.

### "such attitude and negligence"
I was travelling on an Air Niugini PX187 from Mt. Hagen to Port Moresby on 31/3/2017. The check-in was a chaos and in the end flight was cancelled at short notice (as it was time to board), as was the flight on the following day we were transferred to (PX 181). In the end, the total delay was 24 hours. For the whole day on Saturday (8.30am to 5pm), we were made to wait at the airport with no food or water provided  and no information on when we might be able to fly. The staff were unwilling to help or offer any kind of assistance or volunteer any information. When I enquired about refreshments for the passengers I was told that it was 'not the airline policy’ to take care of their passengers even in case of delay which was entirely the fault of the airline. When we finally arrived in POM at 6pm on the 1st of April, our luggage was left behind. Again, no specific information was provided by the airline as to when they would arrive, only an approximate “maybe tomorrow”. We went back on the following day and received 1/3 of the checked in baggage. The other two bags didn’t arrive. My colleague went back again in the afternoon to check but still nothing. I gave up as life is too short for this (no chance the airline will follow up on your behalf). I wrote to the airline but haven't received a response. I have never experienced such attitude and negligence by any other airline in the world.

### "seat pitch is ridiculously tight"
Sydney to Port Moresby. Air Niugini use a remote hard stand for boarding in Sydney. Passengers can expect to catch a bus to take them to the aeroplane. Economy Class Seat 12B. The seat pitch on the Boeing 737-700 is ridiculously tight and is much much less than their 767s which I fly very often. I use Qantas 737-800s every 1-2 weeks and they offer a much better seat pitch. I am 189cm and my knees were jammed against the seat in front on the Air Niugini 737-700. The seat cushioning and lumbar support is near non-existent and passengers should expect to have back and leg pain on arrival. The 767 is the same. The seats fail to lock up right and recline on take-off. My seat gradually reclined to the full reclined position on it's on which severely impacts the limited space for the person seated behind you. The IFE on their Boeing fleet (767 and 737) has issues. The touchscreens rarely work and register phantom touches consistently throughout the flight. These either sequence the exit movie button or turn the volume to max. The passenger in the seat next to me screen's orientation was upside down. The food is relatively good for an economy flight. General condition of the aeroplanes are showing their age.

### "most useless airline"
The most useless airline I have had the misfortune to experience. Booked flights in January for July holiday to take our mother back to Rabaul after 47 years for her 70th birthday. Arrived prior to the other 8 family members only to be advised my flight was cancelled. Rebooked on same day only for this flight to be cancelled. All due to the fleet being 'unserviceable'. No communication of cancelled flights, even when at airport. Forced to stay over night in Moresby, flight rescheduled for 8am, only to be cancelled. Finally after so many attempts, I had to pay $380AUS to fly with the alternative non government Air PNG airline so I could start my actual holiday and join my family. These forced changes rendered my pre planned expense and time useless. I felt sorry for airport staff who are placed in this position due to pilots striking. I felt very sorry for customers who were forced for to wait 5 days before they could get to their destination.

### "staff are very friendly"
Port Moresby to Brisbane with Air Niugini - relatively expensive airline although not on routes from PNG to and from Brisbane and Cairns in Australia. Planes are old but have been refurbished with quite comfortable seats and have quite a good in-seat entertainment system. The toilets are clean, which is a plus on any airline. Meals are actually very good and probably amongst the best of any airline I have flown with (at least in economy). However, what sets this airline apart from many is its cabin staff who are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.

### "polite cabin crew"
A smooth 2 hour flight with Air Niugini from Singapore to Port Moresby. Orderly boarding and very polite cabin crew. The plane was spotless. Varied selection of movies, music and television shows. Satisfactory meal and drink service. Would not hesitate to fly again or recommend.

### "memorable experience"
Port Moresby to Singapore with Air Niugini, and they provided the best assistance and service I have experienced. The ground staff and the check-in service was wonderful and very quick. The staff is professional and helpful. The 6 hours flight from POM to SIN journey was very comfortable and relaxing. The crew were very decent and helping. Overall wonderful and memorable experience.

### "has been consistently great"
Over the past 40 years I've travelled to many destinations around the world on many different airlines, but none of them have even come close to punching above its weight than Air Niugini. I've been flying Air Niugini ever since I was pleasantly surprised over 18 months ago, and the experience has been consistently great. It is what one would expect from an airline, but to deliver a world class service amidst challenges is what makes Air Niugini stand out for me.

### "decent staff and pilots"
Air Niugini planes in good condition, decent staff and good pilots. The food on the international 767 was good and the seats have good IFE but a limited movie selection. It breaks down a bit on domestic flights though. The planes (Dash-8s and Fokker 70s) and pilots are still good and inflight service OK, although you'll only get 2 small cookies and a small juice container (finding plain water in PNG is bizarrely difficult), however ground service is pretty bad. Port Moresby check-in is a madhouse and locals check huge amounts of baggage (note that the free amounts are small - 5kg carryon and 16kg checked, although if you're connecting from international they will usually allow whatever allowance you had for that flight), which means that late arrivals are often bumped due to the plane hitting the weight limit - so check in early! And then hope that your luggage actually arrives - I've already had misdirected luggage on my 4th flight in PNG. The weather contributes to frequent delays and cancellations and the handling of rebookings is poor. Still much better than most domestic flight experiences that I've had in countries like this. Overall score of 7 considers an 8 for international and a 4 for domestic.

### "Staff were friendly "
Flew Air Niugini from Port Moresby to Brisbane return. Seating pitch was adequate and meals were good. Staff were friendly in the reserved Melanesian way. The planes are old although the they've recently (in the last couple of years) been refitted. Decent IFE for short-haul flights.

### "but poor service"
Air Niugini the most expensive airlines but poor service - I already paid my ticket 1 month before flight departure. They said that I must stand by because the flight was very full. After that I give small money to one of Air Niugini officer that he helped me to get seat and finally I can get boarding pass and fly to Buka. This airlines I think like to sell ticket more than aircraft capacity and very bad attitude of company. The ticket is very expensive. The old plane was a Fokker 100. The plane was very dirty. 400USD Ticket POM to BUA with 1 hour 20 minutes flight, and Air Niugini just give 1 orange can juice and 1 biscuit snack. No Inflight Magazine. Aircraft was full. Cabin crew was polite and professional.

### "aircraft clean but very old"
Air Niugini from Buka Port Moresby with Fokker 100. Good experience. Inflight service was nothing for Buka to Rabaul flight due to short flight time just 1 hour, Rabaul to Port Moresby with 2 cookies and orange juice Only. Aircraft clean but very old. No inflight Entertainment, no newspapers, no inflight magazine. Flight Attendant to keep the safety procedure.

### "exorbitant airfares"
I've never had any reservations flying Air Niugini. Though the inflight product on the domestic sectors does not match the exorbitant airfares, the ground service and most flight attendants are usually excellent and professional. They do their best with what they've got. No IFE on domestic flights (POM/HGU is 1 hr flying time).

### "Crew professional but not the warmest"
Early morning Air Niugini flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane. Check in fast and friendly. Immigration at Port Moresby was slow with just 2 officers. Boarded on time to a clean Boeing 767, seats had updated IFE with nice screens and good content. Crew professional but not the warmest. A good breakfast was served which was of good quality. Arrived into BNE 15 mins early. Being non busy time at BNE. Immigration cleared fast and bags picked up and out of airport in 20 mins.

### "decent amount of entertainment"
The Air Niugini food was good for airline food on my flight Port Moresby to Hong Kong, and a decent amount of entertainment options as well. If you get seated in row 8 you have a lot of leg room and I am 6'4". The airlines in the USA should learn how to have entertainment and food from them.

### Air Niugini customer review
I flew with Air Niugini, 24 August 2015 from Port Moresby to Bali with a B737-700. Overall not very good in service and the flight attendants did the minimum. Check in at POM Airport is very poor, just 2 ground staff to do that and they are very strict with baggage handling and baggage weight. On the B737-700 there were 7 flight attendants but just 2 working in Economy Class causing a very slow service. Inflight Entertainment, seat and toilets were ok.

### Air Niugini customer review
The flight from BNE to POM was on a B767 with an upgraded interior. IFE and very comfortable seating. The inflight service was excellent, the flight attendant provided a professional helpful service complete with an indepth and accurate description of the wines carried for the passenger seated next to me. In addition this same passenger was a vegetarian but had not pre-ordered a vegetarian meal, the flight attendant produced a very acceptable vegetarian meal. Her level of customer care was above and beyond much of what I have encountered on many airlines and I left the flight feeling that the service was far more than expected. What a difference a a flight attendant who is caring, professional and prepared to go the extra mile can make to a flight.

My daughter and I are back in Sydney tonight thanks to Air Niugini going the extra mile. When the flight from Alotau to Port Moresby was cancelled we were in a challenging situation, then when the rebooked flight from Alotau to Moresby couldn't land because of difficult weather conditions we had to overnight in Alotau and hope to connect early through a rescheduled flight from Alotau the following morning. The Air Niugini staff at Alotau handled a difficult situation for customers extremely professionally both the day of the delay issues and through rebooking everyone on the rescheduled flight the next morning.

### Air Niugini customer review
SIN-POM-SIN on B767s. Friendly professional and efficient service from the crew made the flights bearable. Flights were largely on time. Exit row 10 had unbelievable leg room but it also meant other passengers climbed over us to get to the toilets in the other aisle. Food was ok. Touch-screen entertainment screens were great but bring your own headphones. Entertainment selection was limited.

### Air Niugini customer review
PX4 BNE-POM 29/12. Re-fitted 767. Don't know who designed and who signed off the new economy layout but there are serious flaws. 2 toilets only for the whole of economy and they are situated mid cabin. There is no void space around the toilets so any queue just forms in the aisles. There is a seat right by the door to the toilet so this poor passenger cops the door opening and closing all flight plus the odour. Would be a nightmare seat on an overnight flight. Why is the "latest technology" entertainment system not gate to gate. I've had is turned on anywhere between 5 and 25 mins after the seatbelt sign was switched off and then turned off at the started of decent - 30 mins out. Result -movie not finished. Service slow mechanical. Food quite good. New seats ok for short flight but would be uncomfortable on longer haul - too hard and seat base too short -no under thigh support.

### Air Niugini customer review
One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Of course you can not expect much in a country like Papua New Guinea. Overall I had six domestic flights all were delayed by at least one hour. All planes were in a disappointing condition. The cleanliness was poor the crew were rude incompetent and not very service oriented.

### Air Niugini customer review
MNL-POM-RAB return in Business. In the last five years flying with Air Niugini service and airplane quality has deteriorated dramatically. A flight inside PNG has become an absolute lottery game without help whatsoever from the ground crew.

### Air Niugini customer review
Flew Air Niugini from Cairns to Port Moresby on a Fokker F100. Departed on time fantastic food great crew.

### Air Niugini customer review
I have the misfortune of using Air Niugini often through lack of choice. Most recent flight was POM- SIN return. The airline is now leasing an aging White Airlines A310 which is older than the previous B767. Seats are appalling IFE does not work and toilets are constantly unservicable. The food is passable but really nothing special. Service is slow and Cabin crew seem unable to deal with complaints or concerns raised by passengers. Overall Air Niugini is not deserving of a three star ranking - a two star ranking would be more appropriate given the decline in the airline's international services.

### Air Niugini customer review
BNE to POM POM to Mt Hagen and return. Was very impressed with service. Cabin staff could not be faulted and very obliging and friendly.

### Air Niugini customer review
SIN-POM Busines Class. Check in at Singapore easy as we were early and able to take advantage of general early check in desk and also a separate Premium check-in area is available. Lounge at SIN is nice with a bit of food. Chaotic getting on plane with lot of pushing - we were sent down at a time when the Economy passengers were still queuing to go through security. Plane very hot and stuffy. Food edible - but you do not need 2 meals on an overnight 6 hour flight! Real problem are seats - the plane is a very tired leased 767 with seats that do not recline much and a poor foot-rest. They are the most uncomfortable seats I have experienced in either business class or economy for a long time. My husband could not sleep so put on his i-pod and was immediately told to turn it off as it was interfering with the radio. IFE did not work.

### Air Niugini customer review
I have been working in Port Moresby for two years and am a regular Air Niugini passenger. Have flown with them to Singapore Tokyo and numerous times to Brisbane. Primary long haul aircraft is still a hard working leased 767-300. Fokker F100 sometimes used on the Brisbane route. Cabin is a bit tired and lacks a good entertainment system. The service is Air Niugini's real plus - always a smile and flight attendants willing to go the extra mile. Fare competitiveness has improved significantly over the past few years with the introduction of competition from Airlines PNG on the Cairns and Brisbane routes. Qantas flights in/out of Port Moresby are codeshare with Air Niugini using Air Niugini aircraft.

### Air Niugini customer review
NRT-POM-BNE Business Class. It was a pleasant experience. FAs are efficient and friendly. I did not have much expectations for the IFE but was actually quite good. 3hour delay at Port Moresby but waiting at the executive lounge time went very quickly. Incidentally I never complain about delay when the airline company's priority is safety and paying extra attention to some fault even if its minor. I heard airliners in South Pacific region as well as Australia and NZ have very good safety record and I deeply appreciate and respect that.

### Air Niugini customer review
CNS-POM-CNS + domestic. The cabin crew are friendly and I would fly with them more if they expanded their route network. Fares are steep but then they have a monopoly on the PNG market. Aesthetic needs a bit of an upgrade as do most parts of the overall product (ie entertainment inflight magazine).

### Air Niugini customer review
The service is always good the food often served cold training required there - the delays are ongoing - why? Why can't we use upgrade certificates on the BNE-POM flight? The lounge in POM is late opening and often doesn't open before the 7am departure - people pay for this service.

### Air Niugini customer review
BNE/POM/MNL/POM/BNE in April 2004. First time with this line. As Mr Tate says the cabin crew are shy but very helpful and courteous. The cheap fare for the round trip (about $820) was the snare but I found them punctual efficient and the food (economy) quite good if a little light on in- flight reading matter.

### Air Niugini customer review
I would not hesitate to fly with Air Niugini Airlines again. I flew twice with them last year (2003) to Singapore and happened to have on board two of the same crew as my previous flight with them. They couldn't do enough for their passengers Qantas could take take a leaf out of their book. I no longer fly with Qantas as I find the staff always trying to avoid going that extra mile especially when it comes to night flights.

### Air Niugini customer review
BNE-POM-BNE Economy. service great flight was full food served promptly the IFE wasn't so good but Air NZ is too blame for that. Fare was cheap. The only thing is the Delays Air Niugini is delayed quite often but the crew are great when the flight has been delayed.
