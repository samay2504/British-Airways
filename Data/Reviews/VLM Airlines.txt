### "offered reasonable prices"
Work required me to go on very short notice to London, so I decided to fly with VLM which offers you three flights per day from Antwerp to London City with their Fokker 50. Decided as well to fly from Antwerp as they offered reasonable prices for their flights, while my usual airlines I usually take from Amsterdam or Rotterdam were extremely expensive for just flying of less than a hour. Arriving a touch early at Antwerp Airport, check-in and security were quite quiet, so it was just a matter of a few minutes to pass both check-in and security, while waiting to board (Very small airport, so don't expect much to do after security.) Once the aircraft was ready to board, it was just 15 minutes to be fully ready to start up and depart. The Fokker 50 they were using was surprisingly neat and clean from the inside for an aircraft of this age and was quite spacious to stand in the aisle. After an on-time departure out of Antwerp, the flight was quite smooth and the flight attendant started to serve us with a complimentary drink and snack of your choosing, while the flight crew kept us up to date about their procedure into London City and the estimated time of arrival, which to me was well done. Turbulence appeared into approach of London and landing was on-time. The most surprising factor of the flight was that the noise was quite low for a turboprop within the cabin. After a on-time landing, the boarding was quickly done in a safe and mannerly matter and all that was left was to wait for our luggage to arrive on our belt, which probably was the longest wait.

### "very poor customer service "
Very poor customer service team, My flight was cancelled and I've been waiting from the of May for a refund. I was told it takes 7-10 days to be transferred into my account, I phoned 3 times to follow this up, the staff were rude on the phone, did not listen, spoke over me saying its done repeating themselves. I still have not received a refund, phoned today and spoke to the most unhelpful lady , who did not listen to my concerns and did not offer to follow it up. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there is no manager, this is obvious in the poor customer service provided by this company.

### "arrived on time both ways"
My wife and I flew VLM from Southampton to Antwerp return on a Fokker 50. Left and arrived on time both ways. Only about half full on way out and three quarters on the return. Had a free beer and snack. Fokker 50 is on a par with more modern turbo props on these short flights. Antwerp airport is a breeze, in a rental car and away within 15 minutes of landing.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Why do we always want to fly the big airlines? VLM has the efficiency of a budget airline, the service of a high value airline and the punctuality of a German airline. They have friendly staff and after landing you are out of the airport in 5 minutes. Moreover book well in advance and you have a very attractive fare.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Cabin crew fantastic as always. Have flown every week with this airline since it started in April 2015. The flights were 104 euros return. The cheapest flight now for a commuter to London is £204 euros if you book months in advance. That is 4 times the price of Ryanair. If you don't book in advance a commuter flight is well over 300 euros. It's just not worth it travel to Cork or Dublin and save yourselves thousands a year if you commute regularly.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Excellent flight, more leg room than other airlines, 1 cabin stewardess who was excellent and  tended to all passenger requirements, served all passengers with  complimentary food with drink (which is unknown nowadays). Good old fashioned service and customers do count. Flight from Waterford VG425 7th June.

### VLM Airlines customer review
RTM-HAM return in F50s. The outbound flight was delayed by about 20 mins due to high winds but the captain kept us informed. There was only one member of cabin crew on this half-full flight yet he managed two full drinks rounds in the short flying time. The return flight was relatively uneventful and arrived on time. For the return fare VLM/CityJet do offer excellent value for money with a full service in economy.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-EIN. The VLM brand is no more (but the ticket still stated VLM). You have to use the CityJet website planes are in CityJet livery and china and glass have been banished in favour of the bog-standard cardboard cups. I tried checking in online but there was a problem with the system. I cannot remember the last time the online check in went smoothly with VLM/CityJet. I eventually managed to do so. Passage through LCY was quick and efficient due to the extra security they've installed and the fact it wasn't a busy period but it was a bit manic at the gate as the ground staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. Consequently we left 20 minutes late. Once in the air the flight was fine (about 70% full) cabin crew managed one bar service and one tea/coffee service during the short flight and handed out Belgian chocolates (at least this VLM feature has been retained). I don't think VLM's standards have slipped due to the takeover by CityJet apart from online check in but the staff at LCY need to get their act together.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY to ANR. Flight left late due to chaotic scenes at the gate ground staff came twice through the plane checking names against boarding cards (obviously having not done it properly first time). Flight otherwise good attentive staff good service.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-Antwerp unable to check in on line for no apparent reason. On arrival check in machines also refused to accept flights to Antwerp. So joined long queue to the 3 check in desks that operated for all the Cityjet flights. Eventually checked in only to find that the security queue snaked through the airport building almost to the doors! Not sure what went wrong but staff were eventually cherry picking those passengers whose flights were imminent to go to front of queue. By contrast the flight both out and back on 30th oct were smooth and uneventful.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY to Antwerp again. This time my booking had been transferred to Air France system and my eticket details had been incorrectly coded as a paper ticket. Unable to check in online so joined another long queue. Had to go to ticket desk where agent blanked me took a phone call and then started talking in French. The convenience of the flight is good but the staff are buffoons who really need urgent retraining.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-Antwerp. Disappointing experience. Long queue at baggage drop due to only one attendant being present. A second eventually appeared but was inadequately prepared - did not have the key to work the baggage belt. Stood there for 5 mins totally ignored whilst the attendant made a barrage of calls to remedy the situation without even a 'sorry to keep you waiting'. Flight OK but I find the Fokker 50s poor and noisy in comparison to the 146s. Overall the same level of mediocrity and couldn't give a stuff attitude that affects so many airlines these days. I would suggest some of their staff need to be sent for re-training.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-AMS-LCY Economy. Great flight on 146/RJ85. Seats a bit tight widthwise but made up for by excellent crew and good food/drink. This on a 45 min flight. Spoilt by disorganisation of KLM - we had flexible tickets and wanted to change our return flights. Were told by KLM staff at the machines "no you can't". Then sent to "check-in assist" where it was clear our flight would be long gone before we got to the front of the queue. Eventually went to ticket counter and asked for refund and a new ticket for our new flight which sorted things out. Then back to bag drop - which took as long as manual check in would; they also must have special selection of staff who can say "have a nice flight" in the most insincere way possible.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-AMS-LCY on codeshare with KLM / CityJet on RJ85s. Both flights on time. Outbound flight nearly empty return flight full. On both flights a drink and a (good) sandwich were offered (although as the outbound flight was mid morning breakfast may have been more appropriate!). Cabin crew attentive on both flights though they were rushed to serve all passengers on the return flight given the heavy loading.

### VLM Airlines customer review
ANR-LCY-ANR friendly check-in staff and friendly flight attendants on both flights. Good sandwich free drink including a small belgian chocolate before the landing is a nice touch for such a short flight. Good seat pitch.

### VLM Airlines customer review
MAN-LCY. Very empty flight. Very friendly crew punctual and great views of the city on the eastern approach into city airport. Arrived early fast baggage delivery.

### VLM Airlines customer review
MAN-LCY. Arrived at MAN about 1hr 45mins before departure and had to wait about 20 mins for check- in to open. I tried to use the self-service machine but couldn't get it to accept my eTicket number. Once check-in had opened a friendly agent spotted that I was only carrying hand baggage and pulled me out of the queue and successfully got me checked in using the s/s machine. Gate (03C) was announced about half an hour before boarding. Gate area is on ground floor directly opening onto the apron and was very poorly heated! Boarding was by bus to the aircraft at a stand. The plane a Fokker 50 was very cold on boarding but soon warmed up once the engines were started. Internally it looked a little tired but who cares on such a short trip? Seat pitch in row 8 was excellent. Inflight magazine said 32 inches but it felt more than that. Cabin crew did an excellent job of serving lunch (cheese or ham rolls) drinks and a chocolate to the quite full flight in the short time available (they also handed out boiled sweets before pushback). The flight continues from LCY to LUX and continuing passengers don't have to disembark - virtually everyone who boarded at MAN disembarked at LCY though. All in all a very pleasant experience. I usually only ever fly between Manchester and London at times like Christmas when there's no/poor train service but the convenient location of LCY for me (living in Kent) means that I would consider this route again - especially if I can't get a cheap advance ticket on the train in which case VLM's fares are often a quite reasonable alternative.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Frequent traveller AMS-LCY-AMS. Outstanding ground boarding (no buses) and onboard service. Very nice seats and catering more extensive than on other European carriers on a 40min flight. Cabin crew friendly and attentive. No baggage problems and biggest delay so far is 40min. I hope now that AF- KL bought VLM they dont change anything at VLM!

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-MAN. Excellent service on this short-haul domestic flight. Flight attendants offered omelette sandwiches and rice pudding as well as a choice of hot and cold beverages with the complimentary meal. The ticket was only marginally more expensive than taking the train or a no-frills airline. Despite a very busy Friday evening at London's City Airport and a fully-booked flight we landed in Manchester on schedule.

### VLM Airlines customer review
This little airline is brilliant. Antwerp to London City. Antwerp is probably the best little airport in the world free parking 10 minute check in simple walk to the plane no fuzz. London City airport is the best airport in London so slightly above mediocre. VLM F50 clean and fitted with great new interior. Staff very friendly and despite short flight two drinks and a sandwich with a smile. Wish this service was available on more routes in Europe

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-AMS. I wanted to fly to Eindhoven but Air France/KLM charged extortionate fares for one-way flights. As Amsterdam Schipol is only 90 mins away from Eindhoven by train I thought I would give VLM a try. I wasn't disappointed! The plane was clean and the drinks were served in glasses as opposed to plastic cups. The single sandwich was a bit stingy but of high quality. My only grumble with VLM is that the website initially displays fares not including taxes. It’s only when you select the flights and proceed to booking that the price becomes comparable with other airlines. Other than that highly recommended!

### VLM Airlines customer review
One wonders how an airline like this can offer free food and drink in such a short period of time have a charming crew clean planes and easy check in and boarding. Flew Hamburg to Rotterdam. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-BRU also due to tunnel fire. Flew out business class as no economy seats left - definitely not worth paying for as the only difference it made was a (marginally) bigger meal than on the return trip in economy. In all other ways the service was great - no queue for check-in friendly staff snacks OK and aircraft seemed in good condition although F50s are a bit dated. I had to hand over my bag on boarding the aircraft as the overhead bins are quite small but it was handed straight back on getting off.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY to BRU because of tunnel fire. Arrived at LCY 30 minutes before departure and pretty much walked onto the aircraft. Large roll and drinks (in actual glasses) served on board by friendly staff. However F50 could definitely do with replacement or interior refurbishment - seats all seemed to be falling apart. Also hugely expensive.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Rotterdam - Hamburg. Check-In in Rotterdam very efficient no queue. Plane was a Fokker 50 in good condition and was only half full so I had 2 seats for myself. FA friendly and helpful. Food and Drinks were better than many other airlines would offer on a similar route. Flight was a 15 minutes late but luggage was already waiting for us at the belt.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-AMS clean newly refurbished F50 comfortable seats and good catering attentive crew on-time. Way better than KLM Cityhopper.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-BRU on Fokker 50. Very good legroom attentive crew sandwich a beer and a coffee on this short flight. I had over 20kg in excess baggage for which VLM decided not to charge . Their call centre staff are pleasant and efficient and changed the departure date of my flight with minimum fuss and at a reasonable cost.

### VLM Airlines customer review
On the short flight from LCY to Amsterdam they manage to serve a choice of sandwiches cake cold drinks and then a separate coffee/tea run through the cabin. Staff are friendly and attentive and the cabin is bright and cheerful with leather seats. Take off and landing both on time or ahead of time. Compare this to the poor service KLM on the same route and the difference is clear - Fly VLM!

### VLM Airlines customer review
RTM-LCY with VLM. Check in took just a few minutes and flight boarded 15 minutes before departure time. In air within 5 minutes of departure time landed at LCY 5 minutes early and on Docklands Railway train away within 15 minutes. On board boiled sweets were offered before take-off and complimentary in-flight snack meal (cheese roll apple pastry coffee and beer) served by pleasant cabin crew. Comfortable seat and great leg room. Highly recommended.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY to MAN. I had checked in on-line and printed my boarding pass. The flight had originally been delayed 20 minutes but in the end departed on schedule. As others have stated the service is excellent although I dont like foccacia bread (a crusty roll would have been my preference). That sad the quality of the chicken sandwich was high (fresh and full of flavour). A chocolate muffin was also served. The tea tasted like real tea and the use of china cups is a nice touch. A good airline and one which deserves to continue its success.

### VLM Airlines customer review
MAN-LCY-AMS-LCY-MAN. What flying should be about. Great staff at checkins and onboard good food and coffee without having to pay for it and real cups too. This airline that I had never previously heard of seems to believe in old fashioned good service at competitive prices and they make a profit so it can be done without penny pinching and charging extra for everything. Highly recommended.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-MAN-LCY - Superb service in a recently refitted F50. On time both ways and good in flight catering for such a short flight. On the return to LCY I left a item of property on board. The effort to trace the item was outstanding and it was returned to me within days after making only one call to VLM in London. Forget the train to Manchester from London. Go with this airline at a third of the cost.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-MAN-LCY Booking well in advance saved considerable time and money over the equivalent train journey. Cabin crew were pleasant but I do wonder why on such a short flight it's necessary to offer food albeit just a sandwich - I'd rather pay less on the ticket price. On the return journey the ground staff at MAN were extremely helpful to let me switch without charge to an earlier flight. Overall I found VLM efficient and helpful and would certainly use them again. After all flying in a Fokker 50 puddlejumper was actually fun!

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-BRU. VLM isn't a bad option but the comparison with Eurostar on the Brussels route isn't credible. I can get so much work done in comfort on Eurostar on both the outbound and return journeys using my phone when I need to. Give me that rather than a bumpy Fokker 50 often delayed/cancelled by fog any day!

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-BRU. I go to Brussels regularly on Eurostar but on this occasion tried VLM. The service was excellent given the very short flight. It was far cheaper than Eurostar and was also quicker even taking into account the time needed to get to the airport. The only problem with VLM is the frequency - 5-6 flights per day is not enough to compete with the train and the timings are not great for a business day trip from London. If they had an equivalent frequency to Eurostar I would always use them.

### VLM Airlines customer review
LCY-BRU and what a great little airline this is. OK plane was old cabin crew were not smiling all the time but apart from that I was very impressed. I read many nice comments here but it was better then I have expected. Check in easy and very fast boarding 10 minutes before departure and still left on time pre take off sweets drink in proper glass coffee in china nice (not particularly tasty) bacon baguette very tasty pre landing chocolate. Cabin crew were present in the cabin during all flight and were nice but didn't smile. I was sitting in the last row and being cabin crew myself I wasn't impressed by cabin crew reading newspaper during landing when she should be in her landing position but I have seen it many times on many different airlines. I didn't even mind that plane was one of the oldest in their fleet as I love turbo props and the noise they make. It's great to fly lower then on jet planes as you get nicer view. For 55 quid I paid for my flight I would give the whole experience 9/10.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Have nothing but praise this airline. A competitor cancelled by misstake our return leg out of Liverpool to Basle and the ground staff was not helpful at all (to say it in a polite manner). What a difference at the VLM ticket counter. The woman knew our situation and offered us a reasonably priced ticket to LCY from where we could continue our journey. As we booked last minute and security checks etc. took longer we got denied boarding at the gate as the flight would have left late if it waited for us to be bussed to the aircraft. Received free lounge acces in Liverpool (A special offer at the moment) and free rebooking to the next flight. Friendly FAs served candies upon boarding and free food and drinks during the short flight. Of course it was somewhat like a cold hamburger but more important is the way they treat you. You might pay a bit more but you get treated as a human being. Arrival in LCY was smooth and in the terminal within minutes. Called their London office a couple of days ago for a copy of the electronic ticket. We need that to reclaim the money from their orange competitor. This request was handled promptly and with no problems! Their Fokker 50s are ok for the routes they use. All in all reminds me of what Crossair used to be years ago. Friendly staff nice service etc.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Flown a few times from LCY-MAN in the last couple of months. Service has always been great - easy check in easy 'onto the plane' and great service once airborne. Only downside is the walk you then have through terminal 3 at MAN as the plane 'parks' in-front of T1. Flights always depart on time and usually a few minutes early into MAN. Prices invariably cheaper than travelling Virgin trains and on a Sunday the time comparison (1 hour as compared to 4+) makes it all worthwhile.

### VLM Airlines customer review
London City to Manchester. After reading other passengers comments I was expecting a great service. This is far from what I received. My original flight was cancelled with no reason or explanation given they managed to swap me to another flight but that was running late. My colleagues on the 7:20 flight didn’t take off until 10:30. Upon boarding the fokker 50 the cabin crew (just one person) may just have been wearing a sign saying “I’m having a bad day” the attitude was absolutely terrible. It would be unfair to name this person but she did not smile once during the flight and was stern and just so unfriendly. There were no pre take off sweets. I do not understand how anyone can say VLM’s food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate. Certainly no chocolates as others have mentioned. On a positive I had a problem with my e-ticket for my return trip and the lady at the VLM ticket office at Manchester airport was helpful friendly and smiled! Shame she isn’t working as cabin crew!

### VLM Airlines customer review
Manchester - London City. Very impressed. Flight was called for boarding 10 mins before departure and was greeted by 2 very friendly FA's seating fine for a 50 min flight offered pre take off sweets. Once we took off Crew offered Ham or cheese sandwiches complimentary drinks from the bar then tea or coffee finished off with Belgian chocolates. All drinks were served in china mugs and glass tumblers made it feel more like Business class. Arrived on time and as I arrived at the luggage belt my bag was already there within five minutes of Landing I was on my way into London. Excellent service Excellent Crew. No complaints

### VLM Airlines customer review
I fly Manchester - London City with VLM on most Friday mornings (the 9.30 am flight) and it appears to be a reliable service. Wheels up is normally at 9.45 and you are on the ground again at 10.30. A good price of £41 all inclusive is available if you book about 3 weeks in advance. It is not a lot quicker than the train for city centre to city centre travel but in my case I am going from South Manchester to Essex and there is an hours time saving.

### VLM Airlines customer review
I recently flew for business from London City to Rotterdam returning from Antwerp 3 days later. When our return flight was cancelled after a freak snow storm the only option we were given was to transfer to the 8am flight the next morning which itself was by no means guaranteed to depart. We were told point blank and with a shrug of shoulders that a refund would not be possible nor were we offered food vouchers transport or accommodation all of which we had to pay for ourselves. Such a shame to let themselves down so appallingly when they perform well in other areas. A colleague encountered an identical situation with Air Berlin the same week and was immediately offered a full refund - no questions asked.

### VLM Airlines customer review
I commented earlier this year about the food being tatty. There has been a considerable improvement in the food offered good news in that respect ! If you are a regular passenger on the Manchester / London City and use the late afternoon / evening flights you may have noticed recently that for some reason departures and arrivals are frequently delayed. This is a real nuisance when you have to have commitments at the other end. These flights are used by mainly by business and professional passengers who have commitments. The challege is for VLM to get its act together and improve on the service which has been most disappointing of late. Time is money.

### VLM Airlines customer review
London City to Jersey 15.50 Friday 16.9.2005. Firstly delayed because of fog. Then taking off at 8.00pm. Then cancelled because of 'weather conditions ' - so no compensation and no alternative but the 6am flight the next morning. How do you get to LC airport at 5.30am ? At what cost is the overnight stay and the transport let alone the cancelled appointments loss of a day's paid holiday etc ? VLM personnel unconcerned; supervisor unavailable ( 45 mins later turned up) No compensation no accommodation overnight . No transport and the airport closes shortly. Lies about weather conditions to avoid compensation for cancellation- other flights were landing in Jersey all this time as confirmed by other passengers being met in Jersey.

### VLM Airlines customer review
Amsterdam - London City (3rd October). No hassles for check-in with a total of 14 passengers on the flight (Fokker 50 with something around 50 seats I presume). Flight left on time and arrived into London City airport 5 minutes early. Excellent service from the two cabin crew during the flight including information on how to reach the city from LCY airport. Inflight meals were great (I did end up eating a business class meal but economy meal looked fine also for a 45 minute flight). Will certainly fly VLM again should they fly where I'm heading!

### VLM Airlines customer review
I flew London City to Brussels with VLM and found them to be a very friendly and professional airline. Boarding was very quick and we took off on time. Shortly after take-off we were given sandwiches and mini Belgian waffles which I didn't really expect. The Fokker 50 was quite spacious with Grey leather seats. We had plenty of head and feet room and the aisle was wide enough to walk down comfortably! The return flight was exactly the same quick check-in and boarding with friendly staff and a clean aircraft.
