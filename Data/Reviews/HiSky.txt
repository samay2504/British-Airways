### "attendants were pleasant and helpful"
Very impressed with HiSky. The trip from JFK and back from OTP was on par with major airlines, we had entertainment and good food (I loved the breakfast Romanian sausages - crenwurst). The flight attendants were pleasant and helpful, flight was on time each way. It would be useful if they partnered with United or a US airline to connect flights. Right now it’s a hassle to connect into JFK on two tickets.

### "bad experience with my flight"
Not Verified |  I had my bad experience with my flight. I had to fly to Oradea from Bucharest and my flight got delayed with 2 hours (my flight was initially at 8.30 AM and got delayed at 10.30). The check in was supposed to close one hour before departure (at 9.30 AM) so we went there at 9 to find that the check in desk were not open and not even written on the screen. So we started to ask around where could we talk (cause they dont have no info point or customer service service) with anybody about the luggage that we should have left at the check in. After we walked around 15 minutes to meet a guy that send us to an employee with a miserable attitude and audacity, considering the company’s mistakes. The employee lied to us, telling us that it is our mistake that we came this late and that the rules of the company were that the check in desk was open regarding the initial hour of departure(so after her words we should have been there at 7.30 AM). After she treated us with arrogance and lied to our face i called the company complaining about the situation we had and the company excused themselves about the situation and told me that the employee indeed was mistaken. Beside the fact that i met that unprofessional disgusting employee, our flight got delayed again cause the airplane didnt reach Bucharest.

### "unable to check in online"
I had an awful experience with this airline. Their app is unreliable, it doesn’t always work or update, which led me to pay extra airport fees due to being unable to check in online. Despite providing screenshots as proof from various times, no one cared. They just want you to pay and move on. Their aftersales customer service is nonexistent, and I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

### "worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. When i got the tickets for this charter flight i was supposed to fly at 8 am, then we were notice for a change at 11 am, then 12.30, then 13.30 and in the end they did fly at almost 14.00. There was no free water on the plane, only a glass per person for 12h flight. The food: i salami bread with no veggies or cheese just plain bread and salami. Then for 10 h they sold all the duty free junk food. 1 hour before landing they came with the warm food. I find it appalling the entire service, delays, food and the fact that there are agencies such as Karpaten and Dertour that won’t sell you a hotel without this private flight company.

### "wonderful experience"
Not Verified | Very comfortable and the staff were really nice, our flight was not delayed - it was wonderful flying with HiSky as it was my first time flying with them and had a wonderful experience

### "an awful experience"
Flying with this company was an awful experience, seats are so close that practically you breath on the neck of passenger in front of you, staff quite cheeky and unable to offer reassurance to distress passengers who had to endure a long flight just to be told that they cannot land in cluj due to heavy fog, we had to land in Bucharest and wait, people were obviously very tired and staff didn’t help not even with water when passengers asked. Their answers were cheeky and don’t know the meaning of politeness or costumer service manners.

### "Uneventful and generic flight"
On the positive side, easy check in online and at the airport, including being able to carry a slightly larger backpack on the plane. On the negative, aircraft was not well air conditioned, meals were generic (e.g., piece of bread, butter, marmalade, and something that looked like mac and cheese for the first meal, and equally basic for the second meal, without vegetarian options). Entertainment was basic, crew was insufficient in numbers to handle requests. Uneventful and generic flight. I suggest using this airline only if the price is significantly discounted, otherwise, for a route from NYC to Europe, use United, Lufthansa, or even LOT.

### "experience was deplorable"
Disastrous experience with this company. Yesterday I had a flight from Bucharest to Cluj scheduled at 20:20. I arrive at the Otopeni Airport Check-in desk an hour or so before departure after a flight delay from Istanbul to Bucharest, and when I check-in I am asked for a 15 euro fee because I didn't check-in earlier because online check-in was not possible! In addition, the take-off did not take place at 20:30, but was postponed until 22:00, and the announcement was very dry from the company's employees: "the plane will leave at 22:00, stay in the area". The people who were already tired of waiting at 10:00 PM came again to the ticket control office and rightly asked for clarifications as to why boarding was not being carried out, the answer was that: "we are waiting for the aircraft from Timișoara" Among the passengers the President of the Romanian Academy was also on the flight, who received an answer like: "it's summer and all the companies have delays" downright pitiful. Finally the plane took off at 22:57 from Otopeni airport. It was my first time flying with this company and I will definitely avoid it in the future. I do not recommend this company. The experience was deplorable. Lack of professionalism and conduct. Avoid HiSky, choose other companies! | Experiență dezastruasă cu această companie... Ieri aveam zbor de la București la Cluj programat la 20:20. Ajung la biroul de Check-in din Aeroportul Otopeni cu o oră și ceva înaitne de plecare după o întârziere a unui zbor din Istanbul spre București, și când să-mi fac Check-in-ul mi se solicită o taxă de 15 euro pentru că nu mi-am făcut Check-in-ul mai devreme în condițiile în care Check-in-ul online nu era posibil! Pe lângă asta decolarea nu a mai avut loc la ora 20:30 ci s-a amânat până la ora 22:00, iar anunțul a fost unul foarte sec din partea angajaților companiei: " avionul va pleca la ora 22:00, rămâneți în zonă". Oamenii care erau deja sătui de așteptat la ora 22:00 au venit din nou la biroul de control bilete și au cerut pe bună dreptate lămuriri de ce anume nu se efectuează îmbarcarea, răspunsul a fost că: "așteptăm aeronava de la Timișoara" Printre pasagerii zborului se afla și Președintele Academiei Române, care a primit un răspuns de genul:" este vară și toate companiile au întârzieri" Jalnic de-a dreptul... În cele din urmă avionul a decolat la ora 22:57 de pe aeroportul Otopeni. Pentru mine a fost prima dată când zbor cu această companie și cu siguranță o voi evita pe viitor. Nu recomand această companie. Experiența a fost una deplorabilă. Lipsă de profesionalism și de conduită. Feriți-vă de HiSky, alegeți alte companii!

### "I am totally disappointed"
Very bad experience, our flight was 2 hours late. And the flight attendant 30 min after our airplane took off, did not allow passengers to use the toilets due to turbulences. Which is normal but even after the turbulence was over, we were told in a very rude manner that access to toilet was not allowed and that we need to return to our seats. The flight attendant had a refractory attitude and zero understanding or empathy towards the passengers. I am totally disappointed with the service of this company. Furthermore, the flight attendant after 1h30 disappeared, he went into the cockpit and came out again at the end of the flight. The food and beverage services were made in 5 minutes, in a maximum rush as if they did not actually wanted to sell anything to the passengers. They were in a hurry to finish this service as soon as possible, not carrying about passengers needs. I will avoid this airline company in the future, that for sure. Zero comprehension, zero tolerance, no professionalism, this is not acceptable.

### "very bad experience"
Awful crew, very bad experience, zero customer service, never again! They treated us very poorly, not even with decency to let us use the toilets during the flight. They seatbelt sign was on whole 5h flight and had to fight with the flight assistant to go to the toilet, no assistance for luggage to be handled, flight delayed 2 hrs.

### “the staff treated us so badly”
This is the 3rd time fliyng with this company and every single time I was deeply disappointed and I swear this is the last time. The last flight was 8 hours delayed and the staff treated us so badly.

### “Stay away from this airline”
Not Verified | Stay away from this airline. We were supposed to fly with them at 6 AM, but they changed the flight to 11 PM! They don’t care that customers are losing one full day and half of the first night of their booked vacation. They offer no compensation for this and just carry on. Nobody is doing anything, and that is why these airlines get to do whatever they want. Avoid them! !

### "Large leg space on the plane"
For a low cost company, HiSky are amazingly good. Preflight service is good, I needed online support and got it. Large leg space on the plane. Takeoffs were on time.

### "they are very rude and aggressive"
Not Verified |  They have lost my luggage and for 1 month they did minimum effort to help me get my luggage back. Flight was direct! Their customer service team barely replies to emails, yells at you and even hang up the phone. They keep telling me the luggage doesn't exist anymore, no matter the tracking used that they can not find it and that there is no record of the luggage being put in the plane. They didn't even bother to find out latest updates from Barcelona airport, I managed to get all info by myself and I was constantly informing them about the status of my bag. They were constantly blaming Barcelona airport, saying it's not their problem and when I asked them why Barcelona airport provides me all details and they receive no reply, they said it's not their problem. They told me I am entitled to compensation, yet no one replies to my emails and there is no Claims dep phone number. I understand they did not handle the transfer of my bag, yet they do almost nothing to assist me/support me in identifying the bag/receiving the compensation. On top they are very rude and aggressive.

### "Waste of money, stay away"
The worst airline in the world. The flight took off 6 hours late and there is no one to talk to. Beyond that they have terrible service. Waste of money, stay away.

### "it is not a serious company"
I do not recommend this company, on 25/07/2023, following the flight made by hisky, my luggage was damaged, I reported this through a complaint, the company decided that the luggage was not damaged following the assumptions and did not register the complaint until I requested repeatedly, it is not a serious company. During the flight, water dripped on our heads from the bridge of the aircraft, plus we had an unpleasant situation where the company representatives tried to force us to change the seats that we bought for them because other passengers have children and they don't have seats for them. Nu recomand aceasta companie, la data de 25/07/2023 , in urma zborului efectuat de hisky mi s-a deteriorat bagajul, in mod legal am raportat asta printro reclamatie, compania a decis ca bagajul nu este deteriorat in urma presupunerilor si nu a inregistrat reclamatia pina nu am solicitat in mod repetat, este o companie ne serioasa. In timpul zborului ne picura in cap apa din podul aeronavei, plus am avut o situatie neplacuta unde reprezenantii companii incercau sa ne impuna sa ne schimbam locurile care li-am procurat din motiv ca alti pasageri au copii si nu au locuri pentru ei.

### "staff were nice"
Not Verified | Good service. I didn't have any problems with check in or any other issues before flight. Low cost airline. So no high expectations. The staff were nice. and compering to other flight of other airline but same route on same time, our flight time was short in half hour.

### "I cannot positively recommend"
Some amateurs in aviation, with maximum stupidity and insensitivity and whom I cannot positively recommend. A charter flight, for a holiday through Dertour, with the pathetic company Hi Sky, in which the passengers (between 20 and 30 seats; 7-10 rows of successive seats) left no room for hand luggage both on the way there but especially on the way back so the crew puts the cigarette cartridges and duty-free goods. The flight attendant yelled at the passengers not to open the compartments because that's where the crew's luggage is and they can put their luggage further forward (over 5-6 rows; probably that's how rational & organizational they can be) or between the legs under the passenger in front. Niste amatori in aviatie, cu tupeu si nesimtire maxima si pe care nu ii pot recomanda pozitiv. Un zbor charter, de vacanta prin Dertour, cu compania jalnica Hi Sky, in care atat la dus dar mai ales la intoarcere au lasat pasagerii (intre 20 ei 30 de locuri; 7- 10 randuri de scaune succesive) fara spatiu la bagaje de mana pt asi pune echipajul cartusele de tigari si bunurile traficate fara taxe. Insotitorul de zbor, urla la pasageri sa nu mai deschida compartimentele pt ca acolo sunt bagajele echipajului si ei isi pot pune bagajele mai in fata (peste 5-6 randuri; probabil atat pot rational&organizatoric) sau intre picioare sub pasagerul din fata.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible experience! We are a family of 4, traveling with 2 small kids (3 and 6) and we bought 4 seats next to each other on the the 1st row. Despite having an online check in confirming our seats (for which we paid) we were given different seats 20 rows apart (row 4 and row 23) splitting our family in two. No reason was provided and no interest to help us and to seat us together. The customer service is horrible and when contacted after the journey they were blatantly lying saying kids under 12 are not allowed to fly on that row: they sat another family with small kids (infants) there and we ourselves flew on the outbound flight on the first row - so clearly just a lie to cover up their own mess and incompetence. Avoid this company at all costs! Terrible customer service communication and no effort to even support or try to understand or help a customer! Never again!

### "they had no interest
We were 3 passengers, 2 adults and 1 child (4 years old). The child seat was in the front and the other was on other part of the plane. I told that to the staff and i was told to be seated and they will ask other passenger to understand and let the child stay with an adult. After take off they had no interest in doing that, my child all flight was 2 rows apart from my wife and me 7 rows away. They don't have any online check-ins in charter, for a 6 hour flight not a single bottle of water for child or a sandwich , you need to buy everything at extra price.

### "fast and efficient attention via email"
Not Verified | New planes, punctual, space between seats. I had to cancel a flight and fast and efficient attention via email. Tolerant with luggage without extra cost. Very good. Out of 10 Recommended | Aviones nuevos, puntuales, espacio entre asientos. Tuve que cancelar un vuelo y atención rápida y eficiente vía mail. Tolerantes con equipajes sin sobre coste. Muy bien. De 10 Recomendable

### "Really bad experience"
Really bad experience! Worse ever! Traveling from Tenerifes to Bucharest, half a day. Traveled with a lithuanian aircraft, no service at all! Not even a glass of water offered during the 7 hours of flight! Do not recommend at all! Very small low cost company, worse experience ever!

### "I have only good things to say about HiSky"
Not Verified |  I had to change my flight route to Venice a few days in advance due to a doctor's appointment, and thankfully found HiSky's Chisinau-Venice route, which fit my timing needs perfectly. I had no problems booking the flight, during check-in (and bag checking), and boarding. The plane was comfortable (the seats were actually upholstered with fabric rather than the faux leather that's so common in many planes now, the fabric seats are more comfy), the flight staff were friendly and helpful, and the flight took off and landed on time. While there was no in-flight entertainment (and I don't recall if there was food/drink service), it really didn't matter because the flight wasn't very long, the seats were very comfortable (as I'd mentioned), and the airline's magazine was lengthy and well-written. I have only good things to say about HiSky: the scheduled flight perfectly met my needs and fit my schedule, took off and landed on time safely, and was pleasant in all ways on board. Keep up the good work, HiSky.

### "Definitely not recommend it"
I was more than disappointed with both the agency staff at the airport and the customer support services. When I booked my flight I've included an extra baggage of 23kg. When I reached the check in and tried to leave my baggage the staff warned me that it exceeds the weight with 4kg and I have to pay for the difference. I said 'fair enough' and went to pay for the extra weight but the lady at the counter told me that I'm not able to pay just the difference, that I have to pay for a whole additional bag. She told me that I'm 100% going get my money back on the 23kg bag. I just have to contact the customer support, provide the flight information and a proof of the second baggage payment. I didn't had time to feel relieved because I asked for her name, as a means of evidence that a valid staff member gave me this information, and she refused it to tell me multiple times. Seeing that I was getting nowhere and because I was short on time I left and called the customer support as soon as I got back home. Did that, provided all the details I've mentioned and they told me I will receive an email and eventually my money back in around 3 working days. Initially they said they don't have any refund policy except if the request for refund was made in the same day as the payment. That sounded a bit off, taking in consideration what the agency staff lady told me earlier, but fortunately for me I was complying with this constraint. I tried to point out that is extremely unprofessional to have collaborating agencies in which the staff is comfortable to lie/misguide when it comes to the airline policies just to avoid a certain situation. More than a week passes by and nothing happened so I called again. I've requested to receive an email update multiple times and still nothing...After more than a month still nothing... Definitely not recommend it!

### "Had the very nice surprise of discovering this airline"
Not Verified |  Had the very nice surprise of discovering this airline for traveling to Bucharest-Brussels in December 2022. I hope the airline will continue to grow - as flights to Brussels have just been introduced by the company - and will keep up their good services. For both flights the boarding was extremely on-time and the flight smooth and a lot very on-time. Good luck to this young company and if things remain as they are, I will certainly replace my usual Tarom flights Brussels-Bucharest with HiSky.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Bad. Never know when or if you will actually take off. Customer service is of zero help and can’t tell you anything about the flights. Inflight services are lowest possible quality and planes are in bad shape. The cabin crew is friendly at least (if you make it into the cabin, that is). Avoid at all costs.
