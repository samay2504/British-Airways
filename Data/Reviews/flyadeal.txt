### "flight was the worst ever"
The flight was the worst ever. The space was too small so if you are claustrophobic you will definitely get panic attack. The seats are not comfortable at all, kind of plastic and don't lean back, when you sit, you are stuck to one pose for the whole flight. There is no sign of entertainment or screens, and of course no wifi.

### "the counter closed 5min before"
Not Verified |  We reached for check-in 55mins before the departure time. We had no check-in luggage and had just a small backpack and they refused to give the boarding pass stating that the counter closed 5min before. While you try to check-in online, they will provide you boarding for which you have to pay to select the seat. The woman on the counter was horrible, and just said buy another ticket, which by the way was of more than double price.

### "Never fly with Flyadeal again"
Not Verified | Never fly with Flyadeal again they are scammers. Trying their best to charge you money. I have carry on on round trip Riyadh to Jeddah. They asked to pay on them in my back flight. They charged SR180 on each. I have 4 carries on. Further, after you buy the ticket and when you do check-in they asked you to pay for the seats. Never see aircraft like this

### "they said the boarding was closed"
The worst airline ever, I don’t recommend. My flight was at 6:55am I was at the gate by 6:00am they were still close, so I decided to go toilet, pray and come back, so I get back to the boarding gate by 6:23am they said the boarding was closed and I lost my ticket! It wasn’t only me but other 10 passengers. They haven’t even announced they gonna close the gate. They do that to rip people off, no refund or any kind of commendation was offered

### "reached around 5 minutes late"
Had a dreadful experience with Flyadeal today (20 Aug 2022) on flying from Dammam to Jeddah (flight time 1:55 AM) for Umrah. Having booked 6 tickets and reached around 5 minutes late and was denied check in, for a flight that was on delay for 25 minutes. One staff was frantically trying to connect to a system which would never open for about an hour, another staff would collect the current reports and slipped off saying nothing but "There's nothing that I can do" and yes the Supervisor, who does not care of anything but customer satisfaction. I always understood that customer satisfaction was of utmost importance for any business but on flyadeal it was nothing but the opposite. Also to point, all in unison said one thing "Take a New Ticket", easy when said. 10 minutes into our reaching the check in point, we noticed there were other passengers around 14 of whom some had reached even before us and facing the same problem. It was though the airlines was waiting for the clock to strike 12:55 and then close the counters for good. In spite of seeing me in Ihram and having said my intentions for Umrah, there was not a slight of consideration from the staffs or the supervisor, by which it struck me that they give high regards to their policy rather than Allah, that too in a country like Saudi Arabia where people are given value and not troubled for such trivial but unavoidable and genuine cases. In amidst of all this the supervisor had vanished, nowhere to be seen. Slowly the other staffs also began to move away and we were left with no one to raise a concern with. Also to take to consideration is that the flight was delayed for 25 mins and there was no problem for it, but a 5 minute delay from our end cost us our time, money and chance for Umrah. Airlines should improve their customer satisfaction areas as there can be always unexpected delays and a mere 5- 10 or even 20 minutes should be granted entry. Of course last minute entries are problematic and should be handled separately. Policies are always good to ensure correct procedures and delays but equally important is customer satisfaction and providing expectations on relevant cases.

### "won't issue a boarding pass for us"
I had booked a flight with flyadeal for Aug20. On arriving the airport. The boarding time was 1.55 am and we arrived just 3 minutes after they close the check-in counter. We were a total of 6 tickets (my family). The staff there would not even issue a boarding pass for us nor would help us in any way they could. They just had one thing to say, book a new ticket then their counter would open. We were going to perform umrah, that morning. The saddest part was flight is still there and the flight boarding time is delay too, but what to do if those staffs over there at the counter won't issue a boarding pass for us.

### "charged me the fees of my laptop bag"
The worst travel and service of my life, I am a frequent flyer on all kind of airlines regardless Flyadeal is a budget Airline they are residuals in terms of services and policy I travelled with my parents over 70 years of age and the counter staff / supervisor treated us very bad , rather than offering them wheel chair they made from is ping pong from departure entrance to counter four times asking to fit your handcarry, we are allowed 7kg each passenger and we are travelling 4 together holding two bags of 22kg as my parents can’t carry anything. we split into more bags as per the request of supervisor but now he said you weight is fine but number of pieces has to be reduced, all the mess he made of make money and he even charged me the fees of my laptop bag which he considered a separate piece on top of all when I complain he said you can make fuss here it’s my country not yours. This is the standard and service Flyadeal is providing and hired staff to rip-off people , the management have to have shame of giving such training to staff and teach them to respect the passengers and treat them like your guest.

### "So much delay"
Worst airline ever: 1) You can't carry a laptop bag unless you pay for it. 2) You cant get your drink on board, you have to throw it. 3) So much delay waiting to be seated. 4) All flights from Dammam airport go through gates directly to the aircraft without using a bus except for this airline. 5) So much delay waiting in the bus to get into the aircraft.

### "prices are quite unreasonably high"
Flew on a routine domestic service from Jeddah to Riyadh. The aircraft was OK for the 1 hour flight. I had paid for meals and water which I never received. So I’m quite disappointed. Legroom was quite bad and the seat wasn’t uncomfortable. But I can’t complain much for the 1 hr flight. I have to say the prices are quite unreasonably high.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience. From the moment you book the tickets till you get off the plane. I booked a seat and paid for it, when I board the plane, my seat was changed to the back of the plane. Check in employees were dead slow. Seat Space does not exist and they don't recline. The airline tries to rip you off all the time, through hidden costs are everywhere e.g. water bottle could be part of your ticket which you will pay but never receive, and check in costs.

### "Hidden charges always leave the clients with negative experience"
Flyadeal price advertised price is not the real price which you will be asked to pay at the end of the booking process! You will be surprised with the additional cost. If you say from the start the flight cost will be for example 200$, why you add at the end 30$ for the seat cost! Where do you expect us to sit? On the wings or hanging on the airplane's landing gears! Hidden charges always leave the clients with negative experience, and indicate bad customer service.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  I had booked a flight in 2020, however due to COVID the flight was cancelled and the airline issued me a credit which had an expiry in Mar-2021. When i tried calling the call center a lady went on a barrage of insults, and when I politely mentioned that I would lodge a complaint she went on "Yes, please do make a complaint if you can" in a threatening note. One of the worst airlines, never fly.

### "a list of the worst 10 airlines"
I've used many many airlines, but as bad as flyadeal I have truly never seen or experienced before. If I were to make a list of the worst 10 airlines. You definitely would take the first five slaots.

### "be cautious with this airline"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Flyadeal on June 10th from Riyadh to Dammam for June 21. On arrival at King Khalid Airport, I discovered the flight scheduled for 8.35pm, didn't exist. All flights currently stop at 6pm at the airport. This is at time of writing. I paid for the flight with my Debit card and am now waiting for a refund for a flight that never happened. Whether I receive my refund remains to be seen. Please be cautious with this airline.

### "worst travel experience ever"
Qassim to Jeddah. The flight suppose to depart at 15:50 it was delayed while we are waiting inside to get Into the plane and they told us the new time is 18:55 Hrs We waited inside Airport after checked in for 2:30 hrs and once the gate opened they took first 150 passengers and canceled all remaining tickets. Of course without any refund. It is very obvious that they overbook the flight . When we talked to the available staff at the gate he said I can’t do any thing and he was very unpleasant person to talk with. I had to pay additional SAR 450 and fly back by Saudi airlines ( only available and remaining next flight ) . I hope the airline authorities stop this kind of practices not allowed any airline to do that to their customers. I do not recommend any person to travel with Flyadeal - the worst travel experience ever.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. They closed the check in counter while I am waiting in front of the employee who was checking me in. When I complained to the duty manager they denied it. So I missed the Dammam to Jeddah flight. Coming back the airplane was late for 5 hours and no one informed us. When we complained they said we sent a notice, it might be by mistake that you didn’t receive it. They never apologized. I was going to Umrah and I did not feel happy at all flying with flyadeal I strongly advise against this airlines. They abide to no rule. Waste of money and time.

### "Bad, bad deal"
Jeddah to Dammam. Bad, bad deal. 2 hours after the scheduled takeoff time I’m writing this review from my seat in the plane on the tarmac. There were no announcements, no updates on the screens half an hour after scheduled takeoff time. The ground staff were beyond terrible. Passengers were told they were tiring, huffed and puffed at and sent from gate 2 to gate 5 to gate 2 - until a passenger exploded in rage demanding to meet the supervisor - granted he was loud - but he was told to go away. Finally this passenger managed to go to the civil aviation office and a new flight time was displayed and the flight has still not departed 2 hours after scheduled flight time. Delays happen - the aviation industry has its standards and benchmarks in today’s world. A lot of work needs to be done and I would not travel on this airline again.

### "a really poor airline"
Not Verified |  Jeddah to Qausim. It is a really poor airline. I had 2 tickets in the same fly airline (Flyadeal) to different cities, the first flight was delayed more than five hours and I missed the other one. They refuse to pay me anything or give to me another ticket for the flight I missed.

### "consider flying Flyadeal more"
This is Saudia's (Saudi Arabian Airlines) budget/low-cost airline. I have flown 3 flights recently. This flight was on a one year old A320, though the carpets and upholstery were looking tired. What impresses me about this airline is it's on time! This flight arrived at the gate 25 minutes early. I pre-paid for row 2 seat and a chicken byriani. In total, the fare was far less than Saudia's standard 'guest' fare. At Tabuk, Flyadeal choose not to use air bridges and boarding is quick and efficient using stairs at the front and rear of the plane. Service on board is fast and efficient. The seats are comfortable enough fora 90 minute flight. The food was very good. It was hot, tasty and the chicken was not dry. Crew were friendly and efficient. There's supposed to be a 7kg hand luggage limit and this wasn't checked. The major issue this airline has is that some passengers do not understand the 'budget' airline concept. I will certainly consider flying Flyadeal more regularly.

### "do not care about the customer"
I booked a flight with flyadeal on December 13 from Riyadh to Jeddah. They have made a new rule of arriving 60 minutes before boarding time even for local flights. All of these new rules are for the purpose of sucking the money out of the poor customer. The boarding time was 10:55 Pm for my flight and I arrived 10 minutes afterwards. The customer agent would not issue a boarding pass for me nor help me. They said to me to go to their office but it was closed. They asked me to call the customer care and it was closed. All of this indicates that they do not care about the customer. They care about making money. Their new way of making money is to make rules that will take advantage of people. So closing gates and boarding time way before the other airlines.

### "Pathetic service"
Flew flyadeal from Jeddah to Dammam. Pathetic service. Flight was delayed for more than 2 hours without any information. Initially held at airport counter without any info. Later kept in aircraft without any info. The customer experience is not given any importance Never fly this airline.

### "Wheelchair was not arranged"
Riyadh to Jeddah. It was Low Cost Carrier So had to pay for baggage and Snacks. Price of check-in baggage if bought at time of checking-in was as high as 100 SAR per baggage piece i.e 50% of total fare. Even upon request Wheelchair was not arranged. But some how ground handling staff arranged it from some other airline. Snacks Price were bit high during flight. Upon Landing at Jeddah there were no Jet bridges so I requested Ambulator (Medical Lift), which they clearly denied that they cannot call and Ambulator for me so had to use stairs to hop off the aircraft. In my personal Opinion it is a cruel act. Luckily I can walk with sticks but what about Passengers who are completely dependant upon wheel chair.
