### "stung with excess baggage fees"
The flight only had one class. We were stung with excess baggage fees every trip (our bags were 24 kgs each) as the airline  only allows 20 kgs of luggage. The planes for each flight were packed with hand luggage but no one was checking that this was in limits. It was just sad to see a once fantastic airline become second rate.

### "fly again with them in a heartbeat"
Bangkok Airways is a lovely "boutique" airline. They are well run, pleasant, and efficient. They go the extra mile. I'd fly again with them in a heartbeat. It's a 1 hr. flight from Sukhothai to Bangkok. Due to massive flooding, the road to the airport was closed. However, the airfield was dry and the flight stayed on time. How did we get there? They sent a 4WD pickup truck to meet us on the other side of the Yom River, at a temple, where our driver could get us. The drive through the flood waters was tricky, but we made it, as did a nearly full cabin of other passengers. We were not charged for this service (if there was a charge, the place where we stayed may have picked it up). The flight is about an hour. Still, they served a meal, and a good one at that.

### "Best ever internal flight"
Best ever internal flight I have had world wide. It was an 11am flight. It left on time arrived on time. Was served a full hot meal service on a one hour flight. Can’t rate them highly enough.

### "Superb flight"
Superb flight. Left on time and arrived early. This typifies the reason why Bangkok Airways is world best regional airline. You got a little bag with a sandwich and water which was tasty.

### “always has to have a delay”
This company always has to have a delay. There is not one flight with Bangkok Airways that flew on time. Always check to have enough connection time cabin crews are nice. But far away from to know what service means, too many cabin announcements that gives you a headache.

### "cabin was very dirty and outdated"
This flight was ok, but my biggest remark is that the cabin was very dirty and outdated. The tray table and the toilet (pictures provided below) were very dirty. The flight attendants were very polite and friendly. The food was pretty bland and the juice wasn’t good. The dessert was ok. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes, but everything was fine. I would recommend this airline for short-haul flights.

### "luggage was not loaded"
I was very disappointed to learn that my checked In luggage was not loaded onto my 15:45 PG961 flight out of Koh Samui. After arriving in Dubai I lodged a Baggage claim with Emirates, my 2nd leg of flight. I was able to track my bag using my airbag and it sat at Koh Samui Airport for approximately 24 hours from when I checked it in (approx 1pm) to getting an email about failing security check and asking for my combination so they could inspect it for a suspected lighter (There is no lighter in the bag). I don't understand why I couldn't have been contacted while I sat at Samui airport for around 5 hours after checking my luggage in rather than me chasing them after I arrived in Dubai with no luggage. They eventually contacted me via WhatApp asking for combination and explaining why it was not loaded onto the plane. A very bad experience overall. I am advised that I will now get my checked in luggage in the next 24 hours. So two days to get a bag from Koh Samui to Dubai.

### "The most wonderful airline"
Not Verified |   The most wonderful airline. It’s the best food i have ever had on a short haul flight. I wish they flew to Australia. Service was friendly and as someone who is 191cm tall legroom was ample.

### "serve a warm meal with drinks and coffee"
Quite amazing that Bangkok Airways manages to serve a warm meal with drinks and coffee on a 45-minutes full flight free of charge. Even though the food wasn’t very special but still edible it impressed me.

### “good value for money”
Not Verified | Always great and good value for money. No issues with delayed flights and a smooth journey overall. Friendly staff and onboard service, even on super short flights eg Bangkok to Trat. At Trat airport they also have complimentary snacks and drinks.

### "delayed over 1 hour"
Bangkok Airways was delayed over 1 hour on flight PG305. Due to the delay I missed my ferry. Bangkok Airways refuses any compensation.

### "best of the small airlines in SE Asia"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok 1st April 2024. Aircraft A319. Easy booking, generous service from luggage to catering onboard. Preordered a special hot meal (free!) accommodated; additional meals provided upon inquiry. Ticket very reasonable, 47 USD. Free lounge access (dry, but an enormous effort to operate and it is well kept with snacks and soft drinks, checked luggage (+/- 20 kg), and got seat upgrade from the very back to the very front – without requesting, but they offered me firmly. Got a whole row 2 for myself despite the flight was basically full. Staff onboard were top-notch, polite and observant. A second hot meal was delivered on my tray table within 20 seconds (yes!). They chose a wonderful alternative to the first dish. Pleasure to be onboard with them. Got even flying mileage inserted to my Qatar Airways Privilege Club for the flight. Many advantages by this airline. Lot of staff on ground and in air, all very effective and helpful. What they generously delivered within an hours’ flight is unbelievable. Worth every penny. And, this was only a domestic flight. If they cross a border, they provide free flow of alcoholic drinks (wine and beer). We miss them back to Vietnam, but they were knocked out by Corona and LCCs. Only three drawbacks are: 1. superfluous and useless online check-in; 2. No luggage transfers thru BKK (just as discount airlines) due to no real partners, interline agreements, alliances. 3. Bus driving from aircraft to Terminal very annoying and disturbs all the good points earned in the air. Recommend them strongly, likely the best of the small airlines in SE Asia.

### “use if you have no other options”
Absolutely disgusted by this airline. Discriminated due to appearance and embarrassed by airline staff. I checked in online and was placed in the emergency exit row without the ability/option to change seats (that was ok due to my preference for the seat originally). Upon arrival to check in bags, I was again informed that I was sitting in the exit row and verified that I understood and met the requirements. When boarding the plane, again, verified my seat and requirements. When I was about to step on the plane, a Bangkok air employee pulled me out of the line (in the tunnel) and demanded my boarding pass. With no explanation, they told me I had to change seats. My friend and I had booked seats together to which they took her boarding bass and scribbled out both our original seat numbers and given new seats at the very back of the plane. This was very embarrassing and with no explanation, we were now the last to board and unfortunately and to no fault of our own, held up the boarding process. We asked repeatedly why we were moved and given no reason. As we were about to land, finally we pulled an attendant and requested an explanation. We we told that I didn’t look like I could perform the requirements to sit in my original seat. I then proceeded to show that I was more than capable, to which the staff agreed. They then merely said if we were not happy to just, “email customer service if you aren’t happy.” Never acknowledged the inconvenience. Interesting that when this airline makes mistakes, the customer is placed in the least desirable seats on the plane. You would think they would attempt to improve your experience rather than make it even worse. Only use this airline if you have no other options.

### "5 hours delay gave us 6 euro coupon"
Our flight was at 17.10 and every hour status change! We finally fly at 21.50, and the worst was that until 20.30 still waiting inside the waiting room cause from check in nobody inform us! For 5 hours delay they gave us 6 euro coupon.

### “I was really disappointed”
Long time ago I flew Bangkok Airways but I have always thought it was a nice airline. But this time I was really disappointed. The check in process in Krabi was insanely slow and pax were allowed to use the Bag drop for normal check in. The seat pitch was terrible, the food was almost inedible but my biggest concern was the safety aspects. A large Indian family was sitting around us and they didn’t apply to normal safety rules for departure and landing and the very young crew didn’t seem to care. I think I will choose another airline in the future. The only good thing was on time departure and arrival.

### "I can’t recommend them enough"
I love this airline. Superb, I can’t recommend them enough. Also on time and the staff are impeccable. Very friendly and extremely professional. Took off on time and landed 10mins early. 1 hour flight.

### "very impressed with their services"
Deserves its title as the World's Best Regional Airline by Skytrax. I was very impressed with their services on their short haul flights between Phuket and Koh Samui which went by so quick. The plane was spotless and cleanliness was good enough for a short flight. The A7R 72-600 was brand new, meals were decent options for a short haul flight. I strongly recommend this airline for your regional travels in Asia and Thailand!

### "I was extremely happy"
Not Verified |  Bangkok Airways were very good. I was extremely happy especially having a meal provided. Aircraft was spacious and staff were extremely friendly The flight was on time and the fair was a good price.

### "check in was seamless"
The check in was seamless and can not recommend it enough. It was the self check in. I was checked in online and you got and get your ticket, baggage label and take it to the belt. Again it’s also self service and was done in less than 5 mins, superb. Had a two hour delay which was annoy as I lost a lot of time due to this. Food was ok for a 1hour flight. Overall good service.

### "a perfect flight"
This was a perfect flight. It was my girlfriends first time flying on an ATR she wasn’t too keen but as a keen flyer I found it superb. The check in was very quick. Transportation to the plane also very quick and efficient. Meal was ok during the flight. Baggage also came out very fast.

### "it was a great flight"
I flew on an extremely early morning flight with this airline and I was in for a pleasant surprise. Albeit the short distance and flight time, the flight attendants provided courteous service and there was even a breakfast meal. It was quite nice. I think the meal consisted of a sausage, eggs and some vegetables. Check-in and baggage drop was done via a self kiosk and it was seamless. At arrival, my checked bags was dispensed in no time. Everything from start to finish was effortless and it was a great flight.

### "Not the greatest treatment of passengers"
Frist, they changed the schedule for the tickets without offering a refund. And then a few weeks later, they cancelled the ticket. I had to login to the website to process a refund. Now I wait up to 30 business days for the funds back. Not the greatest treatment of passengers.

### "the crew was friendly"
The flight was on time, cabin was clean and the crew was friendly, flight crew announcements were clear and understandable. We ordered a kosher meal, and got water, banana and apple but crew kindly replaced it for a regular meal. I wanted to purchase some souvenirs onboard, initially cabin crew said she will come back to me, but finally said they didn’t had any. Strange, if you don’t have any, why do you offer it in a separate public announcement at the beginning of the flight.

### "I have been avoiding them"
The Covid years were rough on Thailand airlines and Bangkok Airways are no exception. Although our flights to Siem Reap via Bangkok from Chiang Mai operated on time, the exterior condition of the A319 on the first flight was deplorable. The second flight was on a ATR 72, Bangkok Airways still flying these relics. Being an ATR it meant a bus gate at BKK. I hadn’t flown Bangkok Airways in years and I was painfully reminded why I have been avoiding them on this trip.

### "Brilliant flight"
Not Verified |  Brilliant flight. Really comfortable seat for a short hop. Service faultless and ground services excellent including a fantastic Business Class lounge at Bangkok airport

### "true feelgood experience"
Flying with Bangkok Airways is a true "feelgood" experience - from the moment you arrive at the airport till you pick up the luggage. Everything is efficient, friendly, clean and, very important, with smiles. Check-in and security took less than 5 mins. The airport is a small one, nearly open air, that I believe is owned by Bangkok Airways. Clean and friendly with small snacks served. Complimentary. Transport to the plane with small, open, electric trams. Small but attractive planes and even a small meal served during the short trip. Everything on schedule. Luggage delivery at Bkk smooth as well. A special experience.

### "very proficient and competent staff"
Great little airline and very proficient and competent staff. On time service and accurate baggage handling. Aircraft in good condition, limited amenities.

### "A very poor experience"
We had flown on Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Krabi a fortnight before and everything was fine. In fact we were impressed by the experience. Good inflight service, tasty breakfast and on time arrival. Couldn't ask for more. Unfortunately our return journey was very different. Check in was easy and we boarded and were pushed back ahead of time. Great. Then the aircraft stopped and was boarded by a ground staff. Captain announced we were returning to the bay. No explanation, nothing. Deplaned. Meal vouchers handed out that had no ability to use at any of the vendors close by. No explanation given as to expected delay. Through questioning ground staff we found out that a technician was to be flown from Bangkok. Again, no announcement. Approx 3 hours passed and I noticed that the lounge had emptied. Questioning ground staff I found out that we were boarding, there had been no announcement on the PA system or listing on the departure gates. Prepared to forgive so long as we get there albeit 3.5 hours late. Push back. Taxi. Stop. Captain announces return to gate. Deplane. Again no announcement as to what was happening. Crowd attempts to find out from ground staff. Possibility of replacement plane coming from Bangkok so we could depart by 6.30pm. Still no announcement. Aircraft arrives and queue forms - no boarding announcement. Slow progress boarding - we find out that we will be handed a document to sign to get 1400 Baht compensation. No opportunity to read. You can sign and then board. I refused to sign. Boarded and arrived 8 hours after the scheduled time. To cap it off there was no meal / snack on the flight. A very poor experience.

### "check in now by kiosk"
Bangkok Airways no longer has staff to help check in at Bangkok airport for domestic flights. All check in now by kiosk which don’t work well. No options for changing flights.

### "excellent value for money"
I would say that this flight felt very much like their pre-pandemic experience. Starting with check in, me and my dad both have Premier Plus status so we checked in at the business class counter very swiftly and with little fuss, we showed them our vaccination records which were no issue. All our checked bags were tagged with the priority tag. There was a considerable queue for check in - there were plenty of flights in the morning. Since Bangkok Airways provides lounge access for all their passengers, we headed there first, but being premier plus members we were able to access the business class section. We had a corner to ourselves with a very comfortable couch. The rest of the lounge can be described as a bit dark, but with a cosy atmosphere with pastries, Thai snacks, crudités and a few hot meal options made-to-order. Everything you can expect from a business class lounge. Boarding was handled quite well, and they used new boarding pass-scanning machines. This flight was near capacity, 142 seats out of 144 available on the A319. We were a family of four so we had seats 1CDE and F. There was somebody seated in 1A and the only empty seats were 1B and a middle seat in the last row. On the return the load was much lighter and I had the whole row 2 to myself, with the rest of the family in 1DEF. The first flight was operated by a slightly older plane, had a slightly tired interior but the seats were well padded, and the interior was clean. The second flight was operated by an ex-Royal Jordanian aircraft. The only indication that it used to be operated by RJ was that the door handles were in Arabic, otherwise it has been fully refurbished. The legroom was average, not unacceptable but not spectacular. This plane was relatively new and was spotless when we boarded. The service was the highlight of the flight. A hot meal was offered with a bowl of fruit. On the outbound the meal was a baked fish in white sauce with baked potatoes which was pretty good, on the return it was a very tasty chicken lasagna. The quantity of the meals is a bit small - understandable since they expect that passengers would eat in the lounge. There was a drinks cart that consisted of red and white wine, beer, soft drinks and coffee/tea. The wines were of particularly great quality. Service was quick and all the flight attendants were very polite and professional. Our bags being tagged priority meant that once we were through immigration, all our bags were waiting for us and we headed straight out. On the return leg check in was painless and the third party lounge in Da Nang airport was spectacular - different creative seating options, lots of delicious hot and cold food options, and a nice, airy feel. Overall, it’s easy to see why they have won the awards year after year. This flight in particular shows that they are willing to give passengers a great experience as if it was 2019 again. Finally, because we booked this trip a month early, we paid a similar price for the flight as a low cost competitor (flight only, no extras), so this was excellent value for money.

### "a very good product for the price"
As others have noted, the airline is very good when it comes to being on time, which is a rarity in Thai society and life in general in the kingdom. Both cabin and ground staff conducted themselves professionally, unlike several other short-haul carriers, and it’s easy to see why Bangkok Airways stands out among them in a positive light. Somehow the aircraft was configured in a single-class configuration so everyone rode in coach. Legroom seemed to have diminished from the last time I flew with them 5 years back, so that was one sore point. Still, a very good product for the price which is just a few pennies more than what other airlines are charging.

### "truly get a feeling of luxury onboard"
Da Nang – Bangkok 11 Sept. on an A319. Flight on time. No luggage problem, had paid a hefty 40 $ tag for extra 5 kilos as I know they can be strict. Rigid luggage allowance of 20 kg. If additional kgs are purchase beforehand it is 80 USD/20 kg, which is almost the value of an additional ticket. Wonder the price if purchased at check-in? Must be a fortune despite the flown is of short duration, an only 90 min. flight, Check-in online is impossible and depraving a lot of time for nothing as it is impossible for any international flight. Why is this no announced instead of wasting peoples time with dozens of information boxes to be filled on approximately 15 screen windows? Shame on the airline, this misleading scam has going on for at least 10 years. FFP useless. Partnership with Qatar Airways (my connecting flight) did not even allow for luggage transfer in Bangkok. Very annoying, meaning wasting 2 hours passing immigration, check-in with QR and back to airside through immigration and security. Very disappointing, exhausting, tedious, and inconvenient like on a LCC like their competitor on this route: VietjetAir. Lounge access not granted and all frills from me being QR gold FFP were ignored (lounge, luggage, etc.). So, the partnership is a joke, cant even work with luggage. Onboard, I immediately felt the good atmosphere. FAs were in a splendid mood, well rested and service minded throughout. Special Sea Food meal ordered delivered to perfection (red snapper). Ordinary hot meals were also good, given out as courtesy to those wanting. I tried a chicken pasta which was truly delicious. Plenty of food onboard, despite small portions. Plenty of drinks offered frequently with a good flow and usually given more than one unit of each. Wines were unusually good quality and I managed to get quite tipsy, which was appreciated. Coffee and tea undrinkable and subpar. Cheap fares, truly get a feeling of luxury onboard. Paid 114 USD for a 1-way ticket was a find!

### "Asia's favourite boutique airline"
They deserve to be called Asia's favourite boutique airline. Everything about flying Bangkok Airways was a pleasure. From efficient check-in to friendly staff on the ground and in the air. But, most importantly the comfort of the business class seats. They are from an era in aviation when comfort was king. Okay, so there was no in-seat entertainment screen - but who still needs those anyway?

### "luggage nowhere to be found on arrival in Phnon Penh"
All of my and my daughter's checked in luggage (3 pieces) are missing. We traveled from Brussels to Phnom Penh 24 June. Our Turkish Airlines flights to Bangkok were delayed, and we arrived in BKK at 4:12 pm and boarding for the codeshare flight via Bangkok Airways was at 4:30 pm 25 June. We made it to our flight by running and asking favours from fellow passengers to let us go first in the queue in disembarking and in the security check. However, our luggage were nowhere to be found upon our arrival in Phnon Penh 25 June around 6:35pm. I wrote to Turkish Airlines and they said this was the responsibility of Bangkok Airways. I emailed Bangkok Airways and they said they never received our luggage. Afternoon of 26 June, I received an email from the Bangkok Airways tracing team that they have located our luggage in Bangkok and that they will send it via the flight that will arrive in Phnom Penh at around 6:35 pm and that the Bangkok Airways Representative in Phnom Penh will get in touch with me. Anxiously awaiting, I tracked the flight and noted that it landed in Phnom Penh 6:32 pm. I have not heard from the representative at all. I wrote another inquiry to the tracing team at 8:30 pm and they said they have forwarded my email to their Phnom Penh Team. It is now 27 June, 9:09 am and I haven't heard from them yet. Neither have I been advised regarding what to do, in terms of securing clothing and toiletries, in the interim that our luggage have not yet been brought back to us.

### "Always on time, crew are always perfect"
I do like flying internally with Bangkok Airways. You pay just a small amount more, but get a more better product and service. Always on time, crew are always perfect. The on board snack was given as you left the aircraft, which was great to get a bottle of water in the red hot heat of Krabi.

### "What was their standard and procedure?"
The flight to Bangkok was delayed around 2 hours. Then there was a new flight to Bangkok, but the ground staff rejected us to move to the new flight while other customers could get in. This was unfair. Even though we informed them that we had an important meeting and got affected from the flight delay, they insisted not to let us in. What was their standard and procedure?

### "want to thank Bangkok Airways for their time"
Not Verified |  I just want to thank Bangkok Airways for their time and accommodations with my flight (which was booked by agent without understanding of the specific requirements for the flights in Thailand during the pandemic) especially the manager on arrival who helped me a lot to change my flight (unfortunately I didn’t ask his name). I didn’t get the same service from Aeroflot and particularly from Finnair. The manager went toward me and helped me to change my flight for the right one, if all airlines will be working like that it will be easier to fly, specially at present time during pandemic (which already makes tourism very difficult for passengers). Besides that, everything in airport was very good organized and done for the people on arrival not like in Europe.

### "the stewardess had acted properly"
I checked the price of flights from Bangkok to Koh Samui - crazy expensive, but as I got a deal on my accommodation I decided to proceed. I signed up for the frequent flier program, but after that I was unable to see the price in Thai Baht, all it would show me was US$ and much more expensive than the Baht price. I pressed on only to find that a bunch of extra costs had been added, not just the usual fees. I checked to the final figure in $US and clicked pay. My Thai bank was not charged in US$ but but Thai Baht at a ridiculous exchange rate. The aircraft from Bangkok to Koh Samui is a a propeller aircraft definitely the worst I have ever travelled in. A very uncomfortable flight. Landing in Koh Samui there was an announcement in Thai and one in English saying the usual "please remain seated with seatbelt fastened until the seatbelt sign is switched off" When the seatbelt sign was switched off I stood to get my bag from the overhead locker. That is when a stewardess screamed at me from the back of the plane to sit down. The plane was very small and everyone stared at me. I pointed at the seatbelt sign above me and she shouted wait to be called to leave. I made a formal complaint to Bangkok Airways about how I had been treated. I eventually received a reply saying that the case had been investigated and that the stewardess had acted properly.

### "friendly yet hard-working people"
Not Verified |  I was booked on a flight from Trat to Bangkok during October 2020. A tropical storm was passing through Trat and meant that there was severe rain and low visibility throughout the day. Unsurprisingly, the captain of the inbound from Bangkok decided to go around and after holding for a bit flew back to Bangkok. Initially I did not ask the ground crew for any information as I was tracking the flight and storm online. They initially announced the delay as "we will inform you the new time later" and it became obvious after a while that the delay would be quite a while. They seemed to have multiple contingencies in place even with the COVID situation, and another plane with another set of crew was sent to Trat, as the previous crew and aircraft exceeded their legal allowed flying time. During the wait, the ground staff were on hand to help passengers and in general handled the situation like it was an everyday thing to them. It really helped the passengers feel relaxed and not stressed. They even offered to try to rebook passengers who were connecting on other airlines, which is clearly going above and beyond their responsibilities. I had a guide to what delayed passengers were entitled to, and a 2 hour plus delay meant a meal would be provided. They did get us a hot lunch box delivered as there isn't a restaurant on site. In the end, the weather cleared up, and the replacement aircraft landed and the ground crews worked to turn around the aircraft and literally as the last passenger boarded the doors closed and we were off, pushing back 3 hours and 10 minutes later than our scheduled departure time. Service onboard was done as a snack box, which contained packet nuts, a savoury chicken pastry and a bottle of water. It wasn't too much to write home about but it sets Bangkok Airways apart from their low-cost competition. The crew were very hard-working although I think they seemed a bit robotic today, but in general Bangkok Airways crew and staff are very casual and friendly yet hard-working people. Baggage arrived very quickly in Suvarnabhumi airport, which seems to become more consistent as they have upgraded their systems. I think that the way an airline is appropriately judged is how they handle a crisis, and in this case they put the safety of passengers first and foremost, yet still handled the situation extremely well. I think this is a textbook example of how to handle a flight delay and I applaud Bangkok Airways for making our day as stress-free as it could've possibly been. If only other airlines handled delays this well.

### "Friendly staff, good service"
Bangkok to Yangon. Be on time! They fly on schedule, clocklike! Good app for online check-in. Prompt and speed baggage drop. Very clean airplane. Friendly staff, good service. Hot meal on this one hour flight.

### "a true dedicated employee"
Not Verified |  I especially want to thank Khun Guy at Krabi Airport Ticketing Office for her perseverance and commitment as a ground handling Staff with Bangkok Airways where she gave me extreme assistance. She's a true dedicated employee. I was booked from Krabi to Bkk & connecting SQ979 to S'pore on April 5th, I realized on the day before my departure, Bangkok Airways was grounded and not taking off to Bkk and I went directly to KBV Airport on April 5th early morning hoping to book a ThaiSmile flight to BKK which was departing at 4pm that same April 5th. Somehow, with sheer luck I managed to get a seat with the kind help of Guy knowing that ThaiSmile was also fully booked and that I'm on their 1st priority list. At the same time,  Guy also made sure that I'm checked in with ThaiSmile as I need to be in Bangkok to connect my SQ flight back home to S'pore. Simultaneously she also made arrangements for Bangkok Airways Staff at Suvarnabhumi Airport to assist me for check-in with SIA knowing that it was a time-factor that I needed to check-in ASAP as my SQ Departure time was 6.30pm & ThaiSmile arrival Bkk at 5.30pm as I had to clear Customs & Immigration that will consume some time. Overall I made it for my SQ-979 check-in on time with the help of Bangkok Airways Staff at Suvarnabhumi Airport.

### "Excellent  experience on Bangkok Airways"
Excellent first experience flying within Thailand on Bangkok Airways, Krabi to Bangkok. The flight left on time from Krabi, the legroom was extremely generous, comfortable seat, the food was some of the best I've had (I have flown business several times and it beat most of these!) and the staff were efficient and friendly. Would recommend and book again in future for definite.

### "very pleased and impressed"
Bangkok to Krabi. I had to cancel my flight because of the Coronavirus. The airline was very difficult to get in touch with by phone, so I tried the PG Live Chat. It took 2 days to be able to speak to someone, so I was imagining by the time I did speak to someone the quality of the service would be low and I would have to argue my way to a refund. But, the service was quick and accommodating. The representative spoke perfect English. She asked why I was getting in touch, asked for my flight information, and confirmed that she had cancelled my flight for a full refund, just moments later. She also found in my record that I had purchased travel insurance along with the tickets, and told me hold I could get that refunded too. Now, the refund will take 30 days because of the high volume of refund requests, so we'll see if I do in fact get my refund. But in terms of quality of customer service, I'm very pleased and impressed.

### "they are changing flight"
Not Verified |  I've booked tickets to my wife and myself from Myanmar to Bangkok - decided to pay more (compare to low-cost airlines that operate the same route) for better service and to avoid any hassle. As dates are public holidays, I booked tickets in advance to ensure normal prices. Month later Bangkok airways sending me a mail saying that they are changing flight to have it 6 hours earlier. So it's destroying my travel plan and putting overall travel schedule under risk. After I got notification about flight change I've sent back request for refund. After 1 week of silence and several mails from my side I've called to their call center and requested refund. They confirmed that they got it and will send me a confirmation letter. 3 days after - still silence but they refunded.

### "wait at the airport for 4 hours"
Mandalay to Chiang Mai. I am now at Mandalay airport, waiting for my flight which is supposed to take off at 18.00 local time. The fact is that I could only learn about my flight delay when I arrive at the airport. Now I will have to wait at the airport for 4 hours instead of two. Plus, I can find no one to talk to about this issue because the counters will be open according to the new time of the flight. I wonder how I will be compensated now. It would be nice at least to have a meal ticket to use at the airport. My flight from Chiang Mai was also delayed but then I was sent an email.

### "nick name instead of passport name"
Phu Quoc to Bangkok. I had the nick name (Last name and initial were right) of my wife instead of her passport name on the ticket, and but they forced me to buy a new ticket for a much higher price before checking in. Besides this they lost my bookings from May 2019 since their whole system was migrated in June. It took us some Long calls to get this fixed too!

### "best in class airline"
Krabi to Bangkok. The best in class airline. As it was a 1 hour flight, we were provided with a proper meal. The leg space in economy seats was quite good. The crew was very pleasant and quick in providing a full service carrier experience in short duration of time.

### "one of the best regional airlines"
Not Verified |  Phuket to Bangkok. This airline is one of the best regional airlines I have ever traveled on. The flights were on time, the crew is very friendly, you get a warm meal that tastes good, lounge access with food, drinks and wifi free of charge. I have just been blown away by how much better they are than any of the US based airlines that I typically fly on that I felt I have to share this experience. Kuddos to the staff in this airline. I hope more airlines would take note and copy them!

### "always lots of helpful staff"
Koh samui to Bangkok. I have flown three times with Bangkok Airways, always lots of helpful staff and every time they serve a good meal with real cutlery. The last time I flew with Bangkok Airways we missed the flight due to traffic but the operators bent over backwards to get on the next flight. I love Bangkok Airways.

### "will highly recommend them"
Not Verified |  I flew from Phuket to Bangkok with Bangkok airways. Then I had to change to a different airline to fly from Bangkok to Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai. But I made a mistake booking my connecting flight too tight leaving myself only 1 hour 40 min. I was almost sure I was not going to make it.. Imagine, the plane was scheduled to land in Bangkok at 10.10, and then I would have to collect my luggage, check in for the next flight with Cathay pacific departing at 11.50 and go through immigration. The lovely girl at the Bangkok airways check-in counter asked me what time my next flight was, and seeing the timing was too tight, she managed to check my luggage in all the way to Shanghai! She saved me so much trouble! So I did the immigration procedure in Phuket and made it just on time for my flight from Bangkok. Highly praise the excellent service, efficiency and genuine care for the customers. I will fly with Bangkok airways as frequently as possible and will highly recommend them to all my friends!

### "only option is Economy Class"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Mandalay. Bangkok Airways is good, but not a lot. It's not good to get in a plane where the only option is Economy Class and you have to use a bus with almost 100 people on it. The food is good.

### "rebook my original flights"
Ko Samui to Bangkok. The plane was old and in need of refurbishment. My seat recline etc did not work. There was plenty of leg room. Staff were pleasant. However booking process was a mess. I had a confirmed flight then Bangkok Airways changed the plane it was going to use to one with no business class seats. They did not directly notify me of this them tried to blame my travel agents for changing my class from business to economy. I tried to rebook through my travel agency and even they had difficulties getting another confirmed flight. Then Bangkok Airways reinstated the original Plane with business class seating and my travel agents had to rebook my original flights with no help at all from Bangkok airways. I was not able to select my seat which had been given to someone else now. The flight was okay but the reservation service needs to improve. I would not recommend them.

### "What a fantastic airline"
Bangkok to Luang Prabang. What a fantastic airline. Right from start to finish. The self check in machines speeded up boarding ten fold, would highly recommend doing using them. Boarding was quick and very efficient. Push back and take off was on time. The seats were very comfy and plenty of leg room. They served a meal with desert and water. Then to top it off they came back round the with a drinks offer which included alcohol, as we had a beer. I can’t recommend this airline enough they were absolutely superb.

### "a lovely service on a very short flight"
Koh Samui to Bangkok. Pleasantly surprised with Bangkok Airways. Such a lovely service on a very short flight. No sooner had we taken off we were brought a lovely Thai meal, and no sooner had we finished eating the staff cleared everything so promptly and then we were starting to descend for landing. The staff were so lovely and the flight was just perfect. Would highly recommend Bangkok Airways.

### "a very good experience"
Siem Reap to Bangkok. The check-In was very fast and the staff very friendly. Bangkok Airways also has its own Lounge for customers with small bites as well as drinks and Internet access, also at Siem Reap airport. The departure / arrival were punctual and the aircraft wanted a good, maintained impression. Also on this short flight they gave food and drinks. Overall a very good experience.

### "Fully recommended!"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Perfect flight. Boarding and take off on time. Comfortable seats. Very kind flight attendant service. Food & beverages were very good. Smooth landing on time. Fully recommended!

### "Once again a great flight"
Vientiane to Bangkok. Once again a great flight. Left on time and smooth all the way. Food was good quality but not to my taste. Only issue is they have premium, priority and privilege customers which does lead to confusion.

### "friendly all the way"
Bangkok to Vientiane. Great staff friendly all the way and easy website to use. Nice food, leg room a bit short for someone's height of 182cm. Will be sure to use again.

### "comfortable for a short flight"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Flight departed on time. Every thing was in order and comfortable for a short flight like 1 hours 15 minutes. The snacks which was served were high standards.

### "the flight was comfortable"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Departure was on time from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. It was a short flight (1 hour 15 minutes) though they provided us with some quality snacks & beverage. Even though they claim them self that Asia's boutique airline, my seat was not that clean. Overall the flight was comfortable.

### "efficient, friendly and professional"
Travelling with Bangkok Airways for an hour's flight from Yangon to Bangkok seemed to be a short time for the crew to prepare the plane for their passengers. But consistently, they have managed to keep the plane clean, fresh-smelling and for such a short flight, they served a hot meal which is good enough to keep one satiated until the plane arrives in Suvarnabhumi Airport. The FAs are efficient, friendly and professional. Just a slight comment on food served both on outbound and inbound flights. As I have an allergy to seafood, I was surprised that I was served shrimp with noodles then on the way back, shrimp with rice. I would have appreciated if they had served chicken instead (which is a safer option in case certain passengers have dietary restrictions). I know I had the choice to refuse the meal being served but I was hungry (as I came straight from the office to make my 3pm flight). Ground staff both in Yangon and Bangkok are all pleasant, helpful and smiled as they carried on with their work. The way they treated their passengers before boarding somehow translated to how they all behaved (orderly fashion) during the boarding process. All in all, another good service from Bangkok Airways, both on the ground on in flight.

### "The cabin crew were nice"
I'm a regular flyer on Phnom Penh - Bangkok route and it's delayed too often! The plane was ok. The cabin crew were nice. No choices for the food and most of the time it's not so great. Pleasant ground staff. No personal TV.

### "They cancelled my flight"
Chiang Mai to Hanoi. They have cancelled my flight for February 2020 that was critical to my itinerary by email.Just cancelled it. No explanation. You wait ages for a refund and have to do all the running around to get it. Will not use again.

### "flight was delayed by 2 hours"
Singapore to Ko Samui. Staff service and quality of food have never been an issue for me so this review doesn't reflect those. My main grumble is the fact that the  flight was delayed by 2 hours. So this experience Bangkok Air is a negative one. Weather is not an issue according to the forecast so what excuse will you give us this time. As a resident of Samui, I expect better.Time to reflect on what you are charging and providing for the ticket price.

### "I wasn't disappointed"
BKK-HKT-BKK. Booked my ticket because price was cheap and Bangkok Air has a good reputation. I wasn't disappointed. When I arrived early at Bangkok airport, the friendly check-in staff offered me to take an earlier flight. I happily agreed and arrived at my final destination Phuket 1.5 hours earlier than expected but missed the opportunity to use the Bangkok Airways lounge in BKK. Yes, they offer every passenger to enter their lounge for free! On board service was also very good on this one hour flight: a hot meal (chicken with rice) was offered together with drinks (water, juice, coffee / tea) and some songkran candy. FAs were super friendly and flights were on time or even ahead of schedule. Only the cabin outfit was a bit dated and seemed to be rather old. Same good experience on the return flight to Bangkok. Economy lounge at Phuket was okay, they offered free drinks (water / coffee / juice) and some snacks. I would definitly choose Bangkok Air again!

### "cant see how economy class can get any better"
Travelled BKK to DAD 15th June 2019 on an A320. On time as usual. Changed initial ticket and preponed departure due to earlier international arrival. This proved to be easy without any hassle apart from some emails and a modest addition of 50 USD. If I change online the cost is horrendous. However, their helpdesk is fairly smooth and I could leave on an earlier flight for 49 USD which was OK. Got my BP in transit in BKK without any hassle. Free access to their (dry) lounge. Service on board is top notch for economy. Special meal provided, it was very delicious. Steel cutlery and wet towel. 2 drink rounds. Neat plane, fresh FA staff. I cant see how economy class can get any better apart from tedious bus-gating in Bangkok

### "There is nothing not to like"
Bangkok to Koh Samui. Easy Check-In, The Bangkok Lounge (available to everyone) was crowded but still comfortable and the food and refreshments options plus WiFi are a bonus. Boarded on time via a bus, but was organized and efficient. Plane left bang on time and flight was 50 mins, in this time 4 crew still managed to serve a small hot lunch with hot beverages. Aircraft was clean comfortable but quite old. There is nothing not to like about Bangkok Airways, arriving in Koh Samui bags were out in 5 mins.

### "No faults whatsoever"
Flew Danang to Bangkok 15/5-2019 on an A320. Excellent trip. Early check-in, peaceful airport, they call you and want to carry you onboard fro your airport hidings even 50 Minutes prier to kick. No faults whatsoever. Cheap as hell (202 usd return, inc. full service and luggage). Why struggle with LCCs which costs almost the same and always conflicts on luggage? Must admit the price of PG has gone down 30-50% after Vietjetair opened the same route for basically half the price. Good luck for them – I have had enough and costs always end up high anyway. Whenever I fly economy in this region I find that Bangkok Airways, when available on the route, are the obvious choice. Well, except for maybe Myanmar, Japan, Hanoi, where they tend to be expensive due to lack of competitors.

### "Staff very attentive"
Bangkok to Koh Samui. They call themselves a Boutique Airline and they certainly are. Staff very attentive, flight was on time. On a 50 mins flight they managed to serve a delicious Phad Tai followed by Coffee. Like the good old days, Bangkok Air treated us like appreciated customers.

### "great airline to fly with"
Not Verified |  Phnom Penh to Yangon via Bangkok. The check-in was easy with friendly staff. The cabin crew was very friendly and efficient. Passengers were offered proper warm meals during the both (short) segments of the journey. The aircraft cabins were well maintained. A great airline to fly with.

### "okay on medium haul"
Bangkok to Male in august 2018. As a regular user and premier member for Bangkok Air, I was curious to see try their business class. I had accumulated an excessive amount of miles which I used for this flight. They charged about $200 in tax, which is reasonable, some airlines charge more or less tax for award tickets like these. The flight was 3/4 full on the way to the Maldives, and completely empty on the way back. At check in, it was a strange feeling when I walked up to the usual business class counter to check in for my first international flight with them. The premier lounge was quite empty when we were there first, and then gradually filled up to capacity. There is hot food table service, but recently this has been discontinued. There is only self serve but there are still made-to-order items available. Instead of doing a boarding announcement, a gate agent walked around the boarding area with a sign up saying “business class/Premier members” which is actually a much better idea than making an announcement. I was first onboard, and was asked what I would like to drink. I settled with orange juice. For a half past nine departure, lunch was served, and the quality and quantity was more than adequate. They understand that you will definitely eat in the lounge, and not feel that hungry once on board. I felt that the clear plastic bowl of salad (with “royal project” branding, they’re a subsidised group of high-quality farmers) was a bit odd, but then the salad definitely felt fresh. The hot meal was also good, and there were 3 choices. We were also served macadamia nuts in a bowl before meal service. I asked if there was any snack before landing, and they only had more nuts. Drinks were plenty and me and my dad didn’t realise we finished an entire bottle of champagne as they just kept refilling! The seat is more than comfortable, like a big lazy-boy. The crew seemed odd. The usual interactive ness and down-to-earth feeling wasn’t there, it felt as if asking for something in the galley (something I’d always do) was met with a weird look. The flight attendant asked me to press the call button, but I personally like going to the galley and asking for something, as it’s better for both. Entertainment is provided in the form of an iPad, and is adequate for the flight duration. Arrival in Maldives, I wish I could say that our bags were first off the belt, but no. It was quick, though. The return journey, felt literally like a private jet. We walked straight up to the counter, and we were given fast track immigration. Turns out, the regular line had no queue at all, so we just went to the regular line! Boarding was called for 40 minutes before departure, and we were still in the lounge when not 5 minutes later “final call for flight PG712 to Bangkok.” So we ran down to the gate. There was No line. Turns out, the load factor on this flight was 21 in total. Including economy passengers, that’s a 4:1 ratio of passengers to cabin crew. Leaving 30 minutes early, then arriving 45 minutes early. When we got to the gate (which was a domestic gate, the flight continues on to Samui) the crew shut the curtain between economy and made sure it stayed shut, and we were whisked off to a private minivan. The minivan took a shortcut to international arrivals, and we were literally out without any other passengers in sight, with our baggage in tow. That is the best Bangkok to Male in August 2018.arrival experience ever. Overall, I am used to flying Bangkok air on short routes, and they perform okay on medium haul.

### "staff is really nice"
Great attention to detail, the staff is really nice and the service is very comfortable, bigger leg room in comparison of other similar airlines like Thai Lion and the catering service was really good for a regional airline, although there were not many choices but a hot meal on a relatively short flight with tea and coffee is an attention that makes it a very pleasant experience

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Not Verified |  Krabi to Bangkok. Excellent service in the full extent of the word, from the help via email, the counters and the attention of all its employees is excellent, in addition to the services both on board and in its facilities in the pre-boarding area, very good service , Congratulations. ES: Excelente servicio en toda la extensión de la palabra, desde la ayuda vía correo electrónico, los mostradores y la atención de todos sus empleados es excelente, además de los servicios tanto a bordo como en sus instalaciones en el salís de pre abordaje, muy buen servicio, felicidades.

### "the service is great"
Flying to Bangkok to Phuket. Older Airbus aircraft that was clean. Staff was friendly and there was a lot of legroom. I am 190cm tall and had no problems whatsoever. Flight was on time. Snack was a cookie with coffee. I recommend Bangkok airways as the service is great for decent prices.

### "seated with a good legroom"
Bangkok to Ko Samui. Chose my seat during my booking session, which was quite expensive to be honest for an economy flight of just over a hour. Online check-in performed, but took a while for my luggage to be dropped off due to a long line for all counters. Security was another extra 30 minutes. Seating at gates was insufficient and boarding by bus about 30 minutes late. Eventually seated with a good legroom. Departed quickly and free hot meal on this flight. No alcohol served. Edible, but not spectacular. Landing on time and luggage took a while to appear after we were dropped by cute buses.

### "definitely a boutique airline"
Bangkok Airways is charging very steep prices for a route they have a monopoly on and takes only about an hour and 15 minutes to complete in an older ATR 72-500 in which you definitely can notice the age. Airport is quite a distance from Mandalay and you are required to enter through security prior to check-in. Check-in was slow, but were welcomed by a friendly agent who invited us to use their lounge. Bangkok Airways is definitely a boutique airline that offers complimentary drinks/snacks at certain airports for their economy passengers too. Lounge was ok with a limited snack offer (hot food and alcohol you would be charged for). Boarding was slightly late and went by stairs to ground. Welcomed by two lovely cabin crew and took only 15 minutes to get airborne. Complimentary meal provided with drinks (cold unfortunately as there is no galley in an ATR). Landing was hard but on time and we were quickly through customs.

### "did get us on the later flight"
For this flight I was connecting from a flight from London and when originally booked there was an over 3 hour transit time, however Bangkok Airways then cancelled this flight and we were booked on an earlier flight with only a 70 minute connection time. Our flight from London arrived late due to the Pakistan airspace restrictions and although we were met by a lady from Bangkok Airways and rushed across the airport we did not make the connection as the lady was not able to use any pressure to expedite the delay at transit immigration at security. However Bangkok Airways did get us on the later flight and the 4 hours in their lounge at BKK was ok! Once on board the A320 was quite tired and the seat cushions past their best. The flight arrived on time and they managed to serve a hot drink and a pastry in the 1 hour duration. In spite of the missed connection our luggage arrived on the flight so this was good!

### "offer a good service for a good price"
Check in at Koh Samui Airport was very quick. Flight boarded on time. At Koh Samui airport you are bused from the terminal in small open buses and as we were seated in row 18 boarded by rear steps of plane. Seat legroom was OK for this short flight. Plenty of space available for my wheelie case in the overhead locker. Flight departed on time. We were served a breakfast of yogurt, fruit and a chicken sandwich, the sandwich was very dry so only had one bite! Cup of tea actually tasted of tea, which is not often the case on flights. We arrived in Bangkok on time. Bangkok Airways may not do everything right but offer a good service for a good price.

### "Cabin crew were very pleasant"
Chiang Mai to Koh Samui in Economy Class. Check in was quite quick at Chiang Mai and we used the Bangkok Airways lounge, which although basic is free for all passengers. Flight boarded on time and Bangkok Airways managed the boarding process quite efficiently and did not allow passengers to jump their allotted boarding group. The A319 was in good condition and was probably one of their newer planes. A hot meal service was provided on this flight and included seafood with noodles and whilst the noodles were a bit soggy the meal was very tasty. Cabin crew were very pleasant. Flight landed on time and not too long wait for baggage. Overall a very good flight.

### "baggage took more than 1 hour"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. The boarding in Chiang Mai was a chaotic mess, and upon arrival in BKK there was no bus ready and we waited 20 minutes in the plane. Then the baggage took more than 1 hour to reach the carousel. All told, the waiting was longer than the  flight. No one from came to the carousel to let us know and there was no announcement, but their office is near the domestic baggage carousels and the staff in there were utterly clueless and disinterested.

### "waited 1 hour for the bags"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Bangkok ground operations were a disaster. We waited 20 minutes on the plane for a bus to take us to the terminal. Then we waited 1 hour for the bags. Staff were friendly and useless.

### "a massive disappointment"
Phu Quoc to Bangkok. For some ridiculous reason, Bangkok Airways sent a reminder around 25 hours prior to departure reminding me to check in online. That would have saved so much time - only the airline does not permit online check in for this flight! Deciding to arrive early at the airport was a major mistake! Three check-in desks, yet the act of checking in was the slowest I can recall in decades of travelling. No doubt this was a result of many passengers with connecting code-share flights at BKK, but there were also ticket problems with some. To wait 30 minutes to get to a desk when there were only 40 passengers in the various queues before me was infuriating when a simple bag drop would have taken only minutes - had internet check in been an option. At this airport passport control also takes forever. Then Bangkok Airways uses a bus gate. Boarding was a slow joke with many passengers forced to bake in the midday heat with no cover and no access to sun protection cream. The two flight attendants seemed thoroughly bored throughout the flight. The gourmet ‘meal’ was a starchy stodgy spinach cream puff and a ‘hard’ coconut cream. I left most on the tray. Then at BKK another bus gate with a driver who seemed to take us all round the airport before doubling back. Had this been a budget carrier, I could have accepted its failures. For an airline with such a major reputation, this was a massive disappointment.

### "Great service thank you"
Not Verified |  Left my luggage at Bangkok Airport and it was taken to lost property. Bangkok Airways retrieved it for me and sent it on the next available flight. Great service thank you.

### "old planes, low legspace"
Bangkok to Phuket. Bangkok Airways bills itself as "Asia's Boutique Airline" which is a bit of a joke given their old planes, low legspace, lackluster food service, and no in flight entertainment. Just about the only thing that is boutique is the price. Flights are extremely expensive but Bangkok Airways runs a monopoly on many internal routes in Thailand, which let's them get away with it. The first leg was infested with mosquitos and the plane was rather old, but service was ok. Flight was delayed by 45 minutes which led to a tight connection, but staff were available to es ort us through immigration and to the next flight. The second flight was also an old but serviceable plane. Unfortunately, the airline managed to lose our bags as well as those of half the plane, which led to a massive two hour queue to claim missing baggage. How on earth an airline can leave behind the bags of 50+ passengers on the same flight is beyond me. What a joke.

### "good value for the money"
Mandalay to Suvarnabhumi with Bangkok Airways. Easy check in, very friendly staff at Mandalay airport and boarding gate. The aircraft was clean and the crew were really nice and polite. Excellent customer service, food was really tasty and good value for the money.

### "has become uncaring of its passengers"
Have to fly Bangkok Airways regularly due to business commitments on this route due to the times. And they also give premier members premium lane passes at Bangkok to speed up the often 2-3 hour wait. But without any notice or email to members, they just withdrew the premium lane passes, and by not telling us, we got stuck in the sad long slow lines of Thailand immigration. Overall they use very old planes, we once had a plane abort take off at Phnom Penh. Mostly no business class, and generally the airline has become uncaring of its passengers recently.

### "Staff went above and beyond"
Chiang Rai to Mandalay via Bangkok. Staff went above and beyond for us! We had two flights on Bangkok Airways, transferring at Bangkok and arriving in Myanmar. However, in January we need to fly two different low-cost companies from Myanmar to Cambodia, again via a short transfer in Bangkok. The Bangkok Airways check-in staff caught a big problem with the future use of my Thai visa and went above and beyond in order to resolve it with the Immigration. I have to thank the Immigration officers at CEI airport as well, for their willingness to help, but the Bangkok Airways staff was so helpful I could never imagine getting such assistance from them, as indeed they did not have to. As for the flights themselves, easy, timely, clean, and short, and we even got meals on both short flights! A bit thank you!

### "Lovely short flight"
Lovely short flight from Ko Samui to Bangkok. Flight with well presented and nice food and no hassle at all. There are two lounges at USM, choose the Blue Ribon Lounge at gate 2, much bigger and better than the one at gate 1.

### "Nothing to complain about"
Bangkok to Ko Samui. Biz class with a 2-2 classic recliner seats configuration. Brought by special mini bus to the airplane, boarding first. Flight departed on time and arrived a little early. Very attentive and not rushed service, very good and well presented food (better than Thai domestic Biz class food). Baggage delivery absolutely first, even before the baggages of passengers from an earlier landed aircraft. Nothing to complain about.

### "aircraft was old and dirty"
Bangkok to Trat. The aircraft was old and dirty. The cabin crew were great. The check in in Trat was slow and they did not speak functional English. Must note that our second flight with Bangkok Airways was on a brand new aircraft.

### "every flight has been excellent"
Krabi to Bangkok. This now is about my 10th flight with Bangkok airways. I have to say every flight so far has been excellent. The flight attendants have always been very friendly and professional. We always get a meal which is good quality even on the shorter flights. The flights have all left on time or within 5 minutes. My bags have always arrived with me. Every time we are in the region this is my go to airline.

### "FAs were professional, pleasant"
Yangon to Bangkok. Outbound flight was uneventful, boarding a bit organized via announced zones though a few managed to jump the queue. Inbound was better (although the boarding gate was noisy due to the squeaking sound coming from the escalator above Gate D5, I wish they could fix that very soon). In-flight service was OK although because of the air turbulence, outbound service for hot beverage was cancelled while inbound had to be rushed and was amazed how the FAs managed to balance pouring hot beverages between rows without spilling on customers. Were served hot meals even for a short flight. Plane was maintained well, although it would help if even TV programs are available as IFE. FAs were professional, pleasant and spoke good English. Will fly Bangkok Airways again. Lastly, their lounge access given to Economy passengers was indeed pleasantly welcomed. The area got crowded at some point but food and beverages were refilled quickly and some passengers who left their used utensils on the limited tables were swiftly cleared by the staff.

### "lack of convenient flights"
Bangkok to Phnom Penh. Availability of lounge is good. Most areas inside the plane not clean. We took off from the terminal instead of the usual ferrying out to the tarmac by bus. I use them because lack of convenient flights but would change if viable options. This boutique airline looking old and shabby compared to newer planes.

### "charged for luggage over 20kg"
They should tell you ahead of time for delayed Luggage. and you get charged for check in luggage over 20kg. If you are taking the last afternoon flight from Chiang Mai to Koh Samui, your checked-in luggage may not arrive on time since the layover at Bangkok (you will stop at BKK) is only one hour and 15 minutes. You may waste an extra 40 minutes waiting in line after you've discovered that your luggage is not on the carousel. It would be nice if they told you in advance to expect this and to fill out the form via computer of where your hotel is located at for the luggage delivery. You can just go straight to your hotel and get your luggage delivered in the morning. Bangkok Airways had poor communications skills. They charge you an extra 1000-1500 Thai Baht (depending on which airport you fly out of) for anything over the permitted 20kg amount. I flew from BKK to Chiang Mai (paid an over-limit fee); Chiang Mai to USM (paid an over-limit fee); then USM to BKK (paid an over-limit fee). The flight attendants on the first two flights did not tell me to sign up on their website in order to request special meals (I asked them if they had vegetarian options). On the last flight, a flight attendant told me to visit their website in the future.

### "absolutely worth the money"
Phuket to Koh Samui. Great flight that was absolutely worth the money. The check in airport was very fast and was very friendly. The plane was relatively small, but the seat had enough space for such a short flight. In flight there was a free meal which you could choose before on the website. In addition a bottle of water. Free hot drinks such as coffee or tea were also offered on the flight. The flight was very punctual and the crew very nice. I can recommend this airline in any case. Toller Flug der sein Geld absolut Wert war. Das Einchecken man Flughafen ging sehr schnell und war sehr freundlich. Das Flugzeug war zwar relativ klein, aber am Sitzplatz hatte man genug Platz für so einen kurzen Flug. Im Flug gab es ein kostenloses Essen was man sich vorher auf der Website aussuchen konnte. Dazu eine Flasche Wasser. Auf dem Flug wurden ebenfalls kostenlose Heißgetränke wie Kaffe oder Tee angeboten. Der Flug war sehr pünktlich und die Crew sehr nett. Ich kann diese Fluggesellschaft aufjedenfall weiterempfehlen.

### "didn't propose any help or flexibility"
I fly a lot for my work and had the worst check-in experience in my life. Extra luggage cost was as much as the ticket! There was no option to book additional luggage on the portal I used, and the airline website was not working for my booking before. I am a professional cameraman, and always fly with a lot of equipment. Every other airline understands this and is flexible with carry-on because most of my equipment is forbidden in checked-in luggage. The flight was almost empty and still they didn't propose any help or flexibility. If I have the chance, I will always avoid flying Bangkok Airways. Aircrafts are tiny, old and with propellers, leg space for seat is inhumane.

### "Time to refresh Bangkok Airways?"
My previous flights with Bangkok Airways have been good, however this trip was not up to the 'boutique' standard. While the service onboard was efficient, a couple of the female flight attendants appeared to be less than happy and did not seem to be able smile. Sure, we all have bad days, but when your job is in the service industry, then act pleasant. I also thought that the aircraft appeared to look a little tired. Time to refresh Bangkok Airways?

### "excess luggage expensive"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Horrible experience with the worse check-in experience I have had, waiting one hour and forty minutes. BKK airport is very modern: I used it tens of times before and never had to wait more than normal. The excess luggage was frightfully expensive (on a domestic flight I paid nearly 3 times my air fare), staff was of no help. Onboard it was decent.

### "professional and friendly"
Connecting from Dubai to Chiang Mai. Domestic connections very seamless at that hour (7.30pm) as there weren't many domestic flights left. Lounge at Bangkok was very quiet and pleasant with a decent selection of snacks and drinks, good wifi too. Boarding was done on time and very quickly as the flight wasn't too full. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. Left Bangkok 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Full meal was served although it was cold and rather underwhelming, unexpected of Bangkok Air. Landed in Chiang Mai 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Only issue was that the plane was rather old and the legroom was very tight but overall, a good flight.

### "disappointed with our experience"
Bangkok to Koh Samui. The lounge services in Bangkok were dirty, flight was dirty, tired and like being in a sardine tin. Our return flight experience from Koh Sumi to Bangkok was not good. At check in at Koh Sumi airport staff questioned my partner's visa rights entering back into Australia since she was traveling on a non-Australian passport which I appreciate was necessary, however, didn’t see the information was in her passport. She confirmed our baggage would be retagged with Qantas business when they arrived in Bangkok – this did not happen. Our flight was delayed  no explanation – seems Bangkok Airways departing flights from Koh Sumai are arranged so they all arrive and take off at the same time. My son's pram was tagged fragile as we requested and we witnessed it being thrown into the hold from our window seat. Ground staff overseeing the transfer point had limited English communication skills and were rude. We had to run with our son and hand luggage across the other side of the terminal to make our connecting flight. I feel very disappointed with our experience. I’m not familiar with Thai hospitality to be like this in Thailand as it is always professional and helpful in my past experience.

### "efficient inflight service"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Excellent flight. Super fast and efficient inflight service with good food. All budget airlines (including BA) who charge for in flight food/beverages and consequently take ages to get through the cabin should take note. This is the way to treat your customers and provide excellent service.

### "Attentive crew, smooth flight"
Siem Reap to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. Overall, comfortable flight. Pros: Attentive crew, smooth flight, decent food. You actually reach a real person if you call customer service. Cons: Flight did not leave on time. Web app is not easy to use when booking. I wanted to book a flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap and tried 4 times. Each time I got to the payment page, the app would crash. I finally called the customer service no. on the morning of my planned departure but by that time, the good airfare was gone! I ended up flying with AirAsia, which I would not recommend to anyone.

### "now its very mediocre"
Mandalay to Bangkok. They seem to have embraced the budget model. Booked our February flights last summer and as these were the only flights on our itinerary which had less than 30kg baggage allowance I had a webchat conversation with customer services about additional baggage. No problem they said, as you are a member of flyer bonus we give you 10kg extra. Fast forward to check in and surprise surprise the check in agent was having none of it and charged us $80 US and refused to get a manager saying pay or leave your bag. Their aircraft interiors have also deteriorated over the years and are not as clean as they once were. This airline used to be unique while now its very mediocre. Such a shame.

### "web site is misleading"
Vientiane to Mumbai via Bangkok. We (2 travellers) only chose this airline for the baggage allowance, in spite of its long layover time. Their web site says 10 kgs extra as flyer bonus, but the ground staff insisted it was 5 kgs only - the information on their web site is misleading.

### "I’d recommend them"
Phnom Penh to Bangkok. Nice check in, dedicated counter. Lovely lounge with comfortable chairs and good food. Boarding was good. Then we sat. And sat. And sat. At least an hour, waiting for approval to take off took a long time. FA were fine, not overly pro-active but pleasant, there was only three of us in business. The food, choice of two, was awful, Awful, poor quality hot meal, what a shame. Three course yuk, even dessert was dreadful, We parked in an outer area and had a mini bus take the three of us to arrivals. We had been given an express pass so immigration was quick and our bags were off early. We were out of the airport in 20 minutes, I’d recommend them but I think I’d go economy next time.

### "Cabin service excellent"
Flew to Bangkok Suvarnbhumi to make shortish international connection. Fly this route very often. This time things did not work out so well. Flight took off 20 minutes late. No announcement or apology offered by cockpit crew. (Already I am starting to get nervous.) Shortly before landing in Bangkok cockpit announces that due to congestion we will circle the airport for a while, (My nervousness increases.) On landing luggage takes 40 minutes to arrive. To make it in time to my international connection I have to run to get through security (frequently long lines) and immigration (always long lines). Breathless, but I make it. Next time maybe I will take an earlier flight. Cabin service excellent. I ordered an optional meal - the Asian vegetarian - which was delicious. And, of course, the very convenient and friendly lounges, with snackies, popcorn, beverages (including a cappuccino machine) open to all passengers.

### "the plane was in an unacceptable state"
This was a reasonably priced 1hr domestic flight from Krabi to Bangkok. Bangkok Airways is still trying to retain its boutique airlines style by providing a lounge for all and decent food. This was great, but the plane was in an unacceptable state. The A320 looks rundown, the toilet was in a terrible state, no soap, no towels, the floor was not clean. At least 3 life vests in my row were just lying on the floor as they had detatched from the compartment under the seat. The condition of the plane was more like 1* instead of boutique.

### "got a ticket for a free meal"
Bangkok to Koh Samui. The landing gear wouldn't go down so we couldn't land and had to return to Bangkok. After waiting in line for 45 minutes, got a ticket for a free meal that the cafeteria wouldn't accept. 6 hour delay. Dealing with customer service on email is a waste of time and only a local Thai number to call.

### "Everything went fine"
Yangon to Bangkok. Everything went fine, flight on time, special meal accommodated. Soft and semi-soft drinks provided. Got an extra hot meal. FA's professional. Disembarking in Bangkok a total humiliation as we had to go several kilometers by bus. No IFE. Luggage included. Not cheap..

### "good as it gets in economy"
Danang to Yangon via Bangkok. As good as it gets in economy class. Small aircraft, A319 and A320. Flights punctual. Check-in smooth and both Boarding Passes issued simultaneously though on 2 different tickets. In Danang no lounge was offered. In Bangkok their lounge is spacious and a relief. Onboard, special meal offered and delivered to perfection. Other 2 options of hot food available. Soft drinks, hot drinks, and wine and beer offered (only 1 brand of each, though. Courtesy upgraded from seat 20A to 3A on first flight (the seats are the same). FA professional and caring. Food quality so, so, and portions were small. Additional food was available and provided on request. IFE onboard ridiculous, some low-rate hidden camera clips were shown in plenum from ceiling monitors. Transfer and transit smooth. Bus-gating in Bangkok (arrival and departure) was not convenient. But in Danang it was better as we walked straight onto the aircraft. I have had 9 trips with this airline and have now, through their FFP Programme, earned myself a domestic 1-way travel in Thailand. Cannot really fault this airline, they are a bit more pricy than LCCs, but it is worth it as they are service minded, provide free luggage allowance, and are generally good

### "inflight service  very reasonable"
Bangkok to Male was a mixed experience. The flight departed and arrived perfectly on time. Seat comfort was good and inflight service  very reasonable. The flight did not provide any IFE or wifi. Food and beverages were reasonably good. However, it was a bumpy ride due to weather and they did not have the seatbelt sign on, and at a specific moment we hit some moderate turbulence. Recommended anyway.

### "service onboard was really good"
Siem Reap to Bangkok. I flew on an old A320 that seemed to be a bit tired, the paint in the outside of the aircraft was showing signs of age. Regardless, the flight experience was reasonable, very timely and service onboard was really good. Recommended.

### "assistance and hospitality"
Koh Samui to Bangkok. If you want to start your vacation already in the Economy Class of an airline, please select Bangkok Airways! My experience says even that holiday feeling is strongly supported by their assistance and hospitality with customer service at the airport! Bangkok Airlines saved our day (and our following vacation in Koh Samui) by saving us from horrible experiences with the most unpleasant airline in the region: Spicejet!

### "Great little airline"
Flew Phuket to Ko Samui with Bangkok Airways. Great little airline! We flew with only about 6 other people on our little propellor plane and the plane was very smooth! Smoother than most other propellor planes I've been on. We were also served a great meal without having to purchase it! It was included in the price.

### "all passengers was squeezed next to each other"
Flew Bangkok to Phuket. I fly around 300.000 miles a year and I have now had 2 flights with Bangkok Airways. The service is friendly and the airplane was in good condition. There was no delay during the last 3 flights. Complaints: during online check-in the airline blocked almost all seat-selections and gave you a choice of a max of 4 selections. I can't tolerate such issues, especially when the aircraft is 25-35% booked or less (all 3 flights). Also the ground personal would not change my seat to my desired selection with the explanation that it was not possible because we need to balance out the aircraft! There were multiple empty rows and all passengers was squeezed next to each other!

### "staff relaxed and very friendly"
As usual Bangkok Airways never disappoints. The fare is very affordable, checking in a luggage is free, the lounge is free food and WiFi. The airplane looks very clean and sharp, the staff are all smiles, relaxed and very friendly. This is my favorite airline in south asia. I love it.

### "aircraft interior was starting to show its age"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok, flight PG228 onboard an older Airbus A319. Flight was slightly delayed due to the late incoming aircraft. The lounge at Chiang Mai airport was fairly basic (sandwiches, juices, and a popcorn machine!) but definitely set the airline aside from its competitors. The aircraft interior was starting to show its age, seats were wide and spacious yet the appearance was subpar even to low cost carriers such as AirAsia. Flight was approximately at 90% capacity with some empty middle seats. Cabin crew were professional and enthusiastic from boarding to disembarking. A full meal was distributed yet left a lot to be desired. Metal cutlery was provided, definitely a nice touch as some other full service carriers don't provide them. Touched down in Bangkok 5 minutes later than scheduled and ferried by bus back to the terminal. Bags were a little slower to arrive due to the far proximity of the area from where the aircraft was parked upon arrival. Overall, for the price I paid for this flight (40USD), I had an enjoyable experience and I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.

### "I enjoyed the experience"
My first flight with Bangkok Airways and I enjoyed the experience. Check in at both Bangkok and Siem Reap went smoothly. Boarding by bus also went without a hitch. Love the prop aircraft since all the seats have a view as the wing is not in the way. Service onboard was good. They provided a meal and you can pre-arrange a special meal if required. Leg room was good and I am a tall person. Would certainly fly with them again. The flight back was no different. Would recommend Bangkok Airways over Air Asia any day.

### "The plane was well kept"
I enjoyed my flight with Bangkok Airways flying from Koh Samui to Bangkok. The staff were very friendly and the plane left on time. Check in was easy. There was even free snacks available before we boarded the plane. The meal they served was not very large, but OK for a short flight. The plane was well kept. No IFE, but given the length of the flight it didn't matter.

### "sit around at the airport"
My partner and I were due to fly from Koh Samui to Bangkok in the afternoon at 15.20. We arrived at the airport in plenty of time and checked in our bags, we were waiting to board our flight only to have an announcement that for some technical reason the flight had been cancelled. I had to report to check in where there was no extra information forthcoming as to why exactly the flight was cancelled. We were then rescheduled for another flight 2 hours after our original departure time. There was the added confusion that we would board from GATE 2 on the new flight, which was then changed back to GATE 1 and the boarding time was delayed again with no reason given. There seemed to be no sense of urgency at all by the airline staff. We had to sit around at the airport for this time, we tried without success to see if we could leave some carry on luggage somewhere secure to save carrying it around to get an unhelpful response from the staff at premier lounge and the check-in desk. We did have an inflight meal while we were waiting so at least one of the staff was concerned, but considering the money we paid for the flights and not much choice of airline a poor service and the flight we came back on was the propeller aircraft. The stewards on this flight looked disinterested and not seeming to want to help passengers. My flight out was a very pleasant experience with a good lounge at Bangkok and very good cabin staff on this flight and the flight was on time.

### "was a pleasant journey"
Chiang Mai to Mae Hong Son return with Bangkok Airways using their ATR Turboprop was a pleasant journey. Even though it was a short-flight (45 minutes), the cabin crew still served the passengers with inflight meal. On-going flight was cancelled due technical issue with their airplane. But, the ground staff were helping us quickly by transferring us to the nearest hotel, rebook our return flight without cost, and gave some compensation according to the Thai passenger right. The price seems OK with its product and service. They provided also a free entry to its lounge in both airports without cost for all economy passengers.

### "total let down experience "
Total let down experience with Bangkok Airways from Da Nang to Bangkok. I do have Food allergies and is not something I asked for and who has food allergies know well what I mean. I did as usual practice when flying, informed the airline about my allergies, once on board the flight the crew came to ask for my name and if I was the passenger with the allergies which I confirmed. When she served me the food there was a label on top of the food container indicating my allergies (Soya, Rice, Banana, Sesame), when I removed the food cover guess what I found rice. It is just unbelievable how lightly they take food allergies or most likely they don’t care. I sent emails and not just 1 but more and nobody form Bangkok Airways even bothered to reply or just give me a call to apologize…

### "booking system is the worst"
Their online booking system is the worst I know. Getting into it is difficult at times, it can be slow and difficult to use. They would not accept my international credit cards which means I have to telephone their office (easier said than done) to make or confirm the reservation. On the last occasion I went through five credit cards all of which are in limit and valid but the website would not accept them. When I contacted my credit card companies they told me that no attempt had been made to charge my cards. So for me, their online booking system does not work.

### "they keep on improving"
Bangkok to Trat. This is my fourth time reviewing Bangkok airways, and they keep on improving. When I arrived at the airport 50 minutes before the flight, my brother forgot his ID. The friendly lady at check in called her supervisor and gave us special documents and let us on the flight. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to the fact cleaning staff were late, normally Trat flights have an excellent on time record. Boarding finished within 5 minutes. My seafood meal was grilled veggie salad topped with salmon. It was great for a 40 minute flight. Unfortunately the flight passed through quite a lot of bad weather so there was no coffee/tea service. Flight attendants on this flight were friendly and very helpful. I'd like to note that if possible, find out if you're flying a -500 or a -600, since the -500 has creaky seats and the plane I flew was unclean. I flew the -600 this flight, and flew this particular plane (HS-PZE) before and must say that time the cabin looked much cleaner. Maybe cleanliness needs to be worked out.

### "Highly recommended"
Bangkok to Phuket. Amazing airline, easy online booking, you can choose seats with no extra cost. Great communication via email a couple of days before the departure. Punctual. They have airport lounges in Bangkok and Phuket for economy passengers where you can get free WIFI, hot and cold drinks and food. Our flight only took 1 hour and they provided food. Highly recommended! They do not let travel agents to book your domestic flight (from NZ) but the process is easy and you have many options (refundable and non refundable tickets).

### "is a sure-fire winner"
Chiang Mai to Mumbai via Bangkok. As a Thai resident have frequently flown this airline domestically. While it USED to cost more than either NokAir or AirAsia, its twice-yearly promotions often brought the price down to match or be less than Nok and AA. This time I flew Bangkok Airways internationally again having bought the ticket during a promotion. Very smooth check-in. A spacious complimentary lounge for all passengers to relax in with snackies, tea coffee (including latte mocha cappu) water juice and freshly-made popcorn. Excellent wi-fi. Always announcements made announcing boardings/departures. Very efficient and well-guided transfer from arrivals to departures in Bangkok where I had to change planes. Friendly, if somewhat officious (had changed seats and occupied an empty row and an hour before landing crew informed me I would have to move back to my original seat and on inquiring why was told that the plane needed to be "balanced"), crew (Bkk-Mumbai). No Immigration forms handed out on plane; no conveyor belt number announced. Don't know if this is the fault of Indian Immigration and Mumbai airport. Return to Thailand also very smooth and efficient with the entire process being done in reverse. Bangkok Airways  complimentary lounges/snackies etc, coupled with great wi-fi and loads of seating is a sure-fire winner.

### "never been treated so well"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok with Bangkok Airways. We checked in at a kiosk with the help of a very polite and efficient agent from the airline, and then waited in line for ten minutes at baggage drop (the airlines allows 50 lb. of baggage with economy tickets). After security, we relaxed in the dedicated Bangkok Airways lounge at CNX, which included free refreshments and WiFi. The airline staff, both on the ground and in the air, were gracious and efficient. The plane was spotlessly clean, and had comfortable seating and magazines, but no inflight entertainment during this 75-minute flight. A complimentary hot meal was offered to all passengers: I ordered an Asian vegetarian meal in advance and it was delicious. We landed in BKK on time and baggage arrived within 10 minutes. I have never been treated so well during a domestic flight. Such a contrast to flying domestic economy in the USA.

### "attendants were attentive and helpful"
Although Bangkok Airways claims to be a boutique airline, it's not true for this ATR aircraft due to small leg room space. Even a 1 and a half hour flight from Samui to Utopao was not comfortable. About 40 minute queue at check-in counters. The other ground services was quite good. Om board meal was not bad with a hot main course. Flight attendants were attentive and helpful.

### "cancelled without notification"
I have used Bangkok Airways a few times during March and April. The last time, my flight Bangkok to Chiang Mai was schedule around 19.40. I arrived the airport quite early before 5pm and found out that this flight was cancelled without notification. They explained it might because I bought the ticket via agency. The next flight was almost 10pm. So bad that I have to wait almost 5 hours. This time again, flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai has been announced as delayed by 1 hour at least! Many of my colleagues also complain frequently of delays with Bangkok Airways.

### "staff was gracious and helpful"
❎ Unverified |  Mumbai to Phuket via Bangkok. A very comfortable flight from Mumbai to Bangkok. The seats were quite comfortable and had enough legroom. The food was good and sufficient for the late night departure. The connecting flight from Bangkok to Phuket was also quite good and no complaints. The cabin staff was gracious and helpful. There is no inflight entertainment. The only issues were on arrival in Bangkok for the transit flight, the attendant directed me to the transfer desk for immigration without informing that the visa on arrival needs to be stamped at another counter before proceeding to immigration. So had to make the long trek to the transfer deck from the gate learn that the visa on arrival needs to be done at another place which was again a fair distance away and then make the trek back to the transfer and security. I managed to just reach the gate in time for boarding my connection to Phuket. Also if you have international connections on Bangkok Airways, your baggage comes at International Arrivals in Phuket and not domestic. Just something to keep in mind if you are arranging pick-up.

### "very pleasant experience"
Bangkok to Mandalay. Flying with Bangkok Airways was a very pleasant experience. The food was good and the staff was swift, efficient and polite. The aircraft was in NIKI Airways livery. It felt a bit strange entering an aircraft  from a small, European budget airline.

### "still have not gotten a response
On Feb. 15, 2017 we checked in online for our Bangkok Airways flight 906 from Siem Reap to Bangkok on Feb. 16. We were at the airport 2 hours prior to departure and checked in smoothly. We went through immigration and were waiting in line at security when the Agent that checked us in came running up to us and pulled us out of line. She said she had been informed by the company that our boarding passes needed a special stamp. At this point everyone in line was staring at us. She took our boarding passes and stamped them both then said we could get back in line. When I looked at my boarding pass it was stamped "Accepted No Meal. This was sold as a meal flight and I had no idea why they would do this. On Feb. 17, I sent an e mail to Bangkok Airways asking why we had been denied a meal with no explanation. It is now March 10 and I still have not gotten a response.

### "among the better economy flights"
Bangkok to Mandalay on 6th March on a Bangkok Airways A320. Flight was full and on time. Everything worked smoothly. Free lounge in Bangkok for all passengers. Hot meals and drinks served, including those hot and those having a bit of booze. Staff efficient. Arrival cards distributed on-board. Among the better economy flights I have taken.

### "was more than I expected"
Our group of 12 was the first to check in for this short hop from Luang Prabang to Bangkok. Check-in was very smooth and was pleasantly surprised that we were allowed to have our luggage tagged all the way through to Manila even if we were holding a separate ticket for that leg. It saved us a lot of time and hassle to have to go through Immigration in Bangkok. We were invited to use their lounge which offered a comfortable environment with snacks and complimentary wi-fi. The flight departed on time and the level of cabin service was top notch considering the cramped environment in a turbo prop like the ATR72. The meal and beverage service was more than I expected. On time arrival in BKK and smooth luggage transfer to our connecting PAL flight to Manila. Congratulations on a well-run airline!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Good flight with Bangkok Airways. The service was efficient and friendly and the food was really delicious. The flights departed on-time on both legs. The aircraft was clean and the seats were comfortable. The only thing that I would like to see improved is their inflight magazine. The content is superb and really interesting but they published their inflight magazine every two months. It would be much better if they did it monthly.

### "Perfect, punctual flight"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok (domestic) on 1st March 2017, on A320. Perfect, punctual flight, check-in, care, and good catering on board. Special meal accommodated. Lounge access in CNX granted. No fantastic, but well-functioning with softdrinks, snacks and a very good wifi. Onboard they served proper lunch with steel cutlery of high quality. One gets almost a feeling of travelling business class. Staff adept, alert, professional and fast and serve passengers throughout the trip. Beers not offered onboard. Two faults would at check-in, neither label nor allow me to check-in luggage on next flights as they were on “another ticket. This has recently changed and is a deterioration. At arrival in Bangkok there was no airbridge to gate and an annoying bus-trip where 75% of passengers would have to stand-up for 15 Minutes zig-zag drive spoiled the trip a bit. Gentle luggage allowance and faultless, quick delivery on belt in arrival hall. On a positive note was that they allowed to make a big change on the return date of my ticket. They waived any change-fees as they had also changed their initial departure time though just a little bit.

### "trip turned out fabulous"
Flew Mandalay to Chiang Mai on 25th Feb 2017 on ATR72. The trip turned out fabulous, despite on modest aircraft due to museum retirement. Bangkok Airways staff give a boost to the remote airport in Mandalay. Check-in professional and smooth though opened late (only 2 hours prior to departure). You are encouraged and trapped into On-line check-in. However, as many times before, it is not possible but only to be told this upon all enterings are submitted - what a waste of time. Security and immigration takes seconds as typically for small airports. Lounge in Mandalay is an attractive, fantastic clever arrangement: Bangkok Airways rent themselves into a smart big cafe-shop in the airport where only a la carte and alcoholic drinks will have to be paid for. Lousy WiFi (as normal in Myanmar). Buffet and softdrinks (incl. hotdrinks) are free, otherwise prices are hefty. Service onboard top-notch and special meal and loads of drinks continuously provided from 3 Minutes after take-off till 7 Minutes prior to touch down. Toilets clean, staff proactive. Drinks included 2 wines (poor quality) and 1 Thai beer, but the flow was smooth. Special meal provided without hassle and of OK quality. I had pre-ordered seafood and got a full tray including three crab-meat sandwiches, very tasty. This is on the cheapest economy ticket available, but one gets a feeling of business class, considered circumstances and rare routing. Buss-gate in Mandalay due to remote parking of the ATR72. Flight loaded with 33 passengers, less than half of capacity. Landed 30 Minutes ahead of schedule. Deserves ideally 10 marks out of 10 but I  deduct 2 for the three issues of old aircraft, online check-in failure and bus gating.

### "FA extremely fast and effective"
Flew Bangkok to Chiang Mai (domestic) and Chiang Mai to Mandalay (international) on 2nd and 4th February 2017, on A320 and ATR72, respectively. Faults: first flight was delayed almost an hour. 2nd flight was downgraded to from an A320 to an ATR72 aircraft. No IFE. Bus-gated in CNX to the remote aircraft. Wasted time on online check in, upon entering of all data, the system eventually deny issuing the BP which “shall be issued in airport upon presenting all travel relevant documents”. Apart from these five (minor) gaps/faults the rest was perfect and nice experience. I used their free lounges in BKK and CNX was a really nice touch, almost like “real” lounges. Full meals on both flights. Ordered seafood special meal which was delivered to my seat upon verification. Was hungry and managed to get the standard meal as well as there were some in excess. FA extremely fast and effective on board and both flights were almost full. Luggage and check-in handled professionally and perfect. They have a smoothless luggage cooperation with Malaysia Airlines which was a big advantage to me when arriving to Bangkok (from Kuala Lumpur) and still did not have to touch my luggage as it was transferred further on the domestic leg. Custom of suitcase was relayed to CNX – and of course 2 days later in Mandalay when arriving there. The International flight was smooth and enjoyable. They served passengers throughout the flight, hot food, snacks, drinks (incl. red, white, beer), coffee, tea, wet towels. Wines of poorer quality. Inflight magazines available. FAs were quick, knowledgeable, linguistic, and kind. Call button answered within seconds. Agreed, not always the cheapest airline and at times monopolising certain routes. However, the feeling you get flying with them in economy is similar to premium economy level. Will fly again.

### "extremely helpful and friendly"
Trat to Bangkok. I'm extremely grateful to the Bangkok Airways staff at Trat Airport. I checked in online, and was late for my flight. I was about an hour away from departure time, and I was still on the ferry from the island to the airport. I called the airport and told them that I might be late for my flight, any solutions? Instead, when I arrived at the airport after flooring it on my car, they had already printed my boarding pass. Wow. After that, it was a Bangkok Airways 4-star quality full flight. Having previously ordered a seafood meal, it was a salad, with a coleslaw as a side! However, one issue the airline should tackle is the hard landings. I have taken 10 flights and all flights on the ATR had hard landings but 2 A320 flights were soft landings. All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. I'm still a loyal flyerbonus member, and will continue to use Bangkok Airways in the future.

### "a very good airline"
Mandalay to Siem Reap via Bangkok. Premium price for premium service cost is definitely higher than other airlines serving the same route, and Bangkok Airways was the only airline selling the connecting flight. Service is nearly business class, whith a buffet provided before departure, a hot meal with metal spoon and fork on the first flight and a meal on the very short second flight. In BKK our luggages were lost (I believe groung handling is responsible) and in Siem Reap they have been delivered to out hotel within 3 hours. In summary a very good airline at a cost.

### "become one of my favorites"
Koh Samui to Bangkok. Nice staff, planes are clean and in good condition, good meal also for short flight. Service pleasant but not pretentious. I was pleasantly surprised by a separate lounge (as a business lounge but for economy class passengers) at the Bangkok airport. Suddenly this regional airline become one of my favorites.

### "they were fantastic"
Bangkok to Sukhothai. I've had mixed experiences in the past (lost bags and delays) but they were fantastic. Printed off boarding pass so no lines. Lounge is functional if busy and snacks appreciated. Boarding organized. Small prop plane , fine for a short hop. Sukhothai airport is very pretty. Same on return, snacks at airport, wifi etc. Buses ready to transfer. Crew on board efficient and food pretty good! Two passengers was cheaper than a car to Sukhothai.

### "friendly, attentive and efficient"
Bangkok to Samui. Happily surprised by the service of Bangkok Airways. We requested an earlier flight and it was done without a fuss. We were given access to the lounge with good variety of food choices, comfortable seats and wifi connection. Ground and flight crews were very friendly, attentive and efficient. The aircraft itself was not bad. Highly recommended and will fly check their flight destinations in my next travels within Asia.

### "FA’s extremely fit and professional"
Travelled Bangkok Phnom Penh on 16 Nov 2016 on a brand new A320. Operate like a legacy, fully fledged carrier. My transit from Myanmar Airways well received and smooth, despite no official cooperation and no boarding card. The free lounge in BKK is a relief for an economy traveller in transit, had a nap on a sofa and a coffee/cake booster. Flight was overly full and 30 minutes delayed. FA’s extremely fit and professional and dished out meals and drinks and even accommodated special meals and special requests into perfection. Meals were full meals, surprisingly good, and served warm. 2 drinks rounds on a 60 min flight were served by an extremely fast working and focused crew. Wine and beers were available. However, service stopped unnecessarily early 25 min before landing, could have continued 20 minutes longer to provide a few more pleasures and less stress. PG delivers, a regional pearl, weaknesses are very few only.

### "the cabin crew were great"
Flew Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Vientiane. Everything from the lounge to the in-flight service was perfect. However, the aircraft that I was on had to return to Bangkok right after preparing to land in Vientiane. The cockpit crew did not communicate much with the passengers but the cabin crew were great. After returning to Bangkok, a new aircraft was prepared swiftly. However, they were no so generous with food and drinks on the ground while we were waiting for a change of aircraft.

### "on-board service was friendly and prompt"
Flew Vientiane to Bangkok. Check-in was efficient and professional. Lounge access (even for economy class) is a welcome treat. The flight departed on time and on-board service was friendly and prompt. A hot meal was served but the food quality was very poor. Overall, this was a very pleasant flight and I would have no hesitation in using Bangkok Airways again.

### "friendly service and free drinks"
Bangkok to Surat Thani. Positively surprised. For us it was the first time to fly with Bangkok Airways on a domestic flight within Thailand and we were positively surprised. Free wifi in the airport, friendly service and free drinks, as well as free snacks at the airport, which made the waiting time very pleasant.

### "I really like this carrier"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. The planes are a bit old, but I really like this carrier. It's a journey I do a lot - only a hours short hop. By signing up for their reward program you get into their lounges and they give you an extra piece of checked baggage! It's one of the few airlines that fly into BKK opposed to DMK from Chiang Mai. This saves a lot of time, heart ache and carbon monoxide poisoning from the arduous trek between the two Bankok airports.

### "will definitely fly again"
Bangkok to Phuket. Second trip that I have used this airline and not disappointed by the reviews. At BKK, good check-in with an attendant greeting you and directing you to an available check-in counter. The lounge in BKK is great as usual, and not so crowded on a Wednesday evening. Plenty of space to sit comfortably with power outlets available everywhere. The food and beverages were good. Good that they have sign telling what the food is and telling that it is 'Halal'. The plane is an old A320, but the seats was comfortable. The crew was very polite and attentive. One thing I like is that if they see that you are reading, they will automatically switch on the personal light for you (as they will dim the light during take off) Meal is good as usual for this short flight. I ordered special (MOML) meal and it was chicken curry (as usual for MOML) which was quite good. Overall, great flight and will definitely fly again.

### "definitely fly Bangkok Airways again"
Koh Samui to Bangkok. Great airline and great to have access to their lounge for refreshments. Come a little early and asked nicely if we had to switch to an earlier flight and they fixed it in one minute. Even the food on the flight have gotten better and we will definitely fly with Bangkok Airways again.

### "rather disappointing experience"
Krabi to Bangkok, a 1hr 20 mins flight and a rather disappointing experience. At airport it appeared the flight was delayed 40 minutes. At the check-in desk nobody told us anything. After discovering the flight was delayed we asked info to the airline representative though she knew nothing. The airline complimentary lounge was okay but overcrowded. During the trip they offered some rice with chicken that was so spicy that only few people (mostly locals) managed to eat. When we arrived to BKK airport it was raining a lot, but no finger so everyone had to walk to deplane to a bus in the rain.

### "such a great hospitality"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai one way. I have some medical condition that require special assistant during the flight. Every staff are extremely helpful, they do everything to accommodate me as good as they can which is much beyond the requirement in medical certificate, and certainly beyond my expectation. The aircraft is an older A320 but seat pitch is great, cabin is clean. Light snack is served and is the only thing I found disappointing. The new revamped (fusion recipe with touch of Thai delicacy) menu sound good in theory , but not edible and not at all practical as an airlines food. Thank you for such a great hospitality.

### "good for a late night flight"
Trat to Bangkok one way. I've flown this route for ten years now. The plane has been updated from a still-excellent ATR72-500 to a plane which is better. The check-in was ok. There are now bathrooms in the lounge, So you don't have to walk to the area where you normally go to the bathroom. The in-flight meal was announced and was massamun chicken burger. They abandoned the box full of goodies and have gone for a more conventional meal Tray. The sandwich looked as though it was prepared no less than 10 hours ago. A smart thing that Bangkok Airways inflight catering has done is make the coffee not very rich, which is good for a late night flight.

### "nice crew, very efficient"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Bangkok Airways live up to their name of being a boutique airline. Very nice crew, very efficient. For 55 minute flight managed to hand out a snack and take everything back. Asked for a blanket as was pretty cold no issues happily provided. In Bangkok you can access their lounge where you get snacks and wifi very nice touch. The aeroplane was well maintained but they should look at upgrading to Neo when possible to really cemenet themselves as the best small airline in Asia. For the price of return ticket from BKK to Chiang Mai I would definitelly advise to pay that little extra and fly with them rather than other lower cost carriers especially since every passenger gets 23KG allowance.

### "aircraft was old and worn"
Flew Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Siem Reap. The aircraft was old and worn (our seats were broken and we flew in refined position). The ground service was good and the free lounge for all passengers was nice (although in Siem Reap it is simply a snack counter in the main terminal). The aircraft did not have a jetway and we were bussed clear around the airport. The toal time from touchdown to terminal was 40 minutes.

### "meal was very tasty"
Bangkok to Phuket round trip. The lounge at the airport is available to all passengers, there are snacks, free WiFi and drinks. Check-in was fast and efficient. Inflight meal was very tasty. Cabin staff were as good as always. I will probably fly with Bangkok Airways again.

### "had three seats to myself"
Flew Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. On-time departure, gracious cabin staff, immaculate airplane but very small leg and knee room. Thankfully, I had three seats to myself, so this six-footer could sit diagonally in the row and be reasonably comfortable. But I dread the thought of being incarcerated in this airplane on a full flight.

### "delighted by the service"
Chang Mai to Koh Samui via Bangkok with Bangkok Airways. For the price of the flight I was delighted by the service that we received. Our flights were only an hour each yet we got access to a lounge at the airport with snacks, free WiFi and drinks. There was an inflight meal and drinks on the plane. There service was outstanding and out of 3 flights we took with them within 1 week we had no delays or issues. Would fly with them again.

### "service good, punctual, no complaints"
Bangkok Airways are an old-style "frills" airline - you pay a little more than the cheap airlines ask, you get a much more pleasant experience. It starts at the airport: in Bangkok as in other places they have a "boutique lounge" (a sort of "business lounge lite") for economy passengers, so you're not waiting on the concourse or by the gate. Service good, punctual, no complaints. Cabin crew excellent. In-flight catering adequate (and not charged for), no entertainment (it was a one-hour domestic flight from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Chiang Mai after all).

### "staff friendly and efficient"
Bangkok to Phnom Pehn with Bangkok Airways return. The lounge comfort and food and drink great. Flew seat 28C outbound and breakfast was great. Return trip in 1A, lounge service in Phnom Pehn was great (including the foot massage in the spa) better staff friendly and efficient. Aircraft clean and quiet.

### "comfortable seats and smiling crew"
Evening flight with Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Chiang Rai and although it was a busy holiday weekend and the international airport was very crowded, the flight left on time. Brand-new and very clean A319-aircraft, comfortable seats and smiling crew. What impresses me the most is that Bangkok Airways seems to be the only airline in the world that manages to serve a hot-meal together with three drink-rounds to around 120 passengers within 20 minutes. The flight lasted only 50 minutes. Just amazing - I have not experienced that degree of efficiency on another airline before.

### "quality with the fare paid"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai return. Overall, I do not have any regret to choose Bangkok Airways for that sector. One of my reason to fly with them is due to the airlines provides a lounge for economy passangers both in Bangkok airport and Chiang Mai airport. There is no special food or beverages in the lounge. But at least, it is a good place to relax and out from busy of the airport. When asking related to bagage delivery, I had to wait around 30 minutes until I got my lugage. The seat was good and so much space. They delivered my special meal without any problem. For the price, it seems reasonable. We get quality with the fare we have paid.

### "crew were really kind"
Loved flying with Bangkok Airways. Check in at Bangkok was straight forward and their lounge, whilst busy, provided a nice bit of relief whilst waiting for our flight. The crew were really kind and the hot snack (chicken and rice) was tasty. From Phuket to Bangkok, there wasn't a queue at check in so it only took a few minutes to drop our bags off. The lounge at HKT was so quiet, the selection of snacks was better and they even had a live Premier League game on the tv. The flight was delayed by 30mins but the airline had sent a text in advance to advise us of the delay. Legroom was amazing. Wouldn't hesitate to booking with them when next in Thailand

### "leg space is decent"
This was my first time flying on Bangkok Airways. The flight from Dhaka to Bangkok was 2 hours late, which was actually a boon for me. The airline provided dinner coupons which one could claim only after a certain hour. Flight service was good, leg space is decent but no entertainment although the return flight from Bangkok back to Dhaka beamed Peanuts. On landing at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, there was no aerobridge which was difficult for my accompanying wheelchair passenger. However, a special van was arranged so that crowded bus could be avoided. Meals were decent with choice of fish or chicken. Attendants do a second round offering wine! The best part about the DAC-BKK-DAC route is its flight timing at night because it lets you finish up work and catch a flight.

### "it was an okay experience"
Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, and all very professional. Check in was good and quick. There is also a free lounge for everyone which provides coffee and eats - very thoughtful and a nice touch. Announcements seemed pretty clear, and cabin crew well groomed, efficient. Seats are good - the meals are mostly fish based so if you don't like fish you've no other option, that has happened me a couple of times. All in all it was an okay experience.

### "insisted we pay excess baggage"
We had a Bangkok Airways flight to Koh Samui from Bangkok on PG 153 on March 11th, 2016 coming from Hanoi Vietnam with Thai Airways. Thai Airways checked our luggage in 2 suit cases both 26 kg together 53 kg. The first leg we did on business class. The luggage was checked through to Koh Samui - no problem. Our flight from Koh Samui to Bangkok and via Bangkok to Zurich with Swiss (Business Class). The booked flight was PG 122 from Koh Samui to Bangkok on March 18th at 9.15 am. We arrived around 8 am at the airport to see that the flight PG 122 has been cancelled and all passengers had been re-booked to flight PG 124 leaving at 9.55 am, which reduced our transfer time severely. Nobody informed us about the cancellation, even it was already known the day before as we found out. Checking in we were told that only 20 kg per passenger in economy class is allowed. We told them this is considerably below standards for economy long haul flights and and that we came with the same airline without paying excess baggage. They insisted that we pay the excess baggage until Zurich, which we told them that we fly business from Bangkok to Zurich and that we are well within the limits for that flight. After long discussions we had only to pay until Bangkok. I mean the whole check-in process handled for all airlines by Bangkok Airways seems to be a way for Bangkok airways to get additional money out of passengers. The service on board was good both ways nothing to complain.

### "cabin crew were attentive"
Another great trip in Business class. I had a tight connection in Singapore and the ground crew were very helpful and I made the flight. Bangkok Airways cabin crew were attentive and served a full meal and bar service on the 1h45 min flight. Seats are comfortable in there 2-2 arrangement and have a 47 inch seat pitch with great recline. The crew are definitely what makes Bangkok airways stand out, I had 2 attendants serving the business class cabin which was lightly loaded with just 3 pax. If a drink was almost empty or refreshments finished the crew were by your side preempting your needs.

### "among the best crews in the skies"
I love Bangkok Airways, but at both Bangkok and Samui the check in queues were horrendous. Staff had to constantly walk the queues with whiteboards showing flight numbers and pulling people from the queues to check them in for the flight shown on the board. A rather lengthy way to proceed, lots of fed up passengers at both airports. Flights are fine, still great food even on short hops and among the best crews in the skies.

### "friendly and efficient crew"
Very friendly and efficient crew in Bangkok Airways business class. The food was excellent (Thai food!) for this rather short flight (1hr 15mins) and the choice of drinks good. Duty free products with a lot of choice, and very different from other airlines. Check-in process in RGN just inefficient, because of the friendly staff at premium check-in counter who let all arrogant tourists (with Economy Ticket) check-in at the counter.

### "issue related to the delays"
Bangkok to Krabi, and this is our 5th Bangkok Airways flight in two weeks as we were connecting around Thailand and the second time it's delayed. The food is okay, noodles with chicken. The service attention is good. Our big issue was related to the delays, two out of five flights and they need to solve this.

### "well-dressed and communicative staff"
Bangkok Airways from Lampang to Bangkok in March 2016 on an ATR72 propeller. No queue at check-in with polite staff who promptly printed out tags. Generous luggage allowance of 20 kg provided as the ticket continued with one of their partners, Jet Airways, out of Thailand. Ticket very cheap, this domestic leg was valued about 45 USD. Bangkok Airways provides an open free lounge in the terminal with breakfast items. Inspiring, clean, and well serviced. Lot of staff to assist with food, garbage, WiFi, or whatever. Airport charming: left the gate to proceed in open, overshaded, electric trolley trains with space for 10-15 passengers at the time – just to drive us the 200 meter to the aircraft avoiding the sun. Onboard, clear announcements, professional, well-dressed and communicative staff who managed to provide a full meal service (pizza, fruits, drinks, coffee/tea) on this 90 minutes flight in a very small aircraft which was very clean despite a bit worn. Metal cutlery provided, refills as you wanted. Flexible seating. Before landing we were informed at which baggage belt our bags would arrive. This is a rare and useful detail. Bus waiting in BKK, and it took only 10 Minutes from entering the bus to embark into the BKK Terminal. Bangkok Airways staff were again available around the belt to ensure further guidance if needed. Well managed airline with beautiful signage, logos, and interesting marketing. The airlines appears faster than bigger airlines in looking up new routes where business opportunities are seen (eg. from DAD-BKK from May 2016). Amazing little “Boutique Airline” as their slogan say.

### "seat was comfortable"
Traveled with Bangkok Airways on their once daily flight between Vientiane and Bangkok. The aircraft was clean and the seat was comfortable for the one-hour flight. The crew were efficient but not as friendly as my previous flight with them. The meal, however, was really good and tasty for this short haul flight.

### "friendly and helpful"
This is a tale of two halves for a flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Ground staff at the check-in were quick and efficient. The ground staff at the gate are very poor and ended up shouting at passengers when it was their fault for not organising things. Flight left 45 minutes late. Inflight service was superb and the staff were able to serve a full meal and drinks on a flight less than an hour long. Staff were friendly and helpful. Seats are fairly standard but for a short flight there is adequate leg room and they are comfortable enough.

### "cancelled with no explanation"
Checked in on line with no problem. Get to the airport with plenty of time to spare to find the flight has been cancelled with no explanation as to why. Put on a Thai Airways later flight making our transfer in Bangkok too tight to be comfortable. We made it with minutes to spare with extra assistance from Bangkok ground staff. This made what should have been two simple flights with ample time in between very stressful and tiring. Staff at Luang Prabang were very helpful and did their best but I wouldn't book Bangkok Airways again.

### "each flight was delayed"
I wouldn't recommend this airline. We used them for 3 domestic flights from Bangkok to Koh Samui during our stay in Thailand as we only had 2 weeks so wanted to make the most of it. Each flight we had (6 in total as return flights) was delayed. Every single flight. Maximum of 2 hours, when you are on a short time scale that makes a huge difference. Food was awful. Staff were pleasant, not their fault.

### "hard working staff"
Male to Bangkok with Bangkok Airways, the flight was slightly late. Seats hard, overhead tvs. What makes this airline is the hard working staff who do drinks and food runs constantly. No meal choice and fish was slightly spicy but I liked that. They are generous with the gin! Asked about 1 way upgrade, but the cost 400USD per person is ridiculous as all you get is bigger seat. Business class was quiet and not surprising at that price!

### "good service throughout"
Bangkok to Male with Bangkok Airways, and good service throughout. Seats hard and tv screen from the ceiling, one movie shown. Very old fashioned and not much to do on a relatively long flight. Lots of water and drink runs throughout. Didn't bother with their free lounge at Bangkok as it's pretty basic.

### "we were very impressed"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai, and the first time we have flown with Bangkok Airways and we were very impressed. Check-in was fast and efficient and we really liked the Bangkok Airways lounge which is available to all passengers, a first for us from a low cost airline. The flight was on time, the aircraft clean and the leg room was amazingly generous (we are both tall and accustomed to being cramped and uncomfortable on flights with European low cost carriers, but not here). Cabin crew were pleasant and efficient. I didn't like the inflight snack very much (a kind of Thai take on a French bread pizza) but my husband had ordered a vegetarian meal and got a salad which was fine. Excellent service for the price.

### "fabulous little airline"
Bangkok Airways is a fabulous little airline. Our Phuket to Bangkok flight was delayed, but a lovely little lounge (online booking). Lots of legroom and unlimited tea and coffee, and snacks on this flight of a little over 1 hour. Good choices, served with a smile and a joy to fly with. Wish I could fly with Bangkok Airways more often.

### "disappointed with my flight"
Disappointed with my recent Bangkok Airways flight from Phnom Penh to Samui via Bangkok. Old A319 planes that was very dirty. They should have newer and cleaner planes for the price that was paid. They think they don't have to care as much because they are the only airline to fly between BKK and USM. Seat and tray table full of marks and dirty. Uncomfortable and my seat was also broken. Checked baggage also damaged somewhere between Phnom Penh and Koh Samui.

### "need to learn basic manners"
I found out myself 2.5 hours before our Bangkok Airways flight from Phuket to Utapao that it was cancelled. I promptly called their service line. I was then put on hold for 15 minutes while staff found out what was happening. I was then told we were going to be transferred to Bangkok instead and then take a bus to Pattaya. 1 hour later I received an email that the flight was cancelled (why that took so long who knows). I proceeded to Phuket airport and was told to go to their ticketing office. I stood there for 10 minutes before anyone even lifted their head. We were given 2 vouchers of 500B to use (even though I had spent well over 2000B extra to get a flight to Utapao). But the absolute worse customer service started when we arrived in Bangkok. We wanted to know exactly where we were going in Pattaya but not one of their staff would answer me (they actually responded to me with contempt, or would say to wait and then not come back to us). Then they were saying we had to now go to Utapao airport from Bangkok airport, as they were adamant that this was on their records. There was not one time when anyone asked me if I wanted to be transferred to Pattaya or Utapao. It wasn't until we raised our voices that they allowed us onto the bus for Pattaya (meanwhile the whole time treating us like we were a problem). We then sat on that bus for another 20 minutes. It wasn't until we got back out of the bus and asked why we were still waiting that we were told our driver was in the toilet. 10 minutes later that driver came back from inside the airport with a coffee in his hand! I paid extra money to get a direct flight to UTP, but I was very understanding of the cancelled flight. Then we were treated like we caused the problem and that we were being unreasonable. Their staff have disgusting attitudes and need to learn basic manners yet alone how to respond to customer's queries. I then contacted Bangkok Airways after our trip, they took two months to respond to my complaint and offered nothing in compensation.

### "in for a pleasant surprise"
My first time flying with Bangkok Airways and I was in for a pleasant surprise. The service was really friendly and efficient. Good food was served on this short hop from Bangkok to Vientiane. All requests were attended to promptly and with a smile. Overall, a very good experience.

### "aircraft was fairly old"
Mumbai to Siem Reap via Bangkok, and having previously flown with Bangkok Airways I was disappointed with the flights this time. The aircraft was fairly old and showed it's age. The FAs were friendly and functional. The seats were cramped with reduced leg room. One good thing is they seated transit passengers in the front of the plane to enable them to go through transit fast at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok. The catering was OK, washrooms clean. I understand planes age but a little cosmetic upgrade or maintenance improves their appearance and enhances the comfort. All the flights were on time.

### "Poor communication"
Bangkok Airways is terrible in terms of on time arrival for this route and getting worse. Last week 2 hours late. This week 1 hour and 25 minutes. It is only a one hour flight! Poor communication to passengers. They don't tell the whole story about the delays which means passengers can't work out alternative plans. Lots of airlines fly this route. I will use them in future and not use Bangkok Airways again.

### "service was polite but robotic"
Flew Bangkok Airways from Yangon to Luang Prabang via Bangkok. There wasn't anything particularly 'boutique' about Asia's boutique airline. All four flights were quite average, the 3 ATRs I flew on were all old and scruffy - windows were scratched, the exterior was dirty, and the interior was tired. Service was polite but robotic. As for the food, whilst acceptable, it's no where as innovative or unique as it used to be - with the exception of it being served on a tray, I failed to see what sets the meals apart from the airline's competitors, it was the standard fried noodle/fried rice dish, and all meals were very unexciting. All flights were late departing (between 10 and 40 minutes), but the return flight from LPQ to BKK was delayed one hour, meaning a hectic sprint through the BKK airport to catch our connecting flight to RGN. There were long distances to be covered, and although there was someone to accompany us the airline did not provide a buggy and instead we had to run the whole way - this may not have been possible for some passengers. Our bags didn't make it, and in RGN they do not deliver - meaning an extra trip out to the airport the next day. Decidedly average.

### "offered a tasty meal"
Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Siem Reap. What a treat! Bangkok Airways entertain lounges for all passengers at Bangkok airport which is nice. On the short-haul flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap (Cambodia) I almost fell asleep but was woken up by a flight attendant who offered me a tasty meal (cold rice noodles, veggies etc.) that I enjoyed on the remaining flight. This was on a 50 minutes flight. Quite impressed.

### "last 2 flights delayed"
Bangkok Airways has the only direct Hong Kong to Koh Samui flight. The service has got worse, my last 2 flights delayed for more than 3 hours each (for a 3 hour 20 minute flight). But there is no competition on the direct route so passengers will likely still be forced to use them.

### "quite new and clean"
Flew from Chiang Mai to Yangon return. We enjoyed the short flight using a small aircraft ATR of Bangkok Airways. Plenty of snacks, foods and beverages. Check-in process was excellent and the cabin looks quite new and clean. The seat was comfortable and have plenty of space. We enjoyed also Bangkok Airways lounge, even though we were economy passengers. There is a lounge for international route offered by Bangkok airways at Chiang Mai Airport after immigration clearence. There is no need to go to domestic lounge at Chiang Mai Airport - as it is far away from international gate.

### "it is outstanding"
Bangkok Airways is what an airline should be. Outstanding service, clean planes, and on-time flights make this an ideal airline. All customers get access to their club prior to departure. The crew smiled throughout the flight, and treat customers like guests. They even serve a meal on a 1 hour flight, and it was decent. It is outstanding.

### "cancelled without notice"
Our flight was scheduled at 3:30 pm and cancelled without notice! Rescheduled for 7:30 pm, delay till 9:20 pm, delay till 9:45 pm. This is the lousiest service I have experienced. They do not seem to care that we have a connecting flight in Bangkok for North America. Luckily it is tomorrow. Complementary coffee and cake cannot compensate this 6 hour plus wait. Note, we are still waiting to board our flight...

### "luggage not been loaded"
Started off well, enjoyed the lounge, and the Bangkok Airways inflight service was good, but arrived in Mandalay to be told our luggage (50% of passengers) had not been loaded due to a weight ration balance issue. They knew in Chiang Mai our luggage would not be loaded but didn't  inform us. Other passengers had been bumped throughout the day and then to arrive with no luggage is negligent and appalling service.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I was pleasantly surprised by Bangkok Airways. Given the relatively low seat price, and having never flown with Bangkok Airways before, it turned out to be a great airline to fly. The plane was almost full and yet boarding was fast and efficient. The crew was pleasant and there was even a good hot meal on the short flight. I'll probably choose Bangkok Airways again.

### "in the boarding bridge asleep"
For the most part I find Bangkok Airways to be a good regional airline. I have flown with them over 50 times in Thailand and around Asia. They provided good service, and run a professional organization. When compared to the other regional airlines in Thailand they are definitely the best. However on my most recent experience when walking down the boarding bridge to the airplane I noticed a Bangkok Airways ground crew sitting in the passenger boarding bridge asleep. I informed the employee standing at the entrance to the airplane that one of the staff was asleep in the passenger boarding bridge. She just laughed at me so I responded that it was not funny but something serious. On the same flight my luggage did not arrive. However the luggage report was handled well and the bag arrived the following morning.

### "overall a good airline"
Booked tickets from Bangkok to Chiang Mai return on Bangkok Airways website. Booking process was easy but my outbound flight was cancelled two weeks before the flight (perhaps due to low load). Rebooking process was bit confusing and the reservation office had no clue on the airport layout etc. The airport lounge at Bangkok was a good offer for a long transit. Basic food and drink were provided free of charge so was wifi. Boarding was bit chaotic but once onboard it was calm. A hot meal was served for a very short flight. Crew were friendly. Return journey CNX to BKK. Online check in was available and bag drop at CNX airport was very easy. Ground staff very friendly. Again the lounge before security was a good offer with very simple food and good wifi. Flight was easy and smooth. It was a bit while of wait for the luggage at the BKK airport though. Overall a good airline.

### "will use again"
Koh Samui is a leisure destination, the predominant target audience are families and couples. Singapore to Koh Samui is a short regional flight. Service is with an infectious smile and staff do their best to cater to anything you want. Especially children in business class are treated like royalty. Business class was empty and every time we take this flight, it’s just us. Business class is only 1.5 times (when we book through their website) the price of economy. Seats are typical regional business class seats, wider and more leg room. Configuration is 2-2-2. But not long haul lie flat seats. It is good enough as the seats are well maintained and clean. Lounge in Koh Samui is air-conditioned, has a small a la carte menu and various interesting “sugar art” items. Service is attentive. When arriving and departing Koh Samui, you are brought in a separate bus to the airplane that is parked on the tarmac (Koh Samui does not have airbridges). Flight timing is good taking standard hotel check-in and check-out time into account  No inflight entertainment, but flight is too short to watch a movie anyway. Have taken this flight several times. Once in a plane without business class though business class was booked, hence we were downgraded. Did get downgrade service in Singapore (i.e. lounge access and priority check-in), but on return flight it was only given after having a slightly emotional discussion with the ground crew. Lounge in Singapore is not interesting (skyview lounge). When boarding at Koh Samui, there’s quite a chaotic crowed queuing for economy. You’ll have to fight your way to the separate Business class entry lane. Better would be if the lounge staff would escort business class passengers through this crowd. Will use again when going Koh Samui.

### "with no explanation bumped"
Uneventful flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, but with no explanation bumped to a much later flight than the one I booked. Had to spend several hours in the dreary domestic part of Suvarnabhumi. The Bangkok Airways lounge was filled beyond capacity. Chairs less comfortable than the ones in public areas.

### "a great customer service"
Wonderful experience with Bangkok Airways. I was not used to receiving such a great customer service! Fantastic experience even on the ground. In fact even ecomomy class passengers can use a dedicated "lounge" with free hot drinks, soft drinks, snacks and free wi-fi as well. Staff are amazingly kind. The route was very short only 1hr. Nevertheless we were served a snack (kind of chicken wrap) with a choice of soft drinks and the or coffee. Cabin crew always smiling and helpful and constantly present in the cabin. The aircraft was a ATR 72. I think it was a new one because the cabin interior looked really new cleaned and immaculate. I'll fly with them again!

### "inflight service was good"
We flew Bangkok Airways from Chiang Mai to Trat via Bangkok. The first flight from CNX to BKK was delayed and since we had a 1.5 hour transfer in BKK we could miss the second flight to Trat. Bangkok Airways arranged another flight for us with Thai Smile so we could still get our flight to Trat. Only problem was that we had to collect our bagage at BKK and check it in again. They told us the people at BKK where informed so that shouldn't be a problem. So far so good. However when we arrived at BKK nobody was waiting at the gate. We went to baggage claim and asked a Thai Smile employee who told us to report to the Bangkok Airways ground staff. Bangkok Airways staff knew nothing. They didn't understand and the only thing they could tell us was to go to the Check in at departures. After asking for a third time and still getting the same answer (they didn't even warn the check in staff) we ran as fast as we could to departures. Just in time for check in (with only a few minutes to spare thanks to a very quiet check in) we dropped our bags off and went through the security check. We made it to the gate in time, but not due to the Bangkok Airways staff at BKK. They were totally not helpful and knew nothing. The rest of the flight was good, but be warned if you have a transfer in between! Very helpful staff at Chiang Mai for arranging another flight, and flight and inflight service was good. Delays and cancellations are common - terrible ground staff at BKK. Not a lot of transfer time on the CNX  DX route (last plane for TDX leaves at 17.00 from BKK)

### "every flight was late or cancelled"
Every flight was late or cancelled from each airport. Appalling reliability, punctuality and 600 baht for 5.5 hour delay. Regular passengers said if flight is not full, they just regularly cancel. However on the boards you will see on time. This is despite every flight having delays or cancellations. Really really poor. Don't rely on them and avoid at all costs if you have alternatives.

### "used to be brilliant"
Bangkok Airways used to be brilliant, but they are declining in service quality, particularly with respect to operations. Flight delayed 2 hrs to Nay Pyi Taw but they could not advise passengers in advance. And a further delay without explanation. Out of my last 10 flights with this airline I think 5 have been delayed.

### "cancelled due to haze from Indonesia"
Bangkok Airways cancelled all flights due to the smoke haze from Indonesia. Unfortunately the information at the airport and from call center was close to zero. Hundreds of people missed their connection flights, I have missed two and had to cancel my whole business trip. There was one flight between 6 and 10 pm but no explanation from the staff why there is no other flight or if there's any other flight.No announcements at the airport.

### "Bangkok Airways shame on you"
Bangkok Airways have gone from my favourite airline to one of my most loathed in one day. We arrive at the airline a few hours early. We try to check in and advise our flight is delayed by two hours due to the smoke haze from Indonesia. They then tell everyone flying that checkins are closed till 3pm, then cancel all flights. They don't put you up in a hotel but they will book one for you at a premium price. Taxi prices double and instead of helping people at the front counter ticket office they tell everyone to call the ticketing office - but you can't get through as the lines are overloaded. Bangkok Airways shame on you.

### "I enjoyed this flight"
Flew on PG964 from Singapore to Koh Samui on 02 Oct. Even though flight was delayed for 30mins due to late arrival of the aircraft, we arrived Samui on time. Seat was comfortable and legroom was adequate. The staff were friendly and helpful. However, the ticket was expensive. but its reasonable because Samui airport belongs to the airline. Overall, I enjoyed this flight.

### "flight attendant did an excellent job"
Flew on flight PG961 back home after 2 days vacation in Koh Samui. Again, flight was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. But the ground staff were helpful, responsible and handled the case well. There was a lounge for all Bangkok Airways passengers. The safety video was excellent, and the flight attendant did an excellent job serving our passengers.

### "other airlines far inferior"
I have not been able to fly Bangkok Airways for the last twelve months, but began again last month. It was a relief to be back with them, as the other airlines I had to use for 'budget reasons' were far inferior in all aspects of service, and ironically value for money. I will be flying with Bangkok Airways again at the end of this month.

### "service should have been better"
We were on our flight departing from Bangkok to Chang rai on Sep 29, everything was fine except the service wasn't very attentive. This was our second time with Bangkok Airways. The first time service was excellent but not this time. I asked cabin staff nicely if I could possibly change my seat since there were a lot empty at the aft. She said she would inform me when is okay for me to move but she never did or cares to assist me. The service should have been better since I considered Bangkok Airways is 5 star airline for the domestic.

### "we recommend them"
Bangkok Airways was excellent, we travelled from Bangkok to Samui as a family of two adults and two children. There are at least 10 flights per day for this destination, so we could choose the times we wished. All the families with children have priority boarding. The cabin crew was outstanding, helping and serving us. We ordered children meals and they also got toys to play during the flight. Adults get one hot meal also (only one type of meal available, if you do not order in front a specail meal). We recommend them.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We had a return flight to Koh Samui with Bangkok Airways. The staff were great and the service good. I was injured before returning to UK, the airline staff were helpful and made sure I was provided with a wheelchair, taken to check-in and boarding area. This made the journey back much easier.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We flew this route to/return and both times the plane was late for arrival to/take off from Luang Prabang. It appeared that such late arrivals are more routine than not. It should be pointed out that the service onboard both flights was excellent as was the food and drink quality.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
My daughter had travelled from UK to Thailand to visit her family. Arriving from Dubai into Bangkok, she was told that the connecting flight to Chiang Mai was delayed by one-hour, this then turned to 2-hours and eventually the flight took off almost five hours later than scheduled arriving in Chiang Mai at 3.00. By the time the passengers disembarked it was 3.35. Very little information was given, very little help was offered by the ground crew in Bangkok. The service was atrocious. I had planned the flights to coincide with a late family supper at home, this turned into a farce. Last week myself and my younger daughter travelled from India to BKK to receive the information that our connecting flight to Chiang Mai was delayed for one-hour. This is not good enough. I will not be using Bangkok Airlines again. 2 strikes and they are out!

Check in very quick with no queue. Business Class lounge I am eligible to use is recently renovated and very comfortable, lots of food (including hot food and light snack) and drinks. Onboard with friendly flight attendants, tasty hot snack served with juice and coffee/ tea. The aircraft looks a bit old, but the seat is new slimline version and give a decent seat pitch. Although it is not really comfortable ergonomic-wise, extra space provided is appreciated. Returning on PG-278, lounge in Phuket is too crowded and too warm, same aircraft as the outbound flight, light dinner is served and it is really enjoyable, both in taste and portion. Their staffs are good as always.

Bangkok Airways gets better. Staff are friendly and well trained. Airplanes although some are showing their age are well maintained. Food on every flight I take is fine with a good selection.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-BKK. A bit upset at the beginning as I arrive early and request a flight change denied by ground staff though I overheard that the flight is not full but that is understandable. Their recently renovated Boutique lounge (economy class lounge) at BKK airport is nice plenty of comfortable seats nice snacks and good Wifi connection for my long wait. Both flights were fine on refurbished A319 with shiny new cushion seat covered hot light supper/ tasty snack is served by nice attendant. Minus point is punctuality both flight delayed 20 and 30 minutes respectively.

Flew BKK-REP return a few weeks ago. I've done this journey once a year for three years now and have to say this year almost felt like a whole different airline. Last couple of years the journey has been "acceptable" but you did feel they were happily benefiting from a route with few competitors. This year it's like they've completely refreshed their service offering. Really impressed and for the first time I felt it really lived up to the idea of a "boutique" airline. Experience started at check-in in BKK - great ground crew and changing to an earlier flight was effortlessly carried out with a simple $20 surcharge. A Bangkok Airways branded bus took us out from the gate to the plane which turned out to be once on board one of their new ATR-72s - Immaculate and comfortable. Crew professional friendly the mini-meal was interesting and fun - a scaled down version of a long haul meal served on a tray with three courses - Cold but you can't have everything. Followed by a tea/coffee service. For a 55 minute flight! As it was the flight turned out to be 1 hr 45 mins long due to bad weather in Siem Reap so we circled for ages - Flight deck kept us informed throughout. Flight back again a great experience - asked at check in if they could check me through to my final destination since my connecting flight in BKK was on a code-share partner. The agent promptly and gracefully did even issued me boarding passes for all my return segments! Very grateful for this service. Plane was an older ATR-72 this time but interior well maintained and looked like it had a spring clean. Crew again professional and friendly and given it's a hour flight you couldn't ask for more. An excellent experience.

For me Bangkok Airways is still the best domestic Thai carrier. However they seem to be getting less reliable. Booked a return flight BKK-UTH-BKK. The flight from Bangkok to Udonthani was cancelled only days after booking it (the second time this happened to us in the past year). We called their customer service got our money back and rebooked with Thai Smile. This morning we arrived at the airport in Udonthani at 07.40am to find out that the 09.15am flight to Bangkok had been rescheduled to 8am about which they had neglected to inform us. Thankfully counter staff still allowed us on the flight. Aircraft was well maintained with friendly staff. A hot meal was included seats were OK but a little hard with enough leg room. Plane only 25% full smooth landing. Unfortunately because we were not informed of the change we had to buy new bus tickets at an extra cost. Will I fly with them again? Yes although I have become a little hesitant because of all their last minute changes.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-KBV-BKK with Bangkok Airways was largely a real pleasure. This airline is trying hard to be different in it's passenger service and it shows. Both flights on time spotlessly clean aircraft full 'meal' service (food nothing special) good seat pitch and largely smiling cabin crews. The only thing to let down the whole experience were the staff in the Lounge at Krabi airport. They were really unfriendly and unhelpful. No eye contact at all and responded rudely when asked a quick question about a smartphone boarding pass.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK to CNX. Uneventful short flight with excellent legroom better than Easyjet and Ryanair. Inflight meal and drinks (non-alcoholic) served free. Overhead in-flight entertainment available. Competitive prices still cheaper than Thai.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-PNH-BKK. Flights were on time. Crews were absolutely professional and courteous. What amazes me about this airline is that on a short 55 minute flight they still serve a full meal in coach. The seats pitch is excellent. Coach passengers have access to their Boutique lounge in both BKK and PNH. I can't recommend this airline highly enough!

22/3/2015 PG 269. 25/3/2015 PG266. 29/3/2015 PG 253. 3/4/2015 PG280. Myself and a friend travelled with this airline from Bangkok-Krabi-Koh Samui-Phuket-Bangkok in March/April. I am disabled and use a mobility scooter. I am very impressed with the service we received. All of the staff from office to ground to cabin crew went out of their way to help and support our journeys. I would highly recommend this airline.

Flew KUL to USM on 19th March rtn on the 26th March. Flights on time or early onboard clean and modern A319 aircraft. On arrival at USM (Samui) by bags didn't make the flight. I blame baggage handlers at KUL. Bags arrived that evening at hotel. Free snacks and drinks at gate/lounge on return from USM for all passengers - unbelievable in this age of cutbacks. Amazing that they still serve a hot meal on such short flights. Crew professional and friendly. Can't fault them.

NPG 914 from Bangkok on March 15th and flight PG 124 on March 25th. Travelled with an elderly relative. Cabin crew were excellent in assisting us and even got a chair lift at Samui Airport to assist getting off the plane safely and nothing was too much trouble. Staff are only too happy to help.

Flew USM-BKK with connection on Turkish to Germany via IST. Very good check in experience in Samui all Luggage checked thru. Staff very engaged ordered Wheelchair for my wife for whole trip because my wife had hurt her knee the day before. Staff always competent and friendly. Excellent onboard experience on A319 with full meal service on a 45min flight. Bangkok Airways is really unique in service.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Excellent service on both trips Bangkok to Krabi and return. Very efficient service which included a hot meal. Aircraft was clean and cabin staff efficient and friendly.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew BKK-REP-BKK-USM-SIN. BKK-REP on a spacious but very dirty airplane. Carpet and seats need to be changed. Food below average they try to impress with a tray service on the short flights. They did not offer any cold drinks at all (only tea and coffee at the end) although they had placed them on top of the cart. Instead they could just serve a small snack bag with a more efficient drink service. Return to BKK more pleasant although it was a full flight. BKK-USM full flight but the staff did a good job. Especially because of the cabin senior of the flight who was prompting his crew to offer drinks together with the meal tray. USM-SIN got impressed by the helpful check-in staff. She got us upgraded to J/C because we had a short connection in SIN but with another airline. Very friendly and helpful. Business class experience was ok but they really need to take an extra step especially regarding the aircraft' interiors/seats/IFE. Especially because they are overpriced. But they are taking advantage of the fact that they are one of the few options to fly from BKK. On the bright side they are mostly on time and most of the staff do their best to assist. I would try to avoid flying them again at least when BKK is involved in the trip. Too expensive for what they offer and Suvarnabhumi is a pretty chaotic airport. Would definitely try to avoid next time.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I flew from BKK (Bangkok) to REP (Siem Reap) on A320: 45 minutes flight. Access to the Bangkok Airways Lounge in BKK and REP even if you fly on Y class. 1st row seats confortable meals enough for a so short flight. Cabin Crew efficient and professional.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew Bangkok - Phuket - Bangkok as code share with another airline. The lounge at Bangkok was fine with free food and drinks comfortable seating and came as a pleasant surprise. Outbound flight was one hour late due to late departure from Cambodia but boarding was swift and the aircraft which had been on the ground for only 30 minutes or so was spotless. Meal supplied was spicy noodles with chicken and it was very good. Return from Phuket was spot on time and boarding was OK. Meal served again surprising how the cabin crew can manage to service a full plane in such a short time. Seats on both planes were OK with acceptable legroom. Cabin crew were excellent and food quality good. Perhaps the management of Bangkok Airways could be persuaded to work their magic on some European low cost airlines? Would definitely recommend this airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew from Bangkok to Phuket on 25/1 and returned on 2/2. Both flights were late departing. Whilst inflight service is good the punctuality is not good.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Our 5th flight with them this year. A great airline flight allways on time. We flew yesterday from Bangkok to Chaing Mai. A320 was very spacious even more so than a 777-300 we had flew on a few hours before. Staff were very pleasant. The flight was only 55 minutes but we got a full meal and 3 lots of drinks.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
RGN/BKK. Really efficient check-in I had checked in online the night before so as to chose seats but our boarding cards were waiting for us-all three sets including EK sectors from BKK to DXB and onwards to BHX. Easy boarding and on time push back-excellent snack of sticky rice with prawns washed down with a French Chardonnay. Decent legroom on a modern A320good in cabin service typical of the high standard of this airline which will be our first choice on this route in the future.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM on ATR and A319 great service even 1 hour flight even a ATR we offered hot meal. Staff were eager to please. USM airport was great tropical atmosphere and they offer complimentary sandwiches and drinks coffee while you are waiting your flight. A great airline to fly with.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-HKT AB 320. Options out of BKK for domestic flights are limited and this was one of the few options available. The fare was approx. 2x that of a flight from DMK. I was on a full fare and for that I had the forced obligation of a kiosk check-in. The equipment malfunctioned and I was forced to go and line up at another kiosk. Then it took approx. 15 minutes to work through the slow system which took ages to load and process. After this experience I then lined up at the baggage drop. 20 minutes later I finally was able to speak to someone to see if I could take an earlier flight. Even Air Asia and Nok provide a faster and more efficient check-in service than does Bangkok Airways. After this negative experience I went to the crowded lounge. Nothing spectacular. I was more comfortable out of the lounge and waiting at the gate. Bangkok Airways provided a chaotic boarding experience to a crowded bus for the ride to its airplane. Onboard it was a full flight with the usual non enforcement of carry on bags. Uneventful flight with late arrival and the usual slow baggage delivery at HKT. Seat comfort was adequate but not as good as Nok. Bangkok Airways has tried to position itself as a full service airline but the reality is that the claim is just marketing fluff. It doesn't really offer anything special except fares considerably more expensive than its competitors.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We flew from Singapore to Koh Samui with Bangkok Airways. After flying with Etihad they were a breath of fresh air. They were cheerful professional and happy to give us a second drink promptly. The terminal at Koh Samui was excellent as they provided tea/coffee/juice and snacks. Would definitely fly again with this airline.

PG937 from Bangkok to Phnom Penh. Thursday 27th November 2014. 9pm. Flight was 45 minutes late. Interior and seat of plane was dirty. Black marks on windows tatty plastic. They took us by bus from gate to plane. The staff did their best but had little information.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK to RGN to BKK: A great choice to fly to Yangon Myanmar with. Their tickets price is cheaper than TG and I am very impressed with their service. Check in has no fuss people with the airline gold card and internet checked in passengers can go to a faster lane. This is especially handy to know for Yangon airport where the check in queues can be quiet long and easily take 30 mins or more. Aircraft is clean in excellent condition and one class only crew are charming and helpful. For a short flight little more than an hour free meals were offered and taste quite good too with metal cutlery not those cheap plastic ones. All in all I am very impressed with Bangkok airways will not hesitate to chose them again for flying to other AESAN countries via Bangkok.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
CNX-BKK-KMV. As per other reviews this is a great airline. We were surprised about the lounge with free wifi food and drinks! And then to have a meal served on both flights was really good. The service was excellent and no queue at check-in. Other low cost airlines should take note.

KLIA - USM 4th November - one thing I can say about Bangkok Airways is they are consistently good. Last travelled with them 7 years ago and they now have newer aircraft. Service excellent for economy. Got a hot meal on a 70 minute flight and flight was early - a great start to holiday. Look forward to travelling with them again on Sunday back to KL on route back to Heathrow.

10 October BKK-UTH on A320. Full flight. Crew professional. How they manage to serve a full flight with the meal and beverages in 50 minutes and also tidy everything up is really amazing and all for 1040THB (approx. 20GBP).

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I fly Bangkok Airways frequently between Chiang Mai and Bangkok and back. I have always been impressed by this airline's service and attention to detail. BKK Air's lounges both in CNX and BKK are being renovated and they have immediately set up temporary make-shift lounges at both airports. Moreover the airline is the only one that I know of that offers snacks tea/coffee/water - pretty good coffee ample seating Internet. WiFi to its economy class passengers. A special commendation on their website: on clicking 'seat selection' a seating chart shows up on which the last three rows after which come the toilets are clearly marked BY Bangkok Air as 'undesirable'. This passenger can only marvel at the honesty shown here!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Ground service from Phuket to Bangkok far exceeded my expectations. Due to unforeseen events I had to cut short my holiday in Phuket. My connecting flights (Phuket-Bangkok via Bangkok Airways and then onwards via a different airline) had a very tight window of 1 hour and 5 minutes. This was a fault on my part but the staff went out of their way to make sure that I would make it on time. I was given a seat in Row 1D to be able to disembark first - upon disembarking a special car was waiting to take me to the terminal building right away and a very efficient lady escorted me to the other airline's counter negotiated with them and directed me to immigration. I've received far worse service from airlines who charge more than Bangkok Airways did for a domestic flight. The help I received from their crew was a huge relief during that stressful sleepless night. I have nothing but praise for this airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Comfortable round-trip flight Bangkok-Bombay-Bangkok. Basically everything fine except that on both the outbound and inbound flights cabin crew suspended the after-meal coffee/tea service due as they said to turbulence. On both occasions this passenger who has been travelling on planes for 40-odd years did not feel any turbulence and the seat-belt signs did not go on. I can only conclude that the cabin crew decided to just take it easy.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Koh Samui on August 12 2014 and return on August 19 2014. Online check in okay. Both flights excellent on time friendly staff clean plane. Staff managed to serve full breakfast (on outbound flight) and dinner (on inbound flight) on this 70 minute flights. Seats are a bit tight for non Asians but not a real problem given the short duration.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
PG937 BKK-PNH. Remarkably great service from start to finish given it was a 58-min flight from BKK to PNH. No line up at check in at BKK airport and very friendly staff behind the counter. On board a full hot heal with choice of soft drinks wine or beer. Clean aircraft. Flight 40 mins late departing it happens. Bags took a long time at PNH as an OZ flight from Korea shared the baggage arrival belt and most passengers were in a line up getting visas on arrival so there was no place for bags from the following flight (i.e mine) on the belt. Otherwise very pleased with Bangkok Airways. Puts American and Canadian carriers on short haul flights to shame especially since my round-trip ticket BKK-PHN-BKK was just over US$200. Great value!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I would like to commend Bangkok Airways for their excellent customer service during our recent trip from Utapao to Phuket and return. My broken ankle meant I was traveling with a wheelchair and crutches so I was somewhat anxious about the trip. The Bangkok Airways staff at both airports were so helpful and did everything they could to assist my access through the airports and make boarding and exiting the plane as hassle-free and easy as it could be. The cabin crew were also very kind. I notified the airline a couple of weeks before traveling and would recommend that you do this to discuss if you have any mobility issues.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
A short flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap and back a few days later. My first time on this budget airline and it was a great experience starting from the free online seat selection and check-in free checked baggage quick check-in at both airports clean airplane and can you believe they served food on a 40 minute flight. Staff lovely! (Other budget airlines should note this is how it is done). Wonderful and planning my next trip with Bangkok Airways.

Chiang Mai to Koh Smaui on 31 March and Koh Samui to Bangkok on 7 June. How do they do it - dedicated lounge with free snacks in flight food (acceptable rather than great) on time first class staff good leg room despite the first flight being half full and the second even less? Highly recommended.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-BKK in Economy. I have been using Bangkok Airways for over 20 years and I am always pleased with their service. Even though this is a short flight (50-60mins) they always serve a cold meal with drinks despite the fact that economy passengers have their own designated lounge in the departure area where you can help yourself free of charge to savouries popcorn and hot and cold drinks before boarding. Their aircraft's are clean and tidy and the crew friendly. I have only once encountered a delay.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I flew BKK-CNX late yesterday-evening at the end of a 30-hour journey a tired and jet-lagged elderly-passenger with a cane and 3 heavy carry-ons (needs must sometimes) and was very impressed with the exemplary-service from all PG's staff and cabin-crew. They went far beyond normal expectations helping me at check-in boarding and disembarking they even had someone at the belt to assist me in grabbing my hold-luggage at journey's end (when the crew were ending their working-day for a layover). I'd recommend them.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. At check in the staff asked if I have any connecting flight at BKK I told him that I have one to Singapore with another airline. He requested for the e-ticket and after checking informed me that my lay over time is about 80 mins and I have to collect my baggage at BKK airport and then check in again for the SG bound flight. In addition he made me sign an indemnity form stating that the Bangkok Air will not be responsible if I am unable to connect to my next flight. I bought the tickets fully aware of the risk of the short layover. While waiting at the boarding gate an airline staff approach my wife and I asked for our boarding passes then exchanged them with another set for 1st row seats so that we could disembark faster at BKK. We were really grateful for their thoughtfulness. Though it was a short 1-hr flight full inflight meals were provided. The safety video was awesomely done with a catchy song and dance number at the beginning and end to draw your attention. The flight arrived BKK about 10 min ahead of schedule and as we disembarked we were again approached by a staff with a piece of paper written on it our connecting flight number. We acknowledged that the flight number was correct and she replied "The check-in counter is E1". I was blown away by their excellent service. They do not have to go through such lengths but they did. They made my day and I will definitely flying with them again.

BKK-HKT-BKK (PG924/PG909). Check-in professional. Free food and drink in superb boutique lounge. Cabin very nice and clean. Seat comfortable though no pillow and blanket offered. The only bad point was PG cabin crew spent a few mins to preach to me in front of many passengers why no coffee or cream was available on the flight.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Krabi to BKK. Easy booking great service including nice meal with hot and cold drinks and hot wipes for a short hop. Prices are in comparison with Thai but the bonus is they fly in/out of Suvarnabhumi. The 'boutique' aspect is overplayed but they do give passengers access to their own lounges serving soft drinks snacks and free wifi. They no longer supply beer for purchase on domestic flights. Recommended.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-HKT. Fantastic service and very good value. Lounge access for all is a very nice touch and the food was great for such a short flight. Plane spotlessly clean on time departure and early arrival. Very highly recommended.

Used Bangkok airways for recent flights to Chiang Mai and that they fly from Suvarnabhumi airport. Easy check in and nice use of the lounge for all passengers. Flight delayed around 30 minutes and after 15 mins of the flight we returned to Bangkok for technical issues. After an hour we took off again for Chiang Mai. From CMX TO BKK again ease of checking and nice lounge access. Flight delayed around 60 minutes not sure if they have regular delays or was just my experience.

BKK-SEM-BKK. I always like this airline and is still as good. Online check-in easy and lounge at BKK and surprised to fine one at Siam Reap too - both a big bonus as for all pax. Very short flight (45 mins) but meal boxes and tea/coffee done despite busy a/c by the usual friendly crews. They are always my first choice round the Far East and I wish other carriers there and in Europe were as good!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
This is a great airline for hopping around Asia. I made several trips (via BKK). I found there to be a great consistency of service on all flights. Some of their planes are a bit older than others (our flight to Siem Reap was a turbo prop) and slightly more uncomfortable. Inflight service was of a very high standard. Very friendly crew and adequate food for each flight. Two very positive points:1 If you join their frequent flyer program you get an extra 10kg baggage allowance. 2 They have a lounge for all passengers at BKK. They have snacks soft drinks and free wifi. I'd definitely recommend them.

PG 709/710 Bangkok - Mandalay return. Aircraft is an ageing A319 wet leased from Bulgaria Air with Bulgarian crews and Thai supervisors. Outgoing flight very nice with usual PG service standard smiling and helpful ground staff lounge access good seat pitch tasty and decent food–hot lunch with drinks beer and wine included. Bulgarian crews are superb and perform service by PG’s protocol. Returning flight was interesting. Nobody could check in online for this route. Upon arrival at the airport we found our boarding pass pre-printed seat randomly assigned no change allowed because the equipment at airport could not support PG’s system yet. They need to print it out somewhere in advance. Long wait as agent had to find our boarding pass from the pile one by one luggage tag is hand written. After that we were told that they do not have lounge here so we are given a voucher for a set of light snack (sandwich of your choice and hot/cold beverage) at a nice cafe. Other than that a fine experience.

BKK-Krabi. This is like an airline stuck in the 80's. Airplane was old. Far too many onboard announcements for a flight of just one hour. Yes they do serve you a meal but it's inedible. Much prefer the simple offering on Thai. Bangkok Airways really needs to move with the times. On a positive crew were smiling but otherwise quite robotic.

Flew BKK-USM-BKK in Jan 2014. While I do find their prices a bit on the expensive side Bangkok Airways is a really nice airline to fly with.

It reminded us of the better European carriers 15 years ago.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew to and from Luang Prabang on 14 and 17 November. Check in at BKK professional. Aircraft an ATR 72: embarking/disembarking only via the aft door: first in last out. When embarking we saw our suitcase (one for the two of us as we were only to spend 3 nights in Luang Prabang) under the a/c to be loaded. Inflight service was good: a full meal and extensive wine-and coffee service. Seat comfort not so good: when the person in front of you reclines the seat impossible to put your tray table down. Very little legroom especially for the taller non- Asian pax. Upon arrival it turned out that 7 suitcases (including ours) had been offloaded again in BKK due to weight and balance problems. Ground staff were quite helpful and apologised and after some arguing from our side offered a compensation to buy some toiletries. Suitcase arrived almost 24 hrs later on Laos Airlines. Check in at LPQ was a bit chaotic. Had to stand in line (3 people in front of us) for almost 20 minutes. Only one counter open 2 hrs before departure. No idea why it took so long to check in 3 pax and why they didn't open a 2nd counter. We had pre-assigned seats 4A and 4C but as some VIP's were on board they were given our seats and we were seated on the last row. Not too pleased. All in all: inflight service good and professional for a short 2 hour flight. But offloading suitcases in order to take freight is unacceptable.

Return trip BKK to CNX. Both flight an hour late CNX to BKK nearly 1.5 hrs. Bussed around both airports this is not a premium service they claim. Previous flights with them have been much the sane. Fly Air Asia and save money for the same service.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We have just taken 2 domestic and one international flight with Bangkok Airways and are beginning to wonder what it takes to get from a 4 star to 5 star airline. Flying economy they charge very reasonable prices give you access to their own lounge a full meal even on short flights and crew who are delightful and extremely attentive. Having flown on airlines around the world there are many European an N. American airlines which could learn from them. Granted they may not have brand new planes (rumoured to come from Air Berlin) but they are not bad. All in all a great experience to be thoroughly recommended.

Flew HKG-USM and USM-SIN. The planes didn't look great but the food and staff were superb. Full meal on a 1h 30min flight really means something. Very nice check-in process everything on time. Koh Samui airport operated by Bangkok Airways is also great. No rush great design free food and drinks. Not a single reason to complain.

Bangkok - Samui - Bangkok in August in a large group. Check-in at Bangkok was fairly smooth with a group check-in area. Flight was on time with efficient good service from the cabin crew. Unfortunately on the return flight we ran into issues with the Samui ground crew. There is no group check-in but we were staying at the Four Seasons which allows guests to check in at the web counter. One look at our large group and the ground staff rudely told us to get in the long economy line. It wasn't until I as a foreigner asked them in English regarding the check-in for our hotel that they admitted we were allowed to check in where we were. Meanwhile two check-in staff were idle as there was no one else in line behind us and we had wasted 10 minutes arguing. Actual flight was good though aircraft was a bit old with scoring on the windows. Unfortunately the argument with the gruff ground staff in Samui left us with a very bad impression of the trip and we'll make efforts to fly TG whenever available going forward.

BKK-Phuket. Checked in online and went straight to bag drop counter with no queue. Request seat change to emergency exit and got it with smile. My luggage was oversized and did not fit their normal carousel they try to assist me as best as they can and even dispatched a porter from the Business class desk to make sure I got everything right at oversize luggage delivery hall. Lounge and snack good as always. Nice service on board with professional crew light cold cut served with juice or soft drink. On time departure and arrival the only negative is the aircraft which most of their fleet will be in serious need of retrofit or complete renovation very soon.

Definitely our preferred carrier within Thailand!

Repeatedly thanked for flying them and they did a great job. Served a full meal on each flight (45 min) which was impressive- even asked for red or white wine on LPQ-BKK sector. Where the airline gets minus points is the ground staff. Flight delayed 1 hour in LPQ- no announcement or explanation with 70 pax milling around in a small airport. On arrival into BKK to make tight connection to USM staff met pax at airplane door then said "Go to gait 3A" and disappeared. No info on where to go what to do in a large busy airport.

PG 746 DAC-BKK 26 MAY. PG 745 BKK-DAC 04 JUN. Flew with them last month. Aircraft was clean staff very friendly and food quite good. Will definitely fly with them again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
PG 274 12 July. Since Thai Airways delayed they changed our flight to be on time in BKK for connecting flight. Windows of aircraft very bad due to cleaning and polishing. Staff performance is very good Food was good. We would use this airline again.

I booked an award ticket BKK-PNH in business class. Very fast check in and fast track security and passport control. Blue Ribbon lounge in BKK offers different drinks and wine cold snacks and some hot food. Possibility to shower. On board there's no real business class. Bangkok Airways created Premiere Class on this route. That means the seats are the same as in economy but the middle seat serves as a small table. Very good food on this short flight. Easy immigration and luggage came fast. Conclusion: very good service. But their economy product is so good that it's difficult to beat it at a reasonable price. I would never pay for this ticket!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Koh Samui - Siem Reap - Bangkok. All flights on time and bags delivered quickly. Excellent cabin service and more than palatable snacks. Overall a great little airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I have flown many times with Bangkok Airways from Dhaka to Bangkok and Bangkok to other Thai cities. For the most part I enjoy the service i.e. friendly staff clean and well maintained aircraft food OK. However the legroom is not all that great and the on-board entertainment is woeful. Since I first started flying with Bangkok Airways back in late 2011 their prices have increased considerably such that the cost of a return ticket Dhaka to Bangkok is only slightly less than Thai Airways but with no Business Class far worse flight times and crap on- board entertainment. Their so-called 'lounges in Bangkok and Phuket are also not worth bothering with. The food is pretty ordinary the coffee bad no alcohol and quite dirty (e.g. stains all over the lounge chairs and carpet). Hence I have recently switched to Thai Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I flew Chiang Mai-Bangkok return and had just had a shoulder operation. They were very attentive. They approached me to give me first boarding and put me in a row with no other passengers. They then offered me a wheelchair in Bangkok though I didn't need it. I was very touched by their attention.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-BKK. Flights left on time. Service very good. Lounges appreciated even for economy pax. Meal served on Samui flight not that good but this is according to individual taste. The return flight meal was the best I had on my trip even compared to the long haul flights I had - excellent! The airport at Samui is great and a new departure lounge is also very good. The service onboard was excellent and to be commended.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-PNH-BKK. Outbound 04/06/2013 on PG 931 on a relatively newish A319. Flight took off with a 30 minutes delay no explanation no apology given. Cheerful and friendly crew. Very tasty breakfast. Uneventful flight landed after 50 mins. Return 06/06/2013 on PG 934 on an old A320. On-time departure. Nice crew responding quickly to any type of requests. Fish served for lunch. Landed on schedule.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew Phuket - Bangkok last week on A320. Very colourful airplane with an older interior but still clean. Seats are a lot more comfortable than newer style. Travelling a lot you appreciate a seat like this! Inflight entertainment was on overhead screens. Such a short flight they still had a full meal service. Upgraded to exit row without knowing an added bonus! Would travel again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew from Bangkok to Chiang Mai on May 26 201. Flight PG215 and back to Bangkok on May 28 2013 flight PG226. We liked: Flights operate at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Check-in online / seat selection. Innovative lounges with WiFi for all passengers. Comfortable seat. Reasonable ticket price. We disliked: Cold staff - ranging from passenger service agents to cabin crew and purser! No meal selection. Bad quality food was served onboard. Poor in-flight entertainment - only airline's magazine. Cabin crew didn't response for passenger's call. Overall ground and in- flight services very underwhelming compared to Thai Airways. We were told the lounge was crowded. So we had to wait for almost half an hour. Could be a long wait for lounge service if the airline operates more flights? 3.5 stars awarded despite disappointments as some very good points.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Took round trip flight Koh Samui - Singapore. Very friendly service and smooth flight both ways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK to Siem Reap. A good service from onboard crew small snack and soft drinks offered. Whilst I used to recommend this airline they have become unacceptably expensive particularly where they have the monopoly of flights. I will try alternative and much cheaper options in future where available.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
HKT-USM ATR 72 HS-PGK. Short flight 40 min. Plane was empty. Good seats as plane was empty had a row for myself. FA very professional. Food good as was cake and sandwich great on such a short flight. Captain kept us informed during some moderate turbulence. No IFE but not needed for such a short flight. Overall very satisfied and looking forward using them again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We were given notice by email that our flights were being switched and therefore we would miss our connecting flight to Cambodia and get in a lot later than we had planned for. In the email we were told as a result we were being offered business class options. This in fact was not the case upon arrival to our connecting flight. I expressed my disappointment to Bangkok Airways. Long story short we had a 12 hour layover to our 15 hour flight back home. Initially Bangkok Airways had arranged for us to take advantage of the airport lounge at the Hong Kong Airport but to our surprise when we landed we were greeted by a nice gentleman who actually took us to the airport hotel. We were able to get a good night's rest instead of having to spend 12 hours at the airport before our 15 hour direct flight. We were also given a breakfast voucher. Overall we were very satisfied with how Bangkok Airways resolved this matter for us which started out as an inconvenience. The only other criticism I may have of the airline is that their light meals are not very good or appetizing. May times we did not eat our meal because it contained processed looking lunch meat. Other than that the flights are clean and the customer service with access to the lounge at the airports is a nice touch.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Several hours delayed from Samui to Bangkok. Delay announced only after check in had elapsed. We believe they delayed us because flight wasn't full and they want to save fuel at passenger expense.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Samui return. Always impressed with service. Outgoing flight - quick check in lounge with plenty of snacks drinks and comfortable seats. Aircraft is the Ex-Batavia air with poor seat pitch no entertainment screen but clean and well maintained delicious light breakfast served by friendly crew. Return flight horrible with very long check in queue. Notify Ground staff that we have done internet check in and they open a new counter for us to drop our bags. The flight operated with new international configuration A319 and was very comfortable. Cabin crew reassign our seat to emergency exit one which offer even better comfort. Good quality light dinner served. Baggage delivered in reasonable time.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Myself and my Wife were booked from Koh Samui- Bangkok on 31st March. We were to take AI-331 from BKK-Mumbai on same day. Due to technical reasons the PG-146 was delayed by over 3 hours. On arrival at BKK we were met by a Bangkok Airways representative who took us by car to the terminal to try to reach in time for the AI flight. However the AI counter was closed by the time we reached it. However Bangkok Airways could arrange for us to get seats (flight was full so we had to wait till the counter closed) on PG-733 to Mumbai. All the time the Bangkok Airways representative was with us. We appreciate all the help given to us by Bangkok Airway ground staff at Bangkok and have no hesitation in recommending the airline in spite of delayed flight from Koh-Samui.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM and UTP-USM on a recent holiday in April. Both flight were very good we have used PG many times and will continue to do so. We were connecting on a flight from China to USM through Bangkok and were very late as our arriving flight was delayed (on another carrier) the check in staff were helpful and we made the flight with 2 Minutes to spare.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
HKT-USM. Quick check in was able to use their lounge in the Phuket airport it was nothing flash a few chairs and tables drinks cookies and free wifi but still unexpected and very welcomed. Short 45 min hop in an ATR 72 turboprop. Airplane looked a little dated but clean. Good communication from the pilots cabin crew friendly and very efficient. A food box was served which to my surprise contained a full meal which was very tasty. Smooth ride all the way and on time arrival. This airline exceeded my expectation would definitely fly with them again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-Samui expensive as they have the monopoly on the route. Flight was comfortable I had great legroom and slept the entire flight didn't even eat the snack provided although my friend said it was great. Overall great.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Have flown many times with them and always found the service very good. Food very good for the short 50 minute flight to Samui. The lounges at BKK and USM are also a very nice feature. The only downside is the virtual monopoly they have on certain routes and hence the high fares.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Have been travelling Bangkok Airways for the last 10 years. First time we needed assistance for a family member. Staff were efficient courteous and took all the stress out of travelling so much so am already planning next years holiday and problems with mobility are no longer a problem. Has given my mother confidence to be able to continue travelling long haul. Travelled on 18th Feb PG 169 Bangkok - Koh Samui and returned 28th Feb 952 28th Feb to get connecting flight to London. Loved the free refreshments in both Bangkok and Samui and it is a shame that other airlines globally do not give passengers this treat.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Four flights BKK-PKT-BKK-PNH REP-BKK. Took 4 flights in as many days. Check in was fine no queues staff overall were robotic very few smiles. Food was not good at all. Cold rice and a cold sausage served twice - inedible. Flights were on time got our bags there in one piece. Never used the lounges as were tight connections am sure its an added bonus. Overall not boutique more budget airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-REP REP-BKK. Last month my wife and I traveled on this airline for the first time for our travel to and from Siem Reap. All the personnel of this airline we came in contact with were friendly and very efficient. Our flight to REP left and arrived on time. During this short flight (50 minutes) the efficient flight attendants served a tasty box lunch as well as 2 beverage services. There was also a short video about the airline that was very well done. On our return trip we experienced the same great service as well as the same clean and well-appointed aircraft interiors. We both remarked how well this airline treats the passengers and bemoaned that it was pity that most US based carriers can't or will not give this level of service on any but the longest of cross continent flights. We both will be Bangkok Airways patrons again as soon as we are back in the area!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Koh Samui - Phuket. Overall the airline offered excellent service meals onboard very short flights and value for money. The planes were clean and newish the food tasted good and was plentiful and the staff were friendly and efficient. They have a lounge for all passengers at Bangkok a Boutique Airline and it certainly lives up to this title. Would certainly recommend this airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok to Phuket in economy. Service was decent but planes old with poor seating. Meals and drinks were of a low standard and just barely edible. Lounges in both airports a welcome respite away from the busy terminals but quite crowded themselves. Would probably fly with Thai next time for the better seating comfort and meals.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Samui-Bangkok. They have a monopoly on this route hence the expensive fares. Flights delayed both ways return flight over 3 hours. Staff professional but stressed out. Check-in in Samui absolute mayhem but I believe it because that the first week of January is high season. Positives as everyone points out is the lounge access and Samui airport which is fantastic.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Siem Reap: Despite my early arrival from LHR check-in refused to let me on first flight available (except with 100 US$ fine). Took last flight ATR delayed 1 hour 15 min. Ground staff extremely prepared to deal with delays. Plane old. On the way back Siem Reap-Bangkok A320 good flight attendants. Did not see any 'boutique' just marketing and expensive tickets.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
CNX-BKK. My preferred carrier on this route as I like to be able to relax in the lounge. 10.15 flight. Flight on time and busier than usual. PG has been playing around with meal services and they have this one all wrong for the time of day. They served up a salad consisting if a slice of chicken and smoked fish with coleslaw. There was a rather tasty cake with it as well as the standard PG offering of coffee juice and water. Given that most people were westerners who probably had tucked into a hotel buffet earlier or had breakfast in the lounge most trays around me were returned almost untouched. Something like a muffin would have been adequate.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew 4 segments (Siem Reap - Bangkok Bangkok - Yangon Yangon - Bangkok and Bangkok - Phnom Penh) with this so-called boutique airline and we were sorely disappointed. All 4 flights were late. I can see why they are late because they obsess over checked luggage being 3 pounds over and then make you re-pack and carry one of your formerly checked bags. It certainly delayed everyone else in line. The next flight we were chastised because we had an extra carry-on which of course the other agent made us use. Finally and most egregiously - on the last flight we had been booked with a supposedly legal one hour connection in Bangkok. Of course the in-bound flight was 55 minutes late but we were met at the gate by an employee who was there to 'help' us. Her help was to start running a quarter mile or so through the airport with no assistance with our carry-ons and no electric cart. My wife and I are in our 60's. We finally got to the gate and in fact got on the plane - the only good thing about this story - and then waited another half hour for other delayed passengers from another late Bangkok flight. We had this experience during a SE Asia trip that included twenty different flight segments with a multitude of airlines - all of which were better than "Asia's Boutique Airline. - Never again!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Trat return. Worn out seats sometimes not possible to move up to upright position. Great service with alright snacks served during the very short flight. As a bonus a very small airport in Trat!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
LPQ-BKK. Flight operated with an ATR 72. Good plane although the cabin was not exactly modern and the back of the aircraft is extremely noisy. Staff were relatively present although the service was far from perfect. After a late departure (40 minutes delay without explanation) and a 20-minute flight we had to go back to LPQ because of a missing passenger whose luggage was in the plane. In the end 2-hour delay and very unprofessional move from Bangkok Airways. Not Recommended.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Phuket-Bangkok. Both flights were delayed. Both aircraft's were worn and dirty. The quality of this so called Boutique airline has gone down in recent years. The Bangkok lounge was overcrowded and the lounge in Phuket was closed. The meals onboard were actually quite bad. What used to be a boutique airline is now just an airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Another Bangkok- Koh Samui return trip. Good service all around quick check in good lounge with nice snack. ATR 72 aircraft for outgoing flight is really worn out and cramped but FA make up for it. A small surprise souvenir in the seat pocket - key ring from Sony inflight snack tasty. Return flight on International configuration A319 as it is a part of Hong Kong - Koh Samui - Bangkok. New aircraft comfortable seat with best seat pitch comparing to their other aircraft. Both flights punctual.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We flew several legs on Bangkok Airways during our trip to Thailand and Laos in mid Nov. Bangkok-Luang Prabang Chiang Mai - Koh Samui Koh Samui - Bangkok. On every flight I was struck at the warmth and efficiency of the small onboard crew. A hot tasty meal and a dessert was served. Alcoholic drinks offered free on the international segment to Luang Prabang. Overall excellent service and well worth the price. The best thing however is the on-ground service. Check in was fast and efficient. They allowed us to take an earlier flight from Samui to BKK even though that flight was priced much higher than our later flight. The boutique lounges available at all airports are excellent. Great mini buffet and non-alcoholic drinks. Its nice that all passengers have access to their lounges. Overall we were very pleased with this airline and although you do pay more - you do get full value for your money.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
My husband and I flew in November 2012 from Bangkok to Phnom Penh then from Siem Reap back to Bangkok - Chiang Mai - Bangkok. Both highly impressed with the service and the price! Will definitely fly them again!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I travel regularly with this airline Bangkok-Phnom return. The service is always excellent and the staff are invariably most helpful. The lounges at both airports even for economy class passengers are an added bonus.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Koh Samui-BKK - C Class. Great check in even a business lounge in such a small little airport. Great staff on board. Young but experienced. Will try them again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
My son and I flew from BKK-USM-BKK this past summer 2012. We arrived BKK earlier than expected from DXB and the agent moved us up to an earlier connecting flight at no additional charge. We have also used Bangkok Airlines from BKK to Cambodia and return a few times BKK in and out of Myanmar and also on to Maldives. We can't say enough of their professional service. The staff both in-flight and on the ground couldn't be nicer. The aircraft were clean and the food great where applicable. I'm sure we will use them again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew with my family on PG 242 from Chiang Mai to Koh Samui. Check in at CNX was very efficient and was done in less than 10 minutes. Bangkok Airways also have a small but very good lounge in CNX for economy class passengers which has snacks drinks and free wi-fi. 10 minutes before boarding 2 members of staff came around stamping boarding passes and boarding was also done in zones which I find quicker. Settled into our seats and discovered we were on one of PG's older planes but despite this the plane was in excellent condition. 30 minutes after departure the cabin crew came around with hot meals on this flight Chicken Noodles were served cold drinks tea and coffee were also served and beer was sold. After a flying time of 1.5 hrs we arrived in Koh Samui Airport which is an excellent little airport we were the last people off the plane and when we arrived at baggage claim our bags were already out and within 10 minutes we were at the car rental desk. Overall a very good first experience with Bangkok Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
USM-HKG Economy Class. First time Bangkok Airways and have to say an overall great experience. Slightly late with departure but made up some time along the way. Crew efficient and friendly. A little frustrating arriving at the satellite terminal in HKG and having to be bussed to the main terminal - so many flights arriving at once made for a very crowded group all trying to get on a bus - but other than that slight delay no problems at all. Would definitely recommend.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Siem Reap to Bangkok October 20th. A short afternoon flight on this "boutique airline" (their description) was straightforward. Spotlessly clean cabin friendly staff. Departure and arrival on time. Very adequate snack served. I'd happily recommend Bangkok Airways to anyone. No inflight entertainment available. Had there been entertainment I'm sure it would have been excellent.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX return. Outbound flight delayed 1 hour while onboard due to technical reasons however no information from cockpit! Meals onboard consisted of small snack and free non alcoholic beverages. The so called lounge in both BKK and CNX disappointing mainly due to backpackers using this to sleep and passengers bringing McDonalds bags etc into this lounge/waiting area. Drinks and snacks on offer were like a basic canteen with juice/coffee machines. All in all product definitely went down the hill over last few years however for local standards still at a premium price. Not sure if this is still boutique!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Koh Samui. First leg operated by ATR 72 the plane shows some wear and tear on the outside but the cabin was spotless and crew members seemed enthusiastic. Flight only 1 hr and 20 minutes but surprisingly a meal was served. Meal was very tasty although the drinks selection could improve greatly. On the leg back to Bangkok an Airbus A319 was operated instead. Flight was 1 hour and yet a meal was served and still of the same quality compared with the on served on the ATR 72 and staff service was warm. Many other airlines choose to have around 3-4 cabin attendants in a A320/319 but on a small jet like this one there were at least 5 attendants serving the 1 hour flight.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Although it was only a 40 min flight (Phuket to Samui) we were hardly in the air before it was time to land. Staff served lunch box - tasty chicken roll fresh fruit and drinks. Nice friendly service. Have traveled Bangkok Air about 5 times and they have been constant in good service from ground staff to flight attendants. Enjoyed the free snacks in lounge at Phuket for all passengers and while I thought the price was a little expensive the service more than makes up for it.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX. My latest run between these two cities. Check-in easy and efficient as usual so off to the lounge for my morning coffee and a read of the paper. Boarding was fast thanks to the fact that we were bussed to the aircraft (yet again). Noted the new uniforms then came the also new security video which is awful combination of song dance and a totally unprofessional narrative. Left on time and a short run to the end of the runway for a speedy departure. Then came breakfast which used to be good but us now a disaster. I was one if the few to attempt to eat the Swiss cheese and omelette croissant with salad. Bring back the muffin please. They still screen a short comedy video which helps pass the short time. Early ino CNX. Baggage had transferred from connecting flight from the wee hours in the night. I will forgive them the food onboard as they are still my preferred choice between the two cities as they gave a schedule that usually suits me and I do like the lounges they operate.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Travelled from Bangkok to Siem Reap as part of trips to Thailand Cambodia Singapore and Indonesia. The cost of the flight was a complete rip off. As they are the sole airline on the route they can take you to the cleaners and they do. The plane was dirty and the check in staff impolite. This what happens when someone has a monopoly.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Have flown with Bangkok Airways from Bangkok to Phuket Phuket to Koh Samui and then back to Bangkok over the last two weeks. Have no faults whatsoever with this airline. Excellent! Great value for money excellent service onboard especially for the length of the flights. One flight on the Airbus and the others on the ATR72. All aircraft clean tidy and in good condition. Crew are attentive and friendly. All flights were excellent value for money (around £50 per flight). Lounge access for all passengers at every airport for all passengers with free internet access and complimentary food and drinks.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phuket to Bangkok 31 July 2012. Excellent flight even though it was only 1 hour or so. Lovely meal which made the time fly the flight crew were excellent with service. A very pleasant experience compared to Air Asia X the ticket price was more than agreeable too.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
For a short flight it was adequate but time management seems to be an issue the plane was about 2 hours late from Singapore to Koh Samui and nearly 3-4 hours late on the return. We basically piled off the flight and ran to get our connecting flight. I would suggest allowing plenty of time for connections if flying with Bangkok Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-REP July 2012. Highly recommended. Efficient polite and friendly crew. Free food and drinks even though only short flight on an ATR.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I flew 3 times aboard Bangkok Airways during a recent trip to Thailand. I was very impressed by the quality of its service. The service aboard is good staff professional and polite. They provide us with a really good meal even on 1-hour flights and they have a lounge at BKK Airport for the customers in transit which was very appreciated when we were waiting between our interconnecting flights via Chiang Mai. There we could enjoy a complimentary buffet coffee juices and Internet. It was very pleasant! Our flights were always on time.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We flew from Bangkok to Koh Samui and return. All flights were on time generous service on board for a one- hour flight. Outbound was an ATR which takes 20 minutes longer than the Airbus. Lounge access to economy passengers is a nice touch. Online check-in is a life saver since you can just use the luggage drop-off counter with fewer passengers queuing. Otherwise it might take at least half an hour due to the popularity of this route. Would fly again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
We flew to Samui. The inflight experience and business-class seats were nothing was exceptional but lounges are very nice and accommodating both in Bangkok and Samui. On the return they changed the board and business-class cabin was cancelled. However at the check-in counter they sincerely apologized and paid us the difference between Business and Economy in cash as a goodwill. They still gave us an access to Business Lounge in Samui and sat us in the first row in Economy with extra space for legs.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK- Koh Samui return. Outgoing flight a bit chaotic. Unusually long check-in line even for Internet bag drop counter. Boutique (economy class) lounge at BKK airport completely full during rush hour once we manage to find a seat the snacks and drinks are still very good and well stock. Onboard ATR 72 a bit old but fairly comfortable for 90 minutes flight. Light breakfast very tasty and adequate. Return flight brilliant. Samui airport lounge give the scenic panoramic runway view. Flight is again on ART 72 but look newer. Impressed by the dinner served for a short flight. Baggage claim very quick for both flight.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Yet another CNX-BKK flight with an onward connection to Doha with QR. I had expected my bags to be tagged all the way through to my final destination but was very surprised to also get my onward boarding passes for my flights with QR. I use PG frequently and was surprised to find that the flight was about 1 hour late. A member of the PG staff personally spoke to every passenger with an onward connection to ensure that they still had enough time and he promised that we would be met on arrival at BKK. And indeed we were. The half dozen or so transiting passengers were put on in a minivan which took us to the security check thus avoiding a 3 mile hike. Reason for the delay? Late arrival of incoming aircraft. Once onboard there was little apology for the delay and still no reason given. Standard PG snack which is fine after an hour in their lounge at CNX airport. Thanks to the arrangements made for our arrival at BKK I still had plenty of time to board the ongoing flight.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Flew Chiang Mai to BKK - and as usual everything excellent. Lounge at Chiang Mai well stocked and always replenished with snacks and drinks (non-alcoholic). Many copies of current magazines and WiFi connection. Light tasty meal offered on this one-hour flight. Cabin crew very friendly and co-operative. Boarding easy; deplaning ditto. Will always fly this airline even though it costs more than the largest budget carrier in Thailand. Getting luggage at Suvarnbhumi always takes time. This of course is not in the control of BKK Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
REP-BKK-REP. As the only carrier serving Siem Reap from Bangkok you don't have much choice. Service is an ATR72 or A320. The food is ok for such a short flight it's nice to have something to eat and drink. Beer is available so no complaints there! IFE depends on your aircraft but pretty basic. One important point I'd like to mention is that in certain airports there is a lounge for all passengers. One general lounge for economy and one of course for business. Not much mention is made for economy passengers but in here you get free food and drink wifi and a much more comfortable place to rest before (and after) your flight. For the short flight that this is approx. 1 hour what is provided is decent although a little over-priced.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Last week BKK-HKT-BKK. Both flights A320's in very nice condition. Departures and arrivals pretty much on the mark. FA's friendly and professional. And a meal on an hour long flight! This is a terrific regional airline and I hope they control their growth so they do not lose all the little things that make them unique. The airport lounges were a nice touch. Will continue to use whenever possible.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
After a 5 month absence from Thailand I was curious to see if the PG service between CNX and BKK had any changes. There were and all positive. The quality and offerings of snacks have improved considerably. Lounge food is pretty much the same but the lounge is a real bonus and for economy passengers probably unique in the industry. FA's were efficient without going on a charm offensive. PG remains my choice of carrier on this route.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-BKK business. Flights were both good in A319s. Service was excellent menus were handed out and hot meals served on both flights - one afternoon one evening. Lounge at BKK is good and separate from the one for all also at Samui airport. Delay on return but information given and accepted. Flights are short but in that time they are able to impress one and genuinely enjoy the flight with them.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok- Chiang Mai return. Outbound on ageing A320. Aircraft interior worn out stained seat cushion but service very good. 45 minutes flight with 5 minutes late arrival tasty croissant sandwich served as breakfast special meal request delivered promptly. Return on Ex-Batavia Air A319 with Batavia's seat more cramped than other aircraft in PG fleet. Light dinner is ok but not impressive. Extra plus - PG always have a staff to sort baggage at carousel to avoid any possible damage.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX-BKK Nice airline with excellent service. The lounge for all was a nice place to wait and despite both sectors being under an hour a hearty snack and drinks were served on both legs. Crew was friendly and efficient and completely satisfied.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phnom Penh-Bangkok regularly and the flight is rarely on time. Food is usual mediocre airline fodder. Usually there is a bus from the apron at BKK to and from the main terminal adding time to the journey. Having said that it's the best value compared to expensive Thai Air and tatty Air Asia planes.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Male. Check-in was easy boarding good food tasty. Cabin crew all looked cheerless. Smiles were only offered on disembarkation. Male-Bangkok - 3 loud and drunk German passengers howling with laughter and behaving like drunken schoolboys made this flight an unpleasant 4 hours. What made it far worse was the complete lack of control shown by the cabin crew who kept supplying beer to them right up to 20 minutes before landing. I will not be booking with Bangkok airways again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Travelled from Phuket to Bangkok. Low rating on value for money due to the level of service compared to the price you pay with this airline compared to a low cost carrier like Air Asia. Seat comfort and food is average.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangalore-Bangkok-Bangalore and Siem Reap-Bangkok. Don't know what's so boutique about the airline. Flights were not on time food was mediocre and portions very small. Crew do not smile seats onboard were cramped - overall very disappointed with this airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
HKT-BKK. All passengers were at the gate on time. We were guided to a bus that was to take us to the airplane only to wait for about 35 minutes. Once finally onboard it took us another 30 minutes before we could take off. This time they had completely turned off the AC. The situation didn't improve during the flight. Upon arrival at Suvarnabhumi we had accumulated a delay of an hour. Service was pretty bad and the food below average. There is little luxury about this airline. It's a pretty bad low-cost carrier with full prices and a monopoly on certain routes.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Both flights from BKK-LPQ-BKK were good but 45 minutes delayed. Staff performance was excellent and friendly. Food was standard. The seat was a bit small and not convenient at all. Both flights from BKK-Trat- BKK was on time both take off and landing. The flight was not full both way and service was good as usual.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-LPQ on ATR72. Scheduled depart time of 9.15 pushed back in 30-min increments until eventual departure at 13.30. Excuse given was "weather at LPQ" but was clearly a lie since other services into LPQ were running to schedule. Gate staff at BKK clearly stressed. At boarding a carload of VIP pax turned up boarded before all other pax so suspect that was the real reason. At least a full lunch service was catered.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok to Samui return. Flights on A319 which were both full comfy clean and on time. A tasty tray of food served at breakneck speed with little grace with one T and C. Check-in easy at Bangkok with no queue but a nightmare at Samui with long queues. Club lounge at Bangkok is a nice touch though the quality of the food and drink is lacking. Bags took 30 mins to arrive in Samui which given the size of the airport was poor. Overall an excellent experience and worth the fare which wasn't cheap!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX. Used this route last year and product still very good and consistent especially for the price. The passenger lounge at BKK is a real plus and very popular but somehow never seems crowded. Flight on time and baggage waiting - what more can you ask!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phuket to Bangkok A319 Class. Absolute chaos at departure gate due to overlapping Koh Samui flight along with prior Thai airlines and delayed Air Asia all using variants of gate 66! The flight itself was usual friendly smiling staff nice snacks and if you become a member of their rewards scheme you get a healthy 30kg luggage allowance.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Chiang Mai to Ko Samui and Ko Samui to Bangkok - impressed by the service. They do not fly the newest planes but the professionalism makes up for that. Both flights on time and the best food delicious!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-BLR return and BKK-CNX return. All flights in tidy A320 cabin crew helpful and smiling excellent food even on short flights. Entertainment with overhead flats screens ok. Good information from captain. Comfortable seats for economy even if pitch cannot be great on short to medium haul flights. In Bangkok and Chiang Mai a lounge for economy class.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK to Koh Samui and back. Although the flight was about 1 hour we were served a warm meal with salad dessert drinks coffee and tea. The cabin crew were friendly and very efficient. The seats were 2-2 configuration and plenty of leg space. We have flown Bangkok Airways several times and it is always wonderful to see their brightly painted aircraft with exotic motifs. The return flight was delayed by nearly two hours but the ground staff kept us informed.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
A pleasant experience. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The airport lounge service a welcome surprise. The planes were new and clean. We were served food and beverages on all short flights. Value for money and high quality service.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
SIN-CNX and CNX-BKK. Excellent roomy seats good entertainment and food friendly helpful staff and always on time.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok to Phuket with A320 in economy class. The lounge for economy class with free seats was comfortable. Service onboard very good they served a sandwich juice and coffee/tea. Crew smiling and helpful.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phuket to Siem Reap with Bangkok Stopover. Normal flight quick boarding at Phuket surprisingly good menu - in Europe you would get some peanuts or mostly a sandwich for such short flights. The possibility to book the seats when I bought the tickets was also a pleasant surprise. The fact that they changed the flight programme (delayed 3 hours) although communicated per Mail was less so.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok to Samui return. Check-in for flight early in the morning with huge queues but the line moved fast. Flight on an ATR which was full. The aircraft seemed new and the seats had ample space. Great service with a small breakfast provided. Return flight was on time. Once again good flight. Would recommend the airline on this route. The flight is however very expensive even though we booked 2 months in advance.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
PG prides itself as 'the Boutique Airline' but the quality and standard of service was below standards on the flight. Cabin Crew did not seem to be interested in serving passengers - they thought they were doing passengers a favour. When I asked for a blanket I was given a blank look. Passengers that ordered special meals were provided their meals ahead of other passengers. When it was our turn the only meals on offer were vegetarian meals even though we were seated at the front end of the YC cabin. On our return flight to BKK we experienced service that was below the standards we experienced on our flight to BOM. Cabin Crew did not offer a Drinks Service and once again we were offered Vegetarian meals. I was surprised as to why the bar service should be offered to passengers after their meals. I chose to fly PG because I have always been satisfied with the service and the quality of meals and do not mind the high price. In view of the above I suggest that kindly take a look at improving the quality and service of the cabin crew and meals served on flights to India.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
RGN-BKK-RGN in Economy. Outward flight rescheduled an hour later then delayed 2 hours - without any explanation. Looking at other comments this seems to be a recent occurrence on Bangkok Airways. Just a short flight and service was fine though they served identical meals in both directions which seemed poor. They seem to have lost the 'boutique' aspect of their service and if I wanted to fly with a full-fare carrier in the future would consider other options.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Siem Reap return with A320. BKK-REP delayed 3 hrs without any notice REP-BKK delayed 3 hrs again this is the only choice on BKK-REP route and they charge a very high price with limited service and simple food/drinks served. Not worth the money paid.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-Luang Prabang Economy. Original flight delayed then cancelled. Put on flight to Vientiane had to stay a night then found out we were on stand by with Lao air for last night. Return flight delayed again and baggage not loaded on aircraft as 'ran out of space'. One bag arrived 3 hours later in BKK and still waiting for other bags a day later. Very unimpressed with care provided and the actual flight was nothing special. Dried up pork bits and a tiny cake does not a full service airline make.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX CNX-USM USM-BKK. All flights were on time the quality of inflight service was excellent given the short length of flight. Booked well in advance and the cost was very reasonable. Samui airport experience was excellent!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Luang Prabang economy. Flight cancelled after 30 minute wait in hot plane. Vague excuse given which turned out to be a lie. Utter chaos as returned to airport kept in lounge and after 3 hours of people shouting and 2 staff trying to sort out the mess we eventually got on a flight to Vientiane after a long walk through the terminal and a complete lack of direction from Bangkok Airways. Arrived at Vientiane had to pay for own hotel. Arrived airport next day to find out we were just on stand by. Luckily on flight at 9am after some drama. Feel really let down by Bangkok Airways who behaved like a budget airline. No managerial presence poor communication passports taken from us and left on a table in the lounge.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-PHN and REP-BKK. More seat pitch than European carriers. A hot meal on the PNH route and decent cold meal on the return from REP Neither flight longer than 55 minutes! They have a lounge at Bangkok for Economy passengers. Flight on time and bags properly checked though to LHR.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-LPQ. BKK International Lounge for all passengers is a bit used but great to have own lounge even as a Y passenger. Especially helpful in BKK airport. Flight on ATR 72. FA's very friendly. Served hot meal on this short flight and a full bar service. Seat pitch tight. Really a boutique airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
USM-BKK. Nice airplane food ok very good treatment at Ko Samui airport. However prices are quite expensive although it was a short flight there was no inflight entertainment.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Koh Samui-Bangkok on ATR72. The prices are creeping up but these flights are always on time with a decent sandwich for a short flight friendly crew and USM airport is lovely. Nice lounges with free drinks and snacks at BKK and USM. Would highly recommend.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-RGN-BKK on A320. On departure we were bussed out to the plane - on return we docked at an airbridge but were still bussed to immigration. Flights were well under half full I wonder how long they can sustain 2 flights daily. Disappointed that my vegetarian meal preferences didn't come through but they had standby pot noodles which is more than most airlines can manage. Interesting that at Yangon duty free shopping is after customs.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Whilst claiming to be Asia's boutique airline might be a bit ambitious the service is quite reasonable. Flight was on time and comfortable enough - seat pitch not too tight. However the aircraft interior looked a bit tired the carpet was almost threadbare and the inflight entertainment system a joke. For the price they are reasonable - they are not cut price but cheaper than Thai and an acceptable level of service.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Great staff nice aircraft. Still using turbo props but those will be replaced within some years. A bit pricy to fly with them but it's worth to pay for it. Good connections. Nice food.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok to Koh Samui. Cheap fare but directed to lounge with free refreshments snacks and Internet. Onboard for a 55 minute flight there was plenty of food available. Great service and good leg room.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CMX-BKK on A320 and TDX-BKK on ATR 72. Bangkok Airways provide you with lounge entrance even for economy passengers (internet access snacks drinks coffee) food served on board even on TDX flight. On the A320 drop down screens with short shows. Domestic fares best if flying from Suvarnabhumi airport - at the time only Nok Air from Don Muang had better fares. Flight attendants helpful and smiling.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phnom Penh - BKK last week. The flight was on time seats were decently comfortable and staff were attentive. Additionally a full breakfast was served on what was only a 55 minute flight (better than what I've gotten used to in the US). I would recommend Bangkok Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM return BKK-Chaing Mai (one way). All 3 flights were delayed by at least 40 mins with no announcement until the departure time had passed. Return from USM was a bus pick up from the plane which dropped us off at international arrivals mayhem and confusion followed. On the plus side the lounge at BKK is great with access for all passengers check-in at BKK quick and easy. Arrived early for check-in in Samui and was offered an early flight with out asking. Drink and food provided on the flight.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
They took good care of passengers. When I was waiting to board I felt unwell so I informed staff. They took action immediately and took special care of me. It was impressive and a memorable experience.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
SIN-USM-SIN BKK-USM-BKK USM-HKT-USM. I have used PG over 20 times from Samui and every time they excel. Great service great staff and you can not beat Samui airport. The price may be steep but sure beets 5-6 hrs going via the ferry.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Luang Prabang return. Rather chaotic check-in at BKK. Long queue out towards the airport entrance leading to the 5 open desks (all flights). Being interrupted by staff looking for passengers on earlier departing flights (& moving them to the front of the line). So by turning up 2 hrs before my flight probably meant I queued longer. After that the service was faultless on the ground and in the air. The meals both ways were very good the cooked breakfast on outbound and a delicious chicken salad with Thai dressing on the return. The staff were smart friendly and helpful. Flights on time and a dedicated lounge at both airports. Also enjoy the ATR 72 plane I am tall so was lucky to get exit extra legroom. A pleasure to fly.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-DAC. I ended up having to purchase their flight ticket due to abrupt cancellation of my original flight (GMG Airlines). Although the ticket cost was high as it was a last minute purchase I felt their services made up for it. The flight was on time the plane was new and clean ground staff was efficient and professional and accommodated with luggage transfer etc. The flight attendants were courteous and the food was top quality for a small airliner. I wish I had booked them for this leg instead of GMG! Due to short connection time in BKK my luggage could not make it with me in the same flight. But BA made sure the luggage made it to DAC on the very next flight and their ground staff in DAC informed me in a timely fashion when my luggage arrived in DAC. They even checked with me several times to make sure I had picked up the luggage and everything was in good shape. Excellent all round service.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Utapao-Phuket. The cabin crew were absolutely first class. We had a few gentlemen flying on the flight who did not seem to understand basic rules. Not once did the stewardess get flustered or angry. She remained the consummate professional. Its only a short 1hr30min flight but Bangkok Airways have always delivered the goods and I fly this route often.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Laung Prabang-Bangkok. At first I was a bit apprehensive about flying on a local Asian airline. I soon discovered that the service and standard were far superior to most European short haul airlines. The flight departed and arrived on time in difficult conditions. Access to the airport lounge in Luang Prabang was included. The lounge was quite basic but appreciated with a free snack and refreshment. The in flight cabin on the ATR72 was quiet small but comfortable. The food served on board was excellent. I highly recommend this airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Our flight was Bangkok-Phuket I found the service was excellent. Food was very good quality I would definitely choose Bangkok Airways again.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Good business clasS lounge in Bangkok and the lounge in Samui is welcome as it can be very humid if you're not in a lounge. Airline food ok for short flight. Boarded first on plane in Samui (as it should be) but they boarded business class passengers last in Bangkok. This is unacceptable. You pay more to board first not last. Second time this has happened but was boarded last in Samui last year. They really do need to get their act together.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-BKK. The lounge at BKK is really good and airport facilities at Samui also good. They serve food/snacks with drinks on this short flight and are also able to interline your baggage with many other airlines which is a real boon when connecting in BKK.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
UTP-USM-BKK-CMX-BKK. Bangkok Airways are almost always good apart from their route to and from Samui. This flight is expensive and from Samui regularly late. We flew back USM to BKK on Songkran (thai new year). As few people were leaving the island Bangkok Airways cancelled a few planes. This was to bump us all onto less flights. Luckily I had no connection that day but the delay of 2hrs was annoying for the person picking us up. Bangkok Airways had a special deal to Chiang Mai and the flight was half full. The flight attendants were great and the flight was smooth. For locals and regulars to Samui Bangkok Airways are not liked on the island due to their high prices. An island struggling for tourists after the bad flooding needs help form everyone.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
The best treatment I received in an airline. Helpful staff meals in flight free drinks in the lounge personal assistance in transfers and access to lounges in the airport for all users.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
HKG-Samui in Business with A319. Small delay but good flight perfect seat room and dinner friendly girls serving you. Three hours gone like nothing if you want you get a DVD and headphones to see movies also.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Luang Prabang to Bangkok on ATR72-500. Staff very polite meal including wine served & comfort for such a small plane better than most other airlines. One of the most pleasant journeys I have had.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX-BKK. Good price on time good crew and a nice little meal on 1hr flight. The lounge at BKK airport is a really nice touch and made a real difference waiting for the flight. Will be using them again for sure.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-PNH on A319 "Hiroshima" - carpets threadbare food terrible. Only use them due to time pressure otherwise I'd fly AirAsia save money.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
HKT-BKK although a short flight its a pleasure flying with Bangkok Airways. Full meal was served on this 1 hour flight. Flight attendants a very nice and helpful. I can recommend them.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok Airways are such a pleasure. One feels the staff really wish to make even a short flight a real delight. Our family votes them the nicest airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
I love the Blue Ribbon Lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport. It is very comfortable snacks and drinks at the lounge are superb. Bangkok Airways have excellent staff - polite helpful  and informative.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Sukhothai-Bangkok. Sukhothai airport is tiny but beautiful! You get free juice coffee tea etc while waiting and magazines/newspapers. It was only just over an hour flight but still got drinks and a meal. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The plane was quite small but just able enough to get comfortable.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Excellent service. I sprained my ankle and was taken by a young man with a wheelchair into to the lounge to wait for my flight in Bangkok and then taken right on to the plane. The inflight service was great and the flight on time.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Samui-Chiang Mai via Bangkok Got the flight for a good price which is surprising as Bangkok Airways are overpriced. Service was good although my girlfriend and myself had to sit separately. We should have checked in online. Bangkok Airways always have good service and the FA's are always turned out well but they are over priced for regular travellers to Samui.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Male return. Great staff both in the air and on the ground International Lounge is not as crowded as Domestic one. Check in counter at Bangkok Airport Rail Link station is very quick. Bad point - A319 aircraft with very tight seat pitch and very uncomfortable for such 4 hours route. Meal service is disappointing flight is only two third full but they manage to run out of food choices before reaching me for both flight and the taste is bland. Not up to usual PG standard.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phuket from BKK on a very clean A319. With a very good trained staff for disabled passengers both on the ground and in the air.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
SIN-USM-SIN on holiday trip with family. I choose this airline because of the good comments I read about it and have to state they are all true. Very swiftly check in on time departure clean plane very friendly staff a decent meal (in spite of the short flight). In short this was absolutely value for money.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Injured while in Thailand and treated like a VIP on my return. Wheelchair and my own carer. Have flown with this airline on many occasions and cannot fault them. Courteous efficient and friendly.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
If you are a holiday maker you will find this airline diverting and fun what with its own lounges open to all passengers with free snacks and internet plus further in flight snacks and quaint privately owned airports like Koh Samui. However if you live in Samui and frequently wish to travel to Bangkok you will find it a different matter. Long waits on booking reservations through their call center very expensive flights on the Samui to Bangkok route and the ground staff indifferent. Once in the air the service is good. Delayed flights often gives the impression that if not fully booked two flights are compressed into one. I now prefer to drive to Bangkok that must tell you something!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-HKT-BKK. This was the first time I've flown Bangkok Air. Great airline that understands customer service. Tickets were half the price of Thai. Quick easy check-in at both BKK and Phuket. Excellent lounge in BKK for economy passengers. The lounge at Phuket was too small to be or use. Boarding from the gate to bus and on to plane took a while at BKK but everything else worked like clockwork.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-LPQ-BKK Wonderful and attentive service on both legs. PG offers departure lounges for all passengers at each airport served and they are nicely appointed with a variety of amenities. Hot meals were served in both directions with wine and beer available as well at no cost. The crews are gracious and attentive. I made a request and the FA returned to tell me when and how it would be attended to. Absolutely met expectations.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Nice aircraft staff and food is ok plus nice comfortable lounge to wait in. Although my last two flights were delayed which didnt make for nice trip I have to commend the staff on our first flight. We were connecting to an international flight (so was another pax) in flight on descent we were moved to the front business section. We were escorted with another pax off first and to a waiting van and whisked away to the terminal we had plenty of time but the other passenger was very late for his connection but the girl RAN with him to show him all the way to his next gate. Thanks for the awesome service best I have received. Return flight was delayed 3 hours! not good we asked when we arrived in if we could get on the earlier flight but was told there was $100 charge to change flights so didn't. Then after that flight left ours was delayed 3 hours we would have paid the $100!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-PNH though a short flight we were provided with a delicious meal complete with complimentary wine (in Economy Class!). The flight attendants did not hesitate to provide you with more than one drink. They were very generous and let us finish our food even though the plane was already landing. I personally was amazed at the service - in the US you would expect orange juice and peanuts.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Short flight between Phnom Penh and Bangkok. Only a 50 minute flight yet they still came round with a 3 course meal when I said I was vegetarian they offered me a selection of different starters and bread rolls to make up for the fact I couldn't eat the main. Pilot offered a lot of information.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-HKT-BKK. Lounge at BKK had nice snacks drinks and WIFI! Service friendly and professional on the ground and in the air. I even liked the sandwiches they served onboard. What a wonderful way to fly!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
LHR-BKK-USM. I've flown with them 6 times over the last 18 months and great with no problems. They also code share with Eva air which makes life easier when you need to make a connecting flight with them. Your luggage is automatically transferred. On one occasion I had to wait about 2.5 hours for the connecting flight to Samui - when I checked in they said there are seats on an earlier flight that leaves in 40 mins if you can make it to the gate in time which I did.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-CNX return. 2 adults and 2 teenagers. This is a wonderful airline. No queues at BKK and fast check in. Didn't check out their lounge but looked great from the outside. Got tea/coffee/juice onboard with a croissant which was great. The flight was smooth and less than 1 hour. The plane was very clean and tidy. Staff are friendly and helpful. Baggage is returned quickly. Overall a great cheap airline. Would certainly use in the future.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Koh Samui - Chiang Mai - Bangkok. This may read like the last review I wrote for this airline two years ago but I love this airline. Check in is a dream in BKK. There were no queues at all. The ground staff were incredibly nice. The economy class lounges really set this airline apart as they are open to all. They may be basic but they really do add to the holiday experience (which I'm guessing 95% of their passengers are doing). Their fleet is very new and incredibly clean. In flight service isn't quite what it was (no hot meal any more) but you really don't need more than a sandwich on hour-long flights. The only frustration about the airline is when they make you get a bus at BKK - either from or to the aircraft. They really shouldn't still be doing this at such a new airport - especially for A319 jets (ATRs are different). Baggage is always returned quickly and the experience is always a good one.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Phuket return A320. We heard excellent reviews about Bangkok Airways but our experience was disappointing. Both planes were reasonably clean but old and tired. We had to use customer service via phone to change the dates on our tickets and that wasn't the best experience but it got the job done. FAs not particularly friendlyh. The prices we paid were not much more expensive than Air Asia and not much cheaper than Thai Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
An excellent airline in the air and on the ground. My wife and I have flown numerous times with Bangkok Airways and have always found them to be so friendly and helpful. After disembarking from a long haul flight to Bangkok it is so relaxing to unwind in the comfort and friendly atmosphere of their lounge prior to continuing our journey to Samui or Phuket. Flying with them is a pleasure and when assistance is needed on any matter from booking flights through to completing the trip it is given in a friendly and helpful way by the customer relations department. We will certainly continue to fly Bangkok Airways.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Very good airline friendly staff on-time good food which was free enough space for legs nothing to complain about.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok Airways is my carrier of choice between CNX and BKK. I recently came back to from Guangzhou and needed a ticket to CNX. I had expected to have to fly with Air Asia but checked the price with PG first. I was offered a seat on the new late flight at the same cheap webfare I had seen online while in china. At last a carrier that actually wants and appreciates your business. I was able to spend several comfortable hours in domestic lounge read up on the news about Thailand check email and unwind after a fairly long day that far. Travelling again next week and managed to get the same webfare through an appointed agent in Chiang Mai for the leg down to BKK. Also glad to see that the dreadful cold chicken burger has been binned for something more edible. Cheaper than TG and worth the extra over flying the unreliable Air Asia.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-Siem Reap bussed out to small propellor plane. Small inside not room for large bags. Bumpy but interesting flight - in 55 mins had nice snack box tea coffee run and water and beer. Efficient and clean. Not cheap but a good quality.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Phnom Pehn return. The lounge comfort and food and drink great. Flew seat 4A outbound plenty of leg room and breakfast really great. Return trip was better staff friendly and efficient. Aircraft clean and quiet.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM return in economy. Lounge in Bangkok available to all passengers and is great for relaxing before flight. Given exit row seats both flights without asking. Service onboard good for short 50 min flight. Even offered meal and drink. Pretty good airline overall but they have a virtual monopoly on Bangkok-Samui route.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Phnom Penh to Bangkok on evening flight. Very easy and quick check-in but then Phnom Penh is a great little airport. Flight to Bangkok was on time. Meal very good for a 50 minute flight and choice of reasonable red or white wine. Bussed from aircraft to terminal (happens quite often with Bangkok Airways flights) but baggage arrived almost as soon as I had been processed through immigration. This is a great regional airline but its a pity it still does not fly to Ho Chi Minh.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-TRAT Siem Reap to BKK in economy. Bangkok Airways offers service within Thailand but to Cambodia and Vietnam as well. I didn't expect a lot. Small aircraft but in very visual condition and crew was keen to make this a very pleasant flight. They even served a decent breakfast a light meal on both flights although the flight time was just over an hour. So in total it was a very recommendable performance and especially considering the price level I would fly them again!

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok to Samui business class. Separate check in and excellent lounge in Bangkok and priority boarding. Full menu and choice of soft drink or beer inbound and outbound. Separate check in and smaller but air conditioned lounge in Samui. What let the service down was the chaotic boarding in Samui. Business class passengers had to queue up at gates together with economy passengers only to be segregated onto transporters according to ticket class. This took ages and then all classes were moved to the aircraft together. To be a true business class service they need to call business class passengers first and get them on the way to the aircraft before they start to call the economy class passengers.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-HKT return. Bangkok Air is a good inexpensive regional airline. I have flown them several times and like them due to their up front pricing-no bag fees etc. Economy class lounge at BKK a nice touch. Check-in and cabin service efficient. Quality of food could be better. They fly new aircraft for the most part. In general cheaper and less hassle than TG or Air Asia (which charges you for everything).

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok-Chiang Mai everyone could use the lounge which was very fine A319 in perfect condition. Service onboard very good they served a sandwich juice and coffee/tea. Crew smiling and helpful.The 4 star status of Bangkok Airways is absolutely reasonable.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
Bangkok - Siem Reap Bangkok - Phuket return on both legs. Service between BKK and Siem Reap is fantastic crew able to perform a full service on such a short flight. Everything runs smoothly and delivers a professional experience. The lounge is Bangkok is a definite plus for this airline. Aircraft seems to be in decent conditions. You can find cheaper flights I think but have not tested the quality of service of the competitors.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-REP then REP-BKK-HKT. All flights on time in fairly new and clean aircraft. Pleasant staff who managed to feed the passengers and do two drink runs on such shorts flights. Expensive since they have a monopoly to Cambodia out of BKK but not a waste. Efficient and reliable airline.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-BKK. As PG and TG share this route between them they can dictate the relatively high prices. The lounge hardly provides a haven due to the fact that everyone on the flight has access and can become noisy and does not compensate for the overpriced flights. The equipment was clean however the crew on the flight to USM were a little indifferent. A small packaged snack is provided which is of poor quality and really not worth the trouble - particularly when it was virtually thrown into the lap of my wife. As competition is seemingly controlled I would prefer it if they charged a realistic price and got rid of all of the gimmicks.

### Bangkok Airways customer review
BKK-USM-UTP. Good flight to Samui on time and in a clean new aircraft. I was delayed on arrival to BKK and had to change my flight which Bangkok Airways did without a problem and for only a minor charge. The return flight to U-Tapao in the small prop was again on time and hassle free. The only problems with Bangkok Airways are the food served onboard is pretty poor and they are slightly overpriced. Apart from that Bangkok Airways is a good airline.
