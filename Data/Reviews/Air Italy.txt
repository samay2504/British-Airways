### "Staff is very kind and happy"
Milan to Male. Nice airline. Very good in all services. Economy class is a very good class. Beverages are very good too with a lot of product. On my flight services were 3: snack, lunch and a afternoon snack with a slice of pizza. If you need something else you can ask to steward that will help you in every moment. Staff is very kind and happy. Good airline.

### "Air Dolomiti worked okay for us"
Not Verified |  Munich to Bologna and Pisa to Munich, both on an Embraer 195, economy. Both flights handled efficiently, southbound on time, northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight (there had been thick fog at MUC early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning). However, support given to those with tight connections. Modest in-flight service - snacks and drinks - wine came in proper glasses. Air Dolomiti worked okay for us.

### "WiFi not free"
My flight Catania to Milan was 2 hrs late and when we arrived no one from Air Italy was at gate to help us to catch our flights to Miami which we missed. No one at transfer desk. Doors locked to floor for check in desk. Security would not help. We were told flights would wait but air Italy did not. It took many hours, even business class, to secure cheap hotel room far from airport. They would not even give me seat or ticket for flight next day. When we got To this hotel, their restaurant already closed. I finally gọt seat the next day with no apologies. WiFi not free for business class.

### "very comfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Verona to Mahon. Flight at full hour, aircraft slightly dated but maintained better than others, very comfortable seats. In mid flight we were served a very good snack. nice and elegant and above all professional hostesses. volo in pieno orario,aereo leggermente datato ma tenuto meglio di altri, sedili molto comodi. a metà volo ci è stato servito lo spuntino, molto buono. hostess carine e eleganti e soprattutto professionali.

### "my bag never showed up"
New York to Catania via Milan. We flew business class on the way over on this trip. Service was okay. Food was not great. Upon arrival, despite having 'priority' tags on our bags my bag never showed up in Sicily. There was no way to contact anyone at Air Italy and they only have 1 person who manages lost and found bags. No compensation or return upgrade was offered. I had to spend every day trying to track my bag and spend money to replace things. A complete waste of precious vacation time. We arrived on Saturday afternoon and I didn't get my bag until Thursday afternoon (we left Italy a few days later). When I inspected my bag I realized they cut through 2 sections of the bag even though there was a TSA lock and I gave them the code. They also went through my belongings for no reason (my original tag with name and information was still attached). Everything was just shoved back in haphazardly. It was also impossible to get a hold of anyone on the phone (used the US toll free number), you wait on hold and then the system hangs up on you. They really had a negative impact on my vacation and cost me a lot of money.

### "not impressed with the staff nor the plane itself"
Although my original flight from New York to Palermo was on time I was not impressed with the staff nor the plane itself. The staff were rude and not friendly at all, instead it seemed we were more of a nuisance rather than paying customers. On our flight home we were delayed over 3 hours and we were never informed prior to arrival at the airport. This delay led us to miss our connecting flight to New York. Although issues may arise with the planes the way they handled the situation was unprofessional. Once we arrived in Milan they gave us little direction on where we needed to go in the airport and we wasted an hour trying to figure out what we needed to do next. The airline put us up in a hotel and said we would leave the next day at the same time. At the hotel they provided us “dinner” which included dry pasta, processed chicken, mush for green beans and potatoes. When we asked for more sauce for the dry pasta they refused to give it to us unless we paid for it.

### "Worst customer service"
We arrived at SFO Air Italy desk to see staff was just standing around and talking, it was as we where inconveniencing them. I was trying to ask questions but they would over talk me and not take the time to listen to my questions. I just gave up on asking about our seats. Worst customer service ever. On our flight, the attendants stood in the back galley talking. This is not an airline I will be flying in the future.

### "a 2nd rate unprofessional operation"
Not Verified |  Flew Business Class from Milan to New York. Worst Business Class I have ever experienced. We were made to stand for one hour before boarding and the gate agents were never advised by the Captain that the flight would be delayed as the plane had to be cleaned! The board stated that we were leaving on time though this was clearly not the case. All they had to do is post a new departure time instead of leaving the original departure time on the board. I suspected something fishy in Cagliari when I noticed that 2 of their flights to Milan were over one hour delayed. Fortunately we flew Alitalia on this route. The food was awful except for the pasta dish which was served lukewarm. The seats were not completely flat but this did not bother me. The Purser insisted that everyone on the plane put their shades down though this was a day flight. The whole economy section was in the dark! He kept on putting my shades down without my permission. When I told him no the 3rd time as I was reading he told me to put the light on. I insisted on keeping half of one shade up. Their Dining on Demand like on Qatar and Etihad is a joke! They don't follow the time you request to eat and even forgot the desert. If they can't do it properly don't do it! The steward got angry with my travelling companion because she fell asleep between the hour we asked to wait for the entree after we had finished the appetizer. He had to reopen her tray table and the tablecloth had fallen to the floor. Seats are not fully flat but this did not bother me. The economy class legroom looked awful too. Clearly a 2nd rate unprofessional operation. Inflight entertainment was very limited and the music / audio pretty bad. OK they give pajamas but quite frankly I never wear them, especially on a day flight.

### "I literally was trapped"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Rome via Milan. First: Ticketing Counter: Very inconvenient counter locations at the airport, the farthest counter from everything, around the corner and hidden behind all other counters that you actually have to ask someone to locate. By the way, they do not affiliate with Air Italy. First I thought it was just at JFK but to my surprise it was the same setup in Rome. Seems like they picked the cheapest counters at the airport. Second: Leg Room: Let's start with tight seats with no leg room, they do not meet the standard requirements. Once the seat in front of me is reclined, I literally was trapped and could not get up. I could not even close the food tray that was jammed on my lap. Wanted to reach out to flight attendant for help but obviously couldn’t reach out the overhead help button. No one walked by for hours until dinner time, but even then she was not able to help. As if people in economy do not matter at all. I understand that they have to treat upper class customers better but they cannot ignore economy class to that level. Third: Baggage Fee: No charge for luggage from US to Rome but they hit you with 'No luggage allowed' policy for economy unless you pay 100 euro each. As if it’s not the same bag came on the flight in to Rome. Why charge only one leg of the flight? When I refused the pay, they referred me to the supervisor who finally showed up after half an hour but was not helpful at all. In fact she was extremely rude and pretty much said to us “this the way it is whether you like or not”.

### "smooth and very pleasant"
Not Verified |  My flight was to Milan from Toronto and return. Check-in was fast, the crew were polite and efficient on the ground and in flight. For the most part both of my flights were on time, just on the way back there was a delay of 2 hours but Expedia had informed me through e-mail 2 days prior of my flight. I was pleasantly surprised regarding the meals served on board to and from Italy, not only you can choose from a menu but the food was delicious! Also I found that choosing the option to pay for checked baggage on Air Italy site was much cheaper than paying at the airport, I paid in Canadian dollars instead of euros. I usually fly with Air Canada but Air Italy was much cheaper in comparison. The only thing that I would appreciate is that when choosing the option to pay for my checked bag online that it would indicate "1 checked baggage included" at time of booking. The flight was smooth and very pleasant. I will definitely fly with Air Italy again in the near future.

### "no seats were assigned"
Milan to Palermo. We paid extra for an assigned seat only to be told no seats were assigned and we could sit anywhere vacant. Staff at check in and boarding gate vague about reasons. I’m trying to claim back the additional money we paid via their online claim form. It is very user unfriendly and keeps asking for a claim form number. Extremely frustrating

### "seat slightly more comfortable"
Milan to Sharm el Sheikh in September 2018. We flew Air Italy 737 Max 8 before it was grounded, on 2 business class tickets. The seat pitch was so small, that even the length of an Ipad could not properly fit. I complained with the airline, and  was offered a 100 euro credit, which i refused. I was asking instead for a credit of the difference between coach and Business, for two passengers. On the Milan to Sharm el Sheikh flight back in September 2018. and while the seat was slightly more comfortable, with a few extra cm of pitch, the pitch was probably the same to the one in the economy section of the cabin.

### "aircraft was modern, clean, and comfortable"
Toronto to Naples via Rome with Air Italy. A very nice experience! The cabin crew were probably the most professional and friendly that I have experienced in many years. Completely bucking the trend of surly, and cheap service that most airlines seem to be offering now-a-days. The aircraft was modern, clean, and comfortable - plenty of leg room! The meals were excellent with nice snacks and fresh beverages. Even the entertainment was very good. The airport personnel wer also very efficient and friendly - altogether a very good flying experience!

### "line which moves very slowly"
Milan to Toronto. At Milan Airport you have to stay in a line which moves very slowly to get your boarding pass. If you like to check in online I believe you have to pay a fee.

### "thoroughly enjoyed the experience"
New York JFK to Milan. I flew Air Italy for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The customer service was outstanding. My cabin attendant was fantastic. Anytime, I requested something or asked a question, she was patient, knowledgeable and most kind. Normally, I fly business class but was not available since i booked my flight 2 days before departure. I felt like I was in business class minus the bed. Also, the first officer introduced himself to me and told me to ask for him if needed anything. I have never had a pilot introduce themselves and offer their assistance, that's first. Hats off and well done.

### "seat was ok though still cramped"
Los Angeles to Milan, the seat was ok though still cramped. Fortunately the flight was nearly empty and I got to rest my legs on the seat next to mine. The food was good, but I found the flight attendants were a little unprofessional.

### "Customer service great"
Los Angeles to Milan. Customer service great. Both by telephone thanks to the excellent and patient Mrs Nardina who helped me get all the information regarding my special assistance. I also wish to commend the treatment received at Malpensa airport by Air Italy Supervisor and staff assigned to check in, who distinguished themselves for their kindness, speed and determination in managing my problem, being the undersigned disabled at 100%. As did the check-in attendant at Los Angeles airport. Same treatment for the return. In my numerous flight experiences with different airlines, I had never received similar treatment. I add to what I wrote the great availability, kindness and desire to work of the aircraft crews, in particular the steward. Really top. Servizio Clienti meridiana air Italy Ottimo. Sia telefonico grazie alla bravissima e paziente signora Nardina la quale mi ha aiutato ad avere tutte le informazioni inerenti la mia assistenza speciale. Ci tengo inoltre a elogiare il trattamento ricevuto all'aeroporto Malpensa da parte del Supervisore Air Italy e la signora  addetta al check in, che si sono contraddistinti per la gentilezza, velocità e risolutezza nella gestione della mia problematica, essendo il sottoscritto disabile al 100%. Così come Mrs. Sharmilla addetta check-in dell'aeroporto di Los Angeles. Stesso trattamento per il ritorno. Nelle mie numerosissime esperienze di volo con compagnie aeree sempre differenti non avevo mai ricevuto un trattamento simile. Aggiungo a ciò che ho scritto la grande disponibilità, gentilezza e voglia di lavorare degli equipaggi degli aeromobili. Davvero top.

### "a nice experience overall"
Milan Malpensa to San Francisco. First time I've flown Air Italy, quite a nice experience overall. The main topic they need to address is the web site, which, at least in December when I booked, was sometimes slow or not working in all areas. All the rest has been good, with on line check in easy, bag drop very efficient, seat comfort good in pitch (but with 2 IFE box close to your feet if you travel by the window), good food and very nice cabin crew. I'd surely fly them again.

### "attentive service non existent"
Milan to Bangkok. They appear to me to be a no frills Business Class. Food is poorly presented and attentive service non existent. One of the crew on the return leg was quite rude and uninterested. Upon boarding I walked past him and turned right towards economy but there are one row of business there in between the galley and economy. My locker was full of crew bags. I walked back to inform him there was no space and he said “surely not”. I stood for minutes while he continued to mess about with trays and eventually came with me to investigate. He got a shock when he realised I was a Business Class passenger. My short list of what I feel is not in keeping with a proper business product. Staff attitude. 2) Food quality and presentation. Movies very limited. No fast track cards issued for Bangkok Immigration. WI-FI not working. Lounge in BKK pretty poor and lunge in MXP worse.

### "impossible to contact"
Naples to New York via Milan. Air Italy lost my suitcase and the customer care was impossible to contact. I called the number 078952600, they transfered my call and never answer, I tried to call back and they picked up and hang up right away. This is shameful! Customer care on facebook was handled by automatic responses and was telling me to do the things I had already done. Even if the flight was good overall, such a treatment has to be condemned. I will never fly Air Italy again.

### "Service was professional"
Milan to Dakar with Air Italy. Both flights were on time on new B737MAX8, seats were narrow and if the next seat was occupied you felt cramped. Legroom was 30in, we bought expensive LXseats (2 rows after business + 2 rows by exits). No IFE and for 6 hour flight could be a problem, our flight was a red eye one so we slept all the way. Service was professional and food was plenty and tasty. Overall a good experience.

### "crew service was fantastic"
Milan to Bangkok return in business. A332 from Qatar Airways are very well mantained, clean, super silent. The flat bed seat is very comfy also mattress is provided together with full pajamas and slippers. Food top quality. Cabin crew service was fantastic, so professional polite and dedicated to their job. It's evident all staff is really looking forward to the new Air Italy brand and expansion project so they are fully customer oriented. I'll fly with them again in the future.

### "no apologies for the delay"
Miami to Cairo via Milan. I purchased through Orbitz Economy Premium for my trip with them. My ticket said that I can check-in up to two luggage and I will have priority boarding. When I got to the airport I was denied to check in two luggage even though both of my luggage were under 50 lbs each and that my ticket said that I can check two luggage. The Air Italy staff told me that they have a policy which says that I can only check in one luggage if I am heading to Cairo. After waiting for more than 40 minutes, the head of staff came in and let me check in my two luggage and said to me that there was a confusion about this. There were no apologies for the delay. During boarding, I went and staying in the priority line but the staff started checking in regular economy before they got to us.

### "My bags got delayed"
Miami to Cairo via Milan. My bags got delayed on the way there and on the way back causing me a lot of inconvenience, had to go out and spend money that I did not plan on spending buying clothes. I had to make a special trip to Cairo Airport to pick up my suitcase as they don't deliver, had to pay a taxi to the airport and back, paid for a hand cart in Miami to hold my luggage which was a waste as none of my luggage arrived.

### "Service was good!"
I was drawn to Air Italy via an internet fare special $368 round trip from New York to Rome via Milan. The flight from Milan to Rome is currently operated by Qatar Airways aircraft. I purchased my ticket along with my daughter and her boyfriend. All flights, both directions, operated on time. Service was good! On the flight over, dinner and breakfast was service. Wine, cocktail, juices, coffee, tea, etc. On the return flight from Italy, lunch and snack, along with the above mentioned beverages. The short 1 hour flight from Milan to Rome served a beverage and sandwich. The sandwich was better than the one I purchase at the Milan airport. Leg room was about equal to most airlines. You are allowed a carry-on bag 18 lbs max and a personal bag. Note: the carry-on bag will be weighed at check-in. I had my carry on bag and backpack (which wasn't weighed). However, if you plan to shop it will be best to purchase the ticket option that includes 1 checked bag. If you don't it will cost $50 each way prior to departure; which isn't expensive in comparison to the other airlines. Sidebar: Milan and Rome airport have more shopping choices than eateries.

### "clean and tidy aircraft"
New York to Milan. Good flight, clean and tidy aircraft, poor IFE and bad headphones. Good meals but with a poor presentation. Friendly staff, with some ups and downs. They have to improve in some places in order to balance the best competition.

### "great service on board"
Flew Air Italy from Milan to Rome. Wonderful new airline with brand new airplanes. Cheap tickets, but great service on board. Even got a complimentary drink and snack. Very comfortable seats with adjustable headrest, even on our short flight. Also one of the cleanest airplanes I have seen.

### "online check in didn’t work"
Milan to Moscow. Worst services ever. Their online check in didn’t work for me. Tried to pay online for the bag couldn’t do it as well. At the airport paid 50 Euros, instead of 25€ online. Said that if I won’t pay I won’t fly.

### "headphones do not work"
Milan to Miami. From the outside the plane looks cute with it's paintings and markings. On the inside the plane has an old musty smell. The pillows were decent but the blankets felt like they just shake it off and fold. The seats are small, narrow and cramped. They do have a great selection of movies and tv shows and even have live TV available. This would be great if the movies and shows had subtitles in English because the headphones do not work. I asked for another one and was told it's my last one. You can only hear from one a ear bud and the sound quality is very bad. To start the staff hands us a ripped menu. The options were beef or vegetarian. When they get to us they had run out of beef. I am adamant that I don't want anything. The staff said the gnocchi is good and he likes it more than Beef, and that I should give it a try. I relent, only to hear him tell the guy behind me that there's a special menu - mushrooms with polenta. Why wasn't this offered to us as well? The gnocchi did end up being pretty decent, but was the only thing edible on that try. Their appetizer was what I think was a tuna salad, I found the bread horrible. They serve coffee after meals. The staff gave me a stern look when I asked for a cup of water and a cup of soda. They also served gelato during the flight which was not bad. And the last meal was a slice of pizza with a brownie (pizza was decent but brownie I found disgusting. Bathrooms were standard but kept clean throughout. Check-in was fairly easy, I just checked in online but I did not have to check in any baggage so I can't comment on this. No delays and flight arrived an hour earlier. This made me happy and was the redeeming quality of this flight.

### "service and food were fine"
Accra to Milan, the flight was fine. The Accra flight comes via Lagos, and it must be one of the cheapest ways to fly from west Africa to Europe (250 euro one way, no bag). The flight was only 50% full at most, at check in I asked for, and was given an exit seat (which you would normally have to pay 70 euro for), and as there was a clear row of four seats near the back so I moved after takeoff and slept for most of the flight. The service and food were fine. No in flight entertainment. Cabin staff were pleasant (mostly Italian) and were happy to bring extra water when asked. The Boeing 767 was 20 years old, and showed its age, but it flew on time. I wrote this review to counter all the 1 star horror stories - now that Qatar have invested in the airline hopefully some new(er) planes will start running the Africa routes.

### "appalled by lack of assistance"
Flight from Milan to Dakar at 9 am. The day before the flight I tried to get a boarding pass online through the web site but it would not work. We arrived at the check-in desk at 7.32 am, only to find it deserted. We went to the general ticketing office of Milan Malpensa Airport where a kind lady told us that for flights to Dakar the check-in closed 90 minutes before take-off and that no Air Italy staff was available as they had all moved to the gate. I checked my ticket but this information was nowhere to be found. Only with the help of this lady could i find this information in a sub-section of the Air Italy website. The lady told us we had missed our flight and nothing could be done (the plane was due to leave in over 75 minutes by then). She told us to try and contact the Air Italy call centre (2 euro per minute) and see if we could get on the next flight which would leave 3 days later by paying a penalty. I tried to call but after a few minutes of recordings I just gave up given the high cost of the phone call. More people with small children arrived just after us for that flight and no one was offered any help or could speak to any Air Italy staff member. In the end we had to buy a ticket with another airline leaving on that same day. I was appalled by the lack of any form of assistance or of clear communication (they should have mentioned that the check-in closed at 90 minutes on the ticket). Never again will I fly with Air Italy.
