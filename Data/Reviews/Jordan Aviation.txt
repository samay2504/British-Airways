### "refused to send us to a hotel"
The departure time of our return flight from Sharm el Sheikh to Amman was changed without informing us. After getting to the gate we boarded the plane, while on the runway we were informed of a technical issue with the plane. We spent an hour after that they returned us to the gate and disembarked the plane, no place to rest, restrooms in terrible conditions and restaurants did not have proper food. There was no representative of the airline for 5 hours after we returned to the gates, nobody to talk to. when he finally arrived, he did not give us any information of what is about to come, he lied multiple times that another aircraft is on the way to take us to Amman within the next hour. This continued for 12 hours, no plane came. He refused my request to collect my luggage and let me depart on another airway, he claimed that this is a charter flight and this can't be done. He also refused to send us to a hotel for the night until the issue solved. His lies continued back and forth until 11 PM when another aircraft from the company picked us up.

### "always late and even cancels"
Not Verified | Definitely the worst airline, no good service and this company is always late and even cancels the flight to the next day. Even the flight attendants are like you are on a bus. So I do not recommend traveling with them it was a very bad experience

### "Zero compensation given"
The worst airline I ever dealt with. We had constant delays (10+ hours) back and forth where we were stuck at the airport the entire time without proper communication. The airplanes were in bad condition as half of the seats are broken. The customer service is terrible as they stop responding to your messages after your trip and refuse to provide you any reason for the delays nor paperwork requested by insurance. Zero compensation given.

### "more than ten hours at the airport"
They did not meet the departures timing, and they aren’t helpful at a delayed times of there airplane, they keep us for more than ten hours at the airport.

### "It was a bad experience"
Bag did not arrive. My wife travelled on Jordan Aviation flight on 13 August 2023. But the bag remained in Amman airport and arrived after a week meanwhile I called several times to inquire about the bag that has important stuff like clothes. It was a bad experience for my family. Moreover, the flight was very costly. I will not use this airline anymore.

### "They are an unprofessional nightmare"
The most unprofessional airline, I have no idea how they are in business. I booked my trip through an agency, otherwise I would’ve booked via Turkish Airlines since it comes out to be the same price as this awful Jordan Aviation. I have a teacup poodle that always travels with me in cabin, I made sure that he was able to travel with me and made arrangements in advance, not to mention his ticket price was more expensive than mine. Upon reaching the airport, the Jordan Aviation counter told me they don’t accept pets in to the cabin and he must go into cargo, I pulled up their website and showed them their own policy and they said the rules have changed, sorry we didn’t update the website and the system and our colleague must not have been aware of the rule changes or else you would’ve been informed. How is that even my problem, too bad, you call yourselves an airline and can’t even modify or update your terms and policies! After having no choice I had to call a nearby pet store and beg them to send me a hard cage with a taxi to give my poor 2kg dog to the cargo! They are an unprofessional nightmare, anywhere else in the world they would’ve been sued for such incompetence and the audacity they had, sorry nothing we can do about it! The airplane was old, dirty and uncomfortable. And they still haven’t updated their website or policies

### "Seems like a well run airline
Sharm El Sheikh to Amman. It was my first time taking Jordan Aviation flight (not by choice but that was what my travel agent had chartered and really had no choice but to go on a Jordan Aviation flight). I was a bit worried about aircraft age, delays, unattentative and confused staff and not least, expected commotion during a busy season (Eid holidays) when aircraft could very easily be overbooked, delayed and anything that can come to your mind! But hey, surprise, surprise...as an avid, aviation enthusiast, and frequent flyer (and an aviation insurance professional) I was pleasantly impressed. The aircraft was an older 737-300. Aircraft was clean, comfortable leather seats that could recline (the only down side is it needed a bit of wiping of the front trays and the windows which were really smudged), the toilets were clean and very much acceptable knowing that this aircraft was a workhorse doing the Sharm- Amman flights non-stop (3 to 4 daily flights during a very busy season). Great and friendly ticket/ground staff. Easy check in. As an avid aviation enthusiast/professional, I pay special attention to anything that seems not quite right. Cockpit and cabin crew, very professional (with smiles). Equal to or better than similar carriers and must say National flag carriers. - On time. - I lost a piece of luggage on arrival. Jordan Aviation staff came to me quickly and assisted me until I found my lost bag. I was grateful for his help. He did this with a constant and reassuring smile. The negative: Front trays and back seats need a good wipe! The windows too! I will not hesitate taking a JAV flight again. Seems to me like a well run airline. My flight from Amman to Sharm El-Sheikh on the 17th of August was equally good and can replicate was has been said above (aircraft JY-JAP) a Boeing 737-400. Absolutely no issues. Summary No unpleasant surprises. I was travelling with my wife and 3 kids and did not want any unpleasant surprises. Will fly Jordan Aviation again for sure. Well done.
