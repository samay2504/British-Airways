### "not a great experience"
Staff not very helpful onboard and didn’t offer me refreshments, had to ask them to come back. I was told to go to the economy cabin the toilet even though business class one showed unoccupied. Overall not a great experience seen better service for the price.

### "service was impeccable
Not Verified |  I have flown Austrian twice from LAX to Vienna and it is maybe my favorite international airline at this point. And I have flown quite a few international carriers out of LAX to points around the world. Both trips were in economy but I chose exit rows due to being 6’3. When not flying premium economy or business, this will be the only way I fly. The service on Austrian was impeccable, the flight attendants kind and very attentive. The seats were comfortable and the food was perhaps the best I have had when flying economy. I can’t say enough about it. I do wish Austrian flew to LAX on more than just a seasonal route because I prefer nonstop flights, and while I know I can transit through ORD an IAD year round, nonstop flights are always the better deal. What do you say, Austrian, LAX to Vienna, year round?

### "changed my flights 3 times"
Not Verified |  They changed my flights 3 times. I booked the flights in advance with my boyfriend, we are from different countries but would have the same scale at the same airport. One day before the flight they changed my flights saying my first sector got canceled, i already had everything pre paid, bus to the airport and everything so i had to go to 4 in the morning to the airport, my flight would be at 6. Since they changed it it now would be at 10h30 and not have the same connection as my boyfriend. To top everything 30 minutes before the new flight they told me it was delayed, making impossible to get to my other connection. Finally they changed again to another flight at 12h30,so from 4 am to 12h30 i had to be at the airport alone.

### "keep the dog in the cage"
I have flown yesterday with my pet in business from Vienna to Larnaca and have never seen such behavior/customer service from an airline staff. I have been using Austrian Airline for the past 30 years and never came across such rude, inhuman behavior towards me and my puppy, I wish Austrian Airline can teach their staff to be more kind and understanding when a passenger take his support dog with and not treat them like a baggage. She didn’t even let me give water in the three hours to the dog. She kept raising her voice to keep the dog in the cage (which he was) but no water unbelievable behavior for the manager, very disappointing. I understand that there are rules and regulations and I bought the right cage for the 6 kg puppy but this kind of behavior I have never seen. I paid high price for this ticket and received zero customer service. On top of that I requested a wheel chair and no one would help me get out of the plane.

### "had cancelled our return flight"
In January 2024, we purchased roundtrip air tickets on Austrian Airlines (AA) from Dulles Airport outside DC to Vienna, Austria. We were supposed to fly to Vienna on April 29, 2024. The day before our flight, I received an email from AA announcing that our flight had been cancelled and AA would make alternative arrangements for us. I called AA quickly to make those arrangements. I made a new reservation for us on the same flight for the following day. I didn’t change our return flight in October. AA allows international passengers to check in two days before their flights. So, about 40 hours before our October return flight, I tried to check in. I tried numerous times but kept getting an error message. Our reservation appeared on my AA web account and on my AA App but I couldn't check in either on my laptop or on the AA App. I called AA’s customer service at least three times during the two days before our return flight. They informed me that AA was having technical difficulties with its computer systems and that we should arrive early to the Vienna airport to check in there. On the date of our return flight, we arrived at the Vienna airport about two hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We tried to check in at the self-service kiosk and an AA representative offered to help us. With her assistance, we tried to check in three times, all without success. She escorted us to the baggage service counter where she told us another representative would be able to help us. The woman at the baggage counter was able to find our reservation but not our tickets. She made some calls but was unsuccessful. After about fifteen minutes, she directed us to the Austrian Airlines ticket counter. We spent the next 70 minutes or so at the ticket counter working with three Austrian Airlines agents, one of whom was the manager. The first woman also said she found our reservation but not our tickets. She said she couldn’t give us our boarding passes without our tickets. Her first solution was for us to purchase one-way tickets to Washington DC. I told her that was ridiculous; that we had already paid for roundtrip tickets and would not pay for more tickets. She said that when Austrian Airlines rebooked us in April on our flight to Vienna, AA had cancelled our return flight and had given us refunds of $66.90 each to convert our two round trip tickets to one-way tickets. I scoured my credit card statements and I found the Austrian Airlines refunds in my June statement. However, I never received an email from Austrian Airlines notifying me of a refund for a roundtrip to a slightly less expensive one-way trip. And, because AA had downgraded us from premium economy to regular economy from our cancelled to our rebooked flight in April, I thought any refund was to compensate for that downgrade. The manager of the ticket office was the only Austrian Airlines representative who actually listened to me. She agreed that it made no sense for our allegedly cancelled reservation to remain on my AA web account and on my AA App. She had added that we had done nothing wrong. The manager told us that this was the only time in her 23 years at Austrian Airlines that this had happened to any passengers. She told us she would figure out how to fix it. It took her another 20 minutes or so but she finally called us over to collect our return flight tickets to DC. She said she was unable to seat us together.

### "refused to send any compensation"
Me and my family were excited about traveling on Austrian airline for the first time but the made our complete trip both way a nightmare full of disappointment. On our way from Houston to Amman we missed our flight from Amsterdam to Vienna and was rerouted to two trips instead of one and delayed 15 hours, when we got to Amman our luggage was not on the plane and we waited for 3 days to get it when we got it 4 suitcases were damaged. On our return trip they cancelled our flight and rebooked for 15 days later we end up extending our house rental, car rental phone line, long distance charges over $850 ( I spend over 10 hours on the phone trying to rebook our cancelled flight) and my children missed ten days of school, on our way back we again missed our flight from Vienna to to Frankfort due to the delays by Austrian Airlines from Amman to Vienna, we end losing 17 hours, I wrote to the Austrian Airline to compensate me at least for the house rentals and car rentals and phone charges close to $1900,  they refused to send any compensation and send me a letter asking me to consider them for my future flights, this is the worst company with the worst customer service. I am beyond frustrated and upset.

### "Swedish crew very professional"
No advance information that flight OS738 is not operated by Austrian. At boarding a Braathens ATR72 was waiting. The standard size carry-ons don't fit into the overhead storage and have to be dropped at the plane. An information sheet from Austrian is the only indication of being in the right plane. The flight was smooth, even at 6000 meters with bad weather during the last third. The noise-level was relatively low permitting conversation and the Swedish crew very professional. The usual water bottle and chocolate was served. No other service offered. However, upon on-time arrival the plane is not able to use the passenger boarding bridge and heavy rain when picking up the carry-on resulted in soaked luggage and soaked passenger, giving a new meaning to wetlease as done by Austrian.

### “could not care less about customers”
Not Verified | I booked this flight for $12k but booked the return flight out of the wrong airport. Called to change my return from Budapest to go out of Prague and was told they had to do something in their system to "unmarry" the flights and call back in 24 hours. 2 months later, 16 phone calls and over 20 hours they finally unmarried the flights. Since it took so long, and the flight I wanted from Prague was nearly sold out, I bought two tickets thinking once they unmarried and reconnected the flights I would get reimbursed since I'd already purchased a full price fair from Budapest. The airline refuses to A. speak with me on the phone (though I've been told five times I would get a call back, I never have) and B. refuses to refund any portion of the added flight I had to book because of their incompetence. They truly could not care less about their customers.

### “customer service is horrible”
My flight from BRU to VIE was cancelled a few hours before departure. We got a flight 4 hours later with a stop in Frankfurt. Coming back they told us we had to fill in an online form and would get back the money after a week or so. After first mail we received directly an answer that our tickets would be reimbursed, but after four months, a lot of phone calls and mails later, we still haven't seen our money. The customer service is horrible and really unfriendly. If there is any other company, even more expensive, take it, because the stress with Austrian is just not worth it.

### "image of your typical discount airline"
The night before departure, I received an email from Austrian Airlines asking me to check in my hand luggage because the flight was full. This, I definitely didn't do. It was a completely full flight. The flight was also on time. At checking at Vienna Airport, they expect you to print out your luggage tag and put it on your hold luggage. Legroom was very tight and the seats didn't recline - I had more legroom when I flew Wizz Air. Only a free glass of water and a small chocolate was served for this 3.5 hour flight. Overall, this flight felt like a cheap discount airline. I would fly Austrian Airlines again, though, because you can be assured that the first flight in the morning should be on time as it is the national carrier and flying from Vienna airport. Austrian Airlines European route services are a mirror image of your typical discount airline.

### “Not one word of apology”
My flight took off late from PVG and left me with only one hour of transit time at VIE. However, the VIE-AMS flight was also delayed (by about 1-1/2 hour), and thus allowing me ample time to catching this second leg and even using the lounge. Nevertheless, my checked luggage did not make it on the delayed flight (OS375) from VIE to AMS and was put on a later flight. Though the whole incident was not reported to me either at the gate or via the active APP on my phone. Upon arrival at AMS, I waited for more than an hour before reaching their service partner (i.e. dnata) inquiring about my checked luggage and it was then reviewed to me that the luggage was delayed. Not acceptable. The original flight was to arrive in AMS at 7:15pm, and after the luggage fiasco, I didn't leave the airport until well after 10:15~10:30pm. Not one word of apology was uttered by the ground service agent nor the airline even though I am a Star Alliance Premier Gold member. I cannot accept this as a way to treating a frequent flyer. Furthermore, enroute PVG-VIE, service on board was minimal. I rang the service call bell for 20-minutes (turning it ON and OFF a few times) to ask for a bottle of water for my medication. Not answered. I wouldn't even want to imagine what if I was having medical emergency. Scary thought. Food served for Premium Economy was mediocre at best. The friend rice (if you could call it that) lacked substance, taste, flavor and simply cheap-food.

### "No one is accountable"
Worst airline I’ve ever flown on,  Austrian Airlines flight was delayed by 1hrs, causing me to miss original flight, and they lost my luggage in the process. No one is accountable for anything, no one can give an answer, no one gives a damn. You on your own.

### “don’t care about customer service”
Worst airline I ever traveled with, I don’t recommend this airline to anyone, they cancel your flight at the last minute, they don’t care about customer service, so rude. Dirty, old, poor service, nasty seats with broken pieces inside.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
I had very early morning flight from Tbilisi to Vienna in Business Class by Austrian. I usually select Lufthansa but as Austrian resumed the flights to Tbilisi, I decided to refresh my memories. Austrian was very popular on this route many years ago with Fokker 70/100 and Lauda was sometimes operating this flight. The crew was excellent - very friendly, professional and supportive. I really appreciate when crew well present in the cabin. The food was ok - very minimalistic but this is 3 hours flight, so no complain. What really surprises me that the cabin did not have pillows and blankets. We were around 12 passengers in Business and it was 1 pillow only (I got it as I asked before departure). It was cold in the plane early morning, everyone wanted to sleep. Nothing available. Passengers tried to cover by coats and jackets and put bags under heads. If somebody is reading from Austrian management - how much it costs to have blankets and pillows? The business class tickets are quite expensive and I believe this is a basic service. My conclusion, Lufthansa is my first choice and Austrian needs a bit of improvement on this route. Otherwise, business class passengers could run away from Austrian to Lufthansa or Turkish airlines or Lot Polish airlines where service is much better.

### "Cabin crew friendly"
Decent flight - nothing to write home about. Cabin crew friendly, cabin clean and seats comfortable. As usual, no free service offered. Austrian chocolate as give away.

### "a really pleasant surprise"
Not Verified |  It was my first time flying with Austrian and it was a really pleasant surprise. Good seats, decent food and the service was absolutely first class. I have flown business class inside Europe with most of the main airlines, but this Austrian flight was by far the best I have experienced in Europe. I flew back home with SAS, and it was, to put it mildly, rubbish compared to Austrian.

### “offers the least leg room”
Been flying with Austrian a lot this year, at least 30ish or something flights in the economy. First, the positives: Crew nice and helpful as usual, cabins a bit worn down and not up to date. Selection of paid meals and drinks quite ok at reasonable prices. What is however not ok is the space in the cabins. I am 6.3”, pretty slim, and quite honestly everything more than 60 minutes is torture with Austrian, comparable with Ryan Air but at premium price. The last flight was a320; but e195 or e145 is the same, not better. Compared to other regional companies (not low cost) the Austrian offers the least leg room and it is not even for a debate.

### "my backpack being too big"
I flew with a group of 28 from Greece to Iceland. The Athens to Vienna was smooth. At the Vienna airport, ground staff made a scene for my backpack being too big. Not even Ryanair or Easyjet even brought up the size issue. The staff was extremely rude and entitled. 10 bags of our group were not forwarded from Vienna to Reykjavik. What a disaster of an airline.

### "our claim has been rejected"
Not Verified | On June 28th, my flight to Hanover was cancelled (as many other flights on the day) due to massive backlog of passengers stuck at the airport due to bad weather earlier in the week. Austrian Airlines rebooked my family on a flight the following day via Frankfurt (not ideal, but) the customer services representative advised us that there are no more hotel rooms available and that we should organise accommodation ourselves for which Austrian Airlines will reimburse us. He provided us with contact details (business card) and said to submit the claim for processing. Few days later I receive an email from Austrian Airlines representative that our claim has been rejected as the cancellation was due to a force majeure. However, 28th of June was a perfectly sunny day in Vienna and Hanover so no bad weather on the horizon yet they still claiming the cancellation was related to it. Fortunately, I have worked in the airline industry for number of years and know how airport terminal slots (schedules) are allocated to carries and what their practice is when they need to prioritise busy routes. Hanover was not their priority on the day and had to give a way to another route, but this is not publicly known fact. It is however a common practice amongst the airline carriers. I am all for airline safety but PLEASE don't use the same excuse when you a struggling to deal with your backlog of passengers from a previous weather event.

### "Free warm meal"
Plane was 90% full, ample of overhead storage since Carry-on free of charge in hold. Free warm meal kind of Austrian version of BigMac. Several times free drinks offered (incl. wine). Helpful flight attendants. However, after 2/3 of flight time (total 4 1/2 hrs) all toilets could not be used anymore since waste water tank was full. Pilot asked passengers to retain or he would need an intermediate stop. Fortunately the passengers did their best and the plane arrived 1o minutes late.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
OS 631 on July10th. Business class. Due to delay of aircraft incoming from Malaga we reported at the gate slightly delayed but the boarding was not finished yet. However we were denied to board. Agent explained to us that they have a huge overbooking ( 12 passengers) and move us to a waiting list for next flight, 4 hours later. They basically thought that we could not reach the gate on time. Fortunatly- probably thanks to senator status - we got seats on the next flight but in economy class. We reached final destination 4 hours later, downgraded from business to economy. Austrian refused to pay any compensation because they believe that all our problems were related to "traffic management". Regarding downgrade they sent us to Lufthansa as our tickets have been issued by Lufthansa. Few words on service in economy class on route from Vienna to Warsaw - there is no service in fact. Just water!

### "refused any compensation"
OS386 from Malaga to Vienna in Business Class. Incoming aircraft delayed 20 minutes, very slow boarding and finally one hour delay on start . After departure we were offered cold drinks - flight attendant was not sure if they have whisky but finally found a small bottle of red Johnny Walker and served whisky in wine glasses . No choice of food - I got a small piece of dry chicken, My friend preordered vege meal and received few pieces of carrot in curry sauce with rice. Small piece of Sacher-like tort afterwards. The coffee served onboard was light warm due to technical problems with boiling of water. Austrian wines only available. We landed in Vienna with 45 minutes delay and lost connection flights, because our seats were given to other travellers from waiting list (overbooking 12 passengers in small Embraer connecting from Vienna to Warsaw). Definitely do not recommend Austrian business class. They refused any compensation despite 4 hours delay for the whole journey and denied boarding due to overbooking  "that was extraordinary situation caused by traffic management". Business class tickets and Senator status did not help.

### "definitely use it again"
Not Verified |   Just less than a month, Austria Airline kept its promise and refunded us, for causing us to miss the flight from Vienna to Barcelona. We submitted paper work only asking for a refund of $500s (transportation, dinner, a missed lodging night in Barcelona), but they refunded more. Their ticket from Germany to Vienna was good price too. They gave each of us a personal travel kit, a nice hotel to sleep over. Rebooking at their airport counter was smooth, the staff was helpful, speaking good English. Their chocolate on airline was so good. Anyway, highly recommend Austrian. So grateful, especially my family had an amazing first, lifetime family trip to Europe! Thank you Austrian, will definitely use it again!

### "been the worst experience"
July 18,2024 This has been the worst experience! Delayed flight in Toronto to Montreal giving you 22 min to the next flight which is impossible for to make the next one. Called customer service over 30 times and no one wanted to take responsibility ask to be book into different flight’s nothing happened. Finally someone tired booked us 4 days later with a 15 hour layover when asked to get food vouchers, they said once you get there they will help you, you get to Vienna now no one will even talk to you said call customer service been on line for 40min no help whatsoever they keep pushing you to the next person. They don’t even take into consideration you’re travelling with kids!

### "Wasted day in the airport"
I was not allowed to board on the plane, because the comapany alows the flight to be overbooked. I booked the tickets in advance, done the check in and came to airport on time, but was not allowed to return back from CPH to VIE. Wasted day in the airport full of stress and nerves and unpaid day off from work.

### "I requested compensation"
Delayed flight, dismal service and no compensation. My flight was delayed 2hours from Santorini to Vienna and was scheduled to arrive at 23:05 it instead arrived in Vienna at approximately 01:05 the following day. The only thing received on the flight was a cup of water, chocolate cookie and a rushed apology from the tired flight attendant. I was notified of this delay a few hours before the flight. However, I missed my connecting train from Vienna to Linz at 12:28 where my accommodation was. I had to sleep the night in the airport and buy a new train ticket the following morning for 60Euro. I requested compensation for the airline fro 61.50 Euro only, (to cover the cost of my ticket the following day). I was denied this compensation, this was the response I received. Which failed to acknowledge the flight was even delayed and denied any liability, therefore not interested in re-reimbursing the relatively small cost of the train ticket. I am just lucky I did not book hotel accommodation as this would clearly not have been re-reimbursed. Thank you for your email and your patience with us. I do understand your disappointment – I am sorry that you were affected by the flight irregularity. Kindly accept my apologies. Taken into consideration the contract between the airline and the passenger is limited to the destinations mentioned on the ticket, I have to inform you that Austrian Airlines is not liable for indirect and/or consequential costs such as lost time, lost days of vacation, pre-booked tours, inconvenience, missed or cancelled meetings, parking costs, petrol costs, pre-booked hotel reservations and transportation costs at destination, etc. Furthermore, according to internal records, you arrived in Vienna 1 hour 49 minutes later than the scheduled time of arrival. The compensation foreseen by the European regulation (EC) No 261/2004 does not apply in case of delays of less than 3 hours.

### “staff vanished”
Canceled flight after check in, no one apologized, no explanation, no one to talk with ... staff vanished 15 min after cancelation announcement..the day after they offered a flight that would take me around 15h with connections (direct flight is 4h). And the cherry on the topping was 10 days to get my lost suitcase.

### "flight was delayed for 2 hours"
The flight was delayed for 2 hours,  we were waiting in the airplane and  were offered only a small glass of water. They were determining if they should pass through bad weather or change the route. Worst experience ever. Never ever again this airline from my side.

### "I was disappointed"
On June 1st 2024 I flew VIE-FRA-YUL on Austrian Airlines( flight OS207). It was my first time flying with them and I have to say I was disappointed. Talking here about customer service on checking passenger and baggage at Vienna airport itself (VIE). We needed assistance for self-service check-in kiosks for passengers and drop off luggage. It was really unpleasant not to be not listen and helped carefully when we needed services by Austrian Airlines representative on site at the airport.

### “an 8.5-hour delay”
Never had a worse experience with an airline. The flight was originally scheduled to depart at 22:10 but was delayed until 06:40 on June 7, 2024, resulting in an 8.5-hour delay. The excuse for all of them is the delay of the flight due to the storm that subsided less than an hour after the initially planned departure time. In further communication with the customer service, I didn't come across any support and understanding for compensation, moreover, they were extremely unpleasant and it was as if they didn't want to listen - as if I was talking to a robot. None of the passengers were provided with anything, neither accommodation, nor food, nor anything, and they only said that we would manage on our own, that they were not interested and that they could not provide us with anything. When asking for a refund, they said it was not possible because, like - why didn't you go to the accommodation yourself, we can't compensate you for what you went through. They don't care if people even had money for that accommodation, what they were late for, what health problems they had and they had to lie around the airport... Ugh, simply never a worse experience and unprofessional relationship in life.

### "I have to say I was disappointed"
I was initially booked on a MAN-MUN-BKK flight with Lufthansa, but due to a delay I was rebooked to Vienna then on to Bangkok. It was the first time I had flown with Austrian before and I have to say I was disappointed. The plane was incredibly hot, I was only wearing shorts a t shirt and flip flops. The cabin crew throughout the whole flight only focused on Premium Economy upwards. Rather cold with economy, you were made to feel and inconvenience. The seat felt quite tight in comparison to other airlines for long haul. The food was terrible. Sometimes it’s the small things that count, the headphone they give you are the ear buds which hurt your ears. I’m glad I have flown with them, but unless the price is incredible I won’t fly with them again.

### "denied boarding by Austrian border control"
I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with Austrian Airlines that has left me frustrated and dissatisfied. Despite arriving at the airport on time with all my valid documents, I was denied boarding by Austrian border control during check-in. The Austrian Airlines employee at the flight stand submitted a request to the border control, which was refused. I received no prior communication from the airline indicating there might be a problem with my transit (visa not required, as it was the same airport and I had no intentions to exit airport during transit). They declined a refund. I expected a much higher level of service and accountability from Austrian Airlines.

### "mixed bag of service"
We flew Austrine Airlines for the second time. The flight from BCN to VIenna was quite disappionted. Although the check-in and boarding was smooth and the flight was on time. The crew on board were OK but they provided only a cup of water and small chocolate bar. The problem was that we have to connect OS flight from Vienna to Bangkok with less than 1 hour. The plane did not arrive at normal gate but Bus gate which took some time to disembark and we had to walk a long way from arrival hall to departure gate via security check and immigration. Our group almost miss the flight due to time and there wes no assistance from OS ground staff. However, the flight from Vienna to Bangkok was quite good. The crew onboard was nice and friendly. The seat was much more comfort and we can get some sleep during night flight back to Bangkok. The food and drink was OK though had only 2 choices. Overall, it was mixed bag of service from Austrian Airlines.

### "send a car to the plane"
There was difficulties at take off from Venice, not the airlines fault. My girlfriend and I knew we only had about 30 minutes in transit to our connect flight to Copenhagen. Austrian Airlines send a car to the plane at the runway, to pick us up and drove us to our connect flight. Our luggage was already there. We flew economy.

### "cabin crew service was outstanding"
Two flights within a week where the cabin crew service was outstanding. Genuine warm welcome, attentive service with a smile. Our glasses were topped up more than three times, on top of tea / coffee. The food was served on porcelain unlike the casual aluminium ‘take away’ ravioli meals of my local airlines. The lunch/ dinner was substantial, flash, cooked with gusto and very tasty. Certainly not an airline meal.The cabin crew faced the passengers when making public announcements. The plane was clean and the cabin was quiet. The cabin crew and the ground team made this trip such a wonderful, relaxing experience. Austrian airlines you set the standard for European short flights! A big thank you to the crew ( Gehart amongst many others).

### "carry on was tagged to be taken"
I just flew connecting through Vienna to New York. Despite my ticket specifically saying I was entitled to a carry on and a personal item, paying an exorbitant amount for extra legroom seats, being a Star Alliance Gold, and clearly being 6 months pregnant, my carry on was tagged to be taken away. It did not matter that I explained I have medicine and several things I need for the long flight, I got surrounded by 3 female staff members at the gate, who started literally harassing me, telling me that I don’t need my bag and tagging it, against my will. And on top of that I was rudely responded “if you want to keep your carry on, fly business class next time”. And what’s worse, half of the overhead compartments were empty when boarding was completed.

### "Unbelievable great service"
This is our fourth long haul flight from Bangkok to Europe and back on Austrian Airlines in the last two years. Our family of four booked well in advance for each trip and got a very competitive price on Premium Economy seats (11A,C & 12 A,C). Four seats on the side of the plane in a 2x4x2 configuration - way less cramped then the four middle seats. FYI - Austrian does charge a fee for advance seat selection, but it is well worth it to obtain the side section seats. I have flown over one million miles on a US long haul carrier, and by far Austrian is far more efficient. They have one of the best airline mobile apps I have used, making communication, check-in, baggage tracking very efficient. Every step of the flights were great; check-in at the airport, boarding, flight experience, extensive IFE choices, good food, seat and cabin comfort and baggage service. On the third leg of our trip, we had a four day stop-over in Vienna. One of our bags was badly damaged. I took it to the Austrian baggage service desk in the baggage claim area. They offered me three options; a new bag comparable to my damaged bag, repair service in Vienna (3-4 days) or repair service in my home city and they would reimburse me for the repair costs. I chose option #1 - a new bag which was the same size and a very good quality name brand. Unbelievable great service - the whole process took less than 10 minutes. This is customer service at its best.

### "exactly where Austrian failed"
The review covers the flight from BKK to VIE with Austrian. I was lucky to get a single seat during boarding which was comfortable and spacious. Food was very good and tasty, well presented by the chef on board which I find is an amazing concept. The old 777s are extremely loud, cramped and uncomfortable and as a matter of fact completely outdated. Toilets were in a catastrophic state in the morning and I noticed they were also used by guests seated in the main cabin - I wonder why nobody of the staff cared and looked after things? During the entire flight the head purser acted super important without making any contribution. Only an hour and a half after departure, the second drink was served on request. The travelling experience in BC on an 11-hour flight was far from being on par with other airlines, especially when you are used to travel with Asian and middle east carriers. Hardware and food is one thing, crew service another things and this is exactly where Austrian failed.

### "Customer service is not helpful"
Customer service is not helpful. Had to change a flight due to visa issues. This is possible online, but cumbersome. Only one date at a time can be selected, and the final price displayed. If it's not a good price the whole process has to be started again. Sometimes the dates that are suggested are one day after the one selected. Dates far in the future gave me an error with the suggestion to call customer service for support. First, contacted the online chat. Every response took 10 minutes. Finally, I was given a price for the dates I wanted to change to. I checked the flight price on Google Flights (took about half a minute), but in the meantime, the chat was closed due to 'inactivity', without asking if I was still there. Then called the hotline. I was on hold for half an hour when they hung up. Called the other hotline in Europe and was told that they don't have access to US bookings. Called in the US again and now got through. The connection was so bad I could barely hear the agent and vice versa. Finally asked about the rebooking dates and the agent looked them up. But she got an error. When I asked why these dates couldn't be booked, her answer was she didn't know. Apart from that I noticed when I rebook online, that I am charged the luggage again. I asked the agent why that was and she explained it is charged again unless I fly the exact same route. The system only allows to rebook the same route, so I don't know why that would be charged. Of course, there was nothing the agent could do about that. Austrian probably gets you to where you want, but any customer support is mostly a waste of time.

### "told me that the plane is full"
Never again. Since online check-in was not possible, they left me in Hamburg and postponed it until the next day. With a ticket price of approx. 600 euros, that can't be true. I bought the ticket and they resold it and told me that the plane is full. I've been behind on compensation since July. Nobody answers the email and tries to push it away. Shame on you!. Nie wieder. Da online check in nicht möglich war, haben sie mich in Hamburg stehen lassen und auf den nächsten Tag verschoben. Bei einem Preis für das Ticket von ca . 600 Eur kann das wohl nicht wahr sein. Ich habe mir das Ticket gekauft und sie verkaufen es erneut und sgaen mir, dass dass Flugzeug voll ist. Seit Juli bin ich der Kompensation hinterher. Niemand antwortet auf die Mail und versuchen es von sich zu schieben. Schämt euch!

### "I will never fly with them again"
I have flown many times with them, service good but unreliable canceling flights as they please. My review is for the flight March 1st Milan to Vienna. I was on the train to the airport (80 minutes ride) received an email telling me that the flight have been cancelled, after communicating with them they were happy to offer me 6 alternative flights between 5 1/2 hours from Linate or 12 1/2 to 14 1/2 hours from Malpensa (absolutely ridicules for an original flight of 70 minutes. I purchased a ticket with Ryanair for 290Euro (the only available flight the same day. The return flight on the 5th was also cancelled but I was never notified, found out 24 before the flight when trying to check in online. I had to buy another ticket on the same flight, apart of the enormous inconvenience I spent over 700Euro, Austrian Airlines is offering me 250Euros. I will never fly with them again.

### "poor ability to communicate policy"
The flight was never taken. My review that I am submitting is in regards to Austrian Airlines poor ability to communicate policy and protocols, it was never explained to me. I cannot even speak to anyone outside of a third party answering service. I have sent multiple emails that are returned by a different person each time. I have requested to speak to managers to no avail. I have spent approx 100 hours trying to rectify this, have been placed on hold for up to an hour at a time multiple times in the same call, and even "disconnected" 8 times in the same day. I have NOT been rude, argumentative, or disrespectful. I simply get hung up on when they decide they cannot help me. I never get a call back due to the disconnection, so I end up starting over, and over again. Ultimately, my original flight was placed on voucher due to my husbands diagnosis and me being his only caregiver. We moved from CA to FL to be closer to family after 5 months of heavy chemo and surgery to remove his stomach, so we could have some more help with the rest of treatment. Now, Austrian Airlines refuses to voucher my ticket to fly out of TPA, FL (which is 2500 miles close5) and are stating that I need to purchase tickets to and return from CA, to fly 5 hours in the opposite direction to LAX in CA, just to fly back towards Vienna, Austria. Then to return to California (LAX) to then fly back towards Florida (TPA). This makes no sense on anyone's behalf. I am not asking for any return of difference or anything. Simply, I would like to use the vouchers to fly from TPA. The original tickets are for both myself and daughter, totaling $4,000. This includes the upgrades for legroom on the longer flights.

### “Austrian dropped the ball”
I just returned from a 2 weeks trip in Europe with a transit in Vienna through Austrian Airlines. First of all save your money and do not waste it on business class. The seats are coach, no screen, 3 seats with an empty seat in the middle, very cheap. Food less than average. The crew is nice. I was on a 7am flight - Friday from Vienna to Paris, my luggage never made it to Paris, and I was told it will be on the noon flight and I would receive it that evening. FYI there are 3 flights a day on Austrian between Vienna to Paris (2 hours flight) I checked the website the luggage was showing on transit for 2 days. I emailed Austrian, they sent me to the website, I even emailed their traceluggage address twice, no one got back to me. Finally on Saturday at 10pm received an update that the luggage made it to Paris and someone will bring it to me. Another nightmare started, as the next day was a Sunday and no indication about the time I was going to get my luggage. There was a phone number with 40c/min, we called but no answer. I was returning to US the next morning and I was debating either ask them to send the luggage to DC, or come up with another solution. Finally The carrier brought the luggage Sunday evening, I opened my suitcase, my clothes were damp and I had 2 items missing. The next day, I flew back to US and wrote a complaint to Austrian. Their response, they need a police report and the receipts for my missing items. I responded, how they expect me to do a police report when I got my suitcase back the evening before I returned home. Still the same response back. I think what Austrian is missing is, this was more question of principle than anything, and as far as I'm concerned Austrian dropped the ball and does not care about the customer. They certainly lost more than one customer. Again, if that's your only option DO NOT TRAVEL BUSINESS. They are decades behind.

### "an arduous experience"
My experience was far from satisfactory. The overall service fell short of expectations in several aspects. Firstly, the quality of the food provided during the flight was subpar, the staff's unfriendly demeanor was quite disheartening. Their lack of helpfulness and apparent annoyance when approached for water or other requests created a negative atmosphere throughout the journey. Moreover, the discomfort of the seats added to the overall dissatisfaction. The lack of sufficient legroom and support made the long flight an arduous experience.

### "professional and polite cabin crew"
Austrian Airlines are really nice, decent cabin, professional and polite cabin crew. Not my first time and I strongly recommend Austrian Airlines to fly with.

### “No apology whatsoever”
Not Verified | This airline didn't load my baggage onto my outgoing flight (I was on standby for this flight, which I only discovered when I checked in). It wasn't a major issue, as they had my bags with me within 24h, and they were shipped to my accommodation. They then didn't load my bags onto my return flight, for which I wasn't on standby. I then couldn't report my baggage missing online, and it was a nightmare getting it back (it took 5 days). No apology from Austrian Airlines, whatsoever. It's a shame because they're actual flight service is to be commended. Their staff were all incredibly polite and helpful, and drinks were constantly trollied along the plane.

### "Do not choose this company"
Not Verified | This company has just managed to lose my and my family's luggage for a second year in a row. It might be some sort of a record. Do not choose this company if you change flights in Vienna.

### "lost my 2 luggage for 10 days"
I always loved this airline but this time, they lost my 2 luggage for 10 days. Can imagine being on vacation with no clothes or anything pretty much. Austrian airline promised to reimburse me if i need to spend and for sure me and my daughters we needed supply's, cloths and we did little shopping as we been promised and we needed for 10 days almost our vacation was over till the luggage's came back! I reported baggage lost and I have claim with them, I submitted all my receipt or invoices. I been waiting for 5 months now and nothing.... they don't even respond. Worse Airline.

### "never fly Austrian airlines again"
I had an economy flight from Vienna to Frankfurt and a connecting flight from Frankfurt to USA. It was supposed to be a quick flight that’s 1 hr and my ticket allowed for 1 carry-on and 1 personal item (which goes under the seat). The flight was supposed to board at 0620 but did not begin boarding until 0640. We did not depart until 0720 and original departure time was at 0700. Upon boarding, the gate attendants asked the later boarding groups to check their baggage in due to it being a full flight: I was group 3 and was not asked to check in my bag. As we started boarding group 3, I was in the front of the line to board and the gate attendant told me to step aside to check in my bag as “you have too many luggage” and I told her I’m entitled to 2 bags with my ticket and she said “they’re too big” (they were within size measurements). I had a connecting flight and was not going to risk losing my baggage due to their incompetence. She then gave me the ultimatum that if I do not check in my bag then I have to rebook my flight - the only reason why I would not be understanding is the fact that she pulled me over when there was 10+ people allowed through the gate that were in my same boarding group and had 2 baggages. I will never fly Austrian airlines again.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience ever. More or better training on how to treat the customers that support your company. Without us, your company does not exist, which at this time would probably be a good thing. From the beginning of the trip booking until the last minutes in the Vienna Airport going home the rude and downright nasty people you employ were numerous and almost as if they couldn’t be bothered. I booked through United in April 2023, your partner airline. While booking our trip, they raised the prices by $150.00 each. I found out the price we paid did not guarantee us specific seats but just a seat wherever you wanted to seat us and we need to pay extra for the seats we want. That costs us another $50.00 each. Several months later they changed airplanes to Vienna thus changing our seats. Another set of emails to straighten this mess up and get seats we paid for. We get the first rude person in a long line of them 4 hours before departure. She looked like she was doing us a favor being there. One of our party had put their carry-on bag in the test container for size and weight. It was overweight. They made some adjustments and got it under the required weight. That wasn’t good enough and they were told that it would have to be checked. At the check-in counter, the woman asked them why it was tagged for check-in. They advised her that the other woman said it needed to be checked. The counter agent walked them over to the same type of test container, put it in, and said that it would be fine to carry on. The counter agent looked at the other woman who shook her head no, and ended that discussion. The trip home: 3 hours before departure time. Must be part of airline policy to get rid of people to talk to when we have questions. Great move that must be to save money for customer service training. The rudeness of the woman attending the self-bag check-in machines. Boarding time: I have my Android Wallet QR code up i.e. Boarding pass. This person looks at the phone, tries to do something with it, and then says he needs to print out a boarding pass. He shuts down the lane to get a printed pass. This separates me from my wife and I am carrying her extra bag. She later told me that they rudely told her she had to keep moving instead of waiting. With the printed boarding, I try to get through the automatic gate and I get pulled out of line for having an extra bag. I explained to the woman that I had to wait for a printed boarding pass and my wife had already proceeded on. I was sarcastically asked “So you want me to believe that your family has already passed through to let you on with the extra bag?” Seriously? I said to the gate agent that my wife had already moved on. She asked the same question again. And I said to her yes. Sarcastically and rudely, she said that we shouldn’t get separated next time. This was all about the lack of customer service. I am not going to say “I will never use your airline again” but I will make it a point not to use this airline if possible.

### “could not have been more helpful”
Not Verified | Flight OS464 from Manchester to Vienna was running some 90 minutes late, having been delayed earlier in the day by a sustained snowfall in Vienna. I was concerned that I would miss my connecting flight in Vienna but both Austrian and their Star Alliance partner EVA Air could not have been more helpful. The cabin crew on the Austrian flight sought to offer reassurance and once again delivered a lovely tasty meal. Despite landing in Vienna with only about 20 minutes until my next flight was due to leave, Austrian and airport staff and EVA Air worked together to make sure I made my connection. Quite brilliant customer service for which I was very grateful!

### “Terrible service”
Not Verified | Terrible service. I received an email the day prior to my flight stating that I could check my carry-on baggage free of charge as the flight was almost fully booked. Upon checking in, the agent weighed my bag and said it was overweight by 3kg. I offered to remove some items to lower the weight, but the agent said that this was not allowed as she had already weighed by bag. This seemed very strange to me at the moment and to be honest, it still seems strange that I wasn't permitted to remove a few things.

### "did pay the financial damage rather fast"
The flight was delayed a few times and finally after a delay of 2 hrs 40mins cancelled. Most passengers were able to reach Athens same day however I was rebooked on a flight at 10.05 pm and this flight also caught a delay of 40 minutes. I reached Athens the next day at 2.00 am. Not fun, I could use the business lounge with food and drinks however Austrian only  give one voucher of 10€ and food and drinks are not cheap at Vienna Airport. On that flight a small hot plate and a piece of cake was offered aside the usual drinks. FA were friendly. It must be said Austrian did pay the financial damage rather fast.

### "They didn’t prioritize business class"
Similar to Lufthansa and Swiss, they pass off an economy class seat plus an empty adjacent seat as business class. Features such as charging ports/outlets aren’t available, let alone IFE. For a 4.5 hour flight, there were no drop down screens. The forward bathrooms were a free for all. Landed behind schedule in Vienna and only had 45 minutes before the next flight departed. They didn’t prioritize business class passengers who had short connections and there were only 4 very crowded immigration desks open. Best to avoid Lufthansa group airlines on any flights longer than 1.5-2 hours. It’s just not worth the $s.

### "surprised how good they are"
First time on Austrian Airlines and I was surprised how good they are. Plane was old, but in a top condition. Food was good too (usually I wont eat plane food) Entertainment was ok. I would gladly fly with them again in the future.

### "onboard service was impeccable"
Austrian Airlines has lots of old Airbuses but they look neat inside. Business class is typical for Europe, just Y seating with the middle seat remaining unoccupied. This is ok for short haul. The onboard service was impeccable. In Y all is available upon payment except water and munchies. In Business, a light meal incl. dessert on china is served in spite of the short flight time. Cabin staff is friendly and courteous. Announcements were made twice from the flight deck, and were the best I have ever heard in recent times where you don't get as much info as you used to 40 years ago. The fare was reasonable. Booking and online check-in were extremely easy and efficient. Even in Y you can select your seat free of charge! The airport services at Vienna and Podgorica were not good, though. Podgorica is a nightmare, and no Austrian Airlines representative seemed to be on hand to look after the 100-plus passengers.

### "consistently delayed"
I am implore you to save yourself the stress, time and money, and find another airline to fly, even if it means flying a bit longer or including a second stop on your journey. I am a gold level traveller, flying one to two times per month for the last few years, and my experience is that Austrian Airlines is 100% the worst airline in Europe. Their flights are consistently delayed, cancelled or over-booked. Recently, they managed to lose my checked-in luggage, only to return it 18 days later (yes, you read that correctly) with nothing but an email saying 'apologies'. Even though their website indicates I could claim for incidental replacements during this 18 day period, they refused to refund me even €1 for the inconvenience caused. I honestly cannot understand how this airline is still in business. For me, I will never fly their airline again.

### "Shame on you, Austrian Airlines"
Not even worth 1 star! Let's start with the worst incident. Lost luggage, no refund even though they acknowledge the mistake. Nowhere to be found, we filled out the forms properly, and all we hear is that they are working on it. It's been about two months now. My girlfriend had to buy everything again from the suitcase, and we still haven't received the money back, even though they admit the mistake lies with Austrian Airlines. If you can avoid this airline, I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend to do so. Mistake number 2: My girlfriend and I flew from Tirana to Amsterdam with a layover. Due to a delay at the first stop, we couldn't make the second flight, everything was fully booked, and we had to stay overnight, only the overnight stay was well arranged. We were supposed to get everything back for food, transportation, etc. We only received about 70% of it, even though we kept it reasonable. Shame on you, Austrian Airlines.

### "best business class experience"
We flew Austrian Airlines from Vienna to Chicago on business class and thought it was the best business class experience we've had between Europe and the USA in years. We used to look forward to flying business or first class because the airlines used to make it a special experience. Our current thinking (until yesterday) was that US and European airlines no longer did that. The service in business class on Austrian was exceptional. It started with a dedicated check in area for business class clients where the staff were helpful and welcoming. The lounge was nice. The real magic began once we got on the plane. The crew and the food were amazing. The chef was enthusiastic about his work and served us little appetizers and soup in addition to the food listed on the menu. It felt like a treat. The menu featured a good variety of meal options and everything we had to eat was very flavorful and well-prepared. The crew was very knowledgeable about the food choices and the wines on offer. The lie flat seats had a massage function plus the weighted blanket and pillow were of high quality. Throughout our flight, the crew made us feel like special guests throughout the entire experience. We will definitely fly Austrian again.

### "food was absolutely delicious"
Not Verified |  What a fantastic surprise Austrian Airlines were - they are right up there with the best airlines. The food was the best I have ever had on an airline, and that is saying something because the food on Qantas is outstanding. The chef came out to welcome us, discuss the menu and take our choices - he then proceeded to prepare our food. The food was absolutely delicious including the best chocolate tarte we've ever eaten. Great coffee and the service was sensational. You could not get better service from a cabin crew - so willing to help with every little need, as though it was their greatest satisfaction to do something for you. The seats were comfortable but not the flashiest business class seats in cubicles, but I would fly this airline any day and every day. We took off and landed on time. Thank you to the cabin crew and to Austrian Airlines for caring about serving their customers with delicious food for a memorable flight, and ensuring their staff are the best.

### "rude ground staff in Cairo"
Not Verified |  Terribly rude ground staff in Cairo, made everything more difficult with checking in our bags and also randomly changed the bag number. The internet on the plane was very bad.

### "Very poor customer service"
Very poor customer service. The airline staff requested for passengers who would volunteer to delay their travel as the flight seemed to be overbooked, with a promise of compensation. After volunteering, my seat was given to another customer and then when all customers had boarded, they realised they flight was actually capable of taken all the passengers on ground. They asked us, the volunteers to get on the flight without a genuine thanks. Never volunteer your seat!

### "Ridiculous, disappointing, and sloppy"
Not Verified | By far the worst experience of my life. After a 14 hour lay over, they not only lost my baggage but it turns out it was never scanned in in the first place so no one can locate it. When I contacted customer service, they first gave me the number to a bank and then they told me they can’t help me when I asked to speak to someone in higher management. I am only in Vienna for a day and now no one can locate my baggage and I need what’s in there today. Ridiculous, disappointing, and sloppy.

### "Most awful long haul flight"
Most awful long haul flight experience I’ve ever had: - terrible staff, rude, unkind and never seen a smile on their face, meals were so bad. There was not even salt and pepper provided. The toilets were in such disgusting shape during the flight. Worst experience to have such circumstances in a long haul.

### "some space for improvement"
Not Verified | This is my review from Vienna to Athens. Boarding started perfectly on time, something that it is unusual these days in Vienna Airport, so I highly appreciate that boarding started on time. About ground services, I can tell that the boarding passes didn't have written the boarding gate something that should change. In addition, in the security area, the security officer did his job as he should. Finally, the crew was polite and offered to me and to my business partner some water and some Austrian chocolate but I would expect something better from Austrian. For example they could offer some beverage service with tea or coffee and a little snack too. I think that this airline is a good airline with some space for improvement.

### "the worst phone help ever"
Not Verified | I have not yet flow this airline. I have been trying to get my ticket corrected now for 7 days and probably a dozen call to Austrian. Probably the worst phone help ever. First, most of the time you will get transferred to Lufthansa who says "you have to call Austrian", but when you call Austrian you get transferred to Lufthansa. When you finally get to Austrian, you cannot understand a word being said. The is not one person, but every call. They are useless. AVOID THIS AIRLINE

### "I didn't have a good flight"
I didn't have a good flight with Austrian. The worst part was the return where my baggage was not loaded due to aircraft overloading! According to follow ups from the airport dozens of baggage were not loaded. Imagine that we pay for the baggage but they fill the airplane with other stuff. They also didn't provide information about scheduled flights for baggage. The baggage was also damaged due to multiple connection flights. I reported the damage but I am pretty sure that they will say "we are sorry for that but we don't process your report and don't forget to pay us next time and buy our tickets!". For the first flight we encountered multiple delay announcements and in total it was around 3 hours. They also suggested us to go to the restaurants in the airport as a compensation for the delay, but the restaurants were not briefed about that and in the end they said (the restaurant I went) that up to 7 euros is free. While the carry-on baggage was said to be 8 kilo (according to the time I bought the ticket), there was no control about that and there were people with big suite cases in the airplane causing lack of space in the cabin. Overall I won't try this airline anymore and I have heard similar things about that.

### "comparable to Wizz Air, Ryanair"
It's a super tight seat. Boarding via bus in rain without any cover in the stairs for people. Boarding only in front. Staff offer no help for people to make boarding faster. Absolutely comparable to Wizz Air, Ryanair apart from the classical music that you pay premium for. Very similar to other Lufthansa owned products. Shiny cover, mouldy inside.

### "Horrible staff"
Horrible staff and Organisation. The flight departed late in Podgorica, the transit time was way too low and eventually they lost my luggage in Vienna. No one could be bothered to help or show at least some kind of remorse. Do not fly with this airline if you need to take a connecting flight. They don’t calculate enough time and will lose your luggage.

### "forced me to pay 70 euro"
On the way to Vienna my carry on which always fits in overhead bin was found too heavy and checked in free of charge at the gate. On the way back I got airline's email saying they would check it in free of charge at counter 358. At that counter they forced me to pay 70 euro which I wouldn't have paid if I didn't get that email and went straight to gate. Random security check is an obvious lie as the security person asked questions to which I didn't want to give extensive answers and wasn't particularly nice either.

### "not enough legroom"
I travelled from Amman, Jordan to Washington DC, USA via Vienna. The aircraft from Amman to Vienna has seats that are too narrow, no head rest, no screens and the seat cushion is too thin. The flight was 3.5 hours we got cheese sandwich only. Flight from Vienna to USA was in a bigger aircraft so seats were better but still not enough legroom in economy class. Flight duration was 9.5 hours we got one meal and a snack. During the wait for boarding in Vienna airport, economy class travelers were kicked out of the gate waiting area and we were told to wait for boarding elsewhere and that the waiting area by the gate is designated for first and business class only.

### "cascading effect of ruined vacation"
This airline first would not honor our request to refund a ticket for 5 traveler that could not make it, then when we arrived they offered vouchers to volunteers to take a later flight, but would not take ours, then simply took our spare seat away. I had purchased premium seating for my family to sit together with a small child, but they did not have our seats assigned. We boarded last. Then 2 out of our 5 bags did not make it on a short, direct 1.5hr flight. It was impossible to contact the airline, they kept giving us different numbers to call, one of which was Lufthansa. Finally two days later we received an email that our delayed luggage arrived at the destination and I took a ferry boat and taxi to the airport only to find out one bag showed up. We had to repurchase clothing for the family member, then received a note that our lost luggage was sent back to our home airport in U.S. Simply no sense of customer service. Ticketing agent interrogated us inquiring about our travel plans, flipping thru our passports, questioning authenticity. Gate agents were no help, general sense of confusion and chaos. Gate agent ran after us and plucked the spare ticket out of my hand to seat someone else. Very odd experience, resulting in cascading effect of ruined vacation.

### "The meal was very good"
Boarding in Venice started with a short delay - flight to Vienna was a short however pleasant experience. A decent snack was served accompanied by Austrian wines. FA's were very friendly. Only minor point was the fact that once again the plane was not at a gate in Vienna - despite the bus transfers were Ok. Flight to Brussels was very good despite the delay. On this flight a hot meal was served with a cake as dessert. The meal was very good - good Austrian wines as well. The purser and her assistant on this flight were exceptional. A more than decent business experience in Europe. For sure my best European flight so far during this year.

### "in a week received a compensation"
Was flying on a business trip from Luxembourg to Belgrade through Vienna. My connection was really short, just 35 minutes, I managed to make it, but my luggage did not. Upon arrival to Belgrade I received an SMS that my luggage was not boarded and some instructions. Reported all to the lost luggage and left my hotel address. I believe that by the evening my luggage arrived to the Belgrade airport, but due to weekends it was delivered to me only on Monday. Since all my clothes were in the suitcase I had to go shopping. Afterwards filled in a report and in a week received a compensation according to their internal policy.

### "not recommend them at all"
The worst ever experience in 40 years of flying, dysfunctional and extremely incompetent, try to email, write to them? All your efforts fall on deaf ears, they are not interested to listen. Flight after flight were cancelled without reasonable explanation, Austrian Airlines ruined our much awaited two weeks holiday to reunite with our family, not recommend them at all. Put in a cheap hotel when the connection flight was cancelled as well due to unexplained reasons.

### "kicked around our baggage"
Heraklion to Vienna on 1st July. After arrival we had to wait 5min in the cabin and watch through the window how 2 Airport Workers threw and kicked around our baggage without reason. I phoned the call center and they told me this is not allowed. I am furious I was not able to tell it to them face to face and ask them if they would like it if someone threw their stuff around like that. Our baggage has been damaged and we have to fill in a form but this won't solve the issue. Flight was good but this was not okay.

### "The crew was very nice"
The cabin of Austrian was quite a shock, as totally outdated: no privacy for most seats, no direct access to corridor for many seats near the windows, and a miserable toilet kit. Food was excellent, wines as well, with a very nationalistic touch, as only Austrian wines. The crew was very nice, very attentive, flight was on time and loading well organised.

### "No information about compensation"
It was a full flight, so they announced that everyone could only take one piece of personal items on board. They proceeded to board people & a lot of people had 2 carry on items & they weren't stopped. Of course I arrive in Budapest & my bag that they made me check at the gate did not make it. I proceeded to the lost bags and they couldn't have cared less. No information about compensation, just here's a link to track your bags. They advised my bag would come through on the later flight & be delivered to my hotel last night. It hasn't arrived & the tracking system has not been updated. I have tried calling & have been on hold since 4.30am, so nearly an hour. I am moving on from my hotel today & I need my bag. I called Austrian Airline to ask about what to do & the woman was so rude. Literally just fill out a form. I asked her about compensation, again fill out a form. I needed to know what to do as I only had the clothes I was in & nothing else.

### "forced to check in my trolley"
I was forced to check in my trolley at the gate in Vienna. There was lots of space on the aircraft, i could have put my board trolley under the seat in front of me but they said it’s “too heavy”. Avoid Austrian if you can as well as Vienna airport.

### "forced me to check in my luggage"
Austrian Airline forced me to check in my luggage saying that the flight was fully booked but there were numerous people with bigger "hand" luggage who were not required to do that. The personnel could not provide any justification for why the requirement applied to me and not to other people, besides there was space in the cabin. As a result I had to wait for luggage at CDG and lost the last train to Paris, arriving home at 2am and after taking a bus and a taxi.

### "could not stand it any longer"
My family and friends (6 persons) bought on 13/4/2022 tickets to Vienna for Christmas 2022. We received confirmation from Austrian Airlines for Flight Athens - Vienna on 25/12/2022 at 14:55 Flight Vienna - Athens on 31/12/2022 at 22:05 On 23/12/2022 I tried to check-in online for the first flight but I received a reply from the system mentioning that it was not possible to complete the check-in and that I should make it at the airport when I will arrive to board to the flight. I called the Customer Serviceto understand if there is something wrong with the system and I discovered that Austrian Airlines cancelled both our flights without notice to us. I asked for a solution for the situation caused by Austrian Airlines and they informed me that they could:  Book seats in an earlier flight (25/12 at 13:25 instead of 14:55) Book seats in another return flight on 01/01/2023 at 18:25 (instead of 31/12 at 22:05) I accepted and booked these tickets upon receiving an assurance from the Customer Service that they will pay for the additional cost that will arise, due to the change of our departure date. I asked if there is any restriction / prerequisite for the expenses and they replied that they do not have any restriction as long as we do not book a five star Hotel. After our trip, we sent the invoices of the expenses to Austrian Airlines and after a two months dialogue they denied to pay our expenses and furthermore they denied to pay compensation. Fortunately, we discovered APF (Agency for Passenger Rights) and with their efforts, Austrian Airlines “was convinced” for their mistakes and payed full compensation according to the EU directive but about 65% of our expenses because, as they claim, they have restrictions. At the end we accepted the 65% because after five months of continuous efforts with the airline we could not stand it any longer.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience. I lost business meetings because of the delays and the bad service. They caused me a big lost of money. It took more then 12 hours and 3 flights to arrive from TLV to Malaga (should take max 5 hours of flight). First flight from Tel Aviv to Vienna they lost the slot of departure, then instead of flying directly to Malaga they sent me in a Lufthansa flight to Frankfort and then another flight from Frankfurt to Malaga. I went out at 2:00 am and arrive to destination at 18:00.

### "totally unprofessional and uncaring"
Not Verified |  On the 2nd of June we were flying from Sofia to Vienna on OS798 connecting through to Reykjavik on OS0327 In Sofia our flight was delayed, so l checked with the man at our boarding gate about our connecting flight. The man said “ what are you worrying about, you will have 50 minutes before your connection”. On our flight to Vienna; the flights requiring immediate transfer by the passengers were announced, of which our flight wasn’t one of them. Despite this; we went immediately and directly to our gate without delay, as quickly as we could. On approach to the gate, a man was standing near the entrance to the gate waiting area, who was apparently waiting for us. He instantly went into a rage, yelling loud and aggressively at us, saying “ the plane it waited for you, hurry up and get on the plane”! We ran towards the gate, and l said “this isn’t our fault, we just arrived because our flight was delayed”. He started yelling at us again to get your boarding passes and scan them and get on the plane! This is while he stood behind the counter, doing nothing to assist. He then started yelling again to get on the plane again. By this time l finally started verbally responding to his attack on us. We ran down the ramp to the aircraft totally stressed and angry and upset from the attack on us; and told the head stewardess that l want to make an official complaint on the man at checkin. We then went straight towards our seats, helped by an absolutely lovely flight attendant in order to not hold up the flight any longer. Once seated I explained to the attendant what happened and asked her if she could tell the head flight attendant what happened, and asked her if she could obtain the mans details for a complaint. By this time, l was nearly in tears; and my daughter who has a brain disability was a mess in tears. The young attendant was companionate and professional, gave us the complaint email, and said she would include her our report; and did everything she could to make us feel better. Unfortunately; the head stewardess did not once through the flight even bother to speak to us to obtain more details or see if we were ok. This l feel was totally unprofessional and uncaring. There was so little time between flights, that we arrived in Iceland without our luggage. The staff in Reykjavik were very helpful and professional resolving the problem. Please thank the young flight attendant and the Reykjavik staff, on my behalf please.

### "Austrian should have done differently"
A year ago I took the same flight and I was very satisfied on all accounts. This year I repeated the flight and, probably, it was the last one with Austrian. My ticket states clearly "MEAL - standard", as the last year. What I got was a miserable half dry half wet roll of bread with some yellow cheese that half was melted inside the bag, half a tomato slice and a napkin. I was flying to a connection flight without food. To add insult to injury, at 10:00 sharp, when we landed all the food stands were closed. At least out of consideration for those going on another flight without anything to put in the mouth, Austrian should have done differently.

### "made our experience a good one"
Not Verified | My husband and I both require assistance. Your staff and the airport staff at all of the airports were extremely helpful and made our experience a good one.

### "recommend but with lesser expectations"
Not Verified | Austrian Airlines which I have flown many times of decades has after been taken over by Lufthansa sunk to a new low. The seats are a much tighter squeeze, the qualify of the food on a transatlantic flight, once among the best, is now mediocre, smaller in quality though with an option of two different main meals - chicken or pasta. The cutlery is not even plastic but rather some sort of cardboard plastic, the knife breaking as soon as I cut into the rather tough chicken - even Lufthansa and Swiss have metal cutlery. Limited drink runs during the flight and only water. Crew itself is polite, friendly and dutiful. Flights both direction full and cramped. Only a muffin served for breakfast NYC-Vienna - no cold cuts/cheese platter as years past, no fruit, no yogurt. I believe Lufthansa has dragged Austrian Airlines down several notches since the takeover. Flights on time, baggage arrived safely both directions. I would recommend them but with lesser expectations.

### "have yet to provide compensation"
Had my luggage damaged by Austrian Airlines 5 months ago - despite immediate report to their arrivals ground staff, several calls to their inaudible call center staff and several unanswered e-mails, they have yet to provide compensation.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines I have fly with. For direct fly from New York to Vienna the width of seats been 39cm. This kind of aircraft could be used for short flights but not for 8-9 hours direct flights. Another think is, if you are seated in the last rows of aircraft you will have to eat only what remains crew will just told you that there is only last option even the other passengers have more options. From my point of view this is very unprofessional if you pay same cost as another passengers and you are just unlucky where you’ve been seated. If you have a chance look for another flight and not use Austrian.

### "I can highly recommend them"
The Manchester to Vienna segment was really good with two wonderful crew but I wish to review here the long haul segment from. Vienna to Bangkok. My seat 7A was rather compact in the lie flat position but for the sitting position it was fine. The cabin crew service on this segment which was led by the purser Karin addressed me at all times by my name, she was very friendly and professional at all times for which I would like to express my thanks and the other six crew were also extremely friendly. The food was also very tasty and plentiful as was the special signature coffee. This was my first experience of traveling with Austrian Airlines and I can highly recommend them, incidently transitting through Vienna airport was very easy and the business class lounge was good.

### "Austrian forced me to check my bag"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Austrian Airways from Cairo to Stockholm with a connection in Vienna on July 23, 2022. Even though I packed in only a carry on bag and had used the same bag as a carry on other flights during this trip with other Star Alliance airlines, Austrian forced me to check my bag. I explained I had a tight connection and if they checked my bag, it would not make it to my next flight. They didn't care and moved forward with checking my bag. Once I landed in Stockholm, I received an email that my bag had not made my connection. I continually updated their tracking information with my location as they would take days to locate my bag in Vienna. They sent my bag to Stockholm once I had already left for Denmark. Then they sent my bag to Copenhagen with only 2 days left of my trip. However they didn't location my bag in Copenhagen before I had to fly home at the end of my 10 days in Scandinavia. It took an additional 11 days for them to deliever my bag to my home address. I was told I would be reimbursed for essentials like clothes, toiletries, phone charger etc. I saved all my receipts and supplied them to the airline August 4th when I was home. I followed up over 20 times without any resolution. I finally got a response on January 30th, 2023 that they would only reimburse my $260 even though I spent more than that. They said I would receive my $260 via direct deposit within 6 weeks. It has now by 14 weeks since then. I have followed up at least 3 times since January 30th with no response.

### "Multiple failures and incompetence"
Multiple failures and incompetence, system dysfunctional, bad customer service. We purchased preferred seats for $35/each for me and wife for both round trips Tampa to Bucharest The Austrian online booking did not recorded them but my Credit card was charged 3 times =$270. We called customer service and they promised it will fix that but they never did. Out Flight from Viena to Bucharest on apr 17 (OS 94) forced us to check in the carry on luggage even was permitted as size and weight-other passengers were let have their luggage in the plane. I ordered  Gluten free meals, got a confirmation emails but that was only provided on the going trip and not on the return from Frankfurt to Tampa. Sseat purchased and charged to my cc for return were not "recorded" by Lufthansa even I had printed confirmations from Austrian. Lufthansa desk service from Frankford told us the Austrian had Problems.

### "good customer service"
Overall a good experience. Flight on time, good customer service online and at the airport (Tel Aviv). Very nice and welcoming crew on board. Clean and nice looking cabin.

### "no baggage upon arrival"
This is the second time in a row we travel Business with Austrian and we receive no baggage at arrival. Both me and my wife are Star Alliance Gold members and we choose to fly business. We filed a complaint in January about our delayed luggage . We were attending a wedding in Athens and we had to buy clothes, underwear, shoes personal items from the beginning. Austrian airline is really good to communicate about long waiting list and not solve the problem. No compensation yet. We traveled again yesterday from Larnaca to Stockholm via Vienna. Once again no baggage upon arrival. I am travelling for a course today and i am once again without clothes. Austrian Airlines are constantly humiliating your Gold and Business passengers. We filed a complaint in Star Alliance today. Who is going to pay for their fault in January? Who is going to pay for all the panic the new clothes etc we were forced to buy then? Who is going to pay for all the food (whole 23+ Kg) we carried yesterday which is going to trash when we eventually receive our baggage this time? Who is compensating me when they force me to attend a medical course with training clothes because they chose to depart the airplane before all baggages are loaded in the aircraft ? Who is compensating us for their mistakes and the frustration and anger they caused?

### "lose your hand-luggage"
Be careful when flying late Fridays the plane might be overbooked. When they ask you to come forward if you want to check hand luggage in, even at no expense from. Get it done else they will lose your hand-luggage. Which just creates big headaches. The will not assist you in any way once it is lost.

### "I was happily surprised"
Great flight Vienna to New York. Good food and bar service; IFE with 100+ movies; friendly crew; and both flights were on time. Considering that Austrian's owned by Lufthansa, which has become one of Europe's worst airlines, I was happily surprised by the service provided by Austrian.

### "Unfriendly personnel"
Unfriendly personnel on the boarding gate, my bag was randomly selected to take to luggage while it was the supposed regulations: of course nothing to prove it or fit it into, and was just taken out by flight assistant who threatened to not let you board the first chance she got when trying to argue.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
The worst customer service. My luggage was lost on August 12, 2022 traveling from Larnaca, Cyprus to Newark, New Jersey, USA. It has been 8 (eight) months that I am dealing with both Lufthansa and Austrian. I have made 30 phone calls to Customer service for the US handled by agencies in the Philippines, South Africa etc. The people are very nice but they can only send reminders to headquarters which they have done several times. I have sent several emails to Customer Relations, they do not accept phone calls. Customer Relations only sends automated responses that mainly say "be patient". I only received some information by the US customer service, what agents could see in the system. The information was ridiculous. First, your baggage is in Vienna, come and get it. Then it arrived in Newark but it was not delivered. Then it was in Munchen. Three months ago I asked for a compensation of $300. Never got an answer other than the automated standard response of "We have a very heavy load of lost luggage, please be patient".

### "Super bad experience + customer service"
Not Verified |  Super bad experience + customer service. Flight was overbooked, they only let us know in the very last minute - literally at supposed departure time. Offered only 120 EUR compensation for the failure to service as booked and 2 hour delay until the next flight. Male flight attendant was unfriendly and denied giving the feedback further that the experience was bad. Female flight attendant was trying to resolve the issue and remained polite. Compensation was only offered in form of prepaid credit card - so not only did they not offer an option for flexible compensation, they also used unnecessary plastic.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I bought a ticket from Austrian from Frankfurt to Athens via Vienna, one day before my flight and after the online check in one part of my flight the Vienna - Athens cancelled due to a strike. I called the customer service to rebook me for the next day of course I didn't expect for the same day as it was a strike and I even told them I can fly Saturday too as I understand they might be full. The solution that the lady gave to me is full refund. I explained her I need to go back and I must rebook and the next solution was a flight via Munich for Sunday, 3 days after. Plus with my expenses to go from Frankfurt to Munich. I told her this is no solution but a bad joke and I must think what alternative can I have. Then I searched my self and I discovered seats available from Frankfurt to Athens with Lufthansa for the next days of the cancellation so I call them back and asked she don't rebook me to one of those flights? And she did after my request. I will never fly with them again.

### "no rights to any compensation"
My flight from Sarajevo to Vienna in December 2022 got canceled last minute. No Austrian Airlines employee on sight. Luckily I had a look at my mails where I saw that I was re-booked on another flight 16 hours later. The canceled flight made me miss work and important meetings. I sent a claim on the Austrian Airlines websites to which they took 3 months to answer. Before they answered I tried to call several times, several numbers, and the answer was always same "we don't handle claims, you need to wait, claims are answered by mail". After 3 months they finally answered to tell me that I have no rights to any compensation because "force majeur: weather was bad".

### Austrian Airlines customer review
The flight from Vienna to Zurich at 14:45 proceeded as usual, the staff was pleasant and accommodating. The food served on board was tasty and nicely styled. Comfort on intra-European flights in business class could be better.

### "horrible check in experience"
Not Verified |  Great flying but a horrible check in experience. Very rude woman at the desk in Innsbruck who seemed bothered to help me and barely said hello. There was no line of people in front of me and I was the only one checking in at the moment.

### "$35 each for seat assignments"
A basic but fundamental complaint. After purchasing two United Airline code-share tickets on Austrian Airlines, I learn that I now have to pay Austrian an additional $35 each for seat assignments, unless I want to see what's left 47 hrs before departure. Doesn't "Star Alliance Partner" mean anything? Doesn't status as a million-mile flyer (on UA) mean anything? This charge is insulting.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Booked Hamburg to Phuket via Vienna and Bangkok on one OS ticket. All legs were in C, HAM VIE operated by Eurowings and BKK HKT by Thai Smiles. Was travelling with my partner. We are both status members with LH. In Hamburg and otherwise than stated on their website, Eurowings refused to check luggage through to HKT; reason given “we are not Star Alliance and as such we do not” This meant we would have to get luggage in BKK and check it in for the BKK HKT leg. This is more than annoying, not seamless at all and in addition, the check-in desk lady was more than rude. Unacceptable for a business class experience. Flight on Eurowings was a little late with some nice red wine topped up twice by a very friendly purser. LH lounge in HAM the typical LH standard with some good food and beverage selection. Did not make it to the Austrian lounge, unfortunately. The Austrian flight in VIE left an hour late, due to snow and de-icing. Cabin crew was very nice and charming, absolutely personal and present. Food and wine above LH standards; had booked two "throne seats" which were amazing. IFE sub-standard. C cabin was fully booked. Arrived in BKK half an hour late. When arrived in BKK we were told by ground staff that out luggage was NOT on the plane and that we should directly go to the Thai smiles gate; also got an e-mail saying that Thai Smiles was “re-scheduled” to over an hour later than the initial booking. We left almost two hours later than planned – already then knew, things would be bad. Thai Smile offered water, juice and noodles options in the premium cabin. Far away from premium. When we arrived in HKT it was far too late to catch the latest ferry to Kho Yao Yai (that we had already paid); it took as more than two hours to verify our luggage would not arrive and sort things out with the Thai baggage service counter in HKT. Had to book a hotel room, buy clothes and a new transfer to the island. It took Austrian four days to ship our luggage to BKK (although there are several daily flights within Lufthansa group) and another 24 hours to ship from BKK to Kho Yao Yai. In the meanwhile, no information was given by Austrian, no reaction to calls, mails etc. The only information we got was from Thai Smiles “we not not know, we have to wait”. I expect an airline like Austrian to be more supportive, responsive and reactive. What I really hate is, that within Lufthansa group, one family member (i.e. Eurowings) behaves like the unloved child and lets customers exactly feel this. That’s bad behaviour. No need to pay premium prices if you do not get premium service. Things went as bad flying home.

### "both flights were excellent"
After reading many reviews, I was sceptical to be flying Austrian Airlines and concerned my luggage wasn't going to make it. We flew BKK-VIE-LHR in Business Class and both flights were excellent. Check in at BKK was very smooth and we were advised of a 1 hour delay to the flight which was a little concerning as we had a 45 minute connection, we were asked to continue with the flight and if the connection is missed then Austrian will sort out a new flight and hotel upon arrival in VIE. We used the Singapore Airlines Lounge at BKK airport which was outstanding, excellent service, food & drink selection. We were priority boarded on the 777 and met by very friendly and smiling crew, there was a pre take-off drink offered which included champagne, orange juice or water. The seats were full flat beds, slightly older style but still very comfortable for the 11 hour flight, there were 2 full meal services on the BKK-VIE leg as well as a snack service mid-flight. Food and drink selection were excellent. Crew were very friendly throughout the flight, i asked about the connecting flight and they were able to confirm near arrival that the onward flight was slightly delayed, they told us the gate number to head to as well. Upon arrival at Vienna Airport, we were able to get between the 2 flights in less than 10 minutes and we made the flight to LHR. The A320 was brand new and had USB charging sockets onboard, we were served a Christmas Dinner in Business Class along with a drinks service, the crew again were very good, efficient and friendly. The business class seat is the same as most European carriers with the middle seat free and a little bit more legroom. Upon arrival at LHR, we were pleased to see that all of our bags had made the connection and waiting for us on the carousel. Overall, I was very impressed with Austrian Airlines and will definitely look at using them again for future flights.

### "expect more from Star Alliance"
Austrian is regular low cost airline. On time performance, friendly crew and relatively new aircraft. Reminded me lot of Laudamotion which is another Austrian low cost airlines. Overall I would expect more from Star Alliance and Lufthansa group member.

### "Staff were very friendly"
Flew Austrian airlines return LHR to Bangkok via Vienna with 40 minute connection both ways. Everything was well-organized, our return flight was delayed and we only had 15 minutes to change to LHR plane and we managed to do it, in addition, they held the plane and waited for those of us who were coming to this connection. To add, our bag did not make it to our final connection due to time limitations and they informed us as soon as we landed and delivered it to our home in less than 48 hours! Very impressed. Staff were very friendly on all the flights and did their best to make our journey comfortable. The food was just okay, vegetarian to suit everyone. There is a decent choice of entertainment, but could always improve!

### "forced me to check in my luggage"
Terrible service. Thé lady at the check out wasn’t even looking at me when I check in, she was busy talking to her colleague. Then she forced me to check in my luggage cabin which was 9.9 kilos , authorized weight is 10 kg. She said even business class people I don’t allow this, so you can imagine for economy class as yourself. That was very downgrading.

### "have the right to claim a compensation"
I was a passenger on a flight OS 0392 (Barcelona - Vienna) and I had a ticket that included a connecting flight to Sarajevo (OS 0757). The flights were booked together in one single ticket. The take-off of the flight from Barcelona was delayed, and we got late to our transfer flight from Vienna to Sarajevo which was scheduled at 12:55 pm, together with the other 7 passengers. During the flight, we were told to go to gate G36 as quickly as possible so I ran first because I have the EU passport so I can tell them to wait for my colleagues who have non EU passport. I arrived first, and there was 7 minutes until the take off, but we were denied boarding even though there would be enough time for us to enter the plane. We were told to go to G4 to get our flight rebooked and it was rebooked to all of us. I noticed that for the other transfer flights, the staff from Vienna airport were waiting for the passengers and directed them to the gate. I don't know and can't understand why that wasn't a case for us, because that would help us to make it on time. The passengers of different flights should have the same conditions so they can enjoy the same rights. According to EU REGULATION EC 261 I have the right to claim a compensation of 250 euros and I will definitely ask for that. In addition, 10 euros isn't enough for a daily meal and a drink at Vienna airport because of the high prices. Also, when I picked my suitcase at Sarajevo Airport, a wheel was missing and since I didn't report it at the airport, they refused to give me any kind of reimbursement.

### "trip was uncomfortable even with the upgrade"
Not Verified |  Athens to Vienna wasn't too bad but Vienna to Newark was a nightmare. Having to walk down the planes steps in the rain, herded onto a bus (the driver drove recklessly) then having to fight to see our gate # and finally loaded on another bus!? The gate was total chaos. The employees never announced they were boarding and it was a crush to get thru where we had to check in for a 2nd time. The plane trip was uncomfortable even with the upgrade. A totally bad experience.

### "tolerance of excessive carry-ons"
Not Verified |  Short flight from Vienna to Rome. I had no issue but tolerance of excessive carry-ons led to a mad scramble slightly delaying takeoff. Crew was very nice. I had a recurring bout of back pain, and we had to go down a very long flight of stairs to a door, board a bus, then climb more stairs to the airplane. Not friendly for the mobility limited passenger.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service at the boarding area, personnel on boarding gate are so rude, needs to be thought good manners, doesn't even ask nicely and demanding, from the person who demanded to check in the luggage, he said he is the supervisor. The one in the counter just threw the passport instead of handling it. The lady on the gate shouted to not to be in the way. No one is smiling.

### "the hardest trip in my life"
I booked a flight on their plane and it took off late so I missed my plane from Vienna to Cairo and they refused to book a direct flight for me. I had to wait all night and then they sent me to Germany and I waited two hours at Frankfurt Airport and then another flight to Cairo. I had my wife and 3 year old daughter. It was the hardest trip in my life and after all that they didn't ship the bags until two days after arriving

### "chaotic situation and delays"
The staff is non-professional and do not have the ability to properly communicate with the customers. With their poor conduct, they create chaotic situation and delays.

### "Do not fly with Austrian"
Not Verified |  I don't recommend flying with Austrian airlines. They provided a connecting flight from Dubrovnik to Amsterdam and did not allow sufficient time to make the transfer in Vienna. The flight landed on time and we ran the whole way to make the second flight but the door was closed right in front of our faces. The airline sold a connecting flight with no time to make the next one. Several others also didn't make the connecting flight. This ruined our last day traveling through Europe and now we're at risk of missing our flight from Amsterdam to the US. Do not fly with Austrian, especially if it's a connecting flight. I truly don't understand why they would sell a flight knowing people wouldn't make it.

### "very upsetting and discriminatory"
Not Verified | I flew back to Montreal last Saturday with OS. I could not believe my eyes and ears when we were told the seats at our gate were reserved for business class passengers only and that we had to stand or find other seats elsewhere. Over 75% of the seats remained empty until boarding. No other flights in this area had the section cordoned off. People were pretty upset and the poor agent got an ear full. In my opinion, this is not acceptable and very upsetting and discriminatory.

### "Terrible experience"
The connection flight was delayed. I had 3h to wait on airport instead of 1h. Then my luggage didn’t come with this flight, so I had to wait another 3h for another flight with my luggage. They said its better to wait because my luggage will not be delivered to my address in 7 days. The place for waiting had only vending machines, no food at all! Terrible experience for such a short flight! It took a a whole day to travel from Zagreb to Berlin.

### "flight was very comfortable"
My flight from Belgrade to Vienna was a morning flight. The departure was on time and we also landed on time in Vienna. The plane was clean and the seats were comfortable. For short flight, they also give us chocolate. The crew was friendly and the flight was very comfortable. I love to flight with Austrian.

### "My 3 bags were 4 days late"
I flew on August 20 2022, VIE-LAX. My 3 bags were 4 days late, and came on August 24th. I filled complaint on their website for reimbursement and no response.

### "not recommend flying with Austrian"
I was flying from Cairo to berlin via Vienna, my flight from Cairo left very late without any declared reasons. Most of the passengers and I have missed our next flights. The attitude of the staff at the airline service center was very rude and disrespectful. Would not recommend flying with Austrian.

### "Purser was very friendly"
Hamburg to Brussels via Vienna. Boarding in Hamburg caused some delay as the flight was nearly full and once again a lot of people with oversized cabin luggage. Nice breakfast was offered including some hot items. Friendly FA. The connection in Vienna was easy and flight to Brussels was done in an Embraer. Unfortunately the plane was not on a gate. Purser was very friendly and a good hot meal was served with the choice of several Austria wines. Unfortunately for all the passengers doing the flight ex Hamburg the luggage was not loaded in Vienna. My luggage was delivered at home next day at 5pm - a shame I would give Austrian an 8 but now a 6 for the delayed luggage.

### "done nothing to help me get my baggage back"
Terrible baggage handling experience. Austrian (or Vienna Airport or Berlin Brandenburg airport, I'm not sure) lost my baggage. That being said, it is the airline that is responsible for retrieving this baggage. Austrian has done nothing to help me get my baggage back. It has been more than 1 month, and I have not heard anything back despite my 50+ calls, emails, contact forms, complaints, tweets, and so on. They have not even been able to give me information about reimbursing my expenses for what I had to buy in the meantime to replace what was in my suitcase. Austrian is expensive like a tier-1 airline (and advertises itself as such), but treats its passengers like Ryanair passengers. I have issued a complaint with the US DOT and the European Commission Mobility and Transport.

### "my flights were overbooked"
Not Verified |  Both on the way to and from Tel Aviv my flights were overbooked and someone had to take their hand luggage into the belly with the other luggage. From Vienna to Copenhagen this ended up being me. Having wasted 40 minutes (almost the same length as the flight) waiting just to get my hand luggage, because they overbook it every time. They need to change how much luggage you can bring without being charged or do it some other way. I don't think it's acceptable to make people waste 40 minutes because they don't have the capacity for the luggage they promised.

### "not very customer friendly"
Not Verified | Vienna to Montreal. It is ridiculous that in 2022, you are not able to let passengers check in with a Permanent Resident status in Canada online. It is time consuming at the airport, seat cannot be selected because check-in works only at the airport, and I am wasting my time at the airport because the system is not working online. I called the support service and I am just told to check in at the airport. Very frustrating and not very customer friendly.

### "I would not recommend them"
Not Verified |  Austrian Airlines lost my luggage on 15th August and on 3 Sept we were delayed my nearly 2 hours. Terrible service. They have gone down a lot this summer. I would not recommend them.

### "had lost my luggage twice"
Not Verified |  Austrian airlines had lost my luggage twice. Initially they lost it on my flight from Amsterdam to Sofia with a layover in Vienna, where I was forced to attend my wedding in whatever outfit I could purchase from H&M. My luggage was returned to me 3 days later. And lo and behold, my luggage was lost on the return trip back to Amsterdam. It has now been 3 weeks and I have had absolutely no update whatsoever on my luggage as to the whereabouts, and all my attempts at contacting the airline to find out what is happening and find out where I can receive compensation for the costs of buying basically a whole new wardrobe have been for naught because customer service does not exist with this airline. I'm reluctant to even start an insurance claim for the damages done because the process may take months at this rate due to how utterly hopeless this airline is.

### "That’s how Austrian Airlines treats business class clients"
Quick update to my last review of Austrian Airlines. So after waiting for my luggage for half my holidays, Austrian told me they would deliver my luggage today. As you can imagine they failed to honor that as well! When I contacted them I was told I was to take a taxi at my own expense to come retrieve the luggage in the warehouse of the local agency in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country! There you have it guys. That’s how Austrian Airlines treats business class clients. Don’t say that nobody warned you.

### "waiting for my luggage for half my holidays"
Vienna to Larnaca. Austrian Airlines is a scam! Quick update to my last review of Austrian Airlines guys. So after waiting for my luggage for half my holidays, Austrian told me they would deliver my luggage today. As you can imagine they failed to honor that as well. ! And when I contacted them I was told I was to take a taxi at my own expense to come retrieve the luggage in the warehouse of the local agency in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country! There you have it guys. That’s how Austrian Airlines treats business class clients. Don’t say that nobody warned you.

### "my luggage had not been loaded"
I have now been waiting for 3 days for this airline to deliver my luggage. I made the huge mistake of booking a business class round ticket from France to Cyprus for a small week off. Not only I had the displeasure of being informed upon landing that my luggage had not been loaded (although as a business class it was marked as a « priority luggage) but since then it has been nothing but impossible to reach their customer service. The Concierge at the hotel I am staying has been calling them non-stop for the past 3 days without success. I emailed them left and right and only to be greeted with non-sensical half-baked generic apologies from a no-reply automated server. And to top it off, not only this incompetent bunch has just ruined half of my holidays, but they do not even guarantee customers to reimburse them for damages to your belongings nor for additional essentials purchases.

### "the temperature was set to 24"
Flew business from LAX to VIE on June 20. Cabin was warm when I boarded. Asked purser to cool it off. Yes no problem, once we get going it will cool off. After dinner went to bed, woke up half way through the flight sweating (was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and not using the provided blanket). Rang the bell asked what the temperature was set to learned it was 24. 24 is ridiculous. Austrian does not have individual air vents. After arguing with the purser for over 10 minutes she agreed to lower it to 22. I argued this was not enough and argued there was no way I could sleep in such a hot cabin. She then said, 'do you feel how cold I am? I'm freezing'. So because the purser is cold the whole cabin has to suffer in a sauna-like environment on a 10 hour flight. I've written letters to the standard customer service team, and have forwarded comment to the head of operations asking what the policy is for cabin temperature. 4 weeks later no response. Even though I think the products and service are generally better on international airlines, I simply can't trust then to have a reasonable cabin temperature.

### "disastrous customer service"
From the moment I purchased my ticket for a business trip to Berlin and subsequent environmental fieldwork in Scandinavia, I've only run into problem after problem with this surprisingly incompetent airline. First, they informed me that my return flight had been canceled. After over a dozen phone calls over the course of a week - that is, sitting on hold for over an hour to never actually reach a customer service agent, someone finally picked up the phone and I managed to re-book another flight. Then on my outbound flight on August 6, they lost my luggage, sending me an email two days later that they had located it and handed it over to the delivery company. Three weeks later, after countless (unanswered) phone calls, emails, and online forms, I still hadn't received my luggage, only to find out that the delivery company (CLS Express - also impossible to get in touch with) had, in fact, never received my luggage. I was forced to purchase new items of clothing, shoes, and field gear (over $1000), as I had nothing with me for my month-long trip. I never received any feedback from Austrian Airlines regarding reimbursement or compensation of any sort. Furthermore, to say that the "Lost and Found" at the Berlin Airport is utterly useless is an understatement, as they - after making you wait in line for over 45 minutes - just refer you to the Austrian Airlines website to submit a claim. I had initially booked Austrian Airlines for my business trip thinking it was a quality company I could rely on. In my 15 years of international (and overseas) travel - both personal and business, with a multitude of different airlines - I have never run into so many issues with a single flight, or such disastrous customer service. Needless to say, this was my first and last time traveling with them.

### "our baggage didn’t make it"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Stockholm was delayed with 10-15 minutes, therefore our baggage didn’t make it to our connecting flight - which is understandable. However, it has taken us four days to get any update about our baggage which was originally said to reach out hotel in 1-2 days. After calling a couple of times we got an update that our baggage where handed over to a currier and will reach us in 1-2 days (4-5 days upon arrival). They also promised to updated us by phone or email which they haven’t done a single time during these five days. They are not able to give us any information about the company who is handling the currier. I can not understand how this is not a prioritised matter to the airline?! They say that they will reimburse any necessary cost, which is reasonable, but not for over six days - since some things is not replaceable when abroad. This is horrible treatment, they promise things they can’t stand by and doesn’t seem to care.

### "one-hour delay to Vienna"
Not Verified |  Austrian Airlines made the return trip from Mallorca unpleasant for us with its one-hour delay to Vienna. In the plane, except for a glass of water, everything is paid for by card, including coffee, which the airline should offer free of charge for an hour's flight delay. As a result, we missed the reserved seats on the bus to Bratislava. We had to urgently look for an alternative connection at the airport in Schwechat. If we didn't find anything, we would be forced to take a taxi all the way to Bratislava, and Austrian Airlines would definitely not reimburse us for that. We will never travel with Austrian Airlines again, we would rather not go on vacation. They should improve to a great extent. Spiatočnú cestu z Malorky nám zneprijemnila letecká spoločnosť Austrian Airlines svojím neuvedeným hodinovým meškaním do Viedne. V lietadle okrem pohár vody sa za všetko platí kartou, aj za kávu, ktorú by mala letecká spoločnosť ponúknuť bezplatne za hodinové meškanie letu. Tým pádom sme zmeškali rezervovane miesta v autobuse do Bratislavy. Museli sme narýchlo hľadať náhradný spoj na letisku na Schwechate. Keby sme nič nenašli, boli by sme nútené ísť taxíkom až do Bratislavy a to by nám Austrian Airlines určite nerefundoval. Už nikdy viac s Austrian Airlines nebudeme cestovať, radšej nepôjdeme na dovolenku. Mali by sa zlepšiť a to vo veľkej miere.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
The crew onboard was friendly and polite. The flight was on time and even landed before scheduled arrival time. I would give this airline company a higher rating if it weren’t for the meals they serve onboard. The food in the economy class is literally uneatable. The pasta penne was soaked in water with a disgusting sauce on top. The dessert cake as hard as a rock. My seat neighbors could not eat the food either. Considering the price of the plane ticket this is absolutely unacceptable! I would not recommend this airline to anyone unless you don’t mind bringing your own food onboard.

### "luggage still missing after 1 week"
I had 2 checked luggages and the lady at check-in convinced me to check one of my hand luggages for free. She even offered to check in my daughter's stroller. Very kind of her. Thankfully, I kept the stroller because I needed it at the lay-over in Vienna. When I landed in Tirana, neither of my checked luggages came with me. The smaller luggage came after 2 days, one of the checked bags came after 3 days and the other big luggage still missing after 1 week. So, half of my daughter's clothes, all the supplements and anti-pyretics I got in case my daughter got sick during our trip, and all of my clothing and shoes, altogether with some gifts I got for the people we were going to visit, lost in that luggage. They tell me to send the receipts for the replacement items. What about all I spent to get the luggage and what I have in it? What about all the frustration and the wasted time to find clothes for us when we could be enjoying our vacation as we were supposed to? Our vacation was ruined and all what Austrian airlines customer support tells you is to file the missing luggage report online and the replacement items form online and that's all. The seats were so tight that you had no room for the arms. The meal was horrible. At least the coffee was good. I had to remind the flight attendants to give my daughter the crackers and the meal she was entitled to, even though she had her own seat paid at full price. This was my first time traveling with this company and it's going to be the last.

### "✅ Trip Verified |  "
Their online system appears to have a massive defect which would cause a tremendous issue. After issuing the reservation that I have provided documentation of, I received a note that appeared to be a scam, claiming my credit card had not approved the charge for the flights I had received confirmation of. Checking my credit card statement, I was charged for the tickets. When contacting Austrian, they stated that having not been paid their system canceled my flights without notifying me. However, their agent then confirmed they had indeed billed my card and their charge was in fact being held against my card. Their agent admitted that they were utterly befuddled by the numerous errors within their system, the error in cancelling my flights, the error in stating they had not been paid, the error in not notifying me of a cancellation, etc. Essentially, she was polite, but could not sort out any reason for the numerous mistakes Austrian had made. I have blocked payment to Austrian and booked another airline as I cannot risk failing to reach Vienna for a business meeting. This should serve as a cautionary tale to check, verify, investigate, and take any other action possible to ensure Austrian has not failed spectacularly in what should be a trivial business transaction.

### "lost my 4 luggage in Vienna"
Not Verified |  It´s not the first time I have a luggage lost, but Austrian is by far the worst company I have to deal with. They lost my 4 luggage in Vienna and after 8 days, they are still lost. No information, No excuses, impossible to join by any means. The worst airline company ever.

### "Worst customer service"
Baggage has been lost for seven days and you cannot  get in contact with with anyone and there has been no communication. It has ruined our vacation. I understand if there was communication being made but there has been nothing. Worst customer service.

### "worst experience with an airline"
This was our first experience with Austrian Airlines and it was memorable for all of the wrong reasons. Delays, missed connecting flights, lost luggage, rude service agents. Finally made it to our destination over 24 hours later than scheduled. Luggage is still lost and the website tracking system is absolutely no help. Quite simply, we will never fly with Austrian Airlines again even if it means paying more money to a different airline or taking a longer route to get there. This was my worst experience with an airline in more than 30 years of international travel.

### "Will never ever travel with them again"
Amman to Stockholm via Vienna. One of the worst flights that I had in my entire life! The customer service is very poor and no one is answering me. They lost my bags and didn’t even bother searching for them or updates me about the situation. Will never ever travel with them again.

### "Both of my bags are sitting in Vienna"
The airline did not transfer my bags from the Vienna leg of my trip. When I arrived at LAX my bag was not on the plane. There were at least 20-30 other people on my flight that did not receive their bags. I was unable to obtain my bag to recheck it onto my domestic flight for the final leg with United Airlines. Since my final leg was with United I could not file a claim with Austrian Airlines. Both of my bags are sitting in Vienna. I am on day six with no bags and no word, despite completing the required claims forms. This is ridiculous. I was in Europe for six weeks and nearly all my clothes are in those bags. The airline is simply not doing what it should be doing to ensure passenger bags are delivered. They are either over-committed on their flights or severely understaffed, either way, the airline obviously does not care about getting bags delivered on time when people depend on them. I would recommend NOT using Austrian Airlines or their affiliate Lufthansa if you want your bags to accompany you on your trip. On a side note, my bags were delayed 8 days on my outbound trip. As an additional comment, the service on the plane was also substandard. The flight attendants were not friendly, appeared annoyed by their responsibilities, and the restrooms were filthy by mid-flight. I saw a flight attendant look inside one of the bathrooms curiously and with visible disgust, but no one ever cleaned it. The main meal was not bad but subsequent snacks and small meals were nothing more than a slice of meat and a slice of cheese on doughy bread.

### "This is not the business seat service I paid for"
We boarded Milan 8pm, arrived in Austria 10pm. Luggage was checked all the way to LAX. We had a 15 hr layover in Vienna - upon arriving to LAX on August 2nd our luggage was missing - two days later and they have no clue where our 5 pieces of luggage are and I have not received any updates. This is not the business seat service I paid for.

### "there is zero assistance by Austrian"
First time with Austrian Airlines and it will definitely be my last. My flight was Venice to Dubrovnik with a layover in Vienna. Their customer service is a joke, they all just have scripted answers and redirect you to fill out forms on the website. It’s like talking to a robot. I’ve called numerous times without any success. You request for a supervisor and they say there is none available no matter when you call. I held for an hour today. My partner and I were on a week long trip across Europe and I was planning to propose in Dubrovnik, but then Austrian Airlines have “delayed” our luggage when we had landed and most likely lost the luggage. My proposal and trip has now been ruined as my partner had to return to Seattle for their portion of the trip for work. While I had to spend a full day of my remaining vacation spending extra money on getting new clothes toiletries because I’m going to be here for four more weeks across European countries which I’m told they’re going to only reimburse 50% of clothes and 100% of toiletries but it’s probably going to be a great hassle to get out of them considering everything else lately. I’m never checking a bag again because of this and encourage no one else to ask well. This is gross negligence and they take no accountability or action. Even when I did check in my baggage I had issues as well. I tried to buy online for 30 per bag and the website kept giving an error which I showed the error and charges to the check in at the airport and she still did not honor the price and made us pay 50.00 per bag to then lose said bags and destroy a proposal and vacation. Now I’m spending half my time on vacation, stressed out, trying to do everything I can to at least have my bags found and sent home and there is zero assistance by Austrian. Never fly with them and I would definitely suggest never checking your baggage!

### "Do not fall for the 45 minute layover"
Do not fall for the 45 minute layover in Vienna. We travelled within the EU, and still had to run from the gate to passport control then a km to the surprise additional security check, back to the same airplane to catch the connecting flight. With a baby. Not to mention this was a different experience during the departure trip (to the same country but different airport - had to change terminals, despite the same airline, and go through passport control but no additional security check). Friendly staff onboard though.

### "very poor at customer service"
Austrian Airlines put me and my partner on standby status. Thankfully we managed to fly out on the allocated flight. However, we did not get seats on the inbound flight and returned to Manchester via Zurich on a much later flight. Secondly, Austrian Airlines said I had not paid to carry luggage in the hold. I clearly had paid the additional fee in advance and had to provide a copy of my invoice to substantiate the fact. Austrian Airlines lost our luggage. We were not reunited with the luggage throughout the entirety of our four days in Vienna. It was only when physically searching a lost luggage warehouse at Vienna Airport that we found our luggage. This was on the morning of our departure. It was impossible to get in touch with the airline while we were in Vienna, either by allocated phone number of e mail. A complaint made to the airline on 13/07/22 requesting repayment for clothing and toiletries that had to be bought while in Vienna, has not been responded to. It is approaching three weeks without response from Austrian Airlines. I am very disappointed with Austrian Airlines. It is as if the airline do not acknowledge our existence. It is my experience that Austrian Airlines are very poor at customer service.

### "The worst I have ever tried"
The worst I have ever tried. The food was very cold, airplane was not clean, they lost my luggage, when they found it they did not offer any delivery, instead asking me to come back to the airport in Amman while I live in Palestine. You will not be able to talk to any human being their chat system is useless they do not answer any call.

### "Austrian Airlines lost me as a customer"
I booked Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City via Vienna and Bangkok at Austrian Airlines. The first two flights were operated by Austrian Airlines and the last part was code-shared with Thai Smile Airways. Once we arrived at SGN we discovered damage on one of the bags. We went to the baggage desk and filled in a form. Photos of the damage were taken. We went on holiday and after returning home I send in a form to Austrian Airlines. I got a case number and then for 6 weeks did not hear a thing. When I emailed for a reminder I got a short email back saying I have to go to Thai Smiles since they caused the damaged, also saying Austrian is not responsible and Austrian refers to their own rules. I asked again by email for a proper argument (I explained the damage could have occurred at Amsterdam, Vienna or Bangkok and that I have a booking with Austrian Airlines and not Thai Smile). Then I got an email saying that they refer to their first answer and that this will be their last communication with me. What a rude way to take care of your customers. So here I am with a bag (€160) which can't be used anymore. Austrian Airlines lost me as a customer

### "one of my best flights in recent years"
My flight was good, both were. Cabin crew was nice and helpful. Even the food was ok, I ordered special gluten free meal and my travel partner had pasta. Leg room in the first, small plane (Embraer) was like really good. In the Boeing 777 it was comparable with the other air lines. Flights left on time. Overall that was one of my best flights in recent years. One thing to flag is that there was no WIFI though it should have been. And the second meal was only a sandwich and little desert, could be more.

### "the cheapest and poorest service we have ever had"
Not Verified |  This was the cheapest and poorest service we have ever had in our life, no simple services like beverages, and cold water was with a purchase option only, otherwise you get the warm water with no ice. The crew did not care if we had small ones that needed more water, you have to always ask again and again and you get that half plastic cup. For someone who travels often, this was a really bad experience and one of the worst services I have had, travelling in a bus or a train would've been a better experience.

### "the most disrespectful attitude"
Austrian Airlines cancelled my connecting flight from Vienna to Brussels and refused to give me a hotel voucher or a free meal. I wasn't informed of this cancelation until I was ready to board the plane to Austria. The staff was extremely rude and dismissive and the lady at the counter started yelling at me when I asked for more information on my connecting flight. I was obliged to go back to departures where I found out that there are no representatives of Austrian Airlines working at Oslo airport. The information desk gave me a German number and asked me to call and solve the problem myself. After waiting for a long time on the phone, I was told that my flight to Brussels would take place, four days later. No other solutions were offered by Austrian Airlines. It was the most disrespectful attitude I've ever witnessed at an airport. I eventually paid for a new flight with Norwegian Airlines and I flew to my destination the next morning. I highly recommend that you choose another company for your travels as Austrian Airlines is extremely unreliable.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever! After receiving an email that my return flight was cancelled, it was absolutely impossible to get in touch with Customer Service. I tried calling the numbers listed online several days in a row, however, to no avail, as I was kept on hold for over an hour each time, after which I hung up. They do not respond to emails, and take over a week to respond to messages sent via the online form on their website (which is unacceptable, considering the time-sensitive nature of rebooking flights for business trips). Would not recommend or travel with them again.

### "No communication whatsoever"
We landed 3 weeks ago in Amsterdam and are still waiting for our luggage. Impossible to reach customer service. No communication whatsoever. Come on Austrian Airlines! Take your responsibility.

### "worst airline experience I have had"
It's 8th days since I hand my family 6 baggages to Austrian Airlines and missing since then. I have been calling every day but they are not willing to provide update. This is the worst airline experience I have had. Austrian Airlines where's our baggage? We have the right to know.

### "causing me to miss my last flight"
I booked my flight three month in advance. My flight got delayed for two hours causing me to miss my last flight to the final destination. Both flights were Austrian Airlines. I received a hotel voucher but this does not change the fact that I missed a very important day. They rebooked me automatically and in the end I have to take two more flights.

### "would never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Purchased a ticket that included one check-in bag (I have written confirmation of this) and was charged 50 Euro for my check-in bag at the airport. The flight was already overpriced but +50 Euro was ridiculous. The flight was not a pleasant experience, I asked the ground staff if I had to wear a mask on board, and they said no, the pilot was very rude to me as I boarded for not having a mask on. Service on board was at the best ordinary, unfriendly crew, my seat was uncomfortable and my tray did not appear to have been cleaned. I can genuinely say I truly dislike Austrian Airlines. From start to finish it was not a nice experience, I would never fly with them again.

### "our baggage is still in Vienna"
We are traveling family group of four. First thing Austrian Airlines canceled our flight without informing us because they oversold the flight. Second they put us on a flight to Chicago instead of Las Vegas which is the longest route to Las Vegas. The worst thing they didn't ship our bags with us and lost in transit. We have been calling and emailing them every day but not willing to provide update. This airline customer service is the worst and the employees have no any customer service skills. It's five days since we arrived in Vegas without our baggage and begging for our baggage but American Airlines informed us that our baggage is still in Vienna. What is going on with Austrian Airline to keep our baggage in Vienna?

### "initial flight was delayed"
Absolutely the worst experience and customer service. Missed our connecting flight because initial flight was delayed which caused me to miss an event and spend an extra 10 hours and an extra flight before arriving to my destination. After speaking to the customer service desk, they offered 4 Euros for my inconvenience which couldn’t even buy a coffee at the airport. I have sent 3 emails with no response, spoke to one customer service agent who hung up after I told him my dilemma and being on hold for 20 minutes. I have now tried calling again multiple times with no answer.

### "no one received their bags"
Do not fly this airline! Your baggage will be lost. I’m at a winery in Tuscany and every person in four groups with about twelve people flew Austrian Airlines into Florence and no one received their bags. They have horrible customer service and every contact you get will send you to another contact to call. No one claims they can do anything about it. You can call. You can email. You can use their chat feature. No one will be able to assist. They should not be allowed to offer a service to check bags if they can not keep up with them.

### "Cost cutting to the max"
Cost cutting to the max. The inflight service has now reached the bottom. No more choice of meals, just a mini portion of salad, cheese pasta without salt or pepper. A mini sandwich as a second meal during a 9h flight.

### "They fell to the lowest level possible"
They fell to the lowest level possible. Dirty seats, greasy windows and walls, ultra budget service for not so cheap tickets, very nonchalant approach to covid safety measures, masks not obligatory, they don't give away masks to passengers who don't have one. This was my last time flying with this airline.

### "I have learned my suitcases were untraceable"
Not Verified |  Having purchased a business ticket at a rather hefty price I was surprised to learn the aircraft did not have any proper business seating neither when I asked they had a simple blanket nor a pillow. Having arrived after a few unpleasant hours to Geneva I have learned my suitcases were untraceable, long story short after almost 3 days I still did not receive my suitcases and no one reached out to inform me about their status. Having perishable goods in former luggage and having to travel inside EU, it was certainly one of the worst experiences I had for travelling such a short distance. Worst part was neglecting of both airlines and Swisspost bag handling team, very unprofessional and unamicable.

### "Excellent service"
I would recommend Austrian. Excellent service, on time, Vienna airport is excellent without delays. I traveled business. Easy online checkin

### "our bags never arrived"
Not Verified |  The flight from Chicago to Vienna was great. The flight attendants were wonderful. The trouble started in Vienna. The security staff are the prime example of what happened when you give a small amount of authority to stupid people. They were awful. Barking orders and to be honest trying to delay us out of just sheer pettiness. Terrible experience. Flight was good again but our bags never arrived. Found out later that no one’s luggage arrived. 3 days on my 10 day vacation and still wearing the same clothes. Luggage still hasn’t arrived.

### "AUA management is behaving like a cheap airline"
I've been flying AUA for years now, since they have been accommodating and reliable for most of the time. So I did again, for our flight back from Thessaloniki to Vienna. I purposely don't book cheaper airlines to avoid cancellations. This time it was different, on the evening before our flight, they got cancelled, we instead got a flight from Thessaloniki to Athens, from Athens to Zürich with 6+ hours layover and then Zürich - Vienna. This flight was impossible for us to reach since the earliest bus from the northern province city would not reach that connection in time. So on top of paying the bus in vain, we got to spend 1 hour in the Austrian hotline plus another half an hour on the phone corresponding with the (kind) lady there. After a tedious search for an alternative, we managed to get a flight from the local airport in Kavala with a 9 hour layover in Stuttgart, to finally arrive in Vienna over 12 hours later. I paid 200+ euros for flights that I could have had for 50€ or less with the cheaper competitors to not have stuff like this happen. AUA management is behaving like a cheap airline and I cannot recommend them anymore due to these practises. One thing I have to say, to make a fun point after this extremely unenjoyable experience: At least they are behaving like true Austrian leadership. Kudos to that. Refund my bus tickets at least. For a state funded airline, this is unacceptable.

### "Truly zero star experience"
Truly zero star experience on Lufthansa booked through Austrian Airlines. When I checked in online, I received a boarding card for a different flight. The evening before departure the flight was suddenly canceled, no reason given and no alternative flight. When I called  (30 minutes waiting) in Vienna they rebooked me on another flight. I tried to do another online checkin, but got only errors on the site. I tried to call again but nobody was available. So I had no boarding card yet when I went to Schiphol the next morning. In the night I got a reminder that the flight was almost fully booked and they urged me to check in. But I could not as there was an error on the website when doing so. The next morning I was at the checkin and they said the flight was full as I did not check in on time (I was there 2 hours before departure). So I had to cancel my trip as there was no other flight available the same day.

### "Would not recommend"
Non-existing customer service. Stroller was delivered damaged and one suitcase is still missing. Been trying to get a hold of the airline for two weeks through numerous phone calls, submitting inquiries on website, two different email addresses and still haven’t been able to reach anyone. + 1 hour each time in phone que that ended up in Austin’s red message that “they can not take my call right now and to try to call back later”. Would not recommend.

### "Plenty of leg room"
12 hour flights are going to be rough, that is a given. The airline industry even found ways to make long flights more uncomfortable as they have tried to respond effectively with Covid. Some background: I am 6’3” and a little claustrophobic. I look for every opportunity not to wear a mask. I don’t like it when the passenger in front of me puts their chair back as far as it will go into my face. But I know going in a 12 hour flight is not going to be a picnic. This flight was no picnic, but it was alright. Premium economy was an expensive choice, but it guaranteed more comfort. The seat in front of me was all the way back most the flight, but magical seat configuration made that less of an issue. Plenty of leg room. The food was good and they fed us at decent intervals. The flight attendants were nice. They provided noise canceling headphones, which was a nice touch, though I never used them because I could find nothing on their entertainment that I wanted to watch more than what I had on my iPad. The worst part of the trip was the Los Angeles traffic after we touched down.

### "an excellent flight"
OS858 from TLV to VIE. The flight had a delay of 70 minutes, but the crew informed transparently and provided additional information about connecting flights to passengers with tight connections. This information was also available for free during the flight using the Austrian onboard WiFi service. Boarding was smooth and fast and the crew were excellent. A warm early dinner was served. It consisted of a pasta dish, warm bread, and some cake for dessert. All of it was well prepared and tasty. All in all an excellent flight.

### "I will never go back with Austrian"
Not Verified |  Bad service, uninterested crew. It was a flight from Amsterdam to Vienna to Sofia May 22nd 2022. The first flight was delayed with 1,5 hour. No information given. During the flight we heard that the connection to Sofia already left. In Vienna no  help at all, they didn't care that you missed your flight. No one to help or to guide you. go there, go there" that was it. At all the desks I was accused I was too late. Eventually they rebooked me on a flight from 04.00 PM. After boarding there were some computer problems. Waited for one hour - no information given - then they told us the flight is cancelled and we had to get off the plane again. And the crew had the nerve to tell us to have a nice day and see you back soon! Back at the airport uninterested staff told us that there were no flights anymore that night. They could give me a hotel and the next day with Lufthansa to Paris, and from Paris to Sofia. I checked the internet there were also direct flights to Sofia. In the end I could go with a flight from 09.00 PM that night because they put me on a waiting list, but only after I did not accept their offer for a hotel. I had a 16 hour journey instead of a 5 hour journey that day because of the incompetence of Austrian. And again the worst thing was their lack of interest; they gave me a feeling they didn't want me as a customer, they only want my money. No service or compassion at all. Needless to say I will never go back with Austrian.

### "rude customer service"
Disgusting check in process at Chicago airport. Disrespectful and rude customer service by the agent. Same for her other two colleagues who were very slow and definitely experiencing difficulties while working with computers.

### "I was late for my flight"
I had a terrible experience with Austrian airlines. I was flying from Florence to Yerevan. In Florence I arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance for the check-in and I was put on standby. I was denied a second boarding pass from Vienna to Yerevan and had to make last minute arrangements but was allowed for boarding in Florence during the last 5 minutes. The lady responsible for boarding gave a second boarding pass stressing that the boarding is at a certain hour. Our flight had a delay and we arrived in Vienna later than we were supposed to. The airport was empty, no information desks, the screens with gates were very rare. I was late for my flight for several minutes. No one has called my name or tried to reach me out. Eventually I was not allowed on board, my trip was rebooked for a more expansive price than if I purchased a new ticket online. The issue is not even the money but rather the attitude and rudeness performed. This was the worst experience of a flight I have ever experienced in my life.

### "do your antibodies test and come back"
My review is on the incompetence of the airport staff. I almost lost my flight connection, and got put thru an ordeal. I had all my vaccinations records, double vaccines and busters, plus I had COVID in January and recovered with pcr records to prove. They denied me boarding at the connection coming back to US. They told me go out they Terminal 1 across there is a health care facility and do your antibodies test and come back, otherwise we are Not boarding you. I had to do all that in 40 min (keep in mind the fact that I entered Austrian land and had to go thru customs again )! I was soaking in sweat and hardly holding my breath! So unnecessary, especially since they emailed me the requirements and I was more then fine! There incompetence put me thru misery and they knew they screwed up! For what? To cash 35 euros for the test? I’ll think twice before using this airline! !

### "Seats are tight like easyJet"
Brands itself is premium but offers little worse exp than Norwegian. Seats are tight like easyJet (priced double naturally), boarding requires a specific mask which is naturally not provided by the airline, atmosphere is Army-Style in general. App is quite good, staff in planes friendly. Feels like it's a badly managed airline trying desperately to be premium without the management willingness to do that.

### "this is terrible quality of service"
There were no information after the the delayed flight was landed and transfer passengers to some destinations also were missing the flight. Neither signs or persons to inform the delayed passenger. And missing the flight with no proper assistance from the airline immediately. After found the airline service counter, the staffs are not responding in polite and responsible manner. I’m not a difficult flyer but this is terrible quality of service.

### "Never book a flight with Austrian"
We will never ever book a flight through Austrian Airlines again. Today is April 5 and we are supposed to take off on April 7 but we are so nervous regarding this flight so we can´t even sleep in the nights. We are going from Palma de Mallorca to Phuket, Thailand via Munich and Bangkok. Our first long haul trip in 2 years because of the Covid situation in the world and we was so much looking forward to this but Austrian have destroyed our feelings... 4 times they have change our flights ending up with unreasonable waiting times at different airports. Today they change the flight again. They again confirmed Palma to Munich but have cancelled the flight between Munich and Bangkok and confirmed the flight between Bangkok and Phuket and hope this is okay for us. What do they expect us to do ? After hours in phone (we have to wait between 1-3 hours every time we want to contact them before anyone take the call and this by international calls, expensive) Each time we ask them to take our phone number because often the conversation is interrupted but they just say "we don´t call our costumers" and the conversations are often interrupted. Finally we got our flight between Munich and Bangkok back. We have booked business class all the way but they have changed Bangkok to Phuket to economy class. We said we want our business class back or refund the money for the price different but they say we have to contact their cooperation airline in Thailand, Thai smile for this despite we have booked the flight with Austrian. We called Thai smile (in Thailand, not cheap) and they say you have to contact Austrian airlines because you have booked your flights with them which seems reasonable so back to Austrian again. After several attempts we have to give up for today. Never book a flight with Austrian Airlines. This is horrible and we can´t understand that a company like this still exist !

### "Very bad experience"
It is a very good company if you like to spend time in an airport: a simple 8 hours trip to Canada is magically transformed into a one day delay of the trip (because of the "covid" of course, but if you ask why the "covid" shifts the flight: no answer. A delay of 3 hours in the flight (obviously we warn once we are in the airport) A coffee was offered. You have to use FFP2 masks while the staff wears a surgical mask. Very bad experience.

### "should be categorized as a low budget airline"
Not Verified |  On the 26th February, I purchased a business class upgrade in Yerevan, Armenia for $543 from Frankfurt to Miami. The flight from Yerevan was delayed causing me to miss my connection from Vienna to Frankfurt. The service at the Austrian counter was a fiasco as you can see in the pictures. A lot of angry passengers and hardly any staff to assist them. I was rerouted from Vienna to New York and purchased a second business class upgrade for $584.03. The agent at the desk said she couldn’t credit my card, but gave me the contact information and reassured me that they would take care of it since it was a result of the airline’s delay from Yerevan to Vienna. I filed a claim online and received a response that upgrades are non-refundable and against their policy. In addition to being extremely poor customer service, this is a blatant horrible response since Austrian caused the problem and was more than willing to charge me for a second upgrade on the same trip. I paid $2555.47 for Economy Flex which was a complete waste of money. Seating was the same and I did not get a refund for the business class upgrade. This is a deceptive business practice. I purchased a 3rd business class upgrade on the 3rd March for $599 from Miami to Frankfurt, bring the total cost to $4081.49 for a round trip airfare. This is a ridiculous amount of money to pay a company that could care less about their passengers. They also managed to lose my suitcase and sent it back to Vienna for some reason. It was delivered to my hotel 5 days after my arrival. The inept handling of this issue came as no surprise. Since this was a short trip, I opted to use Austrian Airlines to cut travel times rather than using my usual carrier, Qatar Airways and routing through Doha to get to the U.S. By contrast, their service is consistently stellar. Austrian should be categorized as a low budget airline charging exorbitant prices for mediocre experiences at best.

### "My group was refused boarding"
Avoid Austrian Airlines, they will cost you more than you think. My group was refused boarding on Austrian Airlines flights from Amsterdam to Sofia via Vienna in March 2022 as we had not had COVID PCR tests. We had checked all website information for the destination countries as well as Austrian Airlines own site. These tests were not required as we were all fully vaccinated with the required documentation. We showed the online information and our immunisation documentation to the check in staff – but they insisted we got the test. So we got the tests, missed the flight, and had to rebook. Costs were over 1700 euros (the urgent COVID tests are not cheap). Austrian Airlines have apologised, but claim they were following their procedures, and refuse to reimburse a cent.

### "I asked for their help, but they just didn't care!"
I fly at least 6 times a year with different companies, and this company is the worst. I think the charter companies are much better. I fly with 2 small children. We especially bought seats for extra coast! The day before we could not make a check in, we called the company and were told by a representative that he cannot fix it in the computer but there will not be any problem because we bought seats. When we arrived to the airport we had to stand in line for an hour and a half with 2 small children (one is a baby) because we did not have a check in. Eventually the girl at the desk told us that they changed the plane and our seats are gone, and they have to separate us! A family with 2 small children after we bought seats! I asked for their help, but they just didn't care! When we arrived to the plane, surprise it was the same plane that we booked our seats to, nothing was really changed. The behavior of the crew on board, if you speak German your first class passenger if not, than they don't care! Stay away from these airlines.

### "tell me I called too late for the re-booking"
I booked a ticket and had to to have a flight rescheduled. I had to call and write multiple (10+) times, in order to get it done, they were basically playing “hot potato” between “call us” and “email us”. The instructions were always different. Reschedule by this date X, oh no, sorry, can’t be done, call us by date Y (which was after date X). Then I call after date Y and they try gaslighting me and tell me I should have called by date X. Since I had emails from them, I called them out on it. After the 10+calls/emails back and forth they finally confirm me the rescheduling and told me that I will soon got my tickets. 3 weeks later I still haven’t gotten any new tickets. I call and they tell me “yes, it might take up to 1 month for us to do the re-booking, but everything is fine”. 1.5 months pass and still no tickets. I call back and again: they tell me I called too late for the re-booking and it was not possible anymore. I called them out on their BS (I had everything in writing) and I told them that they had already confirmed my reschedule and told me (twice) everything was fine. And then they told me “oh the other agent did a mistake, it’s not possible to do the re-booking” and basically told me to get lost, all the while (obviously) keeping my money for the tickets and not allowing me to re-schedule.

### "their gate customer service is bad"
Being my 3rd trip with Austrian, and having 2 flights in a row canceled by them, I thought they might redeem themselves - turns out I'm overly optimistic. Not only do they have a garage business class hard product their gate customer service is bad too. Save your money and fly easyjet. These guys don’t deserve to be a Star Alliance partner.

### "their website and their help center is terrible"
Not Verified |  My problem is with the airline customer service. I bought a ticket but I didn’t receive the e-ticket. The automated help chat is awful and there’s no toll free phone number for Spain. There’s a number starting with 08000 and I called them and I was told this number is for emergencies and they can’t help me in anyway. So now I bought tickets which I have no information on the baggage allowance, stop durations or the baggage handling for the connection flights. Basically their website and their help center is terrible.

### "Never fly with Austrian Airlines"
Not Verified |  We had a flight with Austrian Airline in December from Vienna to Athens, but due to the lockdown we never got to fly to Vienna in the first place. The airline with which we have the flight from Athens to Vienna fully refunded our tickets but in Austrian Airlines we paid almost 150€ and at first the told us we will be refunded a total of 78€ (and not a full refund as the other airline did), but they told us after all we will be refunded only 8€! This is a total unprofessionalism, I've been talking with them over 2 months with no positive feedback. We didn`t fly in the first place because the were official government restrictions in Austria! You are obliged to return the whole amount to us. Never fly with Austrian Airlines.

### "will never fly with them again"
Austrian Airlines does not care about passengers and customers. I booked two tickets for my wife and I to attend a medical conference in Graz, Austria from Dec 1-3 2021. A few days before the conference, Austria entered a COVID-19 lockdown, the conference was cancelled, restaurants closed, etc. My workplace advised against going under these circumstances. Despite all these circumstances, Austrian airlines only offered to refund $60 per ticket and they kept the remaining $2000. They did not offer to apply the $2000 as credit to future flights. Terrible airline, will never fly with them again.

### "unpleasant cabin crew"
This was not good at all. Bad service, unpleasant cabin crew, awful food. I have flown with many airlines but this was one of the worst. I prefer Thai Airways or Thomas Cook Air.

### "Shocking customer service"
Not Verified |  Booked to travel to Vienna for a Christmas trip. The Austrian Government banned all people traveling to the country with a full national lockdown. My hotel automatically cancelled my stay following the rules, but Austrian Airlines refused to cancel any flights, thinking it was above the Government, defying the rules and decided to put its profits above the health of its customers and the nationals of Austria! They also refused to provide any refunds, no credit vouchers and only offered to move the flights for an extra £62 (on top of what was very expensive Christmas flights). However, the final shocker was that we had to book the rescheduled flights within 12 months of the purchase date (Nov 21), so our once in a lifetime Christmas trip could not be postponed until Dec 22! This business is without doubt the most corrupt, inflexible, customer hating and profit driven company I have ever come across. Shocking customer service as well that didn't care about any conversation that I wanted to have, took 2 hours to even get through to anyone. The guy I spoke to just sounded bored on the phone and couldn't wait to get off it.

### "3 hours to pick up your luggage"
When you have to wait 3 hours both ways to pick up your luggage, it doesn’t matter how comfortable the flight was. Absolutely unacceptable. No respect for passengers’ time.

### "Can only recommend Austrian"
Great flight experience with Austrian Airlines. Seat in Business Class is very comfortable and gives enough space. Crew was very friendly and often asked if I want more food or drinks. The food was exceptional. Austrian known for having one of the best quality in food service. Can only recommend Austrian and will fly them in the future!

### "didn’t let us use the business lounge"
We chose Austrian airlines for our vacation trip and chose business class, because we had long layover and wanted to get some rest. At the Austrian airlines business lounge they asked for vaccination certificate, we have Johnson and Johnson which is one shot only, and they asked for second shot certificate. So they didn’t let us use the business lounge, and the receptionist was very rude. When I asked to talk to her supervisor it was 8 am local Vienna time, she said their supervisor is coming to work at 1:30 pm. Awful customer service, rude, and unprofessional.

### "need to weigh your carry on"
I had the worst travel experience. It was my first time travelling with Austrian Airlines. It was a long trip from Amman to Toronto via Vienna and Frankfurt (2 strops). The first problem,.. before travelling I reserved the seats and already paid  but unfortunately I didn't get the seats I booked and lost the fees. The second major problem was the negative attitude of the crew during the flight and check in. At Vienna, when the check-in lady dealt with me in a very rude manner and said I need to weigh your carry on. I said I came with it from Amman and they weighed it there.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
OS626 from Warsaw to Vienna. Upon boarding, all passengers were greeted with a disinfection towel. Due to current regulations, wearing an FFP2 mask is required on Austrian flights and at Vienna airport. Masks were distributed at the gate for passengers who did not bring their own. Boarding went very smoothly, even though the flight was close to full. After boarding was completed, we were informed that take off is delayed for 40 minutes due to congested air space over Vienna. The very friendly crew took the passengers' questions and concerns about connecting flights seriously and provided transparent information during the flight. In the end, all connecting flights could be guaranteed and once in Vienna, there was even a separate transfer to the gates for the passengers with the shortest connections. To bridge the wait on the ground, drinks were already served and once in the air, a small snack (an assortment of small sandwiches) was served. All in all, a very enjoyable flight with an excellent crew who did their best in a difficult situation.

### "charged me for one luggage $70"
I have traveled with Austrian many times before and never had such a bad experience, I called customer service to change my flight date and for five days I was not able to reach any of their representatives, I went to airport and they didn’t want to do anything about my request even it was one month in advance. After that I kept calling and after hours and hours being on hold I, finally got the chance to speak to one Austrian representative who told me that I can reschedule my flight, charge me $144 for switching from economy light to flexi, which I was able to see on app. Two weeks later they changed from flexi to economy light again and they charged me for one luggage $70 even on their app and site the price for one luggage is $60.

### "They did not allow to board me"
This company is making up even stricter rules than official sanitary rules of the destination country. They did not allow to board me on the plane with the explication that only 3 times vaccinated, 2 times vaccinated with PCR or recovered are allowed to enter Austria but I was in transit, did not intend to stay in Austria. And for transit official Austrian regulations give exceptions from the above-mentioned rule. The Austrian rules allow transit by any means while Austrian Airlines claim that only further air transit is allowed to another country. Their staff t Brussels Airport were disrespectful when I wanted them to communicate with official authorities.

### "an attempt to get us to pay more"
My girlfriend and I bought round-trip tickets for BRU-IAD in May 2021 hoping the ban on Europeans would be resolved by then. It wasn't, so we had to change the dates for July, again waiting for the ban to be lifted. Again, it wasn't lifted in time so we changed them once more to November 19th. Each time we rebooked our flights we spoke with someone at Austrian. When the ban was finally lifted in November we considered adding time at the end of the trip by rebooking the return flight. When we called this time to do so, the lady we talked to said that my girlfriend had no scheduled return. We had previously had to pay any difference in price to rebook our tickets, but come to find out they had somehow messed up the rebooking in July, not charged us, and so had not changed her flight to the new date. This meant that her original booking was supposed to be valid and she "missed" that flight. The lady we talked to seemed to recognize that this was unfair, as they must have indicated our desire to change flights in whatever file they keep. She offered a voucher for the price we had paid for the prior ticket, but by this time it was already November and so any new ticket we would have tried to get would be immensely more expensive. The lady quoted us a few that were 3-4 times the original price, even just to return the same day we had thought we had planned, which completely unacceptable when the mistake had been theirs for not charging us. It wasn't even a lot that they were supposed to charge us for the rebooking, something like $20, so of course I didn't just happen to notice on my own. She did say that the voucher would be applicable for any flight until the end of 2022 but we would have to use it before mid-January. It was just a ludicrous situation. When asked to speak to someone higher up, this employee said that no one else could do anything, that she was sorry, and that that was it. We called later and talked to someone who was much more helpful in searching for a better price for the return trip under these circumstances, but my girlfriend still ended up paying over $200 more for this. I really cannot imagine how this could have been anything other than an attempt to get us to pay more; the fault was not with us regarding the payment and booking and the company was completely inflexible regarding rising prices. It should not be the consumer who pays the price of the company's mistakes but the company which should have compensated the new ticket fully rather than put us in such a dramatic position. After sorting this out we flew with Austrian's partners, United, and had a great flight, so I can't speak to the former in the sky but I won't be purchasing from them again.

### "Unhelpful, unfriendly and unacceptable"
Not Verified |  Unhelpful, unfriendly and unacceptable. Choosing a seat will set you back about 15 Euros per passenger/per flight. Annoying but fair enough if they at least would guarantee me sitting next to the person I booked the flight with. They don't. As a result you can add 60 Euros to any roundtrip flight as a couple if you want the luxury of sitting together. They ask you to upload documents (vaccination proof) online before the flight. Happy to do so. Except that it doesn't work and you just receive an error message that they can't find a ticket. Therefore you call customer support where you will be in the queue for 1h just for being told "that it sometimes just doesn't work" and to better be there early and go through the check in procedure despite having already checked in online. Also the flight times have been changed by about 3h, but don't expect an email informing you about this. If you have any kind of schedule - bad luck.

### "never fly Austrian again"
The staff would not let me and a colleague on board because we didn't have the right mask. He said I had to buy one but to be quick as airplane was taking off soon, I asked where and he said he didn't know. We had to to rum all over and just made it. Why didn't he know where we could buy one, it's literally a shop 150 metres from him and could be difference between making or missing a flight. And why was he so rude? Will never fly Austrian again.

### "staff were still very rude and unfriendly"
Not Verified |  Now I know how sardines feel in their cans. Extremely low space, staff very unfriendly. The food is not really good, pasta with some vegetables, drink service is ok. Boarding chaotic, group boarding is not working. The flight back in Economy Plus much better but staff were still very rude and unfriendly.

### "need to pay extra for everything"
Not Verified |  Seats are leather like but the space for the legs is ridiculous. Staff friendly, food and beverage expensive as in all airlines but good quality. Value for money: poor as you need to pay extra for everything: checkin luggage, choosing seat, coffee on board, super expensive wifi. USB charging points, at least this is good.

### "so much inconvenience and no respect for the customer"
Horrible experience with Austrian Airlines. The flight was overbooked so no place was left on the plane for me. Had to wait 2 hours at the airport for any resolution on the case, in the end I was rebooked for next day. The staff were extremely rude, customer service not responding over the phone, and it took them almost 2 months to respond to my claim. No compensation in the end! I do not recommend this airline, so much inconvenience and no respect for the customer. For such ticket price it’s much better to fly any other airline.

### "service wasn't especially friendly"
I had high hopes for my first long-haul Austrian Airlines flight. Check-in: Friendly, but a bit chaotic as flights to the United States especially with their necessary COVID-related checks tend to be. Boarding: Nothing out of the ordinary. Seat Comfort: One of the tightest, most uncomfortable long haul seats I've experienced. Even worse than many short-haul flights I've been on. Service: While I did not experience any rudeness, service wasn't especially friendly. I felt as though I was a burden on them. Food/Beverages: No choice provided. First meal was oily, stale pasta with flavorless sides. Second meal was half of a flavorless cheese sandwich. Very disappointing even by economy standards. Entertainment : Modern seat-back system with lots of choices. The flight was punctual. Booking Service: Long wait on the line with the call being cut off a few times. Overall - If you have the choice between Lufthansa or Austrian on long haul, go with Lufthansa or even United to the USA.

### "Overall recommended"
The journey was nice, the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. After a rather hectical boarding, the flight was calm. The crew offered a variety of snacks and drinks, which you can buy onboard. I did not buy anything, but I got a free drink and a small Austrian chocolate bar from the crew. Although i have to admit, that considering the price tag for this flight the crew could have offered a free snack (eg a sandwich) as well, but you dont always can expect something like that from a short-haul flight. Seats and interiour of the plane are in very good condition. Austrian Airlines renovates and redesignes their fleet right now and I think they are doing it  well. There is wifi onboard, although you have to pay a fee. I always like it, when the pilot or first officer somehow talk to the passengers and on this flight, the first officer greeted us and showed up some facts about the airplane and flight, very interesting and nice gesture. The landing was smooth and earlier than expected, not any much you could ask for! Overall recommended, although you have to book early, since the price will skyrocket if you book last minute! Service though is top!

### "I missed the train connection"
I flew from Paris to Wien for my holidays. Unfortunately, my plane arrived 1h30 late and I missed the train connection of the day. At the departure in Paris, they told us that somebody was waiting for us in Wien to help us and tell us what to do. But at the arrival, nobody was there (except the customs) and the only option was the hotel. So I had to sleep for the night in Wien airport hotel and I had to reorganise all my road trip. I did a reclamation just after and I received many mails explaining that they will treat my demand later. When I called them, they passed me from a service to and other one and usually after more that 30min, without any information, they hang up on me. After 2 months, they explained to me that as my plane was not 3h late, they were not obliged by law to do anything for me. I am so disappointed in it. The company is quite good when everything is OK, but from the moment there is a problem, this is the worse I have ever seen.

### "It was the most shambolic process"
We flew from Vienna to London Heathrow on Saturday evening. The flight was scheduled for 5.30pm. It was the most shambolic process going through the Gate to board the aircraft that I have ever had, and I have travelled a lot. We made our way to Gate 12 in good time but passengers did not really seem to know what was happening as nobody was being allowed through the gate and there was a barrier up. When we approached the gate, we were told, and other passengers when they went to see what was happening, that we had to join a queue to get our documents checked - Pre Departure Form, Covid test etc. Fair enough, but the communication was dire. There was one young woman looking after all the passengers until a rather energetic young man tried to hurry us along. We were barked at by one of the staff checking documents about not wasting time. At that, people in the queue laughed. We were allowed into the Gate 12 area once the documents were checked, but again there was not much communication apart from being told the flight was delayed. Finally we were able to scan our boarding passes and go down the escalator to board the plane. This was when one of the most dangerous events happened. As the air stewards had let everyone board at the same time, there was a backlog of people along the passageway leading on to the plane and round the corner to the bottom of the lift. As more and more people came down the escalator, there was nowhere for them to go as the space at the bottom of the escalator was so tiny. People tried to stand closer together but as we approached the bottom we had to push people in order to get off the escalator. The young men behind us almost fell into the crowd of people. More people were coming down the escalator and they screamed when they could see what was happening so started to walk back up it. Finally someone shouted up for them to stop the escalator which was then stopped. This could have been a lot worse. What amazed us was the total lack of awareness for what should have been very basic health and safety. I have tried to offer feedback to Austrian Airlines. I cannot get through on the phone and the contact form you are meant to fill in prior to submitting praise or a complaint is not available. So frustrating. I cannot stop thinking how very much worse this could have been if a real crush had occurred. Then the flight itself was not great. Nowhere to put bags except under the seat. No water offered. I was so surprised by this as I had thought Austrian Airlines would be very efficient and safe. Would not recommend but would love to give them feedback so this debacle never happens again.

### "Such great and friendly service"
I rarely do reviews but had a great flight from Vienna to Kiev. Such great and friendly service, and very good food and wine! Really tasty! It makes such a difference with good, friendly and professional service. I just wish I could order more of that wine. A very good experience of Austrian Airlines. 100% sure I will book again. Thank you!

### "Absolutely no response from customer complaints"
Will never consider Austrian again. Due to travel in August but had to push flights on due to Covid restrictions in Bangkok. I was told I could rebook next year as long as I travel before 31st July. What have they done? Doubled the price of flights until that date so in essence you pay again. In August the flights return to normal. Refund policy is taxes only. Absolutely no response from customer complaints. Atrocious way to treat your customers. I will be taking the tax refund and choosing an airline with integrity who value their customers.

### "irresponsible, unhelpful"
Currently sitting at the departure gate at Vienna Airport, awaiting to catch a flight to Tirana, Albania. Original flight was due to depart at 22:40, which already is a late, tiring flight. To add to that, flight was abruptly delayed by 2 hours and a half and we only got a notification via e-mail. Then the flight was delayed by a further 15 minutes. Again, 0 explanation, only an e-mail which very conveniently for the airline, led to a chat-bot. Passengers are completely abandoned here, with no Austrian Airlines staff anywhere to be seen. I used to fly Austrian quite a lot back in the day, and they had a lot of charm and class. Now they have become an irresponsible, unhelpful, third-hand airline. I would avoid them and rather go for a low-cost airline at this point. You pay less and get similar, if not better, service.

### "Leg room is better than on Ryanair"
Not Verified |  You can get 150 ml of water for free. This is hidden in the menu. Otherwise prices are outrageous and should put any carrier to shame. Leg room is still better than on Ryanair.

### "No free food or drinks anymore"
Check-In 47 hrs in advance, but boarding pass only after check by Austrian of necessary documentation, in this case my Covid vaccination certificate, submitted on-line and boarding pass issued some 10 hrs before departure. Pleasant surprise of empty middle seat due to A319 instead of Embraer 195 as in the past. Arrival on-time and fast airport health check - again same vaccination certificate - due to seat in front of plane. No free food or drinks anymore, but not missed since for such short flights.

### "Swim, crawl or stay at home"
Not Verified |  Delays due to technical issues can happen, but no info about what was going on. Just a never-ending stream of delays, shuffling people around in the plane. We have been sitting on the tarmac for 45 mins now, but nothing happens. Can't say the crew were rude or not, as there is no interaction with them. If you want to feel like the least important piece of cargo, this is the airline for you. Never again. Swim, crawl or stay at home.

### "lost our connection in Vienna"
Me and my husband lost our connection in Vienna because the first flight was delayed and since we couldn’t pass through customs, x ray and run to the gate in 10 minutes they said it was our fault. I really thought Austrian Airlines has a better service than the low cost companies. So, in the end is better to pay less and receive the same service.

### "If you can don’t fly with them"
Worst airline staff service ever. I was treated very rudely and told my mask did not meet their requirements (strange thing that flew 4 days earlier with the same airline to get to Tirana and nobody told me anything about the mask) and to stand aside and not board my flight. The supervisor was rude and was looking for every excuse to fight, no matter how nice you were. Thanks to someone who gave me a surgical mask I made it to the airplane to find out that the staff of the airline were wearing the same mask I had been not allowed to get in the fight in the first place. If you can don’t fly with them, the amount of money you spend and the service you get are not worth it.

### "denied that they made an error"
Absolutely worst experience ever. Customer service is non-existent, cabin is overcrowded, bags under seats, food and drinks are low quality and overpriced, no free wifi or entertainment, etc. I tried to prepay excess luggage on the phone because it can not be done online, I was on hold for an hour, then I was told my CC was declined. I called my credit card company and they said not only were there no issues with my card, but they didn't even show an attempt to charge the card. I called the airline back, was on hold for another hour, and told them what my bank said. They denied that they made an error, or that their system was at fault, and again told me my card was declined. I called CC company, and again, they said there was no attempt to make a charge on their end. Instead of sitting at a cafe in Altstadt, we were on the phone at the hotel. However Austrian customer service said that "you will just have to pay at check in at a substantially higher rate. Lovely, thank you so much. The end result is that shipping my bags round trip cost more than the tickets at over €800.

### "Very rude staff"
Very rude staff. I was flying with my wife and daughter (3y old) on transit flight via Vienna. Departure was late (22:00). During the boarding I was told that my family wearing masks not high quality and we can not board. We need to wear FFP2 masks. Somehow I missed the information that we should get special masks. Late I have checked the website of the airline, and it was very difficult to find the information about masks - on mobile version of austrian airlines website (booking pages, language Russian). Anyway, in my mind, the mask should not be the problem as I was sure that I can purchase it easily. But in the shop such masks were out of stock and the airline were not selling it also. Thanks to the people who shared the masks with us. But the story not about masks, but the staff of Austrian Airlines, which was rude to us. The manager of the flight on any my words or question just shut me up and threatens to take me of the flight. It was almost impossible to understand what is wrong and how we can fix the situation. Even when we managed to get the masks (very thanks to kind people) the staff was still threatening to me, when I was explaining that the passengers' lives could be easier if they just sold these masks. But the response was: "give me your passport if you what to have any discussion you will miss your flight". I just had to bow and shut up. I assure you that I was not rude and spoke without any personal insults. During boarding, my wife was brought to tears (she stood aside) and the flight attendants very nicely handed her a napkin. I fly quite a lot and have faced many situations, so I'm okay with some airline mistakes. Flying is hard these days, and the work of airline personnel has also become harder, but we are still human beings, not cattle driven for loading. It is obvious to me that my situation could be resolved very simply and without the rudeness of the staff, but the airline manager simply was a little human, who had power over people. This is also called the "concierge" syndrome. I don’t think this is the policy of the airline, nevertheless, be careful when choosing your flights.

### "crew do the best to make us comfortable"
Austrian airlines is very good organized airline and their crew do the best to make us comfortable. They didn't serve water as others do but for short flights doesn't matter. Only I didn't like that they accept FFP2 mask and not other masks Lufthansa does.

### "worst airline I’ve traveled"
This is my first and last time to travel with Austrian Airlines. Absolutely the worst airline I’ve traveled. Very bad service and rude crew members, the food was terrible, seats very small and tight. There was many empty seats so I went to sit in an empty seat where nobody is beside me, so one of the crew member rudely wake me and told me to go back to my seat where there was a very old lady which was barely trying to stand and let me get in my seat. So the plane was empty, what would they lose if I sat in an empty seat. And they indicating at their website that there is wifi to buy on board but there weren’t, lastly there is no power to charge your phone. The price of the ticket is the same as any other airlines so probably you could book with a better airlines with the same price.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Today, after more than 5 years, I flew Austrian again (Venice to Zurich via Vienna). Have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Crew was young & cheerful; yes, they have BoB but still provide water & Austrian chocolate for free (same as Swiss but I find Austrian chocolate even better). Planes are ageing but very well-maintained. At this stage, Austrian lounge at Vienna provides a to-go bag with sandwiches of your choice (quality is much better compared to those disgusting sandwiches currently offered at the Lufthansa lounges), water & other drinks of your choice, a selection of fresh fruit, coffee &, cappuccino to-go. Clearly, Lufthansa mainline became the worst of the whole Lufthansa Group. Huge shame on the German flag carrier & will try to avoid it at all cost in the future. Not to mention that Frankfurt became one of the worst main airports in Europe, in my opinion.

### "you have to do it row by row"
Austrian airlines is an average company, nothing special. You get free drink, meaning free instant coffee. Don’t hope for a meal. A very annoying procedure is to disembark the plane during COVID-19 is that the cabin crew doesn’t allow you to leave all at once, you have to do it row by row. And of course no wifi.

### "less than satisfactory"
Punctual and comfortable trip in widebody aircraft on a 3.5 hr flight. Plane older generation but with refurbished cabin and well-maintained. Biz class seat controls additionally placed next to head in sleeping mode, so you don’t need to drag yourself up to use the armrest controls when you want to readjust to sitting position. Downsides were lack of amenity kit (LH & LX provide these on similar routes), and no meal choice, which is unacceptable. I got a tasteless, super dry pasta dish with burned edges of simply penne covered in cheese. This is the 3rd time this happens on OS so I asked the FA why. Apparently they cater exactly the number of plates as the passengers flying, so the last passengers never get their meal choice. I prefer sitting in the back so no surprise it happens over and over. Also no ice available, no ginger ale, They run through the cabin trying to serve all at once, but who wants coffee or digestif when you barely started your meal. Overall less than satisfactory F&B business class product.

### "a refund of 60% without my consent"
I booked a flight but could not travel as Covid closed many countries from travellers entering. Austrian Airlines said that there was no limit to my cancellations during Covid and that I could rebook in January 2021 for any flight until December 2021. To my surprise they instead gave me a refund of 60% without my consent. They lied to me saying that I asked for a refund. When I told them to email me evidence of my requisition they said that there is no evidence but they can not do anything about the refund that was given back to me. I lot £120 from them issuing a refund against my wishes.

### "Friendly teams on board"
The two segments were done in Embraer planes. Not a lot of passengers on board, good meal on both segments. Friendly teams on board, hot meal and sweet to Vienna, sandwiches and a sweet to Dubrovnik. Choice of beverages including Austrian wines. Luggage in Dubrovnik did arrive quickly.

### "denied access to the Austrian lounge"
Flight uneventful. Just a coffee or water on this 1.5h flight, Seat narrow and uncomfortable. Despite being a Star Alliance Gold member, I was denied access to the Austrian lounge. I was told that they do not accept non Austrian or Lufthansa Status members. Priority card holders were happily accepted. Appalling that they contradict their own policies on their website!

### "Crew was friendly"
The Bombardier Q400 plane was nearly full; what about the 1 meter distance between passengers? Crew was friendly. Pilot made an effort to avoid the major thunderstorms. No docking at ramp, therefore waiting time in plane upon arrival - due to thunderstorm. Carry-on luggage stowage limited in plane.

### "the flights are canceled?"
Newark to Sarajevo via Vienna. I was waiting to board to Vienna for almost 3 hours that she would call my name for a message, 10 minutes prior the boarding she ask me how can you book a ticket for your final destination Vienna Sarajevo when the flights are canceled? Who told me it’s been canceled who?Did I get a e mail or phone call that is canceled? No. You are telling me 10 minutes prior the boarding that flights are canceled? Boarding was at 4.40 plane should leave at 5.40 and that was at the terminal c gate 65 at the newark airport.

### "crew was friendly"
The first leg was operated by a propeller aircraft, so most cabin bags had to be checked into the baggage compartment. Only the smallest roller bags and backpacks were allowed. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable, especially if you had someone sitting next to you. Not to mention, that the aircraft is louder than most jet aircraft. We were served a regular snack and drink, like on every economy flight within Europe. After landing in Vienna, luggage handlers were swift in returning the carry-on suitcases. For the second leg, boarding was well organized. The seat had an adjustable headrest, as well as a blanket and pillow waiting for me. Since this was an old Boeing 767, there was no WIFI installed. We took off on time and the crew began serving us right away. Austrian has two hot meal options available to pick from, however, you may pre-order dietary meals online. The IFE was easy to use and headphones were provided. The movie selection was mediocre. Before landing, we were served a cold snack. The flight crew was friendly and everything was on time.

### "I was late 5 minutes"
I was supposed to fly Austrian from Vienna to Budapest. My Air Canada flight from Toronto to Vietnam was 20 minute late I did my best to find the connecting gate, however it was the other side of the airport. I got only 35 minute to get there. I got my boarding pass and run for the gate, there was nobody, I was late 5 minutes. The 5 minutes coast me 7 hours,  I got Budapest 6 PM instead of 11 AM.

### "not fly with Austrian again"
Vienna to Athens. The business class is unacceptable. I was sitting on the second raw (2A) and the leg room was more than limited. The service was poor and the cabin crew were not very welcoming and cheerful to me. I will not fly with Austrian again.

### "crew completely disinterested"
Vienna to Cape Town. We have just landed in Vienna. I had the worst experience ever with the cabin crew. They were completely disinterested. The service was non-existing. The bathrooms dirty without toilet paper. I will never fly Austrian Airlines again.

### "onboard service isn't the best but still good"
Vienna to Düsseldorf with Austrian Airlines. Ground staff were very friendly and handled boarding nicely. Interrior of aircraft looked good and was clean. Cabin Crew was also very kind even though onboard service isn't the best but still good.

### "comfortable on board"
Vienna to Venice. For one time in my life I´m not running late to my flight as I was all relaxed flying back home in the morning and with no luck, I could not catch my flight on time as we were delayed due to bad weather. I was very tired from the past week at work and slept bad the previous night therefore I´ve asked the flight attendant a pillow and closed my eyes after the snack, which was very average for being the morning. Anyways the flight was ok and not so bad, overall, I was feeling comfortable on board.

### "short and proper handled"
Vienna to Venice. I was flying back home and was running late after work to the airport. I had to check-in my suitcase and I wanted to print my boarding pass as well, therefore I wanted to go to the boarding counter with a person. I was told twice from the ground staff to handle it on my own. I´ve made it by talking to someone else to get to the hostess, as basically by not having constancy every employee is able to handle the work in a different way, very rude and unprofessional. I boarded and made it to Venice on time with my suitcases, the flight was very short and proper handled. Austrian airlines you need to make something to enhance the quality of the departure experience in all the airports.

### "very Austrian style"
Vienna to Berlin. Last flight of the day and I was heading like all the other passenger to a destination that much for leisure, I was sitting in a good row where I had a good legroom, but I was a bit disappointed when the snack came which was a very small and little one and the flight was approx. 1.15h and I´ve received a better goodie while flying for also just 45 min. The cabin crew that evening was very tired and not very polite, but was ok, at least still professional, but very Austrian style.

### "comfortable and spacious"
c✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying for actually a very expensive price a short-haul to Krakow. I flew with the small plane Dash Q8-400. I was sitting in row n3 on the window and unexpected I had the best legroom ever, super comfortable and spacious with a narrow and tiny ceiling but the hostess which served the quick snack was very friendly and always smiley, which is not often happing when you fly Austrian airlines. I loved that 55 minutes flying.

### "they are making a good job"
Berlin to Vienna. I was booked on the Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna, a very short flight, approx. 1h 15 min, they have served a quick snack just come cookies and a drink. The crew was friendly but not very helpful.I keep flying the airline as they are making a good job.

### "crew is very professional"
I often fly this route between, Vienna and Venice, and I can always state the same, the cabin crew is very professional and the ground staff very average and low class. I can never complain about the cabin crew as they are always providing with clear information, a nice goodie and when I ask something they try to fulfill even if it. I would recommend the airline

### "The flight was very short"
Venice to Vienna means checking in with the S.A.V.E. group which is not the same that the checking in with their own staff. In Venice your checking-in procedure is running smooth if you talk Italian but otherwise it becomes a very average and not so easy to communicate with the staff. The flight was very short as usual, and the bus boarding is a mess. Normal flight with a nice late morning coffee with manners.

### "forced to check in our carry on"
In Dec and Jan, we had a flight from Washington to Tehran via Vienna. Before the flight, I found that there were available seats and I asked an agent to change our seats. She told me it is not possible. I told her that I see the available seats on the online checking. Then, she told me I should wait till the flight. Finally, another agent changed our seats. Low food quality. They have just pasta and chicken. In another flight, there was just semi-warm pasta. They didn’t have sleep mask, shoes, earbuds, and fragile labels for your suitcase. VIE airport was boring and expensive. The boarding of the flight from Vienna to Tehran was not in a boarding corridor; It was in the open-space of airport (VIE) in Vienna’s Winter and we were waiting for 15 minutes to enter the flight. The plane was small and the crew didn’t help the passenger to find space for their carry on. They just watched them. They could ask the passengers to put their backpack and handbag under the seats, instead of putting them in closets. Just smiling without doing anything. When we arrived, we found that one of our luggage was not arrive and we were told it would be delivered in the following days. The IKA security told us that we need to ask the flight manager to come and get them. The flight manager said that they can’t help us. That was the flight policy and we would have to left the frame at the airport. I was lucky that my family was still at the airport. So, I asked them to get the frames from the airport. It was such a pain. Then, we were forced to check in our carry on because there was no space in closets.

### "connecting flight was not Star Alliance"
I was at Klagenfurt Airport on January 3rd 2020. I inquired information regarding my flight for January 7th 2020. I was informed by ground crew that I would have enough time to change aircraft for a connecting flight, and  I would be checked thru to my final destination which was Philadelphia. As I arrived for my flight on January 6th in Klagenfurt I was met by  ground crew and was informed that my connecting flight was not Star Alliance and will not be able to assist me. Further, my flight from Klagenfurt was 30 minutes late, and it took 25 minutes to receive my luggage, which in turn I missed my connecting flight with British Airways. I went to AAS in Vienna, and they informed me that I had to speak to ground crew at the ticket counter as they were able to assist me. I was told that I would need to go back to AAS and book a new ticket. I am not sure where Austrian Airlines receives their Customer service training but it needs serious improvement. Not only were they rude, but not helpful at all.

### "no hotel as promised"
Our connecting flight from Belgrade to Vienna was delayed leaving us only 10 minutes to board the flight from Vienna to Prague. The ground staff who came to receive and transfer us to the new flight made it clear that the checked in baggage will not be transferred on the onward flight and gave us an option to take the next available flight in the morning with the luggage. After confirmation they also told us that we will be provided accommodation in a hotel. Based on this we chose to wait at Vienna to pick up our checked in luggage and board the morning flight. The ground staff asked us to contact the ticket desk for the tickets and hotels. When we contacted the ticket desk, we were asked to pay 110 Euros each (3 of us) for the next flight and no hotel accommodation as promised. We had to spend money from our pocket and take a Cab to Vienna.

### "a symbol of excellence"
I fly a lot in the Vienna to Tel Aviv route, the flight service is usually fine. Today's flight OS861 from Vienna to Tel Aviv was special thanks to the service manager on board, Barbara. I have never seen such a kind and professional service from a flight service manager. Throughout the flight, she did not rest for a moment and kept asking if I wanted anything more to eat or drink. She is a symbol of excellence in service Well done.

### "friendly and helpful staff"
Not Verified |  Athens to Vienna. Exceptional friendly and helpful staff. Planes are very clean and comfortable. No food, just a small snack, and no extra food can be purchased. Free drinks.

### "refuse to offer a refund"
Newark to Tel Aviv via Vienna. I need to mention that I have flown business class on Austrian and the service, food, seats, flight etc have been amazing; actually one of the best of all European carriers! Our 7 year old daughter was flying on Austrian Airlines as a paid unaccompanied minor on Austrian Airlines from EWR-TLV with a stop in VIE on December 23/24. As we instructed via the documents provided by Austrian Airlines, filled out and signed by us the parents, Our daughter was to be handed over to us the Parents at the TLV airport. Unfortunately there was a serious laps in judgment with Austrian Airlines staff at the TLV airport on December 24 2019. When we met our daughter post immigration at TLV, there was no Austrian Airlines employee to be found. Thankfully my (senior citizen) mother was on the flight in business class and was watching her and had her going through immigration. What I understand and assume to be true is that the Austrian Airlines Employees assumed that our daughter leaving with her grandmother was a safe option, which turned out to be true. However, making this assumption could have turned out to be unsafe and tragic in another circumstance. This is why we gave explicit instructions on her to be handed over to us, her parents. This oversight is unacceptable and no legitimate excuse may or has been be given. We paid $600 fee for the unaccompanied minor fee. We reached out to Austin Airlines. While they profusely apologized, they refuse to offer a refund of any kind, which we believe is owed due to serviced unrendered.

### "Very personalized service"
Vienna to Athens. Very personalized service and food was very good. Plenty of wine selection (2 white & 2 red wine selection) only airline that warm the cup before pouring coffee. Bravo. Even though is a Euro business seating, service makes the difference. Very good Lounge facility with shower availability.

### "They downgraded me"
Skopje to Viena. They downgraded me from Business to Economy without prior notice. They never even said sorry nor tried to refund.

### "didn't get any of the three bags"
Stockholm to Erbil via Vienna. We checked in three bags.When we arrived to Erbil we didn't get any of the three bags. We wrote a report at the airport in Erbil for missing bags. We wrote an e mail to your airlines without any response. We contacted blueribbonbags insurance company which responded directly and told us that your airline will deliver the bags 3 days after the arrival time to the airport which is Erbil. We stay in another city, the airport has to deliver the bags may be after another day.

### "Do not recommend"
Vienna to Montreal. The people in Vienna airport or on board of the plane never smiled at me, they are not friendly at all and when you raise a problem they never try to find a solution. The planes are clean but the staff make you having one of the worst experiences. Do not recommend.

### "Really bad experience"
Vienna to Bucharest. Really bad experience with Austrian. Purchased preferred seats for both me and my partner and received seats in the back of the plane. When tried to discuss issue with desk officer, she told me I purchased only the ‘preferred zone’ which is in the back of the plane. Email management to ask for refund and received response asking for power of attorney for my partner’s approval. When travelling with skis during winter time, this airline charges 80 euros per way. Skis cannot be checked in as regular checked luggage. Never flying Austrian Airlines again.

### "Poor information"
Vienna to London, delayed flight. Poor information on what happened although boarding was on time. Good seats. Flight attendant service - nothing special.

### "Decent experience"
Not Verified |  Warsaw to Vienna. Decent experience with Austrian Airlines. Boarding and take off on time. Good seats. Quite nice flight attendant service. Landing on time.

### "should have either alerted them"
Krakow to Vienna. Our direct flight from Krakow to Vienna was cancelled as we were getting ready to board because (we found out later) not enough seats booked. We all had to head back to counter to rebook (lady at counter had no idea what was going on because they told us the wrong counter number.) Eventually got rebooked on next flight out but routed through Munich causing us a 4 hour delay in getting to our destination. Upon arrival to hotel noticed large tear in outside shell of one of our suitcases. Our hotel maintenance man was able to temporarily patch up for til we got home. We still had 9 days left on our trip so would address then. The airline told us we should have either alerted them at airport or within 1 week of incident. The flight crews and ticket handlers were all great.

### "my flight got cancelled"
Berlin to Vienna. Arriving at the Berlin airport 2 hours before the flight I realise that my flight got cancelled. Heading to the counter they offered me to go Berlin-Frankfurt-Vienna which meant that I would arrive in my final destination 8 hours later Than my previous flight. After checking the schedule I realise that there are 2 more flights from Austrian Airlines which will happen one at 09.00 am and one at 11.00 am. After negotiating they rebooked me at the flight at 11:00am.

### "Contingency planning appalling"
Manchester to Zagreb via Vienna. Appalling service. Flight delayed by 50 mins resulting in no onward flight to Zagreb. Contingency planning appalling. Nothing in place e g. holding the next (last) flight to Zagreb Until our arrival. Flight could only be offered at lunch time the next day. Waiting at Vienna airport from 5 pm until 7.30 in a long queue to be told this so had to take an 11 hour train journey to Zagreb to make my business meeting the following day having had little sleep. Staff rude and deeply unhelpful. Still no apology email 3 days post flight. Would never recommend as my return flight is already 20 minutes delayed.

### "not compensating us for delay"
Zurich to Marrakech via Vienna. My wife and I booked a connecting flight from Zurich to Vienna and lastly to Marrakech, we were supposed to reach Marrakech at 1pm. However, due to a technical issue with the plane we were delayed for more than an hour causing us to miss our connecting flight from Austria to Marrakech. When we reached Vienna and approached the Austrian airlines service center, we were told by the staff that the only way for us to get to Marrakech is to fly from Vienna to Brussels and Brussels to Casablanca and from Casablanca to Marrakech which we did as that was the only option given to us. We only arrived at Marrakech close to 11pm which is more than 9 hours of delay .. we waited to collect our baggage but it did not arrived at Marrakech and we were told by the representative of Austrian airlines in Marrakech that they are not able to locate our baggage in their system. We then asked if it is possible for them to notify us when they have found our baggage but the representative said that we have to call them everyday to check the whereabouts of our baggage and that it is not their responsibility to notify us. We then wrote in to Austrian airlines feedback team to ask about what are the things that we are able to claim due to the lost of baggage and all they said was to send them our receipts and they will review. Their feedback team response time is really slow and things are worst when you are under such a difficult situation during part of your trip. This was their reply when we asked them what we are able to claim due to the lost of baggage, " We will get back to you as soon as possible. Due to the extraordinary high volume of incoming requests we do need longer to answer you. We thank you for your understanding. We wasted almost 2 days of our holiday due to the delay and the time spent to travel to get our essentials such as toiletries and new clothing which we did not need to buy if not for the lost of baggage. After our trip, we were offered 100% of expenses for cosmetic products and 50% for clothes due to the lost luggage. Please take note that they will neither send your lost baggage to your hotel once they have found it nor will they reimburse for the cost of your transport to collect your baggage from the airport and back to the hotel. We were then told that the technical issue with the plane was due to reason beyond their control and therefore the Airlines will not be compensating us for the delay caused.

### "wait five hours in Vienna"
Kiev to Stickholm via Vienna. I had fa short transfer time in Vienna, 40 minutes, but this was within the approved connection time. The flight from Kiev was 10 minutes late and made a remote parking. After transfer by bus, I was able to pass the passport control in a few minutes and rushed through security. I arrived running at the gate 11 minutes before departure. I was denied boarding and had to wait five hours in Vienna for the next flight to Stockholm. The staff could have let me board and my star Alliance status did not matter at all. Rude staff at the gate and lousy compensation (12 euros to be used at snack bars in the Airport). I will make sure to avoid Austrian and Vienna Airport in the future.

### "Welcoming, young crew"
Zurich to Sofia via Vienna. European business class seating with a blocked middle seat from a 3-3 configuration. Ample seat pitch. Welcoming, young crew. Catering as always one of the best on European flights. Luggage on the belt 7 minutes after debarring the plane. Nice experience!

### "the staff is not nice"
Austrian Airlines sold me a ticket from London to Dnipro via Vienna. Transfer time calculated was 30mins. I had flown this route once before and of course it was delayed but they transferred us directly from the airplane to the new airplane with a bus. This time round we arrive 30m late, although the Dnipro flight was slightly delayed as well, they chose not to do the bus (I had asked for it during the London Vienna flight) and when we got in there was simply no info. Staff was rude saying to us, we are getting a bigger plane so maybe you can fly tomorrow. Next day we are flying, massively delayed flight to dnipro. Most importantly the staff is not nice, does not care and not professional.

### "staff very friendly"
Sarajevo to Amsterdam via Vienna. I got upgraded on this flight to business class. Tho only a 1-hour trip, they offer full service consisting of a small warm dish and a delicious cake. Service provided by the staff was very friendly and correct. Of course, the seat was just an economy class seat with the middle one blocked, an upgrade is always welcome. We landed in time at Vienna airport.

### "very kind and friendly staff"
Frankfurt to Vienna. I am a regular customer of Austrian and usually pleased with this airline. But this flight was exceptionally good due to very kind and friendly staff. As it was an evening flight I have pre-ordered a Do&Co meal. The flight attendant asked me probably 7 mins into the flight if I would prefer to sit at an emergency row seat completely to myself as it offers more space to fully enjoy this meal. I was serviced twice with drinks and felt like a VIP or business class traveler. Truly excellent service attitude of the staff. Thank you!

### "My carry on was weighed 4 times in total"
Not Verified |  Flew Austrian Airlines from Skopje to Paris via Vienna. No e-boarding pass. No assistance when I left coat on board and asked right after getting out. I was told that “they don’t have personnel sitting and wating for me to loose my belongings”. I had carefully selected a window seat but when boarding, I was reassigned to another seat with no window without explanation and from the automatic gate, no one talked to me. My carry on was weighed 4 times in total because they don’t want to bother with rearranging suitcases on board and make you systematically check in if over 8kg.

### "rebookings are a joke"
Not Verified | Brussels to Tirana via Vienna. We had a terrible experience with Austrian. Our first flight had a 2-hour delay and therefore we missed our connecting flight. We received horrible rebooking offers and ended up departing 2 days later from Vienna via another stop to Tirana. Both flights were delayed again. We had a total delay of 40 hours with Austrian Airlines. Due to these problems we asked the airline for compensation and they flat out refused. It is the worst customer management we have ever experienced as they deny responsibility and accountability. Will never fly with this airline ever again. Austrian Airlines and Vienna airport work the angle of very short layovers and how they work so well, but if anything goes wrong you get the worst help possible and they will not take responsibility and rebookings are a joke.

### "never fly this airline again"
Vienna to Chicago. Flight cancelled for technical issues, but no reason given until speaking to agent at rebooking. Spent an entire day 8:30am to 4:30pm to get on an alternative flight; process felt rushed and disorganized. Paid extra for both economy plus and for a direct flight. Got rebooked a full day later, for an indirect and inconvenient red eye departure. To add insult to injury, second leg transatlantic was with lowest quality rated partner airline, bumped down to economy and a middle seat. Was told this could be fixed at intermediate stop... Stood in 3 lines was unable to get a better seat. Will never fly this airline again.

### "I was very disappointed
Venice to Vienna. The check-in procedure in Venice went very quick as I was able to check in at the business Class counter although I was flying coach. The flight went fast AND the hostesses were not able to provide all passengers with the snacks, not a big deal maybe, but still a bit disappointing from my point of view, because it´s always pleasant to receive something during the flight. Once in Vienna I had to wait 50 minutes for my suitcase to be delivered, not just me, but the whole passengers from Venice. This was definitely the worst thing of the flight as I basically had one hour in the late evening, I was very disappointed from it.

### "Food on board was fine"
Vienna to Athens. Senator lounge was acceptable, but packed. Nice view on tarmac, very limited breakfast. I had previously noticed that this flight was 1 hour late, everyday in the previous 2 weeks. Ours did not escape the rule. Late departure and late arrival. Very messy boarding (common on Austrian european flights) explains part of it, leading to a loss of departure slot. Then we apparently had to a new slot as we remained on the ground 40 mn after closing doors. Food on board was fine.

### "late for all segments of flight"
Split to Bucharest via Vienna with Austrian Airlines. They were late for all segments of flight for no visible or explainable reason. No explanation from the crew. We missed a ferry in Split on their account of being late. Free food on-board is a joke.

### "seat the same as Economy"
Munich to Vienna. Another funny short-haul Business Class by Lufthansa Group. Price was out of mind and seat was the same as Economy without another beautiful touch, anyway, it’s “enough”. The things that made it worth it was the Ground Service and Priority Luggage Tag

### "Bad service"
Bucharest to Dubrovnik via Vienna. Don't recommend. Bad service. Crew unprepared, cancelled the flight without information for me. Flight was delayed. I will never fly again with them.

### "flight to Larnaca departed without me"
I was travelling from Venice to Larnaca via Vienna with Austrian airlines and when I had booked the ticket the airline gave me as an option a 25 minute stop over in Vienna, which obviously what not enough as the flight to Larnaca departed without me. They knew 25 minutes would not be enough to change aircraft in such a big airport but they still sold the ticket. So I arrived in Vienna and I was told that the flight had left already and that the next one was in the next morning when I was supposed to go back to work. They booked a room for me at a hotel near the airport which didn't provide the basics and they also denied to return my luggage saying it would be loaded on the flight to Larnaca in the next morning therefore I was left without clean clothes and my personal stuff. And as if all these were not enough, the flight to Larnaca in the next morning had a delay of more than two hours.

### "Never use Austrian Airlines"
It has been the most terrible journey in my entire life. We were supposed to travel from Sibiu to Paris via Vienna. The first plane has been delayed, we had only 60 minutes to go to the gate and to change flight in Vienna airport, the cabin crew told us that they would be waiting for us which didn't happen when we arrived at the gate, they told us it would have been ok 3 minutes ago with no explanation. We were a group of 10 people, we had to stay the night in Vienna airport and the next day we had to fly to Paris and they managed to lose our luggage. Never use Austrian Airlines.

### "can recommend Austrian"
Vienna to Varna return. Dropping off luggage was as smooth  at Vienna Airport nevertheless a cpl of agents were available for those who needed assistance. Also security checks went smooth and all counters were staffed. Flights on both sectors were almost on-time, cabin crew was nice and caring. Bar service was offered after take off. Seat comfort was better than on most other planes I have used used. Luggage delivery was quick too, on both portraits the luggage was already waiting for passengers (probably due to the passport control that took some time). Really can recommend Austrian.

### "I would fly Austrian again"
Athens to Newark via Vienna. I had paid extra for an aisle exit row seat with extra legroom. The touch screen was sensitive but I found the movie selection limited. What I did miss is not able to purchase wifi on this Boeing 767. What I did like was that all economy plus seats had thick double sided quited blankets rolled up rather than the paltry thin excuses of a blanket on other airlines. The meal was just ok as economy airline meals go. I had the chicken with rice rather than the pasta. No ice cream for dessert as on United. Beverage service was frequent and attendants professional and friendly. My flight was routine that got me from point A to B on time. I would fly Austrian again if I can't fly United.

### "requesting compensations of 600 euros"
Zagreb to Brussels via Vienna. Flight delayed for more than 4h, lost connection for next the flight, and finally lost luggage. On the top of extremely bad service is that nobody cares! They did not reply to my email complaint, requesting compensations of 600 euros for the delay. Never flying with them again. !

### "I had a great experience"
Washington to Vienna. I'm happy to share that I had a great experience with Austrian Airlines. I was especially worried because I had my dog down in cargo and it was one of the hottest days of the summer back in DC. The staff was very professional and kind when answering my questions about my dog's well being. The flight was smooth and I was quickly reunited with my animal!

### "display of indifference"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Reykjavík. Will never fly again. They lost luggage on a Nonstop flight and were unapologetic about it and have given no updates on the status of the luggage nearly 24 hrs later. Their customer service Dept is argumentative and completely unhelpful. An astonishing display of indifference to consumers.

### "no need to pay for extra legroom"
Not Verified |  We flew on Austrian round trip to Vienna from New York (and also round trip Vienna to Berlin). In general the flights were OK and the crew polite except for one steward on the return to New York. The review is for the transatlantic flights. The seat legroom is fine and looked like 32 inches; so there is no need to pay $100 for extra legroom. Not many airlines still offer 32 inches so that impressed me. Excess luggage fees are atrocious!. We were charged $150 for 3 kilos excess weight. British / American charge $65 and Air Canada $100. As Austrian has a monopoly on the New York to Vienna nonstop route the air fare was high in April / May at $1,250. In addition they charge about $35 to pick a seat. If you change the seat you have to pay $35 again. However we were not charged on the Vienna to Berlin legs. The entertainment was good and easy to use. I enjoyed the choice of music. One can pay 15 Euros for a better meal. The chicken cutlet I ordered was very good. However the regular meals are good but tiny. The snack on our return included half a sandwich with practically nothing inside! The crews were very friendly except for a rude Steward on our return. He missed us with the bread and we had to get his attention. He kept on ignoring us. Finally we had to talk loud and he got very upset. He also missed the drink service to the two passengers in front of us. They had to ask another crew member for a drink. We were very impressed by an air hostess called Maria who was delightful. However just one bad crew member can give a bad impression. Had it not been for him I would give them a 5 rating for cabin staff; due to him I will drop it to a 3.

### "experience made me rethink my choices"
Washington to Vienna. The inflatable business class seat was not holding air on our outbound flight from IAD to VIE. The called technician was not able to resolve the issue. The plane was fully booked so there was no possibility to get reseated. Had to sit/lay on a seat that felt like concrete on an 8-hour flight. The entertainment system wouldn't work either. It was randomly jumping to the end/middle of a movie which made watching a movie impossible. Food/cabin service is great otherwise but certainly doesn't make up for the defects of equipment on this flight. Worst experience (in brief) with customer service after the flight: - the inflatable seat was broken and the entertainment system didn't work - ok thank you, we'll let the service team know - could you please provide me with a copy of the boarding pass (which we needed for mileage credit) - nope - could you at least please provide me with a confirmation of the booking class (see above) - nope - the agent kept offering a copy of the flight confirmation in exchange for a passport copy/power of attorney for my husband which I didn't need as this was originally attached to my service case. It didn't help to point out that this was something I already had. I consider this as a gross defect of promised services but there was no consideration for a very bad business class experience, no compensation/goodwill was offered and there was no willingness to resolve the situation without escalation. This was my preferred airline so far. This experience made me rethink my choices.

### "customer service is awful"
Vienna to Munich. A completely different experience from Lufthansa. Phone and ground staff are flippant and have a complete lack of empathy for customers. Reservations lost, ticketing errors, flight delays, and the list goes on. My worst interaction was a ground “supervisor” in VIE who lied about the details of my reservation and almost caused me to miss my flight. Their customer service is awful.

### "Not a lot of consideration for passengers"
Not Verified |  We had a transfer in Vienna from Dubrovnik to go further to Amsterdam (final stop). We only had a 55 minute transfer time. The plane, in Dubrovnik, was delayed almost an hour which led us to missing the Amsterdam transfer. The pilot and cabin crew told us we would not miss our flight and barely updated us on the Amsterdam plane. The ground crew were incredibly rude and seemed to not care at all. At the information desk, they provided us with a flight 2 hours later. However, we were told with 100% guarantee our luggage would also be on that flight. When we arrived to Amsterdam, however, the luggage was not there and they told us it is most likely still in Vienna. Not a lot of consideration for passengers who have a transfer. Would not fly with them again. Furthermore, it is not possible to check-in online despite receiving an email asking us to do so.

### "partly or seriously delayed"
I had 5 flights with Austrian in June (VIE-GVA, GVA-VIE, VIE-CDG, VIE-LHR, OTP-VIE), with only one of them being on time, all the others were partly or seriously delayed. The worst was the one from Vienna to Paris, with a delay of almost 90 minutes. In Addition, now that holiday season started in Austria, they seem to have a problem with groudhandling / baggage delivery at VIE. Lastly, arriving from Bucharest, it took them 45 minutes from the opening of the doors until actual delivery of the baggage which means we had to wait around 35 minutes at the delivery belt. Otherwise, waiting times between 15 and 20 minutes are normal for Austrian in VIE, so the do have an issue here. The flights themselves were ok, nothing special. Cabin staff was very friendly and tried to make up for the deficiencies of their ground Services.

### "my preferred European Airline"
Still my preferred European Airline. Check in fast and efficient, had access to Thai Lounge at BKK airport which offered many different drinks and snacks. This time boarding was organised, not common for Austrian. Austrian has its own chef on board which prepares food for business class and it is always delicious. Could sleep 5 hours on this night flight and before landing bacon and eggs have been served as ordered. Landed on time at VIE airport and luggage arrived after 15 minutes. Cabin crew on this flight have been very friendly even they could come around with more drinks during the flight.

### "impossible to catch the flight"
Chicago to Bologna via Vienna. My flight OS66 from Chicago to Vienna departed on time, but nevertheless, it was able to arrive late in Vienna. I ran like a crazy to pass through custom and arrive at gate F2 to catch the connection OS547 leaving at 8.55. No way, they did not wait a minute, they closed the gate and I missed the plane. Next plane to Bologna was leaving around 18. One whole day in the airport. I had to apologize to my customers and cancel all our meetings scheduled for that day. As an alternative, Austrian Airlines proposed me to fly to Paris, then back to Bologna arriving at 17 something. I was shocked to hear such a proposal. I also got a fantastic 12 euro voucher for launch, which was not enough to buy a slice of a pie, a coffee, and a drink. I think the whole episode comments itself. The incredible thing is that even if the OS66 arrived on time, it would have been impossible to catch the flight OS547. Let's make a simple calculation: 1 - OS66 was supposed to arrive at 8.25 2 - OS547 was supposed to leave at 8.55, closing the gate around 8.45 3 - OS547 boarding time was 8.25 (same as the arrival of OS66) 4 - In the best scenario, passengers have 15 minutes to run between two terminals, including security check and passport control (impossible unless you can fly, but supposing that you're able to fly, then you wouldn't need airlines). What makes the overall scenario even worse, was that customer support of Austrian Airlines was keeping insisting that the misconnection was generated by "major forces", refusing to admit that 15 minutes available (if OS66 wasn't late) would be never enough. Worse than ever, the next plane was unacceptably late, constraining passengers to lose one whole day of work.

### "connection flight missed."
Paris to Innsbruck via Vienna. Extremely untimely. 2 times flown, twice the connection flight missed. Travel time 6 hours longer than advertised. That has system. I'm taking the train now. Extrem unpuenktlich. 2 mal geflogen, 2 mal den anschlusslflug verpasst. Reisezeit 6 stunden laenger als beworben. Das hat system. Ich fahre jetzt not den zug.

### "Who will pay extra for nothing?"
Not Verified |  Austrian's regional business class is a complete rip-off. No lounge, no preferential boarding, the seat pitch is worse than Ryanair's, the on board service is delivered by an indifferent crew. No smiles, no words except the strictly necessary. The snack was nicely presented but that was the only positive point I could find. Arrival in Vienna under showering rain and not even a simple covered staircase from the plane to their eternal, outdated bus service. We were shoved wet and dripping into it. As as special treat, their ground staff broke one of my bag wheels. I understood then why I was the only passenger on C class on this flight, as well on outbound OS 810 flight 2 weeks earlier, when on top we had the pleasure to fly with a pedantic purser. Who will pay extra for nothing? Goodbye forever Austrian! Never again!

### "Good job, Austrian Airlines"
Bucharest to Vienna return. Both flights were on A320 with slight delay on departure. friendly cabin crew, light snacks and drinks, nothing to fault the airline. They are a reliable option on short and medium flights to Vienna or for connections. Good job, Austrian Airlines!

### "tight connections both flights"
Amsterdam to Tirana via Vienna. While waiting, I saw our plane had left VIE about 30 mins late, which with a 50 mins connection would be tight. By the time the plane arrived at the gate boarding time had passed. It then took them another 30 mts to do the turnaround so we left AMS over 60 mins late - for a 50 mins connection. Despite the pilots making up time, we arrived late. By the time we had wrestled ourselves through security and immigration and had ran to the gate, the gate was just closed, although the plane was still standing there. We were sent to customer service to be rebooked. (not sure why the new boarding passes were not already at the gate as reputable airlines would have so prepared). Here it got worse. Apparently hundreds of people had missed their connections so there was an enormous line. I would have walked away had my luggage not been somewhere 'in the system'. I pulled a number and waited. My 'turn to be serviced' came after about 3 hours standing in line with lots of other 'happy' customers. We were then rebooked via FRA to arrive about 9 hours late in TIA and I had to cancel the rental car and first hotel night reservation. I put in a claim for compensation. Not surprisingly this was denied, under the reason of 'traffic control'. Obviously traffic control has nothing to do with the slow turnaround in AMS (they lost 30 mins there) and the massive queue for the CS (they lost another 3 hours there). Anyway we were in TIA. After a day I noticed in the OS app that our return flight had disappeared. I called. The lady on the line said 'oh no worry, I put it back'. Indeed she did. As I had lost most of my confidence by now I kept checking over the next few days. Sure enough, the return booking disappeared again. When I tried to online check in for the return flight the booking 'did not exist'. So I called again. To my surprise to CS lady told me that my flight had been changed to a one-way flight. This must have been done by the clumsy guy in VIE who rerouted us via FRA. So I objected, and explained what happened. After some investigation the lady agreed with me and re-activated our return booking. In TIA airport the economy line was long so we lined up for the business class as I have a *A gold card. When there were still 2 customers in front of me, the check-in staff sneered to my friend 'this is business class'. He ignored her and we just waited. As our turn came I handed her 2 passports for the both of us. As we were the only 2 persons in front of her it was very clear for who those passports were. Apparently not for her as she asked me 'do you have 2 passports? So I told her '2 persons check in to AMS' She then started chatting with the lady at the next counter. Not sure about what but I heard '*A gold' so at best she was asking how to best service us, at worst trying to find a reason to not service us. She then asked 'if he had a visa'. I assumed she was addressing me instead of my friend so I told him to better show her the visa. We then got checked in. Plane arrived and left in time, arrived about in time in VIE for a 40mts connection. We just made it by running full speed from gate to immigration and a to the new gate. This is clearly not for slower people. To be clear: these tight connections both flights were not our choosing but were the trips as sold by OS. Clearly they failed to deliver. The flights themselves were ok.

### "8kg for the hand luggage"
Vienna to Amsterdam. Limit of 8kg for the hand luggage (before security, 2 star members will make you weigh your luggage and if any kg above, you’ll pay 40eur. Staff is rude. On the flight in we were made to wait for 30min in the aircraft without a single announcement. Really to avoid.

### "both seats are in her name"
My wife booked two return tickets. Apparently both seats are in her name. This only came to light on attempting to book assistance for me at the airport. Austrian Airlines do not accept that their system was at fault by allowing two seats in the one name one of which obviously cannot be used. Their solution was to cancel one seat and book another at over 10 times the price. Eventually they agreed to refund the taxes but not the fare. We are now travelling with a different airline, at short notice, at over twice the original cost. The policy of Austrian Airlines is costing them reputation in the market for the cost of one seat! Not recommended.

### "somebody else  in my seat"
I had a flight from Vienna to Toronto., I got my boarding pass, got to airplane and find my seat, according my boarding pass that my number was clear, somebody else was in my seat. He was with family some kids, one of them had exactly my seat number. The hostess lead me to another seat at door way next to window, it was terrible. I complained plenty of time, asked them to change my seat, but none of them didn’t care about me.

### "chose to not upgrade"
Terrible flight from Copenhagen to Vienna on 13 Apr 2019 at 0710. Austrian Airlines overbooked the flight and did not communicate overbooked flight to any passengers nor ask for volunteers to be rebooked to another flight for a compensation. Ground staff at the gate did not provide any communication of what will happen to any of the 9 people who did not get seat allocation. In the end, 5 of the 9 people managed to get seat allocations. The remaining 4 of the 9 people had to be rebooked to a later flight, even though there were 4 business class seats available. The ground crew chose to not upgrade the 4 people to business class which puzzled even the pilots and flight crew.

### "It was completely fine"
Flying Austrian Airlines from Vienna to Munich. A short regional flight went exceptionally well. We go a small snack and drinks free of charge, the cabin crew seemed to be nice. It was completely fine.

### "ticket is economy and not flexible"
Vienna to Sibiu. I had booked a ticket with Austrian a month prior and called the customer service a week before my flight to reschedule two days earlier. A flight that is not fully booked either on the day I fly nor the day I want to fly. My ticket is economy, no insurance and not flexible. That is why they couldn’t reschedule it for me and I understand.

### "limit carry on weight to 8 kg"
Vienna to Chicago, connecting with United through Denver to Santa Fe. I have a small backpack for my computer and a standard carry-on compliant suitcase. No problem taking on board coming in all the way to Vienna. Returning, however, I could get my Austrian boarding pass but not my United ones, so I had to stop at the counter. There I was informed that on economy they limit carry on weight to 8 kg. So I had to check my bag to get my boarding passes. On my last trip to Europe, my flight was late and I was stuck in O’Hare with no underwear. So this time I wanted my bag with me. I don’t appreciate them nudging me to check my bags or buy a more expensive fare. They have their policy, but my policy is to avoid vendors who bully their customers.

### "miss our connection to Bangkok"
London to Bangkok via Vienna. OS 456 from LHR on 20/01/19, the pilot announced that due to an on board computer error we could not take off, and yet Austrian said the reason for the delay was air traffic control. Therefore not technical and beyond there control. They are in breach of EU regulations. Not only did we miss our connection to Bangkok as our London flight was delayed, but arriving in Vienna at 11.30pm the airport was deserted, it took us over an hour to find anyone who could tell us anything and eventually we found a hotel and were transferred to Thai airways for the following day. To sum up we arrived in Bangkok 15 hours later than scheduled.Customer care is shocking in terms of communication at the airport. All such a pity because in the air their service was quite good.

### "they lost her luggage"
My wife flew TAP Portugal New York to Zurich and then Austrian Airlines to Vienna and they lost her luggage going and coming. I wouldn't be writing this review if it weren't for the fact that they haven't found her luggage after losing it on the return flight. They seemed very helpful at the beginning but after a week they suddenly dropped all intent to look for her luggage. I have tried to contact them by phone and by email but their Central Baggage Tracing Office has disconnected their number and their email responses say the same thing. The sub-department for Lost Luggage will also not pick up their phones- I am writing this while on hold for the seventh time and the longest I have been on hold was 40 minutes. I would not advise flying Austrian Airlines.

### "would highly recommend them"
London to Bangkok via Munich / Vienna. Lufthansa 2 for 1 tickets in business gave me an opportunity to try out Lufthansa long haul. Note, the long haul part of this journey was operated by Austrian Airlines. Lufthansa A320 to MUC was average for intra European business class, crew was engaging and friendly and the food was good. Entertainment was non-existing but WiFi was available but not used. MUC to VIE was operated by Austrian with a A320. Despite the short flight a really tasty snack was served by a very friendly and engaging crew. Seat were standard intra European seats. The flight was slightly delayed as the inbound flight was late but we managed to land only 10 min behind schedule in VIE. VIE was mostly closed when we went through it and boarding had started when we arrived at the gate. Boeing 777-200 with fully flat seats and WiFi (not used). Blanket, pillow and amenity kit was waiting at the seat and a welcome drink was served quickly. The cabin looked fairly new and was clean. Seats were comfortable and great both sitting and lying down. The food choices were great and the food tasty. Dinner was served quickly after take off to allow people sleeping and breakfast cards ensured you could get maximum sleep. The entertainment system was very good, simple to operate and featured a good selection of films and tv shows. The starts of this flight though was the crew who were funny and engaging and eager to please. They also came through the cabin regularly to see if anyone needed anything. The flight landed much too soon in BKK. I would highly recommend them.

### "cancelled my tickets"
Austrian airlines have cancelled my tickets without providing me any information or update about this. I have discovered this when trying to check in. I was able to buy exact same tickets and even same seats, just 300 dollars more expensive. When contacted them, they only provided me with vague excuses and no compensation.

### "cabin was clean"
Vienna to Hamburg with Austrian Airlines. Take off 10 minutes late, but landing 10 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin was clean and the service from the crew was very good. Selection of hot drinks and a muffin. Overall perfect experience.

### "Not compensate me"
London to Newark via Vienna. On arrival at Newark I found my suitcase broken. Took an hour of waiting at ground services to get a supervisor to tell me they couldn’t replace the bag or give me money to get a new one, she agreed the bag was broken, told me she would email insurance claim to Austrian Airlines and I would get reimbursed for new bag when I got home. Despite following up with claim on arrival home Austrian Airlines have told me that without a certificate of irrepairability they will not pay and offered me an e-voucher for a future flight. They are on the opposite side of the world so I will never get to use the voucher. Their we site under baggage damage states you will be given a new bag so they can’t even abide by their own rules. I have found them to be dogmatic in their decision to break my bag and not compensate me after their own ground services representatives told me this is what would happen. No value for money because you are out of pocket for new luggage. Ground staff lie to you and it doesn’t matter what the flight was like, treatment after the flight ruins it all.

### "refused the bag as a carry on"
Worst business class experience. Started on Austrian Airlines from Cairo to Vienna. Got on board the Boeing 737 to find all seats are 3x3 in the entire plane. Business class defined by stickers on the overhead baggage compartments and an empty middle seat, no monitors, no charging plugs, essentially a coach seat and not even a relatively good seat. Service was okay. Off to Vienna and boarding business class flight from Vienna to Washington DC. Checked in and when walking to gates stopped and was told to have my carry on weighed, too much weight at 12 kilos, have to check it. Have taken this bag all over the world and just got off an Austrian Airlines flight from Cairo and never had it questioned, went to excess baggage desk where we were clearly ignored by three staff at their desks until I asked if they were “open”, after a grumpy look one of the staff told us to come forward, same conversation resulting in being refused the bag as a carry on and forced to check it at 12 kilos. Now one purchases a business class ticket for some amount of access and given I have carried this bag as a carry on in coach class and business class on many other airlines, ridiculous it was not allowed. Three points, 1) Weight for a reasonable sized and weight bag has nothing to do with carry on, the plane carries the same weight either in the overhead or in cargo and this one clearly fits in the overhead. 2) Coach seats are not business class and should not be offered as such. 3) Austrian Airlines will not be getting any of my future business and for all else I recommend avoiding them as much as possible. Cheap, rude, and not a business class airline product.

### "Overall good experience"
Booked seat 2c business class, Austrian Airlines short haul from Vienna to Pristina. Business lounge access was easy and good breakfast setup. Spent about 1 hr there. After priority boarding got on the plane as first passenger. Nice welcome aboard and soon after I was asked if I wanted a glass of water. Even before other passengers came in I got my drink. I happened to be the only one in business class once the plane was full. Nice thing was that the stewardess addressed me by my last name the whole flight. After the seatbelts sign was off, got a nice glass of champagne and some extra water. Short haul lunch was excellent. Nice hot pastry, some panacotta pudding and some wine and coffee. Crew very friendly and answered every question if needed with a smile. Seat is just an economy seat with the seat next to you not occupied. Overall good experience.

### "flight was stress free
London to Vienna. After a very quick and efficient check in, boarding went like clockwork for a 6am departure. The captain apologised take off would be 15 minutes late, but he will make the time up on route. The cabin was clean, light and airy, the cabin crew here smart, very efficient and played classic music during boarding. Seats were 3x3 with reasonable legroom and were comfortable. The flight was stress free, with a selection of hot drinks and a tasty sandwich served as standard. Disembarkation was easy and straight into the arrivals hall. A good flight that had more class than the average budget airline flight.

### "was denied any compensation"
We were on a flight from Nice to Vienna on 21 December 2018. After clearing security, we were informed that the flight was delayed and then the flight was cancelled. We had to be removed from the secure area. Stood in line for an hour, with no information forthcoming. 20 of the passengers were then rerouted through Rome, including my husband and I. In Rome we had 35 minutes to change terminals and get a boarding pass. If we were not relatively fit, we would not have made our flight. We arrived in Vienna at 22h55, instead of at 16h45. Thus a delay of over 6H. Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 established common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. Under this regulation passengers are entitled to compensation for these kinds of delays. I contacted the airline, and was denied any compensation as according to the airline the cancellation was due to: "Unfortunately, according to EU Regulation 261/04, paragraphs 14 & 15, we cannot provide compensation for the flight irregularity that has remained because the reason for cancelling the flight was the weather condition. Meteorological conditions are beyond the control of the airline and exclude the obligations of the airline" I asked for clear evidence of weather conditions incompatible with the safe operation of our flight, as to my knowledge, the weather at the time was fine, and other airlines were operating flights as normal, taking off from Nice and landing in Vienna, while ours was disrupted. My request for information was denied. Surely, if you could not fly due to the weather this information will be on hand and easy to give to disgruntled passengers. Why refuse to give this information, unless you have something to hide or just do not want to comply with EU rules?

### "the level of rudeness"
Vilnius to Cape Town via Vienna. I was shocked at the level of rudeness from the staff. I got drinks spilt on me without even an acknowledgement, nevertheless, a 'sorry'; I got side-eyed for asking extra salt and pepper and an additional water cup; I got literally shouted at for what I can only assume not leaving the toilet 'midway' since the "go to seat" light turned on while I was in the toilet. This was my first time flying this airline and I regret the last. An 11-hour flight is painful as it is without being treated so rudely.

### "cancelled or delayed flights"
Austrian cancelled or delayed flights to Frankfurt, however on the same day most flights from other companies landed and started in Innsbruck. At the time of check in, no Information from the staff was given. Most officials who are appointed at counters in Innsbruck appear completely disinterested and show no motivation. Questions about the reasons for delay could not be answered. Then several wrong Information about actual departing time were given. At the time of boarding, no Information about connections in Frankfurt could be provided. When this was mentioned in the aircraft to purser, she suggested to contact ground staff. 30 minutes after boarding, the flight was cancelled and passengers returned to the main hall. There was no organized rebooking so that the passengers without priority were served first. Even after 100 minutes waiting, there was absolutely no progress for most urgent connections. For flights from and to INN, this airline should be avoided because of poor ground operation service.

### "Very frustrated"
My friend and I took a trip to Russia flying with Austrian Airlines. We flew from Chicago to St Petersburg connecting through Vienna. We got to Vienna 4 hours before our flight to St. Petersburg. Austrian Airlines cancelled the flight to St. Petersburg and rebooked us with another airline Aeroflot reassured us that our luggage would be transferred with no worries. Well the luggage did not arrive with us in St. Petersburg. Filed report but did not get the luggage until day 8 of our 10 days trip. Had to buy some clothes. Tried to resolve the situation with the airline requesting reimbursement for money spent on clothes but no luck. Instead Austrian Airlines blamed us for missing our flight when we arrived in Vienna 4 hours before the scheduled flight that they cancelled. Very frustrated and that is why I am writing this review.

### "arrived in Zurich with 14 hours delay"
Budapest to Zurich via Vienna. A complete disaster due to late arrival of the aircraft I lost my connection and I had to stay overnight in Vienna. I arrived in Zurich with 14 hours delay and my bag was delayed.

### "nice and smiling to each guest"
I flew back home with the usual flight from Vienna to Venice. The reviews are getting really shorter as the flight experience is basically all the same. I would just like to highlight that as usual on every flight with Austrian, I´ve picked about 12 in 2018, the ground staff is rude and not willing to help, versus on board they are really nice and smiling to each guest. This time it was just offered one choice of snack, just sweet, which isn´t that great. The captain as well is making also his announcements which are really well and professionally made. I know what to expect so, I would say I could recommend as an average airlines, although it´s quite expensive for the little flight with the little offers.

### "unfriendly customer service"
Most unfriendly customer service we ever had! As human errors happen I fatfingered my wife's surname (missed the last three letters). We tried to fix that problems with Austrian Airlines customer service but all they replied was that it is possible to purchase a new ticket and told us it is not their problem but ours.

### "not show any willingness to help"
Innsbruck to Zagreb via Vienna. For a short trip from Innsbruck to VIE, Austrian sent an Airbus although there were not more than 30% passengers so that their flight management is completely unclear. Because of late arrival from Vienna, departure from Innsbruck was delayed 80 minutes. No supervisor was available at the gate in Innsbruck although it was promised that she will help customers with connections. No SMS or Emails regarding connections were received. Purser during the flight was completely unhelpful. Although it was told that during next two days most connections are completely booked, she did not show any willingness to help. In Vienna they removed passengers with gold status from the connecting flight although boarding was still in progress upon arrival. The supervisor promised help with rebooking so that arrival was possible only 18 hours after original time. He did not take care about luggage. Their staff is unhelpful and there is no email or feedback service during the weekend.

### "Overall, highly recommended"
Newark to Vienna. First time flying with Austrian but not the last. Very pleasant trip from back in the cheap seats. Cabin crew relaxed, friendly and professional. Food and drink adequate for the class of service. Triangular food containers a neat touch. Cabin appeared recently refurbished. Standard seats had plenty of pitch and width. IFE was up to date but my wife's was inop on the way out. EWR departure very convenient for us vs JFK. Express train from VIE to city center convenient, clean and very reasonable. For return flight, checked in at the train station saving time at the airport. Overall, highly recommended.

### "I am completely disappointed"
Vienna to Sofia. I am completely disappointed from this airline. Rude staff, long delays and even though I pre-booked seats, the selected seat number was changed in the very last second. An act which caused a huge inconvenience to myself and the person I travelled with. For a first time in my life I used this company and I will never use Austrian Airlines again. Haven't been more disappointed.

### "realize that I made a mistake"
Vienna to Sofia booked for 30 November. I got really disappointed today. My problem was realized one day before the flight. I feel as if I paid for service that I cannot use. I am really disappointed even though I realize that I made a mistake, but the company had all my information and it just took my money without trying to help me!

### "customer service is unacceptable"
Not Verified |  I have not yet even flown and the customer service is unacceptable. I have been begging to upgrade my cabin for weeks. When I booked (via United), I was not advised that upgrading to a different class of service would be virtually impossible. Not being familiar with Austrian Airlines terminology for cabins, I would have booked an upgrade initially but did not. Here is a customer offering to spend additional money on a flight and no one will take it. I can apparently only upgrade when I arrive at the connection, less then 2 hours before the flight when all upgraded seats will most likely be taken. The airline must be doing very well to turn down a request to hand over more cash.

### "Cabin crew friendly enough"
Vienna to London. The flight was pretty well fully booked. Rather cramped seating, but at least I had a window seat. We were around 15 min late on departure and eventually arrived about 30 min late on scheduled ETA. Cabin crew were friendly enough, but the 'in flight meal' was frankly ridiculous. All that was on offer for this 90 min flight was either an apple or a chocolate bar, plus the usual drinks. I'd had to do some work in the Austrian Airlines business lounge at Vienna - and there'd been little to eat there either.

### "avoid Austrian in the future"
Amman to Vienna. Three words to describe this flight: cheap, cheap, cheap. The sad part is it is clear that it is not the flight but the airline that is the problem. We were crammed in like sardines. I like to work on the plane, but this is near impossible because there is no leg room between seats. No USB ports to charge your phone, no plugs to keep your laptop charged up, no TV screens to watch a movie (that's right, neither seatback or the old fashioned movie screens. Nothing). You can use their wifi to stream movies, but they expect you to pay for that. The worst was the food, it is good that at least they serve a meal (only one option) but it is likely that this is because their competitors do as well. I have never seen an airline meal that reeked of cheap like this one before. As far as I could tell, it had only four ingredients: A ton of salt, pasta cheese and turkey (the deli meat kind). They ran out of wine and beer by the meal time. I think I managed to get one of the last beers on the plane only because I had selected a seat close to the front. Just the week before, I flew British Airways from London to Amman in Economy. The food was seriously delicious (and culturally appropriate) not to mention that there were USB ports and seat back TVs in economy class. I would avoid Austrian in the future. My best guess is that the Lufthansa group has designated Austrian as their low budget carrier.

### "Austrian Airlines delayed again"
Amsterdam to Vienna. Austrian Airlines delayed again. I do not remember the last time that Austrian was on time. I recommend to fly with KLM on the route from AMS-VIE if you can. Last time I'm going with Austrian.

### "careless and ignore customers"
Toronto to Vienna via Amman. I have tried more than 15 different airlines in my life, including several trips on Austrian Airlines, and with no doubt it is the absolute worst (worse than economy airlines if I may articulate). It is difficult to know where exactly to start, but I'm going to make it brief: Their staff, on-board and ground, are rude and dishonest! They are careless and ignore customers' requests and objections! What can I say about their (trans-Atlantic) stale so-called breakfast: A muffin! You carry people over the ocean and feed them a stale muffin for breakfast after +8 hours of flying, +6 hours of them without food! Nothing else?! And without getting into their slightly-shorter-but-still-long-and-boring almost 5 hour flights with no entertainment and tiny seats where people are cramped like sardines. And one can never forget their globally infamous, greasy, revolting pasta that they serve on every single flight for lunch, dinner, and sometimes breakfast. I wish to never, ever travel with Austrian Airlines again and if for whatever reason I book and discover my booking is with your horrid airline I will do my best to change it.

### "they do a good job"
Vienna to Venice. I often fly this route, this time on the flight OS521. What´s disappointing is that at check in  it´s basically all self service. The help not always  good, especially in the morning, where you will find many people. The flight is as usual, really on time, hostess are still smiling and they do a good job in a really short time.

### "not able to choose my seat"
Amsterdam to Vienna. I booked my flight two days prior departure, and chose the Economy classic, as I could choose my seat and check in one piece of luggage - but I was not able to choose my seat until my flight. I tried to call Austrian airlines but they never picked up, after 15-20 min in the line I gave it up. Unfortunately, my train to Amsterdam had a terrible delay so I was forced to just check in my suitcase and run to my gate, therefore i was lucky that I a window seat. At the check in counter, the gentleman, not from Austrian Airlines was really polite, but not so attentive to my items that I had. Once in the plane, the legroom and the space of the aircraft was good. As I was hungry and thirsty I was expecting at least a little sandwich/snack, but it was a chocolate bar with a soft drink, disappointing as the week before I flew with them for neither one hour, between vienna and Venice and we got a chocolate croissant. I understand that it was the last flight of the day, but they did not met my expectations. The captain was really nice when he was speaking at the microphone. I tried the Wifi as they promoted, but it never worked for me.

### "extra price is worth paying for"
London to Bangkok via Vienna. I was very keen to try out the new premium economy product. Heathrow Terminal 2 (of which star alliance carriers use) is quite a pain to use, but there is high efficiency. I boarded the flight to Vienna, and sat in my pre-paid exit row seat, which cost a reasonable £20. However the person next to me was spreading his legs so I didn’t have the most comfortable flight. The flight attendants were courteous on this flight but service was slightly slow. I had preordered a schnitzel which tasted amazing, almost as if it came out of a fine dining restaurant. It felt very fine dining-There was even a tablecloth and it came with silverware and a cloth napkin! A good way to spend £12. As Austrian had cancelled my previous flight, I was rebooked onto an earlier one which made my connection in Vienna 7 hours, and I paid lounge access for the Austrian Lounge, which was a great place to spend a couple of hours. Turns out there was no time limit, when they asked me where I was flying to, they responded “oh, well you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the lounge!” Shower facilities lacking, the shower felt like an ibis hotel bathroom without any amenities (you could ask for razors or toothbrushes at reception) i was given priority boarding, and the cabin was less than half full. In fact, all of the solo travellers had seats next to them empty. I was sat in 10A, which I found out I didn’t like, as initially I thought getting the front row with a leg rest would be good, however the row behind me with only a footrest turned out to be much more comfortable. Recline was reasonable, and I think these seats are equivalent to regional business class seats. There was a physical partition between premium economy and economy but there weren’t any curtains drawn. The plane was 18 years old, and the cabin senior said that its refurbished every 2 years. I couldn’t find any way to fault the cabin crew, but rather, the airline. This aircraft was terribly understaffed. For the standard 14 crew it needed, only 9 were present. When I had finished my meal, the crew had only made it 3/4 of the way to feed the cabin. The meals were of good quality, pretty much business class quality but quantity lacking as I fell asleep still hungry. Breakfast was quite filling and tasted good, to supplement the small dinner. There were three options for each meal. Entertainment was fine, but the remote control is a very funny and confusing design, but the touch screen worked well, rendering it useless. As I took my own personal pillows on the flight however, The position underneath the armrest made me accidentally hit it a couple of times. The cabin senior was one of the best cabin crew I’ve met in a while. I cannot fault the crew at all. I cannot fault Austrian’s premium economy product and I’d agree that the extra price is worth paying for. However, if the airline could make improvements administratively, they would do very very well.

### "my luggage missed connecting flight"
London to Dubrovnik via Vienna. Flight delayed in London and with short layover in Vienna making the connection was at risk. When asked onboard, flight attendants had no idea about connections. Shortly before landing advised gate number for connecting flight and simply said Run. Ended up making the connecting flight, however, my luggage missed connecting flight in Vienna as Austrian Airlines failed to tag it advising of connection, let alone this having a short connection time. Obviously airline knew where bag was when filing claim in Dubrovnik. Initial information was for luggage to arrive that night via Zagreb. Later had to find out bag was sent to Munich for a day before onward journey to Dubrovnik. As a result bag won't arrive at destination until more than 36 hours late, whereas sending it on the same flight a day later would've been faster and the sensible thing to do. What's worse is there's no-one to talk to, everything is just done via forms on their website, including any compensation claims. Terrible service and an airline to avoid at all cost!

### "unable to do web check-in"
I have never encountered such terrible service, with very little desire to help. I am booked to fly New York to Vienna Vienna economy premium. For some reason, I was unable to do web check-in and reserve my seat in advance. Contacted their customer support and was answered that this is an optional service that I don’t have to take advantage of. When I tried messaging online, I was answered that no window seat is available because everything was already taken. When I asked to use my miles and upgrade to business, I was told  that I should contact Miles and More. Deeply disappointed even before going on the flight.

### "moved us to different seats"
Travelling in a group of three with three different reservations, we pre-selected our seats, paying 17 Euros each in order to be able to seat together. Upon checking we realised that they had allocated two of the seats to other passengers and had moved us to different seats (of the same category). Their call centre they advised that they are only able to guarantee the seat category (i.e. aisle, middle or window) and not the seat number. Both the cabin crew and the ground staff seem uninterested. The Senator Lounge in Vienna was a major disappointment.

### "efficient and very friendly"
Very good Business Class Product with great food. The late night flight from Vienna to Bangkok was very nice with a lot of Austrian Culture and "Specialities" on Board. Austrian Airlines has a chef on board in business class: the food - especially the Austrian Dishes - was very good and very different from the usual airline food. The "Tafelspitz" from veal was one of the best dishes I have ever enjoyed on a flight. And all the special Coffee Dishes on offer: one felt like being in a Coffee House in Vienna. The staff were very Austrian, very efficient and very friendly with all the charm and friendliness of Austrian hospitality. The entertainment system had a limited offering: Especially the classical music section was very disappointing: No opera, no operette, no symphony from Mozart, Beethoven, Strauss? The Seat was fine, but not very comfortable in the bed position. All in all as outstanding and unforgettable Experience of Austrian hospitality up in the Air!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Los Angeles to Vienna. Even though flight were on time the service seemed unprofessional and unorganised. One of the hostess was so rude. Me and my friend were asking for food she neither spoke with us nor say anything. She just brought us food after that she even say nothing. Her attitude was wired. After our lunch we had to wait 20-30 minute so that some one will come and pick up our empty tray.

### "expect to be treated better"
Vienna to Toronto. As a Star Alliance Gold member I expect to be treated better but instead worse than anybody else. Not only was I seated at row 30 and on an aisle seat which the airline claimed it was the best they could do but also they did not wait for my connection which was late not helped in any way to make things at least inconvenient as possible. Also they should be more precise with their information about how many luggage are allowed without charge for Star Alliance Gold members and not charge them when they claim 2 are allowed when in reality none are allowed. This is called false advertising.

### "no inflight entertainment"
Tel Aviv to London via Vienna. I'd heard good things about Austrian Airlines, so was keen to try them out - I was however thoroughly disappointed. Selling themselves as being a full service airline, with fares to match - I would have expected the onboard experience to be much better. In terms of food/drink on the 4 hour flight from Tel Aviv we were served a small plate of pasta, along with warm beer and drinks poured into cups from cans - no spirits at all. The seating on the board is incredibly hard and uncomfortable, they offer no inflight entertainment on 3hr 40 mins flight. Connection in Vienna was unnecessarily chaotic and we arrived into Heathrow about 40 minutes late. I won't be flying with Austrian Airlines again, incredibly disappointing and average airline.

### "lengthy verification procedure"
Vienna to Geneva. I appreciate Austrian in many ways. However one small thing could be definitely improved which is the lengthy verification procedure when accessing the senator launch. In all other places boarding pass with the status printed on the boarding pass is fine. Austrian requires status passengers to show their status card in addition. This is not only not logical it also is inconvenient. Perhaps somebody from Austrian may want to pay attention to this.

### "I had 2kg overweight"
Overpriced airline with no extra service. Paid €350 for a flight from Innsbruck to Split via Vienna not including hand luggage. I had 2kg overweight (10kg instead of 8kg) and the only option they gave me is pay 40€ more for one direction (so €80 in total). Very disappointing service.

### "crew were very attentive and helpful"
Vienna to Manchester. Boarding went smoothly and was very efficiently done by the ground staff. Legroom on the A320 could have been better but was enough for a 2 hour flight. The crew were very attentive and helpful. From take-off to landing, they were working non-stop serving us drinks and snacks and dealing with all of our requests. We were offered a choice of a sweet or savoury snack along with refreshments. (We were given two drinks the first time, one from the first crew and one from the second). We were then given refreshments again 20 minutes later, which is not something that would be done on many European airlines. Austrian’s service in-flight is outstanding and their crew is very friendly, it is an absolute joy to fly with them.

### "in-flight service was limited"
Flew from Kiev to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Flight was on time, in-flight service was limited to a somewhat tasteless muffin and drinks, though beer was available and free. Vienna airport is quite efficient, with short lines at immigration, baggage delivery was very fast. I was outside with my luggage just 15 minutes after leaving the plane.

### "service was outstanding"
Vienna to London Heathrow. Check-in was somewhat efficient, although I am not a huge fan of the self-service kiosks at Vienna Airport. Boarding was via bus boarding, very efficient and speedy, which is something that has been consistent in my previous experiences with Austrian Airlines. Unfortunately, just as we were about to depart, a fellow passenger had a medical emergency and had to be escorted off the aircraft and to the nearest hospital. In addition, we were forced to return to the gate and unload the gentleman's luggage. It is evident that Austrian Airlines has been trained for situations like this, as they handled the situation professionally. During this time of waiting for unloading the luggage, they served drinks and refreshments. Eventually, after around an hour and a half on the ground, we finally took off. The seat was relatively basic, and legroom was rather limited (I'm tall so this didn't help). I had an aisle seat for this flight. Every single seat on this flight was filled. The inflight service was outstanding. We were served a second round of refreshments (the first round was on the ground), and eventually we had a choice of a sweet snack (Manner hazelnut wafer bar) or a salty snack (pretzels). I opted for the sweet snack with some traditional Austrian Almdudler, an herb lemonade. There was no entertainment on this flight. We landed in London an hour and a half behind schedule. Overall, bad luck came our way but Austrian's outstanding crew handled the situation very well. Austrian's hard product (the seats) need some improvement, however their staff have been consistently fantastic on all of my previous flights with them. I look forward to flying Austrian again.

### "flight was as usual really nice"
Venice to Vienna. I´m flying this route quite often, because it´s the only way to arrive quickly in Vienna, but spending a lot of Money. In Venice, Austrian Airlines wants to be different therefore they are not making the check in with Lufthansa and Swiss, as Star Alliance partner, which can be ok, but the check in Experience is bad. At the check in counter you find staff from Venice airport, which is not meeting the standards of the airline. During check in I arrived and the Gentleman asked me for an ID, and suddenly an other passenger interrupted my check in because he wanted to make his own. I was shocked as I started complaining to him, and the operator just asked him to go away, but as he other passenger did not care he stood there, and the operator did not do anything. Now my question is, why there was not a reaction, my check in was almost over, but my privacy was violated. Anyway the flight, unfortunately too short was as usual really nice and ok, cleanliness really good, as well the cabin staff attitude they are smiling quite always and really polite to everyone.

### "most definitely recommend"
Flight OS82 from Los Angeles to Vienna. I have flown this route (Vienna/Los Angeles) only once, so I was interested to see how Austrian's service was on a red-eye flight such as this. Overall, I was quite impressed with Austrian. The configuration of Austrian's 777-200ER was the standard 3-4-3 configuration, however due to the shape of the fuselage of the airplane, there were a few rows of seats at the very rear of the plane that had a 2-4-2 configuration. I was traveling with a partner at the time, so I booked these seats right away. These seats had the benefit of a little bit of storage space between the window seat and the wall. We departed right around the scheduled time and on-board service began with a drink service, followed by lunch. They had two options for lunch: chicken with fried rice and pasta in cream sauce with smoked turkey and broccoli. I took the pasta. It was delicious. I managed to get a decent amount of sleep in before breakfast, which was around 2-3 hours before landing. It was an omelette with roasted potatoes, tomatoes and bacon. It was very good. The inflight entertainment was good without being outstanding. It had a decent amount of movies although the screen was very responsive, which is a definite plus. The pillows and blanket provided were very comfortable and of a good quality. The seat itself however lacked in some aspects. It served it's basic function however there was no in-seat plugs and no exterior cup holders, which would have been much appreciated. The seat did contain a coat hook, a USB port and headphone jack, an adjustable headrest (much appreciated), and a tray table. Austrian makes up for this though with their exemplary service. The flight attendants were consistently serving drinks and did all of this with a smile on their faces. They were also eager to please and very engaging. We eventually landed in Vienna. Overall, it was a fantastic flight. I would most definitely recommend Austrian Airlines to any traveler.

### "Excellent experience"
Paris to Bangkok via Vienna. Amazing flight, everything was smooth and perfect. The boarding was efficient and not messy. The cabin is elegant and the seat comfortable. The meals were amazing, very sophisticated, delicious and generous. The staff was very warm and friendly. Many recent movies and a good size screen. Excellent experience.

### "good value for money"
London to Vienna. I wasn’t impressed with the 1.5 hours delay. The cabin crew onboard are very friendly however, much more than other European airlines I’ve flown with. The snacks and drinks are served twice, quite unusual for a 2 hours flight, perhaps an extra service due to the delay. The plane was pleasant, seat is comfortable, enough space for cabin baggage, smooth takeoff and landing. There’s a paid wifi onboard which I didn’t purchase, quite unusual for such a short flight. Overall good value for money, other budget carriers charge around the same and would’ve given less service. If there was no delay, I would have given 10/10.

### "she started shouting"
Vienna to Toronto. When I was boarding the lady at the gate checking the passports asked me a question which I didn’t fully understand. Suddenly she started shouting the question at me. I asked her why she was shouting at me and she said because she has asked me the same question six times. Her underling was equally rude to me and told me to “go” (meaning get on the flight). These two people do not represent the Austrian people nor the Company, and no customer deserves to be shouted at because they do not understand a question.

### "you have been downgraded"
I booked Business Class and received a boarding pass for seat in row 8, which made me suspicious. Only after asking for a different seat, the check-in lady told me you have been downgraded. The supervisor tried to cälm me down by promising me that Austrian will ask for volunteers at the gate so I could get the seat I paid for. They did not! Before entering the plane , they tried to have me sign a waiver and give me 120 euros.

### "Showed no concern"
Frankfurt to Belgrade via Vienna. Unhelpful, infuriating and late. Showed no concern for missing connecting flight that was also with Austrian. No food or compensation, no help in any way. Complaints department's business card had no name on it.

### "service is polite and friendly"
London to Sofia via Vienna. Checked in online for both flights using the app, which was very easy. I had a "Economy Light" fare which meant cabin baggage up to 8kg plus a laptop bag or similar. This was a 06:00 departure from LHR T2. I always like to have paper boarding cards in case of phone failure so on arrival at 04:25 I went straight to a self service kiosk and got boarding cards for both sectors printed very quickly and easily. This is one of the first flights out of LHR so I was amazed I was through security and airside by 04:35. The downside about this time of day in T2 is there is absolutely nothing open until 05:00. My flight was out of the gates in the satellite building so I walked there. Boarding started just after 05:30 and was efficient, used a jet bridge and not a bus, and the staff applied a pragmatic approach to hand baggage. I had no problem stowing my wheelie bag in the overhead locker and my other bag under the seat in front. The seat pitch was acceptable and comfortable enough for a 2h15 flight. We departed approx 5 mins late, but arrived 15 mins late in VIE. Onboard service on this sector was reasonably swift in getting started and was basically beverages including alcohol plus a muffin. There was a second beverage service later into the flight. The flight attendants were all friendly and helpful. Arrival at VIE, which was late, was not helped due to us arriving at a coaching gate and being bussed to the terminal. I then had just under 45 mins until my connection to SOF out of the D-gates. It seemed a long walk and despite a flight attendant telling me I did not need to re-clear security, this was required. This said I did manage to get to my gate before boarding started. Gate D33 was terribly small and over crowded and due to the level of background noise from people passing through security right next to the gate it was impossible to hear what the gate agent was saying over the PA system. Boarding commenced late and was unfortunately another bus to the aircraft. We departed a few minutes late and arrived 10-15 mins late in SOF to yet another bus arrival. So I can only conclude Austrian are trying to save money by turning down jet bridges at SOF when most gates with them were unoccupied at SOF T2. The inflight service was very similar to the flight from LHR, albeit slower to start and slower to get through the cabin. It was a choice of either a sweet pastry or breadstick little snacks. Complimentary beverages were served including alcohol however on this 1h15 flight there was only one drink offered. Overall conclusion on Austrian European short haul economy service is: polite, friendly; appreciate the complimentary beverages albeit the snacks are not a meal, but the amount of bussing to and from aircraft I experienced did not feel full service carrier. I would fly Austrian again at the right price point.

### "shunted onto a midnight flight"
I felt severely let down by Austrian Airlines. My first set of flights Hong Kong-Vienna-Zurich and return were ok: excellent cabin service but awful boarding procedures. A good initiative is being able to use the business lounge at Vienna for the payment of 30 euros, if one is a premium economy passenger. However, despite the boarding scrum (no area designated area for PE and business class passengers seemed not to fare much better) I still arrived quite happy and enjoyed the actual flight experience (good food, good wine good seats, and excellent service), so much so that I booked Austrian Airlines again out of Hong Kong for a second set of flights a month or so later. Austrian is one of very few airlines offering daylight flights in premium economy into Europe from Hong Kong. However, on the second planned flight disaster struck when I received an SMS in the middle of the night bluntly informing me that my flight from Hong Kong to Vienna was cancelled - that was it. Although I had carefully booked premium economy (partly due to some slight health problems) I found out that I had been shunted onto a midnight flight on Swiss International and downgraded to very basic economy. I was also shoved into a poor seat in the middle down the back on this long overnight flight. I was stunned. Why couldn't Austrian re-book me onto a similar Lufthansa premium economy flight (they are in the same Lufthansa group), albeit also an overnight flight? Why couldn't they otherwise offer a flight next day on Austrian Airlines which I worked out would have been suitable. I could see there were plenty of seats on these other flights in PE. Also beware that as Austrian Airlines is a typical small European airline its call centre and help desk are only open in their local daylight hours, Vienna time - almost useless if one is in Hong Kong or Tokyo trying to make contact. Also Austrian have a fairly small long-haul fleet, making it easily prone to disruption and cancellation for whatever reason. So Austrian (and Star Alliance) have lost a potential lucrative business traveller in me who was in the process of moving over from One World alliance for these flights. I make 15-20 long haul international flights per year, usually in premium economy or business and this experience with Austrian Airlines has sent me rushing back to Cathay Pacific and One World.

### "a quality experience"
Vilnius to Copenhagen via Vienna. Efficient boarding in both VNO and VIE. Business Class cabin very comfortable, with very welcoming and jolly flight attendants. Aircraft and cabin well maintained and clean. Food portions were very delicate, well tasting and stylishly served on porcelain. Selection of good quality Austrian wines available. All flights were punctual on landing. Altogether a quality experience, with no flaws. Definitely using Austrian again.

### "not serve alcohol in the night"
❌ Not Verified |  I flew in Premium economy from Vienna to Beijing. The flight was not bad the Premium Cabin was only 3 people from 18 seat so everyone get space enough. The IFE is ok but the service was not good - no welcome drink and after 3hrs they say no more alcohol because they not serve alcohol in the night.

### "Breakfast a disappointment"
Vienna to Paris. Lounge had very few options of food; sad when we know Austrian traditional breakfasts. Boarding was messy in a narrow gate. Business class seats are just Economy seats. Breakfast was a disappointment, compared to previous flight. Usually Star Alliance flight arrive at T1 (CDG). Arrival in CDG was at T2, which is much more user friendly.

### "food in business class incredible"
Bucharest to Berlin via Vienna. Switching from Oneworld to Star Alliance seems to have been a good idea since the quality of the product is way better. The planes I got to fly in were new and the seats very comfortable. At check-in, the operator at the business class desk, apologized for taking a person flying economy and that I had to wait for 2 minutes. I found that sweet. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive and it really makes a difference in the sky, even when flying just under 2 hours. Speaking of the flight attendants, their uniform was somehow strange, everything red, including shoes and stockings: unique indeed. I must say the food in business class was incredible and the selection of wines was everything I needed for my trip. Everything culminated with a cup of tea, served in Austrian's branded porcelain. Both flights were on time and connecting in Vienna, while not the quickest and not always stress free, made it possible for the whole trip OTP-VIE-TXL to be under 4h. The WiFi didn't seem to work. I connected myself with the network but I couldn't get the redirect page where to book the plans. Anyways, I didn't really need it and I didn't ask the crew. maybe it was my phone.

### "economy product is solid"
Berlin to Bucharest via Vienna. I always thought that water and some hot drink should be offered in a plane while flying, at least for the airlines that consider themselves quality carriers and Austrian seems to know this, together with their counterparts in the Lufthansa group. It is indeed a good alternative to the Ryanair flight, the only direct one between Berlin and OTP and the connection in VIE is convenient. The economy product is solid, the seat comfort OK and the connection in VIE was quick.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight with Austrian from Berlin to Belgrade via Vienna. The incoming flight from Berlin was slightly late so that I was worried about my connection, but connecting in Vienna was a breeze. It took me less than 10 minutes from a Schengen to an non-Schengen gate. The seats were sufficiently comfortable for a short-haul flight, the service friendly. Austrian served free beverages and a chocolate bar during the service.

### "nearly a dream flight"
Bangkok to Vienna. Just perfect. Everything went so smoothly that it was nearly a dream flight. All business class seats have aisle access, remembering that 5 stars Lufthansa do not presently offer this. Chef on board. Very nice food, excellent choice of drinks, friendly staff, etc. Best flight ever between Asia and Europe. Just a note: only 7 European movies available out of on 100. Very weird for an European airline.

### "I need to check in my carry on"
Vienna to Zurich. Before boarding the flight we were asked if some of us could please check in our bags. While boarding I was politely told by personnel that I could check in on the left side (everyone was boarding on the right with the machines). I go to the left side and then I'm told that I need to check in my carry on because it is too big. I look around and I see that everyone's carry on is the same size. Upon reaching the plane I asked if I could please keep my suitcase because I had a lot of personal belongings in it and I have back problems. They told me sorry no and made me take my things out just to give them an empty carry on bag! Now I'm having to haul my personal belongings through Zurich airport with a back problem. I wouldn't normally mind but this flight is transatlantic. I feel the airline behaved in a rude manner in this case and should have asked more people that were in line to check in their bags.

### "was really disappointing"
Mauritius to Vienna was disappointing in various aspects. The business class cabin crew's attitude and poor performance in service have been the key problem. After boarding, there was no help with luggage or seating to anybody. Once some crew members realized that we do not speak German, they lost any interest to communicate with us at all. With the exception of personal welcome from the main purser and only one flight attendant, the rest of the crew did not care for a majority of this long-haul daytime flight. After the take-off, the breakfast has been served. Then, the crew gave up almost to be presented for the passengers, or at least to ensure to refill in some frequency any kind of drinks at the “minibar” in the galley. When someone from the crew has “checked” the cabin, it was the high speed run through the aisle. I was lucky to call the flight attended and asked her for a drink, as there had been nothing in the galley minibar at that time. No answer, but the face told enough, that I had exceeded some unwritten limit perhaps. Absolutely unbelievable. The more offended face, when she came back with the drink. The lunch, served about 3 hours prior the landing, was delicious. With the mentioned exception of that one professional flight attendant, nobody has cared about the passengers (no refilled drinks again, no talks, no motivation to look professional at least). At Vienna airport the plane (B772) parked at the remote stand with totally disorganized bus transfer into overcrowded terminal building. But it is another story. Except the food, the flight in the Austrian long-haul business class was really disappointing.

### "highest standard of service"
Innsbruck to Frankfurt. After boarding I was surprised by cabin crew by giving some gifts to our child! Crew were  smiling and very helpful. Plane was in very good condition. I was surprised by the highest standard of service. In-flight service was also very good. I could choose between variety of drinks. I also got a cake which was very good. Thank you Austrian Airlines for the best flight ever!

### "Overall experience good"
Frankfurt to Thessaloniki via Vienna. Nice airline, I enjoyed the flight, food during the flight was nice. Food in the business lounge in Vienna was bad. I had a problem with my luggage in Thessaloniki and I didn’t find any representative for the airline in the airport. Cabin staff are very friendly. Overall experience good, I won’t hesitate to fly back with Austrian airline.

### "trying to be compensated"
I flew from Los Angeles to Venice via Vienna. At the check in counter, I was informed about the half an hour delay of the departure that then rose to more than an hour while we were already on board. During the flight we managed to make good some of the delay, but despite all I missed my second flight for just 5 minutes. It's true that I was immediately redirected to the next possible one which was after 4hr. The second plane boarding was on time, but we departed with delay of 25 minutes. When my suitcase arrived, I found out that it was damaged. Now I continue to waste my time, trying to be compensated for the damage.

### "were downgraded to Economy"
Male to Vienna. We took a week-long vacation to the Maldives using Austrian through Vienna. We booked Business Class seats but were downgraded to Economy. We were given 4 Maestro cards as compensation for the downgrade. None of the Maestro cards worked (you can check the amounts on line and they never had anything on them). And, now I will apparently have to wait 4 months for them to even look at my complaint. Needless to say, the Business Class seats were incredibly expensive. The compensation they gave me was nowhere near the difference in price -- and this is assuming that I actually get some compensation from them. So, not only did I get downgraded (I understand this happens), but I lost a lot of money because of their mistake.

### "would not allow the increased luggage"
I booked economy flights from Copenhagen to Vienna for my husband and myself for 4 January 2018. As we were travelling in Europe during the winter for several weeks, we had more luggage than allowed under our ticket. The airline website encouraged purchasing extra luggage allowance online as it was cheaper than on arrival at the airport when checking in. I tried to do this several times but the website would not accommodate the request. A day or 2 before the flight, we were offered an upgrade to business class at a cost of €119 each, which we took up. The receipts for payment for the upgrades clearly showed an increased baggage allowance to 32kgs each which was more than sufficient for us. On arrival at the airport in Copenhagen for check in, the check in agent would not allow the increased luggage without further payment as it was her contention that the upgrade we paid for did not include increased luggage. At our request she called the airline twice but was told that we would have to pay extra DKK559. As we had no option, we paid the demanded amount. I lodged a complaint with the airline’s “guest service” team, attaching a copy of my receipt showing the increased baggage allowance as part of the business class upgrade. I also requested a refund of the DKK559 I had paid. I exchanged several emails with the “guest service” team before I was then informed that I would have to lodge my request anew with the airline’s feedback/complaints department via its website. I re-lodged my complaint/request as instructed and received an acknowledgement. I have received at least 2 further emails advising the airline “is committed to offering a high quality of service and your concern is therefore important to us. However, due to a high volume of requests, you may experience a delay in receiving a response”. My complaint/request was first lodged on 4 January, almost 4 months ago and I’m still waiting for a response to something that should be very straightforward.

### "felt exceptionally below service"
This was my first time flying Austrian Airlines on 2 small connecting flights: Munich-Vienna / Vienna-Iasi. I have to mention that I mostly fly low cost. I didn't expect any incredible inflight service because of the type of flight and destinations. Overall flight was good, snacks a bit small compared to most other "normal" airlines. However one thing felt exceptionally below service, especially for a Star Alliance airline. We were departing from MUC to VIE and I came to my seat amongst the last and the overhead was full. I was carrying 1 cabin trolley, plus my purse and laptop which I always put under my seat. With no place to put my cabin compliant trolley, I turned to the flight attendant for help, literally saying "could you please help me stow my trolley, not sure where to put it". She shrugged her shoulders in a very obvious "and what do you want me to do? manner and said "the overhead is full due to passengers bringing 2 pieces of large luggage" and proceeded to not moving an inch, while looking at me. Then another passenger helped me make room in the overhead (probably his backpacks were there). I could have just pushed some random overhead bags really hard or asked some passengers to take out their smaller backpack and put it under their seat but really, I think this would have been rude on my side - I wouldn't want a stranger smushing my bags or asking me to move my stuff. I also strongly believe it is the flight attendant's job. It clearly *is* for all the low cost flights where flight attendants are taking really good care of this aspect. So I am expecting much more from a Star Alliance company that charges double or more of what a low cost would. At least I am expecting the willingness to be helped with basic things. If you can't be bothered to help me stow my luggage, I find that a problem, especially given the price I am paying. The rest of the flight attendands were great, accommodating, and we had some of the most talkative and informative captains on all of the Austrian flights - which I liked.

### "they didn't serve breakfast"
Washington to Vienna. Overall good experience but to my surprise they didn't serve breakfast before landing in Vienna, only a muffin!!! Not enough crew on board compareh to my previous experiences with Austrian. The drinks were not serve in trays, also not hot towel or hand sanitizer was offered.

### "better than any North American carrier"
Newark to Kiev via Vienna. Flight from Newark to Vienna left late but still landed early. Food was decent, drinks services frequent and generous, IFE worked well and had a few good movies and cds, but the earbuds they give out aren't exactly comfortable. Flight from Vienna to Kiev only served chips or chocolate and soft drinks, a bit disappointing, and it was late too. But still, Austrian is better than any North American carrier, and I'd happily fly with them again.

### "could not provide baby bassinet"
Bangkok to Vienna with child and infant. Austrian Airlines already sold front row seats thus could not provide baby bassinet (travelers with infant be aware, you need to pay extra EUR50 / passenger / long haul route for front row seat if you wish to use baby basinet). Bassinet itself is free of charge. Fortunately Austrian office in Bangkok booked a seat for my infant daughter so the flight was OK. Dinner was standard airline quality. With the hidden charges, not recommended for families with small children.

### "very pleasant experience"
Vienna to Washington return. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Both flights were on time, with the outbound one even arriving well before schedule. One the reasons for that might have been the surprisingly efficient boarding on both occasions. Check-in went smoothly at both airports, even though the counter was rather difficult to find in IAD, due to virtually non-existent information screens at that airport. Ground staff was always friendly. On both flights, cabin crew was very friendly and hard-working, running up and down to serve drinks throughout the whole flight. The food was very good and the onboard entertainment satisfactory. The plane was a seemingly modern B-767 with 2-3-2 seating and enough legroom, so that even as a tall man I was able to get some sleep.

### "not enough food/drinks on board"
I was very frustrated, not to say shocked with the apparently new Austrian service plan. First, Austrian puts 10 seats in one row of a 777 (3-4-3), while other airlines fly with 9 seats per row only. That by itself makes it hard to feel comfortable, since you are always in direct contact with the neighbour's shoulder. The worst however is the service. The food consisted of a 2 cm by 2 cm large piece of meat, a spoon of mashed potatoes and one carrot (see photo), served in a disposable triangle. Drinks were only offered once, following the new service plan of Austrian. When I complained about food and service one of the flight crew members told me that this is the new service directive and food service from Austria. The crew were not happy with it either and indeed felt embarrassed about the quality. All these little extras, that make a flight a little bit more comfortable are missing on Austrian. The nuts and drinks prior to the dinner, the hot (paper) towels prior to dinner and breakfast, nobody went through the cabin offering drinks. I emphasize, that I do not blame the crew. Indeed, they were all very friendly and helped as much as they could. But what can you do if there is not enough food/drinks on board and the company asks you to reduce the service to an absolute minimum. Well, I made my decision. Austrian long haul flights, never again.

### "very friendly and kind"
Hong Kong to Vienna. I bought the ticket with a relatively low price. The cabin was not fully occupied so I managed to sleep on three seats. The food was delicious and I asked for an extra meal. They provided frequent drinks so that I did not feel thirsty. The cabin crew was very friendly and kind that they smiled all the time. The inflight entertainment provides a wide variety of choice as well. The cabin was new and clean. Everyone got a blanket and a pillow. The flight arrived punctually.

### "this time they did much better"
Had a rather frustrating experience in December, my connection flight from Toronto to Vienna has been cancelled due to technical problems. Austrian refused to re-book it and insisted it had to be done by my booking agent, FlightCentre. FlightCentre did get me alternate flight with other airlines but told me it should have been done by Austrian. And on the return flight from Vienna to Toronto the same issue, presumably with the same plane - the departure flight got delayed a couple of times, then it was cancelled after a delay of nearly 5 hours. I was not pleased and wowed to never fly Austrian again. Fortunately, this time they did much better, provided the customers with a airport hotel and food, and best of all - early next morning they got me to Paris and my final destination in Vancouver by another carrier (Air France). Because of this, I would give them another chance in the future and the professional and prompt resolution of the second cancellation improved my opinion of the airline a lot. Why on earth did not behave the same way in December?

### "focused airline of high quality"
Copenhagen - Vienna - Hong Kong on 3rd Jan 2018. (Billund) - Copenhagen - Vienna - Hong Kong on A320 and B777-300, respectively. The short leg CPH-VIE seat had a terrible economy seat offering to business class passengers. Food was very sparse and only 1 hot dish was offered, completely in contrast to the international luxury offerings (see below). However, good FAs. Champagne offered. Check-in in BLL (Denmark) with a useless, inert, junior agent (3rd party, SAS-agent) could not identify my onwards bookings (despite providing boarding cards as prof) and rejected to check-in my luggage further than HKG. The long haul flight VIE-HKG was one of my best flights ever. Have been missing Austrian for its innovations, fresh and super-alert FA’s, colours, decos, and excellent food. 3 Austrian beers offered, one in original bottles. 2 champagnes, lots of reds and whites. For Lunch I consumed two main-dishes: the calf was devine. Also, an Italian cheese-pasta was very nice. 3 hot meals offered on this 12 hours flight: they had each 3, 1, and 2 hot offerings, respectively (for lunch, supper, and breakfast). The VIE-HKG was full but the FA coped well: smiling, attentive, focused, proactive, and caring. The flight was 10/10 but the seat could not recline to horizontal position (lacking 3-5 degrees). The handset controller did not work. Further, the flight CPH-VIE on a A320 cannot exceed an 8/10 score. Altogether, an exotic, focused airline of high quality. Luggage arrived smoothly. I will go again. Much better than Swiss and – in this case: also better than Qatar and Turkish.

### "service was efficient"
Vienna to Bangkok. I was initially booked on Economy on OS1015. At the gate, the gate agent offered an upgrade to Premium Economy for €149. I grabbed the opportunity to try out their Premium Economy product as this was my first time travelling long haul on Austrian Airlines. So I picked up my new boarding pass and settled into seat 10H which was the first row of Premium Economy. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 instead of 3-4-3 in Economy. Seat pitch was generous and incline was good giving me a good sleep for the 9.5 hour red eye flight. However, the earphones were of the in-ear type and sound quality was not good. I would have expected over-ear headphones for Premium Economy. No amenity kit was distributed but I guess this is standard practice for the majority of European airlines on their economy and premium economy products. Catering was of course economy catering. Overall, Austrian’s Premium Economy product was good and service was efficient. It was worth the extra €149 paid.

### "care more about food service"
Chicago to Vienna on their Boeing 767, with a very nice interior and a great entertainment system. Austrian's impeccably trained and very well-groomed cabin crew were at the top of their game both times. I also had a great experience with kind airport agents. My first issue - seat selection for a booking made via United was not available on Austrian's website for the segments of my itinerary they operated. I was assigned random seats when I checked in. Lufthansa on the other hand  allow seat selection on their website for segments they operate, even when you book via United. My second issue was food. You'd expect that on a 9 hour overnight flight they'd pamper you more in terms of food (beverage service is pretty varied, but I care more about food service. On the long-haul flight for dinner they have a choice of two dishes with a limited amount of servings available, so that when one is gone, you are stuck with the other. The assumption that everyone will automatically accept what is left has proven wrong in my case, because for personal reasons, I didn't want the pasta with  that was left, but the dish that was gone (chicken). As they couldn't accommodate my request, I asked if they had any snacks for purchase. They first misunderstood me and gave me 3 more bags of some salty crackers that they had served as a starter. I was told the only thing they had for purchase was chocolate (I assume as a part of their duty-free offer). It turned out my only option was to eat the dish that they had left, buy chocolate or stay hungry. Before landing we were served a muffin for breakfast. I personally do not like having sweets as a meal.

### "crew were friendly and attentive"
Amsterdam to Kiev via Vienna. Check-in was made online and I printed my boarding pass on a kiosk at the airport. I could use fast track through security which was this time reasonably fast considering the time of the day and the fact that you are at Schiphol Airport. Boarding was quick and efficient and I was told by the purser that 'I could take any seat I wanted'. Departure and arrival on time. Arrival in Vienna was at a remote stand and we had to wait a short while for the busses to arrive. Having a 50min lay-over was not a problem, I only had to pass immigration (there was no security check in transit) but did not have any time to spend in the OS lounge. Boarding for the 2nd leg started in time and we were bussed to the aircraft which was on a remote stand. While on board the flight was delayed with almost 30 minutes. During the delay the passengers in C were offered water or juice. At the end we arrived 20min. late in Kiev. On both legs the cabin crew were as usual friendly and attentive. Legroom in the Airbus was OK but the ERJ felt very cramped.

### "They lost my luggage"
Frankfurt to Vienna. They lost my luggage on my way from Frankfurt. They suggested that I check in my carry on too, so I did to help them out. Someone called me today and said my luggage is in Munich - why in Munich I have no clue! They said they might be able to get my luggage to me next week. I called no answer, I emailed no answer, I called to Munich and got transferred to phone number that hang up on me. All I wanted to know is where my luggage is and get it!

### "asked the steward to clean it"
Chicago to Vienna. The worst experience I  had. I was traveling with 11 month old baby, just 2 of us. It was really hard but the stuff weren't that helpful. My baby really active and I put tray with food on floor, so he doesn't mess with it and When time came to clean I asked the steward to clean it and he roll his eyes on me and said " Are you serious put it on floor what I suppose to clean your mess after you now".

### "an average experience"
Vienna - Paris CDG in Economy almost a year ago, transferring in CDG to an AF flight to the UK. Flight was booked with AF as a codeshare. Checked in at the manned premium OS counter (due to frequent flyer status), which was fast and friendly. Boarding – as almost in VIE with OS - slightly chaotic, but an average experience, as well as the flight itself. Solid, but not more. Drinks were free, however Austrian Airlines does not serve actual food in Y. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to a ATC slot, which should not have been an issue, but it was. We had a scheduled transfer time of 1 hour, which was now reduced to 45 minutes. While we made it to the new gate before departure time, the flight was already closed. CDG is a disaster and even the scheduled transfer time of one hour would have been not enough to be at the gate before the official flight closing time. Long lines at passport control with no special lines for EU-passports and no short connection lines. Also, nobody there from the airline or the airport to assist with short connections. Then a bus transfer between the terminals that seemed to circle the whole airport with multiple stops and which took almost 30 minutes. CDG has to be the worst organized airport in Europe. No chance to make the connection. AF then rebooked us to flight leaving 6 hours later. Then we had to wait 1 hour (!) at the counter till AF got the approval from OS to issue a meal voucher for the delay, but OS could not care less to and needed to be called multiple time before they finally sent an approval. Simply ridiculous. Also, compensation for the delay under EU law was denied by OS citing extraordinary circumstances. How can a slightly later ATC slot be extraordinary circumstances? This is business as usual and flight statistics show that this is the usual delay for this morning flight. Even an intervention by the Austrian Customer Protection Agency did not help. OS denied their reasoning, as well. Will not recommend OS, as customer service and attitude handling the delay and compensation was terrible.

### "flight attendants are always friendly"
Flew Beijing to Vienna. Check in at PEK airport smooth and fast. Once on the plane warmly welcomed by the purser by name. The plane took off one hour late because of chinese airtraffic control. Just waiting beside the runway for taking off but still managed an almost on time arrival at VIE airport. The food on Austrian business class is always a dream. I could choose between 8 different starters from the cart, an additional soup, 3 main dishes and 5 different kinds of dessert. The dessert is normally served like in a Vienna cafe with a choice of many different types of coffee. I took my favorite one, Vienna ice coffee. The flight attendants are always friendly and offered frequently drinks and snacks during the flight. Since Austrian modified the business class cabin a few years ago I prefer to travel Austrian business than LH first class. I am a star alliance gold member and if I want to travel on time with a good service than I know that I have to choose Austrian as my carrier.

### "flights with gap of about 30min"
They schedule connections flights with gap of about 30min. That means if everything should run in perfect condition to be up to speed, which is unlikely and in Vienna airport which is big lack of information points. Airport staff very unfriendly. I wouldn’t suggest to use this company and airport as transit point.

### "I was really disappointed"
Graz to Sofia via Vienna. I have flown with Austrian Airlines for the first time and I was really disappointed. In the same week, they managed to be late on three out of four flights of mine with them. When I had lost my connecting flight, because the first flight was delayed, the personnel at the airport were extremely rude and not really willing to help find a solution for my situation. Apart from that Vienna Airport is not user friendly, uncomfortable chairs everywhere, not a single spot where you can take a nap and so on.

### "the flight was cancelled"
My flight (0S88) over to Vienna was fine but on the way back on September 3rd is where the problem lies. Checked in and was given the opportunity to upgrade on FLT 0087 to business class. There was a delay and after several hours the flight was cancelled. They would not refund my credit card for the upgrade even though they just charged it several house prior. Took many hours in the airport to be rescheduled for another flight. That flight was the next day(8/4) and I was booked on Air Berlin to Berlin and then Delta to NY JFK. Air Berlin took off late and I was refused boarding on Delta. The airport in Berlin had an Austrian Airlines and Air Berlin representation. After hours of waiting in lines both companies did nothing to help me at all. Found out Air Berlin was in bankruptcy. Both said they were not direct company employees and could not give compensation for being stuck again another day. Delta re booked for the next day (8/5). No one took responsibility. Finally arrived home in Florida on September 6, with a hurricane bearing down on the state. My luggage? Lost somewhere in Berlin. Finally received it on September 12. Sent e-mails and calls to Austrian Air and no one responded.

### " a very nice flight"
Vienna to Brussels. It was a very nice flight. My second best flight in my life. Very friendly cabin crew, very good coffee and food. The flight was delayed but only for 15 minutes. The flight was very good and I had very nice relax there. I was shocked when we land and they play Mozart, this was was a very nice atmosphere). Thank you Austrian

### "friendly crew and free catering"
Flew Manchester to Klagenfurt via Vienna. Just like to say how smoothly everything went. Austrian allow web check-in 47 hours in advance which was very convenient. Both flights were on time, friendly crew and free catering (packet of snacks and beverages, including wine on international sector), even a quick cuppa from VIE-KLU, which all made for pleasant hop across to central Europe. Seat was fine, of leather and reclined. I'm a fan of the smaller aircraft, so enjoyed both flights. Vienna was a doddle (impressed) from getting off the plane to next gate with a bus transfer, passport and security checks - 15mins! Only had 40mins transfers time, no rush at all and luggage arrived safely too. Definitely would recommend this airline and hope fly with them soon again.

### "the worst food I have ever had on a plane"
Austrian Airlines flight from Bangkok to Vienna: Disciplined boarding, on time, clean plane, friendly crew (recognized as Gold Card member), good entertainment selection. Standard seats, very little reclining, but fortunately, I had a free seat next to me. Some of the worst food I have ever had on a plane: absolutely tasteless chicken and equally tasteless mashed potatoes, you simply do not know what you are eating, otherwise, totally eventless flight.

### "They delayed my flight"
Sarajevo to Amsterdam via Vienna. Very rude and it takes them so long to answer your call and give information. They delayed my flight and didn't even let me know what will happen with my connecting flight. Also they give themselves the right to take away your cabin luggage and lose it afterwards. Never flying with this company again.

### "inconvenient to lose luggage"
Cairo to Zurich via Vienna. This is the fourth time I have taken this trip. Two of the four times my baggage hasn't arrived on time and takes at least 2 days to arrive to the required destination. Austrian Airlines always offers this route with a maximum of 1.5 hours transit at Vienna (either way). If they cannot offer speedy bag transfer they should by default increase their transit time. It is extremely inconvenient to lose luggage and wait for more than 24 hours to get them.

### "happily fly with OS again"
New York JFK to Vienna. Another pleasant flight with Austrian, meal was fine, frequent drinks services, crew happy to provide an extra snack or drink. Plane's entertainment system was well stocked with plenty of good movies and music. Was seated in standard economy, but in a kind of 3-row mini-cabin between business and bathrooms, so it felt more private than regular cattle class. Will happily fly with OS again.

### "seat pitch and crew were great"
I was flying on business to Cyprus and used Austrian Airlines for a first time and I have to say, it won't be for the last time. First we flew a 35 minute flight from Prague to Vienna on an Embraer 190 and even for such a short flight we received water which was really nice and seat pitch was also nice. Second flight was on an A320 (on the way back we used A321) and seat pitch and crew were great. We received a hot meal (some pasta with dessert) which is not usual for Europe flights anymore, not even for 3 hour long flights. Food was really tasty and there was a nice selection of drinks, the crew made 3 drinks rounds in under 3 hours. I was happy with this airline and the crew were the best I've had on a European flight. There was also wifi with 10 minutes free. Only thing missing was IFE or at least some screens showing the flight path. Next time I'll choose Austrian Airlines and can't wait to try them on long haul flight.

### "Worst business class seat"
Vienna to Los Angeles. Worst business class seat I have flown, I am 6'4" and could not even stretch out. The middle seats on the left are like coffins. A 12" opening for legs not allowing you to roll over or extend. I would have been better off in an exit row in economy. Rang my bell for the flight attendant 6 times and finally had to hunt her down. The meals were good but the only snacks were a few packs of cookies. Drink selection was also very poor, the selection was worse than economy. It also took 1 hour to get our baggage at Los Angeles Airport. I would not fly Austrian again.

### "I was very impressed"
Flight OS81 from Vienna to Los Angeles. I had flown Austrian only once before, and it was a relatively good experience, so I was expecting a lot out of Austrian. Fortunately, I was very impressed. Check-in was relatively slow, but the lady there gave us a warm greeting and sent our checked bags away quickly. The flight was fully booked, so there were plenty of people in line. The gate felt extremely small, especially on a fully booked flight. Austrian fortunately was good at crowd control, so people got to their respective seats quickly. The seat was clean and very comfortable, and had all the basic functions and necessities you would expect. Pillows and blankets were provided on this 11 hour and 40 minute flight, even though it was a day flight. The flight attendants, as always, were extremely kind and compassionate and always there when you needed them. Soon after takeoff, lunch was served. It was a mushroom pasta dish, which was pretty tasty. The IFE worked pretty well and was responsive, although it didn't have many movies or TV shows, unlike Lufthansa. Where Austrian makes up for this is in their prestigious service and delicious food. Snacks and drinks were served consistently throughout the flight. Near the end of our flight, a small meal of more pasta with olives and zucchini was served with some sort of pudding. It was phenomenal. We parked at one of LAX's satellite terminals, and had to get bused over to Terminal 6 for Customs, which I find a bit inefficient. Overall, it was a fantastic flight. I would definitely recommend Austrian Airlines to anyone.

### "definitely be using them again"
London Heathrow to Vienna. Excellent on board. Not a long flight but a snack and a drink served by pleasant staff. Incredible luggage allowance for an economy European flight 1 x 23 kg included in ticket price. There is also the advantage at Vienna airport that you can check your luggage in early via the automated baggage drop off points (five hours early in my case) which is available in AA own Terminal 3. This facility is not available with the other carriers who use Terminal 1. If you have a long wait an invaluable facility. 20 min delay at Heathrow no specific explanation provided. Delay on return due to weather so not the fault of the airline. Will definitely be using them again.

### "outstanding quality and taste"
Salzburg to Frankfurt. The boarding procedure started right on time and was fast and efficient. After a warm welcome by the cabin crew they started their service. Despite the fact that this was a one hour flight, a meal was served which distinguished itself by outstanding quality and taste. Shortly afer a pre-landing coffee the plane landed in the designated city, again, punctually.

### "It was an excellent flight"
Geneva to Vienna. The boarding was smooth and the plane departed 5 minutes ahead of time. The plane was an Embraer 195 that are quite old, however the cabin was very spacious and clean. It was just a 50 min flight, but the cabin crew served some drinks and cold snacks (biscuits or salted peanuts). The cabin crew was very helpful and with a smile. It was an excellent flight.

### "review its boarding process"
Vienna to Miami. The Vienna boarding gate experience could be improved. Arrived at Gate 20 min before boarding time. Gate agent stamped boarding pass but announcement was made or instructions for priority boarding. We lined up after a queue started to form. At the gate, agent refused to honor printed boarding pass that indicated my 1k premier status and wanted to see physical evidence. Fortunately UA app has my card in its file and was able to convince agent to let us through. Austrian could do well to review its boarding process for efficiency and convenience and update its gate agent that printed boarding pass status is as good as or even more accurate than the hard copy. Finally got on board and was warmly greeted by a flight steward which made up for the annoyance at the gate.

### "staff not connected with Austrian"
Our flight was due to leave London Heathrow June 22nd at 15:20 arriving Vienna 18:55 for a 20:20 transfer to Sarajevo. However this flight did not take off until 17:10, arriving Vienna at 19:55. Boarding time for Sarajevo flight was 19:50. Flight attendant as we were approaching Vienna kindly moved us with our hand luggage to Business Class so we could be among first to exit plane. As we were not familiar with airport it took us sometime to locate gate for our onward flight and owing to age, health and mobility issues we were not in the best state when we got there. We were also unaware that we would have to go through another security check and this is where our experience was unacceptable. The lack of dignity afforded to my wife when she set off the security alarm was unnecessary and caused a great deal of stress. Not only were we late and concerned we would not make our onward flight but there was no female attendant available to carry out the search. The male employee was rude. The female employee, when she turned up, was no better. Accept that the flight was delayed, this happens, but it would have been good to have been told that the Sarajevo flight was also delayed, which would have given us sufficient time to make our onward flight. I know that these security staff are not connected with Austrian Airlines but their treatment was out of order.

### "Ground services at Warsaw horrible"
Warsaw to London via Vienna on economy Light fare. Ground services at Warsaw airport were just horrible. I usually travel with a backpack which I do not need to check in but apparently Warsaw airport has its own rules. Both legs were delayed: over an hour from WAW to VIE and about 45 minutes from VIE to LHR. Star Alliance Business Lounge in Warsaw was overcrowded and had to struggle to find a seat. Onboard the crew was quite polite, though snacks less than modest. Austrian Lounge at Vienna airport looked like a cafe. Not to compare with lounges at Heathrow, Munich or Zurich airports. Wi-Fi on VIE-LHR flight was not working. I will think twice before booking my next flight with Austrian.

### "over a year to get my money back"
Vienna to Venice. The flight was cancelled and these things happen and thats life. But Austrian thought they could just dust their hands of any responsibility be it their fault or not. There were no flights offered the following day nor any accommodation solutions. The staff ill advised all customers by telling them to find their own way to their final destination and that the cost would be covered by the airline. This has not proven to be the case. It has taken me over a year to even get my money back for the cancelled flight and I've had to go through the Airline governing body to even get any sort of response from Austrian. I wouldn't even give them the obligatory 1/10 if I had the choice.

### "the trip was terrible"
For many years I have been flying Nice - Vienna back and return on Austrian. It always was a pleasant experience. I tried to get a seat in the first row and read the magazines provided by the airline, eat the fantastic DO&CO catered lunch and enjoyed myself. The price of 900 Euros for the roundtrip was a bit steep, but the experience was always pleasant. This year no more. I bought a ticket for the same route, same 900 Euros but the trip was terrible. In the lounge were no magazines offered. The flight Vienna to Nice had an Austrian flight number but crew and plane were from Air Berlin. Even worse the Nice - Vienna was performed by Eurowings an discount airline with a much worse service.

### "overall, an OK experience"
New York JFK to Vienna. Originally, a smaller Boeing 767 was scheduled, that was also one of the reason we booked this flight. But unfortunately the flight was rescheduled to a triple-seven, with 3-4-3 abreast seating, which is hated by the passengers. So we pre-booked our seats in advance (for a surcharge), to get one of the few seats in the rear of the cabin where the fuselage is narrowing and only 2 instead of 3 seats in the window-rows are used. Definitely worth the 50€ we paid! The flight left with a small delay, but landed on time. Lufthansa's JFK ground staff were not polite, fast or effective. But the cabin crew were OK. The seating on narrow seats was fine for a 8 hour flight, but I can't imagine myself being squeezed there for a few more hours. The cabin crew were fine, but keeping a distance from the passengers and being not as nice as those on the previous Lufthansa flight. The food was mediocre and portions very small - we had booked a vegetarian meal, and for the breakfast, it meant only a few pieces of fresh fruit, whereas other passengers had a giant cereal muffin. Apart from the obvious cost-savings by not using a tray and only handing out one piece of food, the fruit box was very small and definitely not enough for breakfast. Thankfully, one of the cabin attendants gave us spare muffins too, upon our request. Thanks for that! So overall, an OK experience, but there are much better Y-class long haul products out there.

### "I did not earn any airmiles"
Frankfurt to Salzburg. I am a Gold Member of Miles&Bonus (Aegean, Star Alliance) and I travel business class. However, in this flight I did not earn any airmiles as I had a business class A ticket (whatever that means) even though I paid a lot of money. I think it is dishonest to have business class tickets in a non earning miles category. Additionally, business class had just a curtain separating from economy and no choice for a meal as expected in business class on this 55 mins flight.

### "really like Austrian Airlines"
Went from Vienna to Zakynthos and back to Graz and I can say that I really like Austrian Airlines. The onboard service may be nothing too special, but you'll still get a warm snack and complimentary drinks. For two hour flights that's sufficient. As we were travelling as a family we also got crayons, coloring books and some playing cards for our daughter. The crew was very attentive and proactive. When our daughter feel asleep they brought a pillow without being asked. On the way to Zakynthos the flight departed and arrived on time. On the way back it got delayed by approximately 45 minutes due to a bug in the check in system. despite a long line up the ground staff remained friendly, professional and as efficiently as possible. Austrian Airlines is currently my number one choice for flights within Europe.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Flew Austrian Airlines from Frankfurt to Salzburg. Short hop on the pleasant Embraer 195 with 2-2 seating. The friendly cabin crew manages to get you a snack and a drink - 2 if you ask for it - on the 45 minute flight. On time performance despite rather bad weather. Part of a Lufthansa flight from Dusseldorf -with change in Frankfurt - and the cheapest option between Dusseldorf en Frankfurt. Would definitely fly again.

### "cancelled the ticket of my son"
Vienna to Sofia. Very unprofessional service. Phone service with booking unhelpful and cancelled the ticket of my son without informing us. Waited 15 minutes in a 35C weather with fellow passengers in a transfer bus from terminal to aircraft. No aircondition was used. -Cabin crew engaged in their own conversation and did not help passengers with finding their seats and space for the luggage.

### "Food was great and tasty"
Toronto to Vienna on Boeing 767 (was scheduled for Boeing 777) with Austrian Airlines. Atmosphere of the cabin was pleasant with nice colors. Comfortable seat but seat pitch was poor with only 30 in. Nice pillow with fabric cover and nice blanket. No amenity kit, no amenities in the WC. IFE was good with 59 movies and easy to operate. There was a welcoming drink and then offer of a main meal with plastic silverware, and breakfast 1 hour before landing only muffin and drinks. Food was great and tasty. There was a mid flight buffet but it was poor quality. They did not offer hot towels. Flight from Vienna to Athens was very basic on A320.

### "best European flights of the last 5 years"
Austrian operated by Air Berlin, wet lease flights OTP-VIE-ZRH on the same airplane with the same crew. As a matter of fact, my last flights with Air Berlin were not very pleasant at all, so I was curious if and how this might have an impact on these Austrian flights. And yes indeed it had. My best European flights of the last 5 years. Airplane livery Austrian, seats Lufthansa group, but not with the specific Austrian red features. Seat pitch LH group standard. So all regular and nothing special. The difference was the service by the cabin crew: simply marvelous, always with a smile, very individual and professional. So, if you had doubts about Austrian operated by AB, forget them. If you can book such a flight it's simply a plus.

### "professional customer care"
I had a flight from Vienna to Zurich and then a connecting flight from Zurich to Milan with Austrian Airlines. Due to the late arrival of the flight my flight was delayed which was meant I would miss my connecting flight. I went to the customer service desk twice and the staff working there was patient and helpful. In the end, they put me on a direct flight to Milan. I just wanted to say my compliments to the staff for resolving the problem. Even though I had to wait for 4 hours, I am still pleased with their professional customer care and client handling.

### "friendly, professional, efficient"
Sofia to Berlin via Vienna. Flying with Austrian is always close to perfect. Quick check-in and boarding in Sofia. In Vienna it took me from touch down via bus transfer, immigration and security check only 16 minutes to reach my new departure gate. Fast internet free in Vienna Airport and very slow in Sofia Airport. Flight attendants very friendly, professional and efficient. They serve a light snack and beverages without extra charges. Toilets clean. Always on time in my experience.

### "Great service, clean cabin"
Innsbruck to Bristol. Just returned from a skiing trip to Austria and this was the first time I'd flown with Austrian Airlines. Great service, complimentary food and drink, on time both ways, clean cabin with plenty of legroom. The thing that made it unique for me was the Captain. On takeoff from Innsbruck he kept us low so we could see the snow topped Tyrolean Mountains, pointing them out and naming them. Absolutely amazing! He also kept us informed throughout the flight. Such a personal touch that made all the difference.

### "two flights without hassle."
Zurich to Bucharest via Vienna. Two flights without hassle. Slightly delayed in Zurich due to late arrival and arrived 15 minutes late in Vienna. Very helpful staff to make the tight connection. Second last to board. Plenty of personal space, the plane was almost empty. Not my favorite airline seat, but ok, got used to it. Early landing in Bucharest and fast baggage delivery.

### "experience of Austrian is cheap service"
Shanghai to Lyon via Vienna. This flight went way worse than I expected. I flew from LYS to PVG with SWISS and from PVG to LYS with Austrian Airlines, so I had the possiblity to make the direct comparison between these two Star Alliance members. The flight took about 11.5 hours. During this time the crew served us bewerage just before and during the two meals. If you expect they would come around from time to time to ask the passengers if they'd like to have a glass of water - you were wrong. After some hours I had to go by myself on the back of the plane to ask them for some drinks and a little snack (since the meal itself wasn't even that big, not even for an economy class meal). Besides the fact that the flight attendant didn't even care about us and not even bothered to smile, two of four toilets were not working. After mealtime many people had of course the need to go to the restroom - with a waiting time of sometimes over 15 mins. I guess that's why they didn't serve as much drink as they maybe usually do? What disturbed me most is that the crew or the maitre the cabine didn't greet the passengers at the beginning of the flight or informed us about the failure of the toilets. Just the captain mentioned it 1 hour before landing, and thanked us for our understanding. The overall experience of Austrian is cheap service with lousy flight attendants and bad maintenanced aircrafts.

### "nice and pleasant flight"
Sofia to Vienna. Very nice and pleasant flight onboard the Austrian Embraer 195. Check in was a little bit slow and also they don't keep the Business Class check in counter only for business class, they also let economy class passengers. However, security check was fast. I went to the Vitosha Lounge, which very nice. There is priority boarding at Sofia - they let you skip the line and be one of the first to go on the bus. I was the only one in the Business class cabin, which had 10 seats. The seating configuration onboard the E195 is 2-2 and in business class really is 1-1, because they keep one of the seats blocked. The cabin crew was very friendly, offered me some newspapers and magazines, but no welcome drink. The food was excellent. They offered many drinks. The plane took off and landed on time. I was in front of the airport about 20 minutes after landing and I had a checked in baggage.

### "not even offering a smile"
Shanghai to London Heathrow via Vienna. Upon boarding the aircraft, two cabin staff surprised me by not even offering a smile. I observed staff barking orders at passengers as to how their luggage should be placed in the overhead storage compartments. The food served was bland and looked unappetising. During meal time, we were given an option of beef or chicken, we were not told what the beef or chicken options comprised of. I opted for the chicken option, it was chicken in a tomato sauce with rice. My husband opted for the beef, his was beef and noodles however, at no point were we told we had an option of noodles or rice. The second meal served was pasta and vegetable in a tomato sauce with a dry roll. I've never been offered a roll without butter on a flight before. The staff were not helpful, approachable or polite. The movie selection was good however, but my sound quality was poor. I had the opportunity to fly business class en route to Shanghai 3 weeks earlier (after bidding on business class seats) and the service onboard that Austrian flight was second to none. Aside from 3 course meals, glass, cutlery and comfy seats which come with business class, the staff were warm, polite and engaging. I assumed that my flight back to Vienna would be equally great but was I wrong!

### "measure the cabin baggage"
Vienna to Moscow. I see Austrian has no free baggage allowance. That is fine for me since I flew back from my weekend in Vienna with my backpack. I did not expect my backpack will be between my legs during the flight. All the people flying tried to bring everything to the cabin, so all the racks got full pretty quickly with bags that mostly would not qualify as cabin luggage due to their dimensions. Austrian staff at the registration / boarding gate did not seem to care. As a result, the flight attendants said that "people simply have too much with them", and all the cabin baggage not properly stowed will be off-loaded into the checked bagage. It took them an hour to sort this all out. I agree the airline managed to beat even Aeroflot on the price but that does not justify their lack of common sence. There is one simple process to avoid all this frustration: just put someone at the gate to measure the dimensions of the cabin baggage! And make the passengers hand all those bags that do not qualify. The meal was just awful, too.

### "spotless cabin with decent legroom"
Flew Austrian Airlines from Vienna to New York JFK. Had a pleasant flight on refurbished B763-spotless cabin with decent legroom and adequate IFE. Lunch was tasty and of a decent size but snack before landing was inadequate-just a half of a sandwich. FAs were proactive and served us with smiles, looked happy to do their job. We landed 20 minutes earlier but gate was not available so we waited until it become available. Miles were credited next day.

### "cabin crew were slow"
London Heathrow to Odessa via Vienna with Austrian. Worst airline experience I've had - I'd rather fly Ryanair. Cabin crew were slow, curt and truly awful. Refreshments were a choice of an apple, a chocolate wafer busciut or salt snacks. They were totally incapable of dealing with a full flight. It was just awful. I hope and pray I never have to use them again and I would never choose to use them

### "an impeccable travel product"
Flew New York JFK to Vienna and back, and would happily fly with Austrian again and again. The food was pretty good, with frequent and generous drinks services, including free booze. Considering how other legacy carriers have cut back on food / drinks, in both quantity and quality, Austrian continues to offer an impeccable travel product.

### "food quality was acceptable"
Tehran to Toronto via Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Not a comfortable airline. The cabin crew were kind but careless and noisy. Food quality was acceptable. Movies were up to date. For the return flight they told us that our flight would have a 2-hour delay. Then after 5 hours they just told us that "the flight is cancelled"! It was terrible.

### "uneventful yet pleasant short flight"
Uneventful yet pleasant short flight from Vienna to Hamburg. The flight departed and arrived on time despite foggy weather in Hamburg. Friendly flights attendants. As it is a pretty short there was no inflight entertainment but free drinks and a very tasty muffin were served. For flights within Europe Austrian Airlines is definitely one of my favourite airlines.

### "good one day, bad the next"
Podgorica to Lyon via Vienna. My priority is that an airline can successfully manage flight connections. Sometimes Austrian can be very good in Vienna, achieving connections despite very short times between the arrival of one flight and the departure of the next. But on November 17, Austrian let me down. The flight from Podgorica arrived early, but the queues at passport control and security check were so long that I missed my connection. Even worse, the lady at the Service Desk blamed me for taking so long. So beware - Austrian can be good one day and bad the next.

### "I recommend this airline"
Athens to Vienna on Austrian. The flight attendants were very professional and attentive. The overhead bins were full so the flight attendants asked us to place smaller items under the seat or to check the bags in the baggage hold free of charge. The seats were okay for short-medium flight durations. However, I did not appreciate the fact that we were offered only a small salty or sweet snack and a drink for the 2hr journey. This was at all not sufficient or acceptable for a full cost airline. Overall, I recommend this airline, but do bring extra snack with you.

### "a pretty average airline"
Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Vienna with Austrian Airlines. This is a pretty average airline compared to other European airlines I have flown with: Lufthansa, Air France, Swiss. The cabin crew were generally unsmiling and disinterested, although they did work hard to get the first meal served quickly so passengers could sleep. Leg room is on the narrow side, although the seat itself is comfortable. IFE was okay. The food was a let down. Portions were small and the fish, which is usually a healthy option, was just deep fried portions with rice and a small amount of sauce. There was just a sandwich for breakfast, which seems ungenerous on an 11+ hour flight. On the upside we also flew the 777 to TLV and the service on that flight was excellent. Avoid row 18 window seats on the 777 because it's mainly just wall and the window is behind your head.

### "No Wifi, no IFE"
Vienna to Paris CDG with Austrian. Seated in the first row after business class so plenty of space for my feet. No Wifi, no IFE. Meal was just one little cake. Beer or wine included - refills were provided. Service very friendly. Pleasant flight.

### "a very mixed experience"
These two flights with Austrian were a very mixed experience. For the first flight and on the positive side, the plane left on time, it was clean, the crew polite and the seat pitch (the distance between seats) in the Economy class was the largest that I have seen in a European airline, one which could easily accommodate very tall people. On the other hand, the crew did not crack a smile even once, the seats were hard and would only recline slightly and the "food" served was practically non-existent (either a sweet bar or a small back of salted biscuits). On the second flight, the crew was better but still nowhere near a really professional one and the seats were softer and satisfactorily reclining, but with very limited space (small pitch). The "food" was even more limited, with no choice at all; only a small sweet bar. The Vienna airport terminal that I waited for my next flight again a very mixed experience; it was very functional and clean, but aesthetically very unappealing and with a very limited selection of dinners and cafes.

### "Seat a bit narrow"
Vienna to Bangkok with Austrian and attendive service. Glasses were never empty, meals exceptional. Seat a bit narrow but okay on this flight. IFE is huge but no WIFI. Looking forward travelling with Austrian in future

### "seats were average but very clean"
Flew from New York JFK to Vienna. Excellent experience from ticket purchase to landing. Best airline food we have had. All the staff were very friendly and we even departed early. Frequently offered drinks during flight. The seats were average but very clean. We will 100% fly with Austrian Airlines again.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Athens to Miami via Vienna. This airline exceeded my expectations for international travel. The plane was new, the flight crew was exceptionally friendly and attentive. The seats, especially for economy, were very comfortable and offered plenty of legroom ( I am 5'10' and am a "healthy" size woman). The inflight entertainment was well rounded and included music, television, movies and games. The food was quite good with reasonable portions. I will certainly fly this airline again.

### "very enjoyable flight"
Flying from Zurich to Lugano (Agno). The flight is booked via Swiss International Airlines but operated by Austrian Airlines. Boarding was to schedule and didn't take much time. Passengers were driven to the plane by bus and greeted by two very friendly crew members. The plane was about 80% full. We took off on time and after around 40 minutes, we were already landing at Lugano. It was a very pleasant flight. The seats were rather convenient and there was more than enough leg room for me (1.80 metres). As this was a very short flight, we were just given a bottle of water and shortly before landing some chocolate, as the flight was operated for Swiss and the always hand out some swiss chocolate. Overall a very enjoyable flight with some great views over the swiss alps.

### "smiling flight attendants"
I flew from Vienna to Sarajevo with Austrian Airlines. The flight was on an A320. As we boarded, we were greeted by smiling flight attendants dressed in bright red uniform and strains of Mozart's music were being piped through the cabin during boarding. As it was a lunch time flight, I pre-ordered a hot meal of paprika chicken from the airline's contract caterer Do&Co for 15 euros. After levelling off, flight attendants started serving snacks and beverages. My lunch was served piping hot shortly. Although it was a short 1-hour flight, service was offered efficiently in a friendly manner so characteristic of airlines of the Lufthansa group.

### "very spacious and clean"
We've been rebooked to an Austrian flight due to a previous flight cancellation and we were happy to enjoy a pleasant experience with Austrian flying from Amsterdam to Vienna. Everything went smoothly, flight departed and landed on time, cabin crew were helpful (could have smiled a bit more though). There was only a little chocolate snack and drink service, but for the short flight it was ok (although KLM served a wrap on the same route). The A319 felt very spacious and clean, it's been refitted with new slim seats which are very comfortable, definitely enough for short haul flights, thanks to slim seats, the legroom is also quite decent. I like the A320 series more than B737, as they are much quieter in my opinion. Looking forward to trying Austrian's long haul service next year, by now, I'd definitely reccomend Austrian Airlines.

### "staff attitude excellent"
Hamburg to Vienna with Austrian. A very good flight, right on time. Very nice cabin with good seats. Free beverages served twice and hot sandwich is also served at noon flight. Staff attitude excellent, one of the quality airlines of Europe. A national flag carrier should be of this quality, like Swiss or BA, far superior to SAS and Iberia which operate like a cheap flight.

### "seats were comfortable"
Flew Austrian Airlines from Vienna to Klagenfurt. After a fast bus boarding the plane took off in time. Despite the fact that this was a 35 minutes lasting domestic flight, Austrian airlines provided a full snack and berverage service. Even a small Austrian "Jausn" with a little desert was given away in business class. The cabin crew was very caring and they seemed to enjoy their jobs. Although it was a very small plane, the seats were comfortable.

### "uncomplicated and smooth"
Vienna to Stockholm. Had a really pleasant flight with Austrian Airlines. Check-In was super smooth as the whole journey. Cabin crew were outstanding, only the snack was ridiculous. A small pack of crisps or a chocolate bar. No monitors provided for flight information. All in all a good experience and recommend flying with Austrian as it is uncomplicated and smooth.

### "can't say anything negative"
Flew Austrian Airlines from Chicago to Vienna. Can't say anything negative, from the very attentive and very friendly flight crew, very good meal selection, loved the coffee bar, highly recommend the double espresso with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream in a tall glass (unless you're planning to sleep). Business class lie flat seat with HD large screen personal entertainment device. The entertainment selection was limited, actually watched a Japanese film with translation. Overall, Worth the money spent. Don't expect the same level of service on domestic routes. The business lounges were tight both in Chicago and Vienna with limited selection on food and beverage but liked the hot shower before making connection.

### "meal was simple but good"
Flew from Athens to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Boarding procedure was easy and fast, the ground staff was friendly. The inflight service was good and the meal served was simple but good. Some snacks and coffee. Seats were not so comfortable but they are ok for short distances (3x3,5h).

### "lack of support and communication"
Dubrovnik to London Heathrow via Vienna. Shockingly bad. Our first flight was delayed which meant we missed our connecting flight. When we arrived at Vienna there was no information for us as to where we supposed to go to. There was literally no staff for at least 8 gates. When we did find someone hey told us to go to the gate our original flight was leaving from. We went, the flight had left and again no one around. On the service desk they rebooked a flight with BA. There was no apology for our delay. We were given instructions to leave the departures and go back through arrivals to check our baggage in. When we questioned another person they gave us different instructions and were told to go straight to the gate. The lack of support and communication was appalling.

### "inflight entertainment excellent"
I flew Austrian from Miami to Stockholm via Vienna. Flight was on one of their Boeing 767-300's. These planes according to their website have all had their interiors redone, and it seemed that was the case. The inside looked fresh and modern. The seats were fine and the inflight entertainment systems were excellent with what seemed like HD screens. I flew economy, food and service were acceptable, and flight crew pleasant. Both flights arrived on time or early. I would fly Austrian again.

### "leg room was tight from the start"
Austrian Airlines Boeing 777 from Vienna to Bangkok the leg room was tight from the start but when the passenger in front put the seat back, I was riding sidesaddle for the rest of the trip. Also on Austrian, you get one meal (not bad quality) and then a sandwich with a yoghurt for the second meal just before landing at Bangkok. The experience, by contrast was even more disappointing when we then proceeded to Sydney on a Thai Airways 747 (also 10 hours) with sufficient leg room and delicious food. The service was friendlier too.

### "hungry and upset with experience"
London to Tehran via Vienna. Staff were generally polite and helpful. However, booking online is a capricious system experience. Biggest problem was extremely low quality of inflight food. Lunch was a 1$ packet of pritzel and cup of tea for a 2 hour flight to Vienna. Dinner was boiled pasta with ketchup sauce, no meat. Bread was served in open basket with many many passengers dipping their hands into the basket to take bread and talking over the bread basket. Totally unhygienic. Total flight cost almost $1000 and 7 hours flight. Arrived hungry and upset with the experience. The cabin staff were polite and agreed catering was unacceptable, but it is out of their control.

### "pleasant and efficient experience"
Nice to Prague via Vienna for the first time with Austrian Airlines. On the route to VIE a brand-new E195, nice and spacious cabin and nice cabin crew. Only a small cake was offered for breakfast on this early departing flight and I was expecting something more. LH for example, offers a hot snack on the most of their morning flights but it was tasty and enough for this such a shorter European route. Complimentary soft drinks provided. Transfer at VIE very fast and efficient within approx. 45 minutes in the "F gates" section. Driven by bus to the terminal from the apron stand. Route from VIE to PRG to be operated by lovely and smaller turboprop DH4, feeling like a swallow above the clouds - I do love these prop-types very much and always to be pleased to fly them. A very short flight that took 45 minutes. No snack offered, drinks only. A pleasant and efficient experience to fly Austrian.

### "recommend flying with Austrian"
Flew with Austrian Airlines from Hamburg to Vienna and back to Berlin-Tegel. The booking process was very easy and clear. I booked tickets for my in-laws and for my family. My in-laws flew back to Hamburg and there was one thing I didn't like: I found out a few weeks before our flight that their return flight to HAM was cancelled. I didn't get any message, I just found out because I something check if our flights are okay. I called Austrian and they immediately booked them on a later flight but I think that it's very bad that didn't inform us. They couldn't even tell me a reason why I didn't get an e-mail. With our flights everything went well. The flight attendants were friendly, snacks and drinks were provided and the leg room was HUGE (I would say I nearly had 10cm room and I could stretch out my legs very well (I'm 1.67m) and even my boyfriend who is 1.90m had enough space). The flight HAM-VIE was delayed for 20 minutes but we arrived just 10 minutes late which was okay. The flight VIE-TXL departed on time and arrived nearly 15 minutes early. I recommend flying with Austrian Airlines and I would consider flying them on long haul flights due to the huge legroom in Economy Class.

### "inflight service very good"
Vienna to Zurich with Austrian Airlines. Boarding procedure was fast, the ground staff was very friendly, and despite the fact that the flight was completely booked out the plane took off in time. The inflight service was very good and the meal served was even better. The captain kept us well informed during the flight and provided helpful data concerning connection flights. As the staff at Vienna airport, the flying personnel seemed to enjoy their job and we disembarked happily.

### "aircraft clean and staff well groomed"
Manchester to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Airport staff very courteous. Checked in luggage and proceeded to Sky Lounge priority pass. Flight was delayed for a hour. The seat I was allocated at the airport was exit aisle. Empty seat next to me which was great. The flight attendant was polite and engaged in conversation which is quite unusual. Since my inward and outward flights were with Austrian Airlines I found the aircraft to be clean and the staff well groomed and professional. Would definitely fly with them again.

### "a very frustrating experience"
The Austrian Airlines flight from Nice to Vienna was originally cancelled before being rescheduled. This on its own would be frustrating yet bearable, the true problems arrived in how both myself and many others were forced to wait for three hours before being even able to talk with airline staff. This treatment was without a doubt extremely frustrating. Beyond being forced to wait for an absurd amount of time, the compensation offered was negligible, despite how due to the delays we were arriving ten hours later. All in all a very frustrating and unsatisfactory experience was had.

### "flight was simply average"
All in all the flight was simply average from Vienna to Bangkok. The food was disappointing. The cabin crew were rather old and not up to international standards. Entertainment was limited. Luckily the flight was almost empty in economy. Having tried to get an upgrade I was told business is full and they are evening downgrading people. Had to press the call button a number of times to get someone to bring some water. When someone finally came, I asked why I had to press the button ten times, she said 'sir we are experiencing turbulence' eventhough we really were not and the seat belt sign was off. Ultimately cabin crew are there to serve people.

### "quite pleasant journey"
Return trip from London Heathrow to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Overall, quite pleasant journey. The outbound flight was late but that was due to weather so it wasn't really their fault. The plane was clean and relatively well maintained. Considering both legs were fully booked flights, the boarding process was quite smooth. The ground staff and FAs were courteous and helpful. The snack could be better even for short flight.

### "surprisingly quite comfortable"
Customer ground service at Washington IAD was very nice. Flight attendents greeted me with a smile as I boarded the plane. My seat was in the middle row, and was surprisingly quite comfortable. The Washington - Vienna flight was a 767, and looked young-ish. No rattling of cabin. Good inflight movie selection. Flight attendants proffesional and cordial and speedy inflight service. Good meals. 14h layover in VIE, ok accomodations at NH hotel. Boarded the flight to Yerevan, flight announcement in English, German, Armenian. Great dinner onboard, but craft looked like it had seen better days. Inflight staff helpful.No tv on A320. Disembarcation at Yerevan was a nightmare. Overall good experience. Would fly with Austrian again.

### "avoid Austrian, avoid Vienna airport"
Early at the airport, I tried to get on an earlier flight for which the correct yet unfriendly employee in ticketing wanted to charge an extra €150. I decided to wait. Based on previous good experiences with Austrian (short and long haul), I decided to purchase an Upgrade to Business Class at the airline’s service desk in pier F. While queuing, I had ample opportunity to watch the demotivated, unfriendly and seemingly overstrained staff. Their supervisor made occasional appearances, discussing how to organise the shift and which employee could leave when, not casting a single look at the queue of meanwhile 20 impatient passengers. After more than half an hour, I was granted the privilege of acquiring the Upgrade for the amount of €225. I did not use the OS lounge - I was too fascinated to see the overcrowded airport and Austrian announcing one delay after the other. Due to he late arrival of the incoming aircraft'. Strangely, it was all Austrian planes that had left Vienna 2–3 hours before. On board, the added value of Business consisted of an empty seat besides me (as many were also in Economy), and an open curtain providing panoramic views of the cabin. The meal consisted of coleslaw, to mini meatballs and a stale jellyroll (see photo). An effrontery to charge €225 what at best did cost Austrian an incremental €10. My complaint afterwards was handled with a ‘copy and paste’ response. Avoid Austrian, avoid Vienna airport.

### "onboard services were excellent"
Toronto to Bucharest via Vienna. The flight of Austrian Airlines for me and my wife from Toronto (Canada) to Bucharest (Romania), via Vienna, (Austria) was not what I had expected in terms of scheduling and mechanical problems, that led to a half-day delay and missing our my arranged pick-up from the airport to our hotel. However, the ground staff at Vienna was extremely helpful and courteous. We were offered a small lunch voucher to compensate for the delay. When I complained to Austrian Airlines after our trip to Eastern Europe, the customer service staff responded promptly. We were compensated for an amount of Canadian $100, which was much more than what I claimed for our loss. We appreciate the generosity of Austrian Airlines and the customer respect we received from this Airline. It appears that delay in flights is not unusual with Austrian Airlines. This may be an area that needs some improvement. However, the ground staff and on-board services were excellent and the food and drinks are good. The seats and on-board entertainment may need some attention. In summary, Austrian Airlines is a reasonable air travel carrier with excellent customer and on-board services.

### "would rather pay a bit more"
Went to Budapest with Lufthansa (on time and no issues) and returned with Austrian Airlines (delayed flight, missed connection, stay in Vienna). While I do have to say that the ground personnel attitude with us was a plus (maybe because of my Gold status? ), the lack of information and impact on my work are unacceptable. What I find even more impressive was the sheer amount of people, from many destinations, that were at the service counter complaining or obtaining vouchers for restaurants and hotels. Wondering if/how this is even viable? I didn't book these tickets, they were a gift, and I was told they were close to the cheapest for this destination. Now I know why that is the case, I would rather pay a bit more and arrive on time.

### "helpful doing my rebooking"
Vienna to Frankfurt. I was going to fly with Brussels Airlines through Zaventem but due to the events there in March, I was rerouted and rebooked for this flight. The ground staff from Austrian Airlines was helpful doing my rebooking. Check-in and boarding was very simple and fast. The cabin was very clean and that bright red colours gave the cabin a classy, yet cheerful ambience. Room was more than adequate, and seats very comfortable. The meal was simple but very tasty and fresh. Staff was very polite, cheerful and nice. The flight was very quiet, no turbulence and the view over Austria and Germany was amazing! Will be flying with Austrian Airlines as soon as I have the chance!

### "low service level"
Bangkok to Amsterdam via Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Really poor service - food was bad and seats also poor. An 11 hours flight with only 1 meal and 1 snack. The beverages offered were ok. It was cold in the plane. The crew were friendly but overall this is an airline with a low service level.

### "same seat like in economy"
I flew Austrian Airlines short haul business class from Vienna to Sofia. The lounge in Vienna was nice and the ground service too. The food on board was excellent and the crew was friendly. I was the only passenger in business class. Basically the European short haul business class is the same seat like in economy, but just has the middle seat blocked.

### "not be flying Austrian again"
Travelled to Delhi March 25th. Flight from LHR to VIE was good, friendly cabin crew, decent food; albeit it being the prepaid a la carte option. Once we got to Vienna, we found out our flight had been delayed 6hrs. We only found out about our flight being delayed via the board at the gate; there were no ground staff to inform passengers of this and when I trapsed down the other end of the terminal to the only counter that had any staff, the Austrian airlines representative was so rude. When the plane finally took off, the entertainment system had limited choice and the headphones were so bad, that even with the volume full it was drowned out by the engine. So films were watched with subtitles and no sound, which is annoying on a long haul flight. Again, the food was delicious on this flight and the selection of drinks/beverages was good. When it came to our flight home from Delhi, we arrived at the airport, giving all our documents to the guard who checks it before letting you proceed into the airport. He informed us that our flight didn’t exist anymore and we would need to book another ticket. So off we went to the help desk to which we were informed that Austrian had stopped their service from DEL to VIE and we’d been moved to a Lufthansa flight. This was fine, but we had not been informed and meant that we had arrived at the airport 6 hours early for our flight, which was now scheduled to depart at 2:45am. I queried about the a la carte food that I had paid £34 for and the staff said that was fine, but we received no special food, and Austrian have not refunded this to my card. I had no email from Austrian to inform me of this change and no emails from Lufthansa. We ended up flying into FRA instead of VIE and I had no way of contacting my family who travelled to pick me up. Will not be flying with Austrian again.

### "recommend this airline"
I flew Austrian Airlines Economy Class from Sofia to Vienna on the new Embraer 195. The seat configuration was 2-2 and this was very comfortable. The lounge in Sofia Airport was also very nice. The crew was very friendly, but the only thing I didn't like was that the plane was late 30 minutes. I recommend this airline.

### "after service was 0/10"
I flew in February from Oslo to Bologna via Vienna with Austrian. The first leg was delayed by 1 hour, so at Vienna I had to rush to take the connecting flight to Bologna. The inflight service was poor, they served only a snack and some beverages. On the flight from VIE to BLQ they broke my suitcase, so I went to claim and the person in charge gave me a number to call, and even if I called a lot of times nobody replied. So the after service was 0/10.

### "didn't buy a bus ticket"
I was flying from Hamburg to Budapest via Vienna, and the Vienna to Budapest sector was cancalled at 9pm. The airline organised for us a bus transfer to Budapest. The way to Budapest (250 km Highway) took 4 hours and was horrible. Maybe they cancelled this flight because it would be unprofitable for the company, 13 passenger, distance 250 km - much cheaper with bus. But I didn't buy a bus ticket - I bought a flight ticket!

### "recommend this airline"
Austrian Economy Class from Sofia to Vienna. The crew was very friendly and also very helpful with my brother. The food was the usual - snack and drinks (nothing special). I really like the seats which are leather. I recommend this airline.

### "I really liked it"
I flew Austrian Business Class on the A320 from Vienna to Sofia (OS797) and I really liked it. I went to the Austrian Senator Lounge in Vienna and it was very nice and the food was excellent. When I boarded the plane, I was offered a welcome drink and right after takeoff I was served some fish. Now I'm looking forward to my next Business Class flight on Austrian.

### "was a nice long flight"
This was my second time flying with Austrian Airlines from Bangkok to Berlin-Tegel via Vienna. The flight was full of passangers and had 30 minutes delay. Starting from the check-in at BKK Airport, all economy counters are full with group booking check-in. So I had to wait longer. The check-in counters do not seem to know the product of Austrian Airlines, even though they wear Austrian uniform. They do not consider the customer frequent traveler status to be checked-in at business counter, where there was no long queuing. After I showed them the website of Austrian Airlines related to the right as frequent traveler, they permitted me to check-in at business counter. I ordered the vegetarian meal, but the cabin crew has given me a chicken. The seat is little bit narrow. Nevertheless, it was a nice long flight. The entertainment system was OK and a lot of choices of drinks.

### "best long haul experience "
Washington to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. I do not like night flights because usually I cannot sleep, but this time I could  go to sleep with its comfortable flat bed, cosy blanket and pillow. The food was really nice, again we had an on-board chef. The IFE had the latest movies, like the new Star Wars or Steve Jobs, the TV series was limited, but nothing to complain about. Arrive early at Vienna, all in all I would say the best long haul experience I had so far.

### "I was really impressed"
First long haul experience with Austrian, from Vienna to Newark in business class. I was really impressed with the interior, the light blue and the skies really do calm the nerves. Food and catering was excellent, the on-board chef was really authentic. IFE was great, good selection of movies a d series. No delay, comfortable seats, a lot of space as only 4 seats are put in one row. Would fly them again, even though landing was a bit rough at Newark.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
I flew Austrian Airlines before in economy class, but did not know what to expect in business class, since Budapest to Vienna is only a 30 min flight. I was pleasantly surprised. We received little sandwiches and drinks, the crew was very nice and the flight was smooth, no delays or other issues.

### "well below expectations"
I flew with Austrian Airlines from London Heathrow to Vienna and back in March 2016 in business class. I have been in business class within Europe with many airlines and I must say this was a let down. The business class product is well below expectations, and for me not worth the money. On both flights I was offered a small meal within the first 30 minutes of the flight. There were no drinks apart from coffee and a glass of orange juice served straight from the carton. There was no drinks trolley. After this meal was served, I did not see the attendant until the end of the flight. This is not business class to my opinion. Same experience in both legs. On a positive side, flights were on time and smooth. I would fly OS again in the future but I would not pay for business class again within Europe.

### "this flight was a let down"
After several excellent long-haul flights in biz class on Austrian. this flight from Vienna to Bangkok was a let down. Service was very average, very rushed and not personal at all. The reason might be that on this particular route you find mostly tourists on board, even in business class. The catering by Do&Co was outstanding as usual. Upon arrival in Bangkok priority immigrations passes were not handed out. All in all, the flight was nothing to write home about. I will sure give them another chance but expect better on the next flight.

### "a good job on the flight"
Bangkok to Vienna on Austrian Airlines. Smart Boeing 777 plane with comfortable seat. In the two side seats at the rear, on a flight which didn't have a spare seat. Good staff, food ok and felt roomy in the two seat side section but I am glad I wasn't in the 3-4-3 sear layout section. Austrian did a good job on the flight but airlines that use this seating just feel more crammed in than those with 3-3-3. Vienna is a great destination though.

### "use Austrian Airlines again"
Excellent flights from Amsterdam to Sofia return via Vienna with Austrian. Planes were all very well maintained and clean. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Meals offered were very good considering they are only short flights. Flights left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Would definitely use Austrian Airlines again.

### "service onboard pleasant"
Austrian Airlines New York JFK-Vienna-Budapest-Vienna-Newark. Placed on this flight at the last minute at JFK as Lufthansa was in the throes of the first day of an airline strike with no connecting flights Frankfurt to Budapest. Had to wait in line 2.5 hours for re-booking (not Austrian Airlines fault), hence full flight on Austrian, no choice of seats. Plane was a 767 which Austrian flies in the winter and legroom a bit better than their cramped 777 used earlier in the year on a similar route. Service onboard pleasant - video screen on back of seat in front of passenger is larger than some airlines, easy to manipulate (touch system) with range of films and very wide range of Classical Music. Food onboard out of JFK usual chicken or pasta served on small awkward tray with fragile plastic cutlery. The breakfast is a warmed charred Panini - nothing else - probably the worst breakfast one can encounter crossing the Atlantic to Europe. Return flight Vienna-Newark was better with Veal offering instead of chicken and the dreaded second meal of the same charred Panini served on last flight Vienna-NYC ws upgraded this time to tasty sandwich and dessert. Multiple drink runs and pleasant service. Seats still very narrow. Vienna - Budapest very short flight - so only water served and was jet rather than the usual propeller plane probably as all Lufthansa flights from Munich or Frankfurt to Budapest were cancelled due to the strike and Lufthansa's passengers re-routed via Vienna and AUA. Business Class on AUA on this transatlantic route is topnotch - Economy class is only average. No luggage problems at all. Would recommend for convenience but AUA in economy is not at the level it once was. Their flimsy breakfast is an embarrassment.

### "level of low cost carrier"
Austrian Airlines has the service level of a low cost carrier, however some planes of Austrian Airlines are pretty old. The flight from Vienna to Zurich was not full, where they fly in competition with Air Berlin and Swiss departing at the same time.

### "non-existent entertainment"
Milano to Erbil via Vienna with Austrian Airlines regularly over the last 4 years. The short Milano-Vienna flight is usually fine. Vienna-Erbil is a 3.5 hours flight. Over the years I have experienced nearly empty flights and fully booked ones and the cabin service is typically consistent. The real problem is the non-existent inflight entertainment. Their A320 offer no individual TV screens. Overhead small screens every 4 rows were available up to a couple of years ago, but these are always kept closed in recent times - not even showing the old cartoons and gags or flight information. Not a single sheet with sudoku or crosswords is distributed - sometimes there aren't even newspapers available when boarding or they are in German only, which is silly when most passengers are non-German speakers (Austrian is one of the only European airlines connecting Erbil with a daily flight). The meal is not bad but small in size and no choice is offered. The dessert is the same for 4 years. The main dish of baked pasta has been the same for the past 2 years. I like it, but many passengers can't really eat it because of its unbelievably high garlic content. I can't say much about the cabin crew as after serving meal and coffee, efficiently but without smiles, they simply disappear for the next 2 hours. As a comparison, the daily flight from Istanbul operated by Turkish Airlines offers (in economy class to the same destination, for a shorter flight) the choice among two menus, pillows and blankets, and an individual PTV screen with a broad range of movies, hundreds of music albums and some simple video games.

### "was a great experience"
Amsterdam to Tirana via Vienna with Austrian, and the tickets weren't very expensive, so we didn't expect much. But it was a great experience. The crew was very friendly and the trip was comfortable. We couldn't check-in online, but it was not a problem by the desk and she checked us in. We had a delay and the crew helped everyone to tell them which gate they must go to take the another flight.

### "extremely pleasant"
Austrian has introduced new Embraer planes for short flights in Europe. They have 2x2 seat configuration in contrast to previous Fokker configuration 2 x3. Flight from Warsaw to Vienna was extremely pleasant and they had 4 flight attendants on this type of aircraft, which resulted in a more personal and attentive service. The flight was on time and transfer in Vienna was perfect.

### "greeted without smiles"
A short 30 min hop to Budapest. The two cabin crew greeted passengers without smiles and didn't seem like they care about service. No food was offered on this very short trip (just coffee or tea). Would not recommend as an option between these cities - I traveled it as it was part of my package.

### "staff were friendly throughout"
Austrian Airlines from Tokyo Narita to Vienna. I was impressed with the modern and fresh interior of the aircraft. I was a little annoyed no menu was provided to passengers, which are still offered by a few airlines. Staff were friendly throughout the flight and smiling when asked to help. Food was adequate. IFE system was average for the flight, however I found myself running out of options to watch. Flight departed and landed on time so all in all I was quite impressed with the service.

### "in-flight service was poor"
While the Austrian Airlines flight itself from Vienna to Hamburg was uneventful the in-flight service was poor. The flight attendants were slow and the snack selection was tangerine or no tangerine. The wine was good though. We also took off with a delay of almost one hour as only a few de-icing vehicles were in operation despite freezing temperatures. Upon arrival in Hamburg it took almost 30 minutes to get our luggage. Generally I still like flying Austrian but it's not much more than a low cost carrier with premium fares.

### "ticket was quite expensive"
Early departure from Sarajevo to Vienna was delayed by just 10 mins. The Fokker 100 aircraft was extremely old. During the flight the food on this 1hr 20 min flight was without much taste. I thought the ticket was quite expensive like for such a short flight.

### "service was great"
Vienna to Delhi, and the product onboard Austrian's business class is quite similar to Lufthansa, if not in the seat type or seat layout. Seats are comfortable, hi-tech and advanced, but quite narrow and congested. Food is as always commendable and fresh. Service was great, entertainment system had a wide variety of movies and songs, playlist feature was convenient and easy to use, unlike many carriers today.

### "a nice flight"
Austrian Airlines flight from Stockholm to Vienna on an A321. It was a morning flight, a full one. Nice clean cabin interior, friendly crew. Drinks for free, snack offered was the smallest strudel you can ever imagine. All in all, a nice flight.

### "service at Delhi not helpful"
London to Delhi return via Vienna. Seat was reasonably comfortable on long haul (Boeing 767). I thought the IFE was limited. Food disappointing with small portions and not very tasty for me (particularly from Delhi). Cabin crew was variable, some managing a smile whilst others seemed very assertive. Connection in Vienna was quick on return leg, but outbound a nightmare as not clear which channel to follow so ended going through immigration twice and security - Austrian should provide ground staff to advise passengers who are connecting. Austrian ground services at Delhi not helpful when checking in fragile item.

### "highly recommend"
Vienna to New York JFK. Austrian Airlines offers a premium business class experience on long distance flights. Cabin is nice and modern, seats very comfy, great screen, but the biggest difference are the crew and the catering. Crew are caring and friendly, and the food is the the best in my opinion. Would highly recommend.

### "no music or tv screen"
Dusseldorf to Baku via Vienna. The flight from Dusseldorf to Vienna being relatively short I cannot assess the conditions, but it was reasonable. Vienna to Baku, a 4 hour flight, there was no inflight entertainment, no music or tv screen. Tight seats and terrible service. I fly with Austrian Airlines a lot and never had that problem before.

### "love flying Austrian"
Austrian is my favourite airline to cross the Atlantic. I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasn’t happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I won’t make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesn’t have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, it’s very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering I’ve ever had. I actually look forward to all my meals that are prepared by the onboard chef. To end, there is the substantial Austrian coffee menu, which I adore. I love flying with Austrian!

### "I would recommend"
Austrian Airlines staff were cordial, seats were quite adequate, food was definitely edible, and despite other negative traveler's comments, I would recommend. The A320 was comfortable, although there was no entertainment, but I was able to sleep a bit on the flight. The second flight from VIE-JFK was good, no complaints. Not a great selection of movies on the IFE, but not horrible. Seats were fairly comfortable. I would have no problem flying Austrian again if given the opportunity. The price was very good, too!

### "One of our best experiences"
Tel Aviv to Vienna with Austrian. One of our best experiences ever. The seats are wide and comfortable, there is plenty of leg room (my husband's height is 190 and he could seat and stretch his legs without touching the seat in front of him). There are hot meals on night flights and hot breakfasts on morning flights. Exceptional service, very nice flight attendants!

### "experience was terrible"
My experience with Austrian Airlines was terrible. Trip from Klagenfurt to Riga via Vienna and back. First a flight from Klagenfurt to Vienna was delayed and the connecting flight to Riga we missed, even though the pilot assured us that all connecting flights will be reached within the normal time-frame. After landing we ran all the way to the gate but we missed it. The plane was there for at least 15 minutes more, but we weren't allowed on. After rebooking the flight to Riga via Prague we again experienced delays from Vienna to Prague. Of course we missed the flight again, so we had to rebook our flight again and arrived to Riga 10 hours later than planned. Now I am sitting at the gate in Vienna, trying to flight back to Klagenfurt. Guess what? The flight is delayed for one hour. Avoid Austrian Airlines - if you can.

### "seat is the same as economy"
Frankfurt to Vienna with Austrian. A long walk from the lounge, pre-boarding for business pax and frequent flyers. A nice welcome, plenty of space (a whole row for me). The business class seat is the same as economy, no IFE (not needed for 1h flight). Superb food (pasta and chocolate tart) and good staff service, plenty of drink refills. Arrival on time - excellent.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
The first time I used Business Class of Austrian. I am impressed by quality of their product and the professional and friendly service provided onboard these flights. The seat (9K), a single window seat, was very comfortable and their is plenty of storage room. I like the air cushion of this seat which really can be well adjusted to the grade of firmness. The bed setup was comfortable, although maybe the feet area was a bit tight. But I slept very good. The IFE was good, but surely not the best (limited choice), but the handling is easy and prompt, screen is clear and noise cancelling headphones work well. I like the possibility of choosing entrées and dessert from a cart and the main courses (I opted for the Japanese course) was excellent of restaurant quality. The drinks were plentiful and the choice offered good option of mainly Austrian red and white wines. Café service is on offer for the desert, Viennese coffeehouse quality. The attitude of the flight attendants was impressive. Maybe half of the crew (at least in business class) has been Japanese (the vast majority of passengers were Japanese as well). The check-in and lounges have been impeccable as well.

### "service was spot on"
Toronto to Prague via Vienna with Austrian Airlines, and I found it to be great. On time (early arrival). I am almost 6'2, had plenty of room in an economy seat. Food was good. Service was spot on! I would not hesitate to fly this airline again (this was a code share flight with Air Canada, operated by Austrian).

### "incredible is how unfair"
Bologna to Budapest via Vienna. Be aware that the offer Austrian Airlines submit via email cannot be honored sometimes. Briefly I received email of an offer called "My Halloween" that should have given right to a 10% of discount for reservation performed the day of Halloween. I did reserve this on 31st October at 23:41 pm - the discount was not applied and Customer care said that this is because despite reservation performed on time, the tickets were issued 1st of November at 2 am about. This is incredible and more incredible is how unfair is their "Customer Care" Center. Flights often in delay, not so clean and food poor.

### "inflight services are good"
Athens to Bangkok via Vienna. I'm presently in the Vienna business class lounge. The food offering is French onion soup, cream celery soup, bread, a nondescript sandwich spread and little squares of cake. We travel all over the world and this is the worst. When flying long overnight flights (Vienna to Bangkok) we rely on some decent food in the lounge because we don't want to wait until 2am for dinner onboard. The inflight services are good and the flight attendants are exceptional. But I will think carefully before booking long on Austrian again.

### "enjoyed my first experience"
Miami to Delhi via Vienna. I enjoyed my first experience on Austrian. The flights were both on time, the Business Class seats were mostly comfortable (not much room to move your feet when your seat is in the lie flat position), the staff was cordial and the meals were delicious. My only negative observation was the the warm temperature of the cabin on both segments - Austrian does not have personal air vents on these aircraft.

### "cheap on luggage allowance"
The new Austrian luggage restrictions and payment for checked in luggage causes passengers to bring way too much luggage into the cabin, and the crew is not able to handle it in a good manner. Austrian should not be so cheap on the luggage allowance. It annoys passengers even they buy a "good" airline ticket, and then have to pay extra for a suitcase.

### "only problem was my food"
Vienna to Toronto, and the Austrian Airlines staff were great. Only problem was my food. I discovered that I was getting Gluten free food instead of my diet/lite meals. Staff tried to switch food but no extra was available on fight home. They did change my pasta on the flight to Vienna. Please consider a meal category with fruit, vegs, dairy, meat, no sweets, no tomato sauces that don't sit well with late dinners on long bumpy flights! I love the Austrian coffee. I don't enjoy the new crackers with seasoning, Want my fish back!

### "staff unhelpful and rude"
Travelling Innsbruck to Zagreb via Vienna. Austrian Airlines offer hotline for their customers with gold status which should help with reeboking in a case of delay. Airport INN announced that their flight 906 to VIE will be delayed, however Austrian hotline provided inaccurate information and tried to convince me that there will be no delay. At the airport, they were informed about the delay and proposed to stay in a hotel in VIE overnight. They did not show any initiative to rebook on the flight of their partner Croatia Airlines. Finally, they rebooked me since I insisted. Their staff in INN is not well trained and their priority is to charge passengers for luggage instead of providing service to passengers on delayed flights. They do not have a lounge what is now especially problematic due to frequent cancellations and delays. Austrian was unable to provide any drink to Business and Star Alliance Gold Passengers during 1 hour and 55 minutes waiting time at the airport. The staff in Innsbruck is particularly unhelpful and rude. Ground operations service level of Austrian is very low.

### "can't say enough about service"
Flew from Washington Dulles to Vienna with Austrian Airlines on the way to Venice. Can't say enough about the service or food in business class on this flight. In fact the food was as good or better than any meal we had in Italy.

### "impressed by the product offered"
Have flown Vienna to Tokyo in Austrian Airlines business class in August. Having flown on Austrian business class several times since they have introduced the new cabin and was once again impressed by the product offered. Intercontinental lounge in Vienna small but nice. Nothing extraordinary but a decent lounge to spend a short time prior to departure. Boarding smooth. Welcome on board very warm. New cabin is a joy to travel in. Design friendly, seats great, entertainment program very nice. Food, in my opinion the best in the skies. Everything is restaurant quality. Viennese coffee specialties a great touch. Crew were fabulous. Will fly them again.

### "no response from customer service "
My partner and me had an Austrian Airlines flight from Vienna to Dubrovnik in August. We had to reschedule our flights and cancelled our accommodation in Dubrovnik, and also missed out on a start of a cruise that we were to catch up with on Korcula. We had made arrangements to catch the last ferry that evening that would take us from Dubrovnik to Korcula. Halfway to Dubrovnik our flight was rerouted to Zagreb which led us to miss our ferry. This left us stranded in a strange city at peak season on a Sunday evening with no chance for accommodation. We notified our cabin crew that we had missed our connection and they directed us to the land crew who were to help us make further arrangements. At the airport terminal, we quickly realised that there was no Austrian Airlines representative available. We asked the information where a lady pointed to the Croatian Airlines counter who represent Austrian Airlines in Croatia. When turning to the Croatian Airlines counter, the lady shrug her shoulders and asked us to "write an email to Austrian". She did offer to look up whether there were any other ferries or buses to Korcula but there were none until the next morning. Then I asked: "Who could help us? I was given the worst possible answer a customer service officer could give: "You can only help yourselves. Finally, after a very expensive taxi ride to Orebic and catching the last passenger ferry we made it to Korcula. No thanks to Austrian Airlines. The following day me and my partner lodged a feedback form and a request for an official statement to confirm that our flight was delayed so we could claim the extra expenses from our insurance. After a month of no response from their customer service and after exchanging email with them over two months, we are yet to receive our statements.

### "meals downgraded in quality"
Austrian Airlines, which I have been flying transatlantically and within Europe for decades keeps slinking downward in service. Flying from JFK via Vienna to Budapest return, I found out that in order to book seat reservations one must pay extra or to do so within 36 hours of the flight's departure. Going online, this proved impossible, even less than 36 hours before departure as it stated "You cannot reserve a seat on this flight" so a call to Austrian Airlines in the USA within 36 hours of departure indicated that they could not or would not book a seat. One had to arrive at the airport and take one's chances. The Boeing 777 Austrian flies from JFK has the most cramped seats regarding width of seat and pitch and this was further complicated by a very corpulent seatmate who kept his legs far apart and spilled over into my seat snatching about one third of my allocated space. The meals served on Austrian in Economy have been downgraded in quality and quantity - chicken or pasta. The chicken dish served enroute to Vienna was rather tasteless. Lufthansa and Swiss have metal cutlery - why cannot Austrian? I tried to opt for a Do&Co meal online for the flight from JFK to Vienna (at extra charge) some weeks before departure, but Austrian's website rejected that request. Austrian's once glorious breakfast in economy (cold cut plate, fruit etc) has been downgraded to a warm cheese pannini served in a napkin. The same type pannini was served as the second meal returning to NYC. The main meal out of Vienna to JFK was tastier than the flight originating at JFK but it was quite small. In Budapest it also proved impossible to book a reserved seat online within 36 hours for the return flight. Austrian has a larger IFE screen than Lufthansa or Swissair, with a large dose of classical music on offer and a slightly simpler ability to operate the visual entertainment. Service onboard is average or slightly above. Austrian was once among the finest of airlines to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the USA - now it is more of a budget airline. The short flight Vienna to Budapest on a propeller plane had no service save for a bottle of water -  but a very short 45 mins flight. I do not really recommend Austrian for economy flights, although Austrian business class is quite superior compared to rival airlines.

### "good flight with a friendly crew"
Austrian operates this route on behalf of Swiss. Lugano airport is small and convenient. Quick boarding and a short hop over the Alps at sunset. Q400 is a propellor plane but quite comfortable. Were offered a bottle of water and a chocolate. I booked this flight after Darwin cancelled the route Lugano-Zurich due to competition from Swiss, but Darwin was half the price of Swiss so it would be better that Darwin re-opens this route. All in all a good flight with a friendly crew, but with CHF 100 a bad price.

### "crew was outstanding"
Our flight from Vienna to Athens with Austrian Airlines was good. The flight was full and we had seats somewhere in the middle (window and middle seat). The seats look new from leather. The comfort was quite good. When I travel on business, I usually take time on the plane to relax and I almost every time ask for a pillow. The steward was very friendly and since the pillows are for business class only, he managed to bring me one anyway. He was very helpful. When we landed I told him he made my day and how little it is necessary that the customer is happy. The service of this crew was outstanding.

### "services continue to decline"
Austrian offers their product Smart Upgrade online, however it seems that they are confused with it and do not want any passengers/revenue in the business class. For a domestic 40 minutes flight, upgrade of EUR75 was offered and rejected. It is interesting that "C" class VIE-INN was empty. However, they prefer to use business class to deliver food and drinks to their crews returning to INN only. Lounge staff in VIE shows a complete lack of interest and is unable to solve any problem with booking. It seems they can only check boarding pass barcode at the entrance. Repeatedly, Austrian services continue to decline and lack of interest of staff in VIE is obvious.

### "price of the ticket was high"
Warsaw to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. This was a small plane and some passengers had a hard time stowing their bigger hand luggage in the overhead compartments. The crew was pleasant and I liked that we were served drinks and a snack for a 1 hour flight. At the beginning of the flight a passenger was watching a movie on her phone with no head phones and at a later point a gentleman was playing/changing ringtones on his phone and the whole plane had to listen to this. I think the crew should have told these passengers to use headphones and not disturbed the rest of the people. Overall I think the price of the ticket was high for the service provided.

### "offer a service that is so basic"
Flights departed roughly on time and arrived early on all four legs of the outbound and return journey. Planes were clean and modern. Cabin crew were friendly and polite. Leg-room fine for short-haul flights although seats would have been uncomfortable for anything over two hours. However, Austrian offers a service that is so basic it verges on the minimal. The outbound flight left Heathrow at 6.00am meaning you had to be at the airport for 4.00am when minimal services were open and operating in the terminal. All Austrian airlines had to offer on a 2 hour flight at this time was tea, coffee or soft drinks and a tiny, dry pastry. This really is unacceptable, it wasn't even possible to buy breakfast on the plane. Service on the other legs of the journey was also limited to drinks and a sweet or savoury snack (both of which were dry and tasteless). There is no in-flight entertainment and the in-flight magazine is produced quarterly rather than the usual monthly. For a full fair national carrier Austrian Airlines really need to up their game. I would never willingly use their services again because they are just not value for money.

### "IFE screen was faulty"
I expected better quality especially on the Austrian Airlines long-haul segment from Vienna to Bangkok. One of my concerns lie in the poor quality entertainment systems - the screens on my seat, and two other travellers around me, were faulty and kept sending a call to cabin staff as well as being difficult to control- the sound level was also too low and we basically couldn't watch any movies on a ten hour flight! The cabin felt more crowded (less legroom, less spacious) than the subsequent flight I took with Thai to Brisbane. Prior to the flight it was also difficult to do online check-in and for special meal requests to be lodged. Meals were bland. The positive was that I got from A to B safely and on time.

### "it was impossible to contact the airline"
Austrian Airlines flight was great, the plane fairly new, leg room. The floor under the seat in front of me needed to be vacuumed but other than that it was clean. However, our luggage was delayed, which happens but it was impossible to contact the airline to find out where it was and what was happening. The website we were given when we reported the bags hadn't arrived only said to check back later -. for three days it said the same thing, even after they were delivered. I called numerous numbers including the one we had been given only to be told that they handled Lufthansa and not Austrian. Then the number from the website was was no longer in service and the only way I finally got through was to leave a message on the machine for lost items at Newark. Finally Austrian Airlines called us after almost 3 days. Delivery was supposed to be at 4, then 7, then 8, 9 - finally at 11pm our bags arrived. I've had delayed luggage before and it's a pain but not a big deal but this was incredibly frustrating. Austrian Airlines check your phone numbers!

### "I was totally blown away"
After a long flight from New Zealand on pale pastel purple Thai Airways, the bright red and white and smart graphic style of the Austrian Business Class cabin on my Bangkok to Vienna flight was a real eye-opener. The crew were bright, brisk and friendly. The Business cabin was completely full, as was the Economy according to my fellow traveller. Big surprise! A crew member dressed as a chef came out, took the dinner orders and the breakfast card. I don't know how they did it, but the food looked and tasted like food from a fine restaurant on the ground. My chicken breast was a proper full grilled tasty chicken breast, served on the best polenta I've ever eaten. The texture and taste of the food was brilliant, and it was so well served. This food service is the best I've ever experienced in the sky (» Best Business Catering Award 2015), and leaves Emirates First Class for dead. The seats lie flat, the electronic entertainment is bright, crisp and clear. The pillows and sheets and blankets are homely and so inviting. The felt amenities kit is elegant and fun. Everything about this airline is smart, amusing and so very well done. I'm sorry if I sound like a press release (I'm not) but I was totally blown away. And this is after over thirty years of constant air travel.

### "expecting a business class comfort"
I was expecting a business class comfort but was shocked on this A320 - business class has three seats on each side (middle one left empty) and the seats seem identical to the economy class on same plane. The legroom is also tight and a 3.5hr flight with no entertainment at all. My flight from Newark to Vienna was fantastic, but I was so disappointed with the business class seats on the flight from Vienna to Amman.

### "nothing but good words to say"
I flew with Austrian from Vienna to Washington, and back from New York and have nothing but good words to say about my experience. The price was okay. With two kids (10 and 13), an 8+ hours trip can quickly turn into a drag, but not this time. Both planes were clean, crew friendly and helpful, boarding went smoothly, we were frequently offered refreshments. They had an excellent movies selection too. I am fairly tall, 190 cm, but had enough room to sit comfortably. I couldn't sleep much because of the plane noise, so I could probably use some ear protection but didn't think to ask. I missed internet, but not all that much.

### "all in all a good experience"
Copenhagen to Vienna with Austrian on an A320, followed by Vienna to Chicago on a Boeing 767-300, in Business Class. Wasn’t able to use check-in kiosks in CPH as they did not work with my reservation. So, used the manned counter, not a problem as no long lines. Agent finally checked me in after some attempts. Austrian use standard Economy seating (Recaro slim seats) for Business Class with the middle seat left unsold. Those seats are not particularly comfortable, but okay for a flight below two hours. Service onboard was attentive with cabin staff regularly around to top up drinks. A small, but tasty hot meal was served. Austrian uses the SAS Lounge in Copenhagen, which is stylish and comfortable. However, only very limited and cheap cold food (some salads, turkey chorizo and some cake) was available. Drink choices were okay, but wines offered were rather poor. Check-in at Vienna was fast and friendly. I was directed to Non-Schengen Business Lounge, as the small Senator Lounge was probably overcrowded. This lounge is extremely poor - spacious and with a view of the tarmac, but in addition of being a case of design over comfort, the breakfast offerings were poor - some pastries. Coffee was good. Onboard it was an overall good experience; not the most modern plane but updated with the new business class and looked very fresh, 1-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD, good, large high quality screens, however movie selection was not that good and rather limited regarding latest releases. After one flight I have already watched what I wanted to see. Cabin staff were attentive during the extensive meal service, but in hiding mode otherwise; eg. only drink round between meals for 10 hour flight. Meals were tasty and with Austrian and international choices and of restaurant quality. This is where Austrian really excels ! Lunch was a choice of various Antipasti from a trolley, soup, a choice of 3 mains (Prawn Curry or Viennese Veal Goulash or Vegetarian Pasta) and a choice of hot/cold desserts from a trolley. The second meal was a choice of Salmon with potato cakes or Chicken Quesadillas. However, the food choices were almost the same as my flight three months earlier. Same starters and same mains with some variation in the vegetarian pasta and soup for the lunch service, same choices for the second meal. Wines were predominantly from Austria with some good quality choices. US border control in Chicago was fast and efficient, and luggage out fast as well. All in all a good experience with some significant areas for improvement (eg. lounge in VIE, movie selection and staff being more present in the cabin during the transatlantic flight). Recommended, as the most important aspects of the flight itself were good.

### "overpriced flights"
Frequent, overpriced flights with Austrian Airlines for this short trip between Amsterdam and Vienna. Whilst onboard service remains as basic as possible, I'd like to comment on their atrocious myAustrian rebrand which resembles that of a cheap, lowcost airline. The new booking process is clunky, fares that used to include luggage are now hand luggage only (and no cheaper), plus to top it all off, an EUR7.50 fee for any booking apart from an unknown local payment system applies - even higher than easyJet or Ryanair. This used to be a quality airline one would be happy and proud to choose, but now I'd almost rather not fly than fly Austrian.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
I had pre-assigned front seats on flights ZAG-VIE-INN as LH Gold member. During boarding for the second flight in VIE, the seat was changed and the seat closely to the last row was assigned. The gate agent was completely ignorant and spoke about "change of the aircraft". This was not true because they use the same Fokker as every day. The aircraft was almost empty and nobody could understand his behaviour. Fortunately, the crew was more attentive and the seats were changed again after boarding. Overall standard of ground service especially in Vienna is rather low and agents in Vienna extremely unhelpful. Their training level seems to be poor.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Two segments flight with 8hrs waiting time between the flights. There was a small snack  served during the flights. Because I was travelling with a baby I had no chance to choose my seat. On the second segment of the flight a small toy was offered to the baby and the crew showed a bit more concern.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Short delay on the first segment, however I arrived on time, as the connecting flight was not delayed. Drinks served for free on both flights. No food served and no option to purchase food on board, which was unpleasant as I was really hungry. They do advertise as a full service carrier though and the VIE-ATH segment is a 2 hour flight (would be worse if it was a connection from a long haul flight). First flight almost full, second one about 65% full. Connection in Vienna was short, smooth and convenient. Used my smartphone to check in, it was a bit slow and with some errors. In the end did not manage to get the mobile boarding pass, however had no problems as the agent printed them in Zagreb with no extra charge. Overall had an average experience.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Departed Heathrow an hour late due to a problem with the loading of passengers baggage. The flight that was due to leave at 1520 left at 1630 but the Captain kept everyone informed and soft drinks were served during the delay. First the negative, the flight was disrupted by a couple immediately behind me who were unable to control their three children for most of the flight resulted in constant screaming and more amazingly allowing them to unfasten their seat belts as the plane came in to land and throw themselves on the ground. That aside it was an otherwise pleasant flight - I was in row 3 - legroom not great but the middle seat was free. A pretty tasty meal of meatballs and mash potato and vegetables was served around 20 minutes after take off with a nice Tiramisu cake and my sparkling wine was kept topped up throughout the flight by the pleasant and attentive crew who apologised for the screaming children to all business class passengers as we disembarked. Noise aside I was impressed by the service and while the delay was frustrating, Austrian Airlines did their best to keep us informed and we eventually landed in Vienna around 30 minutes late at 19:25.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Dubai to Vienna, a night flight. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable, especially if you desire to sleep during your flight. The quality of earphones is poor and I had to use almost 4 earphones during the course of my journey. The snack served in the beginning was average and for the meal served as breakfast  they had no vegetarian options. The aircraft is neat and clean with a pretty good IFE system.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Our flight was supposed to leave at 7 in the morning. We were at the airport at 5, just to find that our flight was canceled (due to a technical defect we were told and with no replacement aircraft available). Since we (2 adults, one youth) planned to travel onwards from Paris to Marseille via train, we were fine with being rebooked directly to Marseille via Frankfort. Although waiting at the airport for 5 hours we arrived at Marseille as planned. At boarding all three of us were upgraded to business on both legs. Flight back from Paris was alright: staff very nice and courteous; as we had seats in a row without a window, my son and I were offered a row of our own with a window, keeping the middle seat free. Catering is of low quality though, at dinner time only a mini portion of pretzels or a small pack of hazelnut wafers were offered. IFE didn't exist. Austrian is alright if you get a ticket at a reasonable price.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Austrian still fly a Fokker 100 on this route. Admittedly in good conditions but basically an old plane from the 1980s. The service is limited to drinks and some nibbles. The flight assistant addressed me in German and when she realised I did not speak the language she made a face as if speaking English was a big inconvenience to her. If I can avoid Austrian in the future I will.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
I booked my flight with Lufthansa 3 months prior to my departure date. When I arrived to Heathrow airport I was not on a passenger list. I had a confirmation email and my flight details sent to me. They told me I have to buy my tickets again for almost 3x the price I paid before. They could not process my payment but never sent anything, on the opposite, they sent a confirmation email with my flight details! I was so angry and frustrated! I planned this journey far in advance and even decided to go via Vienna, from London to Kiev. It was so uncomfortable, inconvenient and I had to wait in Vienna airport for ages. The flight which usually takes 3 hours with any normal airline with no stops took me 6hrs! I will never fly again with Lufthansa nor Austrian Airlines. The "meal" was terrible- a tiny little pack of salty snack.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Original ticket booked in economy class. Upgraded to Business class on JFK to VIE route. Quick check-in, nice Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at JFK. Boarding delayed due bad weather over JFK and chaos it created at the airport. Once we boarded we were kept on the tarmac for 2 hours. Flight crew regularly updated us of the progress, and cabin crew offered soft drinks. Finally airborne almost 3hrs late. Amazing catering by DO&CO, crew kind and polite. Slept for few hours, seat was ok to sit or relax, to sleep it was a bit hard. Also temperature was rather high - woken up for breakfast which was delicious. We landed in Vienna about 2.5hr late. Would recommend Austrian Airlines.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Every thing was fine until the "meal" was served. It was placed on my tray and when I asked what it was I was told vegetarian pasta. I asked if it had cheese and when told yes I asked for an alternative. In a very nasty tone I was told I should have requested a special meal. And that was that. Luckily the passenger next to me didn't want his kosher meal and gave it to me.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Economy - meal choice not offered. Flight OS830, 26/6/2015. Served (pasta) the only choice. Flight Attendants - attitudes poor. Seats - so so. Price wise, toO high for flight duration and service available onboard. Sinks were not clean.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
After completing the boarding and sitting for around 30 minutes in the plane we were told that we needed to change planes, as there was a problem with the air conditioning. We were sent back to the terminal, and a delay after delay was announced. Then an announcement came that the flight was cancelled. We were told to go to the check in desk. Around 170 passengers were queuing with only 3 counters open and most of the employees were making phone calls or running around to check for something to do. I was in the first quarter of the queue and I had to wait for two hours, I was told the only option I had was a flight the next day around midday, which did not work for me, but they said they don't have any other options. I was sent to a hotel to spend the night. The next morning, the taxi did not show up, I waited for 15 minutes. I arranged a ride to the airport on my own, and when I got there, no one seemed to care. The replacement flight was delayed again, initial announcement for 20 minutes, but take off was finally after 1 hour.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flight ZAG to VIE was cancelled and no explanation was given. Cancellations on that route and also on other European destinations are now very frequent for Austrian. Customers need to call in most cases through Germany because the SEN hotline in Vienna is very inefficient. Cancellations and delays in summer and unhelpful IT hotlines in Austria make this airline not very reliable. Decline in all kind of services of Austrian in 2015 is obvious.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Arrived in Vienna on time. When I got off the plane I was told my daughters stroller would be waiting by the door. It wasn't there. Asked a staff member at the door but he wasn't interested in helping. Once everyone deboarded I asked the cabin crew to help. They went to check and found my stroller, I ran to catch my connection but by this time it was already boarding. I had to go through the customs and security. The staff didn't care that I could miss my flight. They wanted to check baby food, in the end I told them to keep it so I could run to the gate. The electronic departure board said my flight was boarding. When I finally got to the gate I was two minutes late! No call for me and no final boarding sign. Staff very unhelpful. The next flight was in 9 hours but they didn't attempt to help at all. No effort to try and help. Staff at the service desk were just as unfriendly. Were blaming the airport for allowing such a short connection time. Apparently they get lots of travellers every day who miss their connections. I will not fly with Austrian Airlines again if I can help it!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
This airline has cancelled a flight with no notice. Only 2 service desks open for all delayed passengers. I understand from another source that instead of being booked on a direct flight at a later time there will be more than a 24hr delay in my arrival at Vienna as the replacement routing is via another airport. I would recommend anyone to think twice before booking with Austrian Airlines. It's not as if this is an intercontinental movement. Any airline worth its name should be able to arrange a replacement aircraft at reasonable notice.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
The flight was delayed 3 hours 15 minutes and we only found this out when we were waiting to board although obviously the airline knew about this problem in advance The ground personnel were not very helpful except to offer us a free lunch. We finally located the restaurant where this so-called free lunch was available. They offered a choice of two cheap sausages or frozen pizza inferior to what you could buy at the supermarket. The drinks for bottled spritzers with artificial flavors like lemon and orange. The calls for the delay was never explained to us. The in-flight service and food were inferior and mediocre at best. This was a disappointing experience.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Austrian has never really been on my radar but after my flight from Vienna to New York, I have to say I’m very impressed. Austrian flies a 777-200 on this 8+ hour flight and the seat and the catering were what impressed me the most. I took the individual seat by the window which is very comfortable, for it has table space on both the left and right side of the seat. When converted to a fully-flat bed it’s very comfortable - although perhaps a little bit on the narrow side. The IFE was also interesting, with a remote touch sensor to control the cursor on the screen. You could also use the touch screen. It was a simple system but perhaps that's why it worked so well. The catering was superb. Wow! They have an onboard chef that prepares (or warms) fresh, healthy meals. The antipasti and desserts were brought to you on a trolley, where you could make your choices. The rigatoni pasta that I had for my main dish was delicious. The best surprise was yet to come though. The coffee menu! With ten options I was completely spoiled. I ended up choosing the Wiener Eiskaffee ice coffee - espresso with ice cream and whipping cream served in a tall glass. Walked away very impressed with Austrian!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew Business Class. Excellent FA service as they offer so much food and drink on you one feels a bit overwhelmed - but it is better then being ignored. Decent seat that reclines to 180 degrees but I felt claustrophobic. IFE poor selection and service that kept cutting out mid way through the movies. On time arrival.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Very good staff and food. I booked a DO&CO Premium Cusine a la carte and it was extremly delecious! There is enough legroom for everyone (I think so). The plane was a little bit old, but inside it was very comfortable and clean seats, very good salon design.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Austrian still flies the old Fokker 100’s on this 100 minute route, although the interior still seems to be in quite good shape. I loved their breakfast. Austrian perhaps had the best scrambled eggs for breakfast that I’ve ever had in the air. And, they threw in some Frankfurters into the scrambled eggs, which I haven’t had in a long time. Great catering for such a short flight.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
New T2 Terminal in London, Business Class check-in due to Star Gold status. Excellent Lufthansa lounge with excellent selection of food and drinks. Long way to the gate, flight delayed for 45 mins, but we managed to land almost on time in Vienna. A321 used on both flights is very nice plane and legroom was ok. Food only consisted of a small bag of snacks/pretzels and drinks, served by bored-looking and not too friendly FAs. I havent heard "please" or "you're welcome" once. Transfer in Vienna was ok, Austrian Terminal is new but not interesting, just a long grey corridor with gates and few shops - boring. Very nice lounge in VIE, good food and beverage selection. In Sofia my suitcase arrived as a last one, despite being tagged as a Priority. Shame. Both flights just correct, nothing to remember.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Short flight on an A320 with friendly cabin crew and a good selection of drinks available. They used to serve a sandwich on European flights, nowadays one gets a small pack of Pretzels. No IFE and not so comfortable seats. If you are taller than 1.80 m it might be a bit too narrow.

On June 27 we wanted return from Chicago to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. Flight tickets I bought already on February, which were confirmed. At check in the woman told us that we do not have a seat on the plane, and we were put on standby. At boarding, at the end of the line we got 2 seats, but behavior from an airline like this I've never experienced.

Zagreb to Vienna we flew with Dash Q400. Small and noisy aircraft but it is just 45 minute flight. The seats are narrow and I felt very uncomfortable. We got water and snacks. Vienna to Rome we flew with A320, the seats are more comfortable. Although the flight was also short (1,5 hours) they show some short movies or flight plan. We got water, coffee, wine and snacks. On both flights the cabin crew was very polite and helpful.

VIE-EWR on a new 763. Left on time, seat pitch limited, but very new and pleasant interiors and seat. Crew mostly friendly, passing by several times offering beverages. Meal was good but no choice of options given (yes, only veggie pasta was left and a pork sandwich as snack, which might not cater to all passengers). Great IFE offered. Overall, a decent experience with a good value for money.

IAD to VIE in business class on board a B777. An excellent flight. Service and the food prepared by the "Flying Chef" were superb. Excellent cabin crew. Very comfortable lie flat seats. Only negative was the cabin was too warm which made it difficult to sleep. We would definitely fly on Austrian again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew VIE-BKK on 777. Flight left on time and plenty of flight attendants to assist with getting settled welcome drink etc. Chef" taking meal orders is a fun lovely touch. Seat is the best I've flown in business class: fully lie flat decently wide for sleeping on back or either side-being able to adjust how hard or soft is the best thing ever! Strangely the touch control panel is very sensitive and kept turning massage on and off: putting a menu over the panel sorted it out. Duvet very comfy. Pillow should be a bit thicker (I grabbed a second one). Meals were excellent. Will certainly fly them again when the routing works.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Other than an extra $200EU per seat not so great meal and curtain we could not determine how they could call this business class. We flew from Skopje to Barcelona via Vienna. Will stay away from Austrian Airlines in the future.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
The flight from Washington IAD to Vienna was packed. Uncomfortable seats very narrow and since the mom in the seat behind me wasn't able to get a bulkhead seat with a bassinet I wasn't able to recline the seat at all. Food was very uninspired and service barely more than adequate. The pilot provided no flight information updates. All of their cabin crew energy and attention appears to be rationed only for the business class crowd. The connecting lobby in Vienna for the flight to Amman was more like a bus station - crowded uncomfortable noisy.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-ORD on Apr 9 on an 767-300 in Business Class. Slightly delayed arrival probably due to the French ATC strike. On board this was an excellent experience not the most modern plane but updated with the new business class and a very fresh look excellent 1-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats Business just half full. IFE was AVOD with large high quality screens movie selection was fine with some out of the box choices but after one flight I have watched what I wanted to see. FA's were professional attentive and friendly. Meals served were tasty and with Austrian and international choices and of restaurant quality. Lunch was a choice of various Antipasti from a carte soup a choice of 3 mains (very good prawn curry or Viennese veal goulash or pumpkin/ham pasta) and a choice of hot/cold desserts. The second meal was a choice of Salmon with potato cakes or Chicken Quesadillas. Wines served were predominantly from Austria. However drinks in general were just ok. Some drink runs between the meals additional drinks available in the galley. Non-Schengen OS flagship lounge in Vienna rather compact with an ok breakfast selection. However no coffee tea etc. as both machines were out of order. Check-in friendly and competent but boarding was a mess. Additional document control with security questions for US flights right before boarding was carried out by just one (1) employee for the whole plane leading to one very long not really recognizable - line. However there were four gate agents afterwards with nothing to do due the bottleneck at the document control. Due to the weird design of the new terminal it was then not even possible to reach the end of the line when the boarding process actually started in earnest. After a cattle call for boarding with no premium boarding whatsoever passengers from all directions literally stormed the check point and people who have been standing in line were kept waiting while employees directed other people to go first to simply get them out of the way probably one of the most incompetent boarding procedures I have seen so far. While the terminal design in VIE is no fault of OS the choice of the procedure used is OS's choice. Immigration in ORD was a breeze however priority bags were out whenever. So after some mediocre flights with OS within Europe this was an excellent experience in air but not so good on the ground. Still highly recommended for the quality of the long-haul in- flight services. (Star Alliance Gold).

Just returned from another business trip from Vienna to Bucharest and back. My flight was paid for by the company I work for and I flew Economy class and it was the exact same story as before - unfriendly cabin crew horrible in-flight catering and relatively uncomfortable (hard) seats. Both my flights were operated by an A320 aircraft which to my surprise was relatively clean. However my first flight from Vienna to Bucharest OS 783 got cancelled apparently due to low demand. I was re-routed to Bucharest on the next day on OS 791 which was alright although I missed an event I was supposed to attend in Bucharest. The flight back was uneventful and was about 35% full (I even had one entire row to myself. On this leg there was an on-time takeoff and landing back in Vienna. The food consisted of a choice between an Apple or a small bag of solettis. I heard some flight attendants refuse to give passengers either two soletti bags or two apples - Each passenger is only allowed one which is simply unacceptable. There is however a decent variety of drinks as well as decent in-flight entertainment. I honestly could not feel more sorry for myself having to fly Austrian for each one of my business trips. If it'd be my choice I'd choose Tarom for the VIE-OTP route without hesitation or simply any other airline other than Austrian.

Was traveling on EWR-VIE on 29th April. Flight was excellent as usual seat is a great 180 Degree flat bed food and wine selection was outstanding. As usual menu was explained by the chef on board. You even can adjust your meal by having only the main course or have only starter + dessert. The crew were really nice! All in all it was a wonderful flight as usual!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Toronto to Vienna - one way: cabin crew were fairly good - meal service was prompt and they came around several times during the flight with drinks. Problems were the very small serving size of meals offered. Before landing passengers were served a small and unappetizing turkey panini. I see Austrian Airlines is taking its cue from the lacklustre North American airlines. Another problem was the long queues during check-in: Austrian Airlines' self- check in machines were not working meaning passengers could not print their boarding passes or complete their check-in leading to long queues at the check in desks. It was a satisfactory trip which could have been much better.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Nice-Vienna-Warsaw. Both flights on time first on nice and clean A320 - soft but thin leather seats good legroom. Service minimum - either small pack of pretzels or cookies plus beverages. Crew just ok did their job but grooming standards are below average. Connection in VIE was nice and smooth flight to Warsaw with very old turboprop Dash-400. Same minimum service cabin crew groomed better but still - just did their job with no smile or personal service. There are better options.

VIE-JFK on OS 087 in Business Class. Immaculate cabin with very comfortable seats (180 lie flat). Fantastic screens for VOD but selection of movies and tv shows limited. Offered champagne juice and an Austrian cocktail. menus distributed and on board chef took orders for lunch. Takeoff delayed 30 minutes without explanation. After takeoff hot towels distributed followed by excellent lunch service - appetizers from the trolley followed by soup excellent entree and great selection of desserts followed by a selection of individually prepared coffees. Before arrival a second excellent meal. Wonderful wine selection nicely poured. Service was very attentive if without much of a smile (ironically Austrian's motto is "We fly for your smile"). Notably the bathrooms were kept immaculate throughout the entire flight. Overall superb inflight service with the best catering of any airline.

Larnaca to Vienna on airbus 321 - plane was clean but seats very narrow - boarding took a long time caused by a lot of people carrying ample cabin luggage. Flight was extremely bumpy for more than 1.5 hours - decent meal with a choice for the main course - quality of drinks could be better - FA courteous. Information concerning the flight conditions could be given earlier as several passengers were rather afraid. Landing on time.

I flew on OS 789 recently from Vienna to Bucharest and nothing had changed. Austrian Airlines planes have started to age (I flew on a Fokker 100). The flight was about 50% full this time the crew on board was hardly attentive throughout the flight. Same horrible snacks offered (choice of sweet/salty) and if one asks for both a sweet and salty snack (since they're so small) the crew will refuse to serve you both a sweet and salty snack which is absolutely appalling! Having paid €210 for my ticket I was hoping for a slightly higher value for money which didn't happen. Nevertheless the flight was on-time which was just about the only positive remark about this flight.

VIE-FCO-VIE. Booked a red ticket 6 months in advance so we could get a very good price. Flight time was 1 hour 20 minutes - snack was served either sweet or salty together with cold and warm drinks. Crew were attentive and friendly on both legs. Austrian recommended on short haul flights!

TXL-VIE-TLV. I had used the overlay in Vienna to visit the city and was late for the second leg due to a breakdown of the airport train. Austrian rebooked me (and about 100 other stranded passengers) to the next flight without problems (and even got me a seat with extra legroom) not minding that the ticket was not flexible. They also provided food and drinks for the passengers regardless that the train breakdown wasn't their responsibility. Apart from that the service was good with a full meal service on the 3-hour leg however no entertainment (ok for three hours but you have to be aware of it).

So having written a critical review of a trip to Male from London Heathrow in September 2014 I now have to be fair and balanced. Was nervous when best business class fares by far LHR-BKK came out on OS particularly with an exceptionally tight connection of just 30 minutes in VIE. Usual chronic Heathrow delays meant serious chance of missing connection but OS pulled stops out met us and guided us to the gate - shortest transfer I've ever done on the ground for just 15 minutes. Business class service absolutely faultless on both sectors with some seriously outstanding crews - return flights equally efficient. Well done Austrian you have restored my faith and will now be more comfortable flying you again.

Flight DXB-VIE-MXP in Economy class. On the first leg we flew on a B767 that was completely refitted. The quality of the cabin and of the IFE has extremely improved. The seats were the modern thinner ones but were comfortable and I could even sleep. The IFE is new with touch-screen and the content is quite rich with films available in several languages. As we travelled during night (departure 2.30 am) we were served immediately a snack and then a breakfast before landing. The food was nothing special and even a bit cold too: we can say that it was the only bad point. The crew was professional maybe not too smiling but that was not important as we all wanted to rest. In general I can say that I was much more satisfied compared to my previous experience in 2013. Transit through VIE smooth as usual. Flight to MXP on an A320 totally uneventful with a correct standard of service for a European flight. As FTL I could enter the lounge in VIE: quite nice but a bit overcrowded as it was early morning.

On December 12 my husband and I flew out of Dulles-Washington DC to Vienna on an 8 hour and 20 minute trip. Flight 9822. We were warmly greeted upon boarding then promptly given menus to select our dinner and breakfast. There were two chefs in full attire as well as a sommelier to assist us. The flight crew were excellent throughout our journey catering to all needs and exceeding expectations. The entertainment screen was wonderful with a vast selection. Our seats fully reclined to a bed and the blankets and pillow allowed for a comfortable sleep. Meals were excellent and beautifully presented. Return flight #9821 surpassed outgoing flight flights very smooth.

VIE-AMS on Jan 2 and return AMS-VIE on Jan 20 both straight forward point to point evening flights both flights on a tired Fokker 100. VIE-AMS in Business (Upgrade due to Star Alliance status as Economy was overbooked) AMS- VIE in Economy VIE-AMS delayed 15 minutes due to ATC return flight on time – Not really much to distinguish Business Class service on the outward leg except for a simple and small but tasty evening snack (warm chicken skewer on salad). Also only one drink was served. Seats were rather uncomfortable economy Recaro slim seats with the middle seat left unsold. Service was very poor. Only two flight attendants for the whole full plane meant that after the initial service of meal and drink both FA's dealt with Economy and were not be seen in Business again for a very long time. On the return flight in Economy one drink (including beer and wine) and a no food just small pack of pretzels or a small chocolate bar was served. On both flights FA's were not exactly unpleasant but not attentive. Web check-in for VIE-AMS went smooth with almost no line for the premium bag drop. In AMS check-in for the return flight was handled by very friendly and helpful LH agents with no lines. Boarding in VIE was later than indicated with no information given resulting in a cattle call once the boarding actually started. Boarding in AMS was uneventful. Flagship OS Senator Lounge in VIE a bit of disappointment as well. Packed and with limited food offerings and just ok drink options. Obviously savings all over the place. In AMS OS uses the shared Servisair lounge which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a very limited to almost non-existent food selection. Overall definitely not a terrible but distinctly mediocre experience. (Star Alliance Gold).

Operated by Tyrolean Airways. LHR-BKK via VIE on 22 Dec 2014 in Economy. A ticket from LHR-BKK via VIE on Austrian. Our return leg - thankfully - was with Swiss from SIN-LHR via ZRH. Firstly they messed up our seat numbers that were reserved online/via phone. Even the nice lady at LHR check-in couldn't change the seating for the long-haul and we were advised to check with staff in VIE. Upon arrival in VIE after a forgettable experience (makes me wonder why they bother operating as a full-service airline when I am finding other LCCs to provide a better experience) there was madness at the gate as the flight was full of families and other fellow holidayers who were heading to Thailand. Spoke with ground staff who gave a curt reply about the flight being full and it is not possible to amend the seats - even if it was an error on their part. All passengers were then herded like animals via a self-service boarding gate while about 7 ground crew members stared blankly at passengers. When we stepped into the plane the atmosphere from the flight attendants were intense. Even the 'Good Evening' greeting seemed forced. I then approached one of the more senior female attendants about the wrongly allocated seats. She replied very rudely that they have no control over seats and I would have to ask other fellow passengers. I have never experienced such an insulting manner on board any airline ever. In any case we managed to swap seats with a very kind lady who was travelling alone. I felt so sorry that she had to take my ill-assigned seat which had almost no recline. The Seafood and Vegetarian Meals my travelling companion and I requested was also not prepared for us on board. They demanded proof that we had made the order in advance. But thankfully there was the Vegetarian Option served as part of the normal service. The seats were also uncomfortable and hard while the entertainment system was very limited. Could hardly find anything satisfying to watch. Upon leaving the aircraft I was given a cold hard stare from the same rude senior female flight attendant (I think she was the purser) at the exit with no apology smile or even a goodbye. Overall I am not only disappointed with my flight I am angry for the way we have been treated by Austrian. My advice is not to take this airline - particularly for long haul in economy - even if it is somewhat cheap!

Good C class service ORD-VIE. Wonderful dinner and breakfast service from Do&Co. The Ice Kaffee was divine. Freshly made smoothie breakfast. Easy connection in Vienna. VIE-TLV short hop but convenient. Good Brunch service.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
ATH-VIE. Temperature on the aircraft was quite high and very unpleasant. Inflight entertainment was completely absent. As for the on board snack you could select between a mandarin a single chocolate bar and some peanut- style small packs. Absolutely terrible.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Bangkok to Vienna and I was seated separated from my children. Thank goodness two lovely men moved so that I could sit with my kids. On returning home flew from Venice to Bangkok via Austria with my children and was told at Venice that I would be separated from my children on the leg Vienna to Bangkok - my children are all under the age of 9. When I went to the ticket desk at the airport in Vienna to ask if we could be seated together and initially told they couldn't do anything about it and that I should have checked in earlier. I went back to the desk to ask again if I could please be seated with my kids and then somehow magically managed to get seats me with the kids. I ordered kids meals and didn't get any and the seats in the plane were so tight you could hardly move. I will never fly Austrian Airlines again.

We just arrived in Delhi from Vienna. The first leg of our trip with Austrian Airlines was from Toronto to Vienna. There were four of us in business class and we all agreed that our experience with Austrian Airlines was exceptional. The seats flatten out to a very comfortable bed. The provision of a duvet and pillow added to our comfort. The food was excellent. We would easily have paid 40 euros for a similar meal in Vienna and that's not including the wine. The flight attendants were polite professional and friendly. The service was superb. The on-board chef was a nice touch. On both flights he came around to explain the menu and take our order before personally cooking it. All meals were freshly prepared. The hot beverages were delightful. I stayed with hot chocolate and freshly whipped cream. My travel companions tried the Bailey's coffee. I will definitely fly Austrian Airlines again. I travelling extensively for both business and pleasure and Austrian Airlines will now be one of my preferred carriers.

Dec 22 2014. JFK-VIE Boeing 777. Economy class is 10 seats across 3x4x3. Very tight seating and uncomfortable. I had an aisle seat and was constantly getting bumped by people in the aisle. Food was pretty good and the in flight entertainment was pretty complete with some up to date movies. The flight crew was pleasant and professional. Boarding was very disorganized with many people carrying oversize baggage. overhead space was overloaded. All in all it was a flight you endured not enjoyed.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-DEL. This was one of the best flights I have ever had. From start to finish the crew food IFE seat exceeded my expectations. The crew was efficient and engaged with a great sense of humour. The seat was well designed though I found the opening to the aisle to be a bit tight. The IFE was amazing with picture clarity that I have never had on an aircraft before. I was told that each seat's unit is self contained and can be replaced by simply popping it out. There is no master server so many of the glitches that are found elsewhere do not occur. The food was excellent and served with pazzazz. I was sorry to arrive and have the experience end. Delightful in every respect.

### "left a bad after-taste"
Had a poor experience with Austrian flying with our 2 year old. The plane was a Tyrolean Airways aircraft retrofitted with new cabin. Check-in out of Toronto was combined with Lufthansa. Once on-board we were stuck with a crew who: 1) Held us up at Toronto because the crew didn't know how to read our baby's FAA approved car seat label or didn't know who to ask, what to do, etc. Finally a senior member of the ground staff came around, and within seconds knew how to read an FAA label, and all was well. 2) Mid-way through our the flight, the baby started fussing. After years of flying American carriers, we didn't expect any help from the crew (like you get with the Sky Nanny service on Gulf Air or the friendly cabin crew on Emirates/Singapore Airlines). On Austrian, the cabin crew came around multiple times and politely asks us to shut our baby up as it "may" bother other passengers. No further comment needed. The food was ok, and the TV screens were hi-def, and the cabin crew were efficient, but the above incidents left a bad after-taste. We had subsequent connections with Lufthansa, and immediately saw the difference in crew training - Lufthansa crew are top notch and knew exactly what to do with little kids unlike the untrained Austrian crew. Flying with a baby for many hours is tiring in itself, I don't need the additional headache of untrained inconsiderate cabin crew - I would not recommend Austrian Airlines to families flying with kids.

OS196 23 DEC CGN-VIE Fokker 70 and OS093/24DEC VIE-IAD. Service was impeccable. Flights on time and staff enjoyable as well as efficient. Inflight service flawless and professional. Meals delicious and presented beautifully. Comfort on board of a very high standard. Restrooms cleaned and stocked with amenities regularly. Highly recommended.

The seats in Business Class are very good with 180 degree inclination. The service on board is good as well. In Bangkok and Vienna airports there did not seem to be any fast track for passengers in business class.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
FRA-VIE round trip. Things getting worse and worse - not long time ago this was an above average airline. Staff demotivated costs cutting all over. The only positive I find is that the flights are nearly always on time.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Had a terrible trip IAD-VIE on 777-200. The seat was a single window seat 9K - in seating position it was ok but in bed position your legs above knees are to be placed to "tunnel" between seats in front of you. Tunnel is so narrow you can't move inside it. Meal service was very slow: my friend in economy finished it and was sleeping when C-class was getting their entrees. It took them more than 3 hours (almost half the flight) to feed us. Then they gave us 1.5 break and woke us up for breakfast - it was a disaster. I had a group of 3 drunk adults seated next to me who were drinking schnapps all flight long laughing and chatting to each other in a loud voice not letting any other in the cabin to sleep. The crew completely didn't care. Avoid them: being Lufthansa's subsidiary Austrian charge the same for much worse service.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Travelled Business class between Delhi and Vienna on 6 Nov 2014. Not a single smiling face among the entire cabin crew. After a comfortable sleep - I didn't eat anything woke to ask for some coffee. No coffee came. What came was a curt response that we will soon serve coffee with breakfast. Very few airlines would respond like that to a business class passenger! The skimpy toilet set seemed to come out of economy a toothbrush socks and eye mask. The breakfast service was good though unsmilingly served.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
LHR-VIE-OTP. Fly this airline frequently in Business class and generally happy. Economy class however is a disgrace. Commoditised product whereby they attempt to up-sell at every opportunity (more luggage Business upg better meal) - this is just conceding defeat to low cost competitors like Ryanair. I had the dubious pleasure of sitting to next to a pax who had ordered the EUR15 meal which demonstrates the true value of the EUR149 upg offered. 2 hour 15 minute flight and one small plastic cake and one round of drinks staff disinterested. VIE to OTP was a 25 gramme bag of salted pretzels. Late arrival in Vienna at a Schengen gate so had to take a bus transfer to the terminal and no time to use the Senator lounge to get any decent food. Returned on LH subsidiary Germanwings with a vastly superior on-board product including sandwiches snacks and drinks. Recommendation is based on Business Class will avoid in Economy.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Budapest - Vienna to London Heathrow. First plane was a Fokker very old but ok for a 30 min hop. Crew just rude and could not be more unfriendly I said hello and was given a blank stare than she looked away in disgust. Water served on the flight. Remote parking in Vienna and a run to my gate through passport control where I just made my flight the last to board. Crew a bit better with just drinks served no food which is a let down not even a sandwich just a small pack of cookie. 2 Drink rounds with decent Austrian wines and beer. Plane nice and clean comfortable. But left a bit unhappy without a sandwich and rude staff. Only again if price is right.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew from Vienna to Tel Aviv round trip in business class on older Airbus. Not worth the fare for business class. Business class simply means the first few rows in the plane with same seating as economy but no one in the middle seat. Food was good and service was pleasant enough but seats reclined only slightly were not particularly comfortable and in any event identical to economy. I guess if you don't want anyone sitting next to you place a high priority on sitting in the front of the plane and are willing to pay a lot for this then enjoy.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Vienna to Dulles in Business class. Superb in every respect. Others have been critical of the seating. I found the seats to be the best in the air. Yes they were firm but in a comfortable and supportive way. My next flight was on United business class and the softer seats were not nearly as comfortable as on Austrian. Food and service were outstanding. The hi-tech seat controls and audiovisual options were similarly good. In many rows the seating was 1-2-1 so plenty of options for privacy when traveling alone. Cathay Pacific was my previous all time favorite but Austrian is even better.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
As this was a United issued ticket I could not preselect seat line nor check in. Could not change seat at airports so was place in the middle seat of 777. Very uncomfortable for a 9 hr flight from VIE to IAD. Pandemonium at the VIE gate. One agent trying to check passports for 300 passengers blocking the main corridor as they would not let checked passenger's into the boarding area. No signage to inform passengers of what the lines were for boarding time or zones. The seats in the 777 are very uncomfortable. In the middle seats your legs have to straddle the pillar of the seat in front and there is no room for any carry on bags. There is limited recline. 9 hours of torture difficult to sleep.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
I flew from Vienna to Athens and back on a business trip and was once again astonished and very disappointed with Austrian - The flight to Athens had a delay of over 2 hours and we just sat there in our seats in the plane which was getting overly uncomfortable. No drinks or food were offered during that time either. When asking the cabin crew for help they'd just ignore me in a very rude manner. After take-off they gave us a choice of an apple or solettis (mini pretzels) which was way below expectations and not even close to enough on a 2-hour flight although they offered a decent variety of drinks. The seats were very uncomfortable on both flights - Both were operated by an A320 aircraft and both flights were empty (only around 30 passengers on each flight). The flight back also got delayed although it was a shorter delay. Once again bad service rude and unpleasant flight crew and flying with Aegean would have cost me a lot less and I would have received far better service.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Vienna to Athens - despite announced pre-boarding for business there was a rush of passengers with oversized hand luggage. Plane was a clean A321. FA courteous however not friendly. Rather narrow seats. Business class meal consisted of 3 slices of tomato some potato salad and a small piece of fish and a small dessert. Rather avaricious drinks service. My luggage did arrive rather late despite labelled as priority.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
October 21 2014 21.55 flight OS 919 (operated by Tyrolean) Vienna to Salzburg. Did the pilot really think he could land in Salzburg despite severe weather warnings? About twenty minutes into the very uncomfortable flight the pilot told the passengers that there was a lightning strike in Salzburg that we could not land and he would let us know next steps. After thirty minutes into the forty-minute flight he announced that the problem in Salzburg was solved and that he was going to try to land even though he admitted that there were very high winds and heavy rain (and of course lightning). After the wheels went down and we headed to the airport he realized that trying to landing was futile. Minutes before we touched down he aborted the landing and flew back up into the storm. After letting us know that he could not land in Salzburg which was obvious he later told us that we were landing in Linz and that a bus would take us to Salzburg. While I realize the goal of the airline is to deliver passengers to their destination from my perspective the stress to the passengers on this flight could have avoided. We had no service because the attendant was securely fastened in her seat for almost all of this harrowing flight.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Staff not friendly and not dedicated on 4 flights. Cancelled flight without an explanation or apologizing (and when you travel for more than 24 hours with unfriendly crew you get irritated). Clearly there was small number of people on cancelled flight so they decided to spread us in other flights. Not enough food no towels or wet wipes for hands. Not enough water served. Not very comfortable seats - entertainment poor.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Austrian Airlines Berlin - Vienna - Thessaloniki return. Each flight was on time everything working rather like a machine than like in a hospitality business. Crews were almost all unfriendly and without dedication. No smile nothing to make you feel welcome. On all flights peanuts or a candy bar served. For a price of a serious airline I'd have imagined different. Why to pay more than on a no frills airline if service is the same?

### Austrian Airlines customer review
LHR/VIE/MLE and return September 2014. Outbound flights were fine and B767 although now extremely old are very well kitted out in Business class. Half full so excellent service. Return is where the problems start - at Male they can only check you in for the MLE-VIE sector - at VIE we found the flight overbooked for LHR with options for the next morning as they had let our seats go. Abysmal service when you have been flying for 9 hours and apparently this is not a concern of Austrian Airlines that there agents can't check you through from Male. We were not alone in having problems with OS connections on a Friday afternoon so be warned fly this route at your peril. After kicking off they eventually found our seats again but then due to technical problems delayed the flight by over an hour with what can only be described as limited explanation - the usual chaos at LHR (not OS's fault on this to be fair) added a further 40 minutes to the delay - a great holiday but not a nice surprise from Austrian at the end.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Just flew from Vienna to Bucharest and back as they had a better departure/arrival time than Tarom and I was more than unsatisfied - the cabin crew were arrogant the food on board was horrible all they offer you is an apple which for a £200 ticket is unacceptable! The flight departed and arrived late without excuses and apologies and the check-in and boarding was pretty chaotic in Bucharest as the flight back to Vienna was about 80% full. The flight from Vienna to Bucharest was flown by a Fokker aircraft with about 20 passengers on board. I was once again appalled by Austrian. On the VIE-OTP route I highly recommend flying Tarom since they have lower prices they are more punctual and Tarom services are top quality and quantity. I'm going to try to avoid flying Austrian from now on.

VIE-BRU A320 c class good check-in in CAT in Vienna City terminal caught an earlier flight than originally booked and the member of staff was just only too eager to help. A breeze to get to airport and an excellent senator lounge. Flight itself nothing to write home about but correct and smooth. Service done by very experienced stewardess. My bag was first out. Will recommend.

They fly for our smile I was so disappointed that most of the staff did not smile therefor we did not smile. My wife and I flew business class from Melbourne to Bangkok with Thai Air and Austrian Airlines to Vienna the main difference was staff on board Austrian Airlines they simply did not want to be there. The cook on OS 25 was rude and grumpy in hindsight I should have voiced my opinion at the time. On the return flight OS 26 it was a repeat the staff did their job but were not pleasant. We are regular flyers to Vienna with various airlines but now have a bad taste from the airline from my country of birth.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Travel twice a year from CDG to VIE. I booked my ticket online in the US. It was not possible to check in online 24 hours prior to the flight and print out a boarding pass. You have to do it at the airport wait until an Austrian airline rep can check you in and get you a boarding pass. This is extremely inconvenient and annoying. Instead of going to the lounge for the layover at 6.30 in the morning arriving from NY you have to wait to get a boarding pass. CDG-VIE business class has the same seats as coach the seat next to you is left empty. The whole point of a business class is have a roomier seat with more legroom. Austrian airline is missing the point. Service usually pleasant food OK. On the most recent trip in August they lost my luggage.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Yesterday OTP-VIE evening flight. Booked online seat 22F in an Airbus 320. Surprisingly plane changed to outdated Fokker 100 so the seat was now in the last row half a meter away from the engine. Because of this change complete chaos occurred Fokker has seats 2-3 Airbus 3-3 so a lot of passengers had seat numbers which didn't exist in the Fokker and 20 passengers was booked on the 22.30 flight. I am 171 cm but I had problems getting into the seat. I could not even read a magazine and opening the table tray ended in the middle of my chest with an angle of 45 degrees. After starting the engines it was so loud I couldn't understand a single word of the safety instructions neither the captains speech. Service is only a 5g-bag of pretzels or a sweet bar and some drinks even this small things are difficult to handle if you cannot open the tray-table. Would be interesting if you order a meal online before for 15 Euros how to eat that? The seat pocket in front of me was full of garbage napkins pretzel-bags. In the past we were proud of our national carrier slogan was "service is our success". Now they claim to be a 4-star airline in fact the are a high price airline with low service outdated planes. I cannot recommend Austrian.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
We flew BKK-VIE we had issues with the online check in. Despite selecting window seats when we paid for the tickets we were auto assigned new seats which were in the middle cabin. At the start of the flight I connected my headphones and the flight steward quite rudely pulled them out from the jack and said no headphones while taking off. I looked around and the majority of passengers had headphones connected but the same steward said nothing to those passengers nor did he do anything to the person sitting next to me who was in clear sight of the steward using headphones. We laughed it off and thought this couldn't get much worse. The food was terrible and they took around 2 hours to clear the trays from your seat. The staff were not very friendly and did not when I would ring the buzzer for some water. They rarely do drinks runs like on other flights. I would avoid this airline if possible.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew ORD - VIE and the experience was very mixed. Website initially let me choose a vegetarian meal and enter my frequent flyer number but after a certain time it was annulled. I wrote an e-mail to them and they told me the meal was booked and the frequent flyer number was added. I did get my vegetarian meal. I also asked them for an aisle seat because the website would not let me choose a seat. They told me that this cannot be done because I had a United ticket. Only at United they told me they cannot influence the seats because it is an Austrian flight - Catch 22. The plane was new the food ok the crew are nice but not offering top service. They told us that they ran out of wine at the dinner serving but then had it again. If you watched a movie and there was an announcement you had to take the earphones off in order to hear it because the announcement was only in the cabin loudspeakers but not in the entertainment system. On arrival in Vienna we had to take buses to the terminal which I found quite strange for such a large plane - I have never experienced this in an intercontinental flight to major destinations. All in all they are still far from perfection. I expected more.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
IAD-VIE Pristine 777 Business Cabin a great place to spend 8 hours - or longer. Crew were friendly professional and motivated and reference to passengers as "guests" was obviously more than just marketing speak. Austrian include a chef in the cabin crew adding the finishing touch to a superior Do&Co food service capped with a delicious "coffee menu. Evidence of attention to detail at every stage of the flight from imaginative amenity bags to spotless loos decorated with fresh flowers. Every bit as good as Qatar and co and in many respects (eg European service style) more to our liking. Onward short hauls VIE-SKP-VIE-FRA showed a standard consistent with the longhaul product. Five stars in the air slightly fewer in the lounges which need a touch of the same magic. Austrian will be our automatic choice from now onwards.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Service in business class was appalling the attendant "forgot" to lay my table the first and second courses I had to remind her each time. Both my husband and I were not offered water or beverage refills after landing they didn't even bother to acknowledge the passengers as we were leaving. We travel business class on many different airlines my husband is a million mile flyer and this was the worst experience. Our flight was OS93 on September 2 2014 from Vienna to Washington DC.

Had a flight from Sofia to Budapest through Vienna. When I arrived at Vienna airport the flight to Budapest was delayed and planned for some 30 mins late. Later they announced that the airplane is expected to depart from Zagreb and will arrive at 11.35 and further information will be provided soon. Heard no more information and went to gate at 11.30 they said that the flight had finished boarding. I was then charged for the next flight to Budapest. So beware of Vienna airport notifications.

BKK-VIE and back on Boeing 777. 1st leg automatic upgrade on exit row seat due to no-one sitting there. Even got given free amenity kit from business class! The promptness and fast flying speed - commendable. Both flights arrived before schedule! Service just gets the basics right. Lacking warmth from Asian airlines. The touch-screen IFE is the best ever. Currently only good for flying to Austria.

In early August I traveled with my wife and 15-year old son from Athens to Vienna and then (the next day) from Vienna to New York. In both flights (but especially in the Vienna - New York one) I need to point out the excellent service friendly attitude politeness and efficiency of the cabin crew. We were excellently treated in a clearly new aircraft with very comfortable and roomy seats large touch-screen personal TVs very neat toiletry bag and a very interesting well cooked and well served menu. As my wife needs help to move around and go to the toilet the response of the cabin crew to help her and make sure that she was comfortable was really exceptional. Although it was a very long "night" flight and the business class was sold out  the crew were always on their feet and did a perfect job in keeping everybody satisfied. We had an excellent 9-hour flight to New York and I would wholeheartedly recommend the business class of Austrian Airlines to friends and family.

Flew Larnaca (LCA) to London Heathrow (LHR) via Vienna (VIE) on 12/08/2014. Economy class. Friendly check-in and boarding gate ground handling staff at LCA. LCA to VIE on A321. Airbridge available. Nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. Clear announcements on aircraft. On time departure from LCA. VIE to LHR on A320. Airbridge available. Departure delayed about 20 mins due to earlier weather issues at LHR. Friendly boarding gate staff. Aircraft nice and clean. Cabin crew friendly. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. Clear announcements. On both sectors seating is typical Airbus economy poorly padded utilitarian seating. Adequate leg room for a 176cm height person. IFE on both sectors was typically advertising the highlights of a visit to Austria combined with cartoons for the kids and a great deal of promotion for Red Bull! The only disappointment was the catering: on the LCA-VIE sector just about edible small (and I mean small) meal + drinks. On the VIE-LHR sector only a tiny bag of pretzels + drinks. I was seriously hungry by the time I reached LHR. I'd happily fly Austrian again but I'd either order additional food or take my own.

This was a terrible flight. The plane looked nice but the staff couldn't care less. We flew from Dubai to Vienna and didn't get water during the night. Even when calling the hostess nobody came. They were very disorganised. It was a very unfriendly staff and they only took care for the business class passengers. Never again with Austrian Airlines.

OS 461 and 642 (Vienna - Yerevan). My experience with this airline was not the best. Boarding in VIE was quite okay but the service onboard was not so good. After take-off they served us a hot meal but it was a very very small portion. Some pasta and 10g sweats (something like pudding) drink of our choice. It was a 3 hrs and 20 min flight so we got something to drink again before landing. Flying back from Yerevan to Vienna the boarding was awful disorganized. Because of these boarding procedures I had never had before we left for Vienna more than 61 mins delayed. Soon after take-off we got breakfast a very small one. Some scrambled eggs (I think not more than one egg/person) rolls and drinks. This is a 3hrs and 40 mins flight from Asia to Europe so we got some drinks again before landing Vienna.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
My husband and I flew from Vienna to Toronto yesterday. It was a 9 hour flight. We chose to pay extra to sit in the emergency row seats. The configuration is 2 then 3 then 2 seats. We sat in the middle seats. We were initially very pleased with the leg room but the TV was in the seat in front so very far from us when seated. Once the flight began we realized the problem. Other passengers considered our row as a way to move from one side of the plane to the other. There was a constant flow of people including airline staff through our row passing and sometimes stopping and standing in front of our TV while we were trying to watch it. Two small obviously unsupervised children probably ran through our row at least 25 times. I'm sure that people were not trying to be rude but after 9 hours of this it was incredibly annoying. The last thing was when my husband got up to go to the bathroom a stewardess came to talk to someone beside us and sat on his chair arm. My husband returned and stood there for 5 minutes before she stood up and he could be seated.

I flew Vienna-Bangkok business class. That really made a difference. The seats were comfortable the food was good the video screens up-to-date. The hit for me was that I was able to lie stretched out - and I am 1.90 m. That really surprised me. The service was good. If I try to find something to criticize: maybe the entertainment system could include more movies. But in all highly recommended.

Four flights on 4 different aircraft's recently: LHR-VIE then VIE-SLZ that went well with a smooth flight with good attendants but only just walking time for the onward connecting flight with a smooth transfer of our baggage so no waiting around. The return BUD-VIE left late due to bad weather so missed our VIE-LHR evening connection as just half an hour between flights. Our overnight stay in the city Danube Hotel plus transfer by car with food vouchers was handled very efficiently but the desk staff as was the morning pick-up and return flight. Snacks and drinks adequate for our economy flight status. So would certainly use this service again.

Flew from Vienna to Astana on July 29. The plane was small it had no in-flight entertainment system. It took more than an hour after take-off before anyone got a drink. The food was terrible (no choice for anyone just penne with tomato sauce and a "dessert" that I can only imagine to have melted ice cream). The staff were unfriendly. Not to be repeated: I will try to avoid Austrian from now on.

Traveled from Vienna to Bangkok. New seats but uncomfortable. Good size TV screen. Food portion was too small and instead of breakfast just one dry sandwich was just a joke. Will never fly again with such a terrible airline. Another jaw dropping fact was when lady next to me asked me to get her drink because she was feeling ill. I went to the back of the plane to report it and was only given drink for her and smile and they didn't bother to go and check on her.

OS425 LHR-VIE and OS25 from Vienna to Bangkok in Business. Everything ran on time and was smooth. The short changeover in Vienna was not a problem all worked smoothly and my luggage got there too. Good flight attendants excellent screen and good range of films passed the time by well. The Sky Chef is very good and the food prepared nicely for you. This is a real plus for Austrian. Full flat bed which his comfortable perhaps a little short for my 6’3” height but no complaints. Quiet cabin allowed a good nights sleep. A much better product than the Swiss service I got on the way back.

Quick weekend getaway FRA-VIE-FRA. Booked into economy but was upgraded due to Star Alliance status. These were some of the best cabin attendants I have experienced. Both directions they were attentive and friendly. My drink was never empty. Good multi-course mid-day meal offering on the return. Seats were the business class slimlines - but fine for 1+ hour flight. Very pleasant experience and will definitely be flying with them again.

ORD-VIE-DEL and return. When we travelled last December the interior of the plane was renovated hence it looked like a brand new plane. They went out of their way to take care of my son. The food was as decent as can be expected from airline food. New entertainment system/ brand new seats (with good leg room) Great service. As a frequent traveler to Asia I have tried most airlines for the long haul flights and I have to say Austrian stood out mainly due to the brand new interior but also due to great service. Last but not least have to talk about VIE airport. Of all the airports to have a 5 hour layover this might be one of the best. Lots of big couches available for take a quick shut eye with free WIFI. The reason for me try this airline was due to their excellent price but this year unless prices unfairly high I am going to book Austrian again. Highly recommended for the long Asia flights.

OS312 from Stockholm Arlanda Airport (Sweden) to Vienna Airport (Austria) Monday June 9. The aircraft used on this service was a Fokker 100 and I had a seat in Economy class seat 3F. Austrian Airlines has recently refurbished the cabins of its Fokker 100. After this refurbishment it is one of the best and most comfortable cabins available on intra-European flights. The seat pitch is good and the seats are very comfortable and outstanding compared to the nowadays common slim seats from Recaro that most Star Alliance airlines have installed. There was no IFE available and the food service were close to non-existent. The very comfortable seating however overcome this shortage in service. I can highly recommend Austrian Airlines for intra-European flights when operated by Fokker 100.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-HAM in May. Got a "free upgrade" due to overbooking the evening flight. Did not know that it was business class seats are the same like in Y-Class. No welcome drink offered C-Class menu is a shame for a 4-star airline. Very narrow seats no real business class seats they just keep the middle seat free for C-Class passengers. Food was tasteless! Save money and stay in Eco. Business Class on OS European flights is not worth the money.

Frankfurt-Sarajevo via Vienna. Very pleasant flight. Basic onboard service (many drinks options and some snacks). Vienna airport with its free wifi possibility is really good for transit passengers.

Chicago ORD - Vienna. Flight on time with very nicely refurbished B767-300. Excellent Ipad-like TV monitor great quality but very limited choice of movies and TV shows literally 20 movies and 4 episodes of TV shows ( compare to 1000+ on EK or BA). Food was tasty good size portions but only chicken or veggie pasta as a option. Hot sandwich for breakfast. Crew was the only down point of this flight only just polite to answer your question not a smile or friendly chat. Generally good flight but crew should be nicer.

Fantastic trip with Austrian Airlines VIE-ORD. Their business class on the 767 is one of the few that is truly worth the money on an inter-continental trip. The food is the best of any airlines world-wide the chef onboard really makes a difference! Service is charming the new seats are nice and offer easy aisle access too. Only drawback are the limited movie options far fewer than in Economy Class on Singapore/Qantas. Now I just wonder why can't LH be as good as their subsidiary?

Flew Business Class from Vienna to Beijing and back. Absolutely excellent service. In particular the lie-flat seats as well as the food (from Do&Co) and wine selection. Hard to beat.

Vienna to Sofia. Flight on-time and was operated by a clean A319 aircraft. Crew was kind although pretty robotic. Catering was just a small pack of solettis - small for the 1.5 hour flight. My ticket cost 220 EUR. Really disappointing trip.

April 30 flight from Dubai to Wien. Boarded at 1am departure scheduled at 1.40am. After one hour we could not take off due to a technical problem. At 6am we were still sitting on the plane. Passengers were kept on the plane for 5 hours (no meal no drinks) and then we were deboarded to the airport. None of the crew came with the passengers we were told to go to the same gate we boarded from - C29. At the gate there was no staff member from Austrian only a couple of staff with a vest marked Lufthansa. The only answer we received about connection flights was that everything would have been organized in Wien. At 13.00 finally we could enter board the plane again. When we arrived in Wien we were sent to the customer service counter where there were only 2 staff members for more than 200 passengers! Provided a hotel in Wien and we took the flight in the morning arriving with a 24 hour delay.

JFK-Vienna-JFK 777 Economy - non-stop flight refurbished interior since last trip 1-1.5 years ago. Leg room adequate but very narrow seat - almost the worst I have experienced in over 250 transatlantic flights. Aisle seat armrest does not retract making it tough for anyone to exit the row. Service onboard extremely efficient and pleasant. Quality of Meals has deteriorated considerably on Austrian. Salad only iceberg lettuce chicken or pasta very small tray. the second meal was once a full breakfast with cold cuts/cheese platter fresh fruit etc served on a tray. Now only a hot wrapped sandwich in tin foil nothing more. Conversely second meal on return to NY which was once small meal and pastry last year served on a tray is now the same hot sandwich which was served for breakfast headed to Vienna in tin foil - nothing more no tray. Reserved aisle seats honored. Austrian is beginning to sink to Delta levels though the screen on back of seat quite adequate and wide selection of films classical music etc.

My last business trip was from Munich (Germany) to Iasi (Romania) via Vienna on 1st May 2014 and Austrian Airlines probably due profitably reasons decided to cancel the flight OS 645 from Vienna to Iasi. Thus I was routed on another fight Vienna - Bucharest operated by themselves and not fully loaded. One day later I flew from Bucharest to Iasi. I don't recommend Austrian Airline and I will try as much as possible to avoid this airline.

Vienna to Dubai on 26th April 2014. I have to say the service and the crew were above expectations. It was a very pleasant surprise after my experiences flying different airlines. Their care for passengers was obvious very attentive and smiling crew throughout. The seats 2-3-2 combination with good amount of leg space overall it was a nice experience. I would definitely choose them for my next flight.

April 2014 Tel Aviv - Vienna - Paris CDG and back. All flights operated with A321. The plane from Vienna to Paris was nearly 4 hours late (we were given a chocolate bar and mineral water at VIE). On the whole good service. On TLV-VIE and VIE-TLV routes meals are served. On European routes just a snack and drinks. On the VIE-TLV flight it was so warm and suffocating.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flight FRA-VIE the online check-in and the iPhone app was quite difficult to use. The flight was overbooked and due to that 20 minutes delayed. The Inflight Entertainment was just Austrian Airlines advertisement. Only the food was good because I ordered an Do&Co Menu. So I was a little bit surprised how poor Austrian Airlines could be because every time I flew Austrian before it was much better. So if this is Austrian's "standard" I can't recommend that.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Used Austrian because Lufthansa went on strike and I have to say I loved Austrian. B777-200 JFK-VIE in seat 9K. Single seat and very comfortable. Food was outstanding as were the crew. The chef onboard is a great touch and the flight went quite fast. Then A320 VIE-LHR and again more of the great food and service with a smile. I will recommend Austrian as the service was better than Lufthansa. The only drawback was the entertainment - poor outdated games and not much else.

BKK-VIE. B777-200 with 10 seats across in a 3-4-3 configuration seat width was seriously reduced. This is the most uncomfortable flight in my life. The seats are very bad.

Milan-Vienna-Milan. A319s clean and well-presented. Fair cabin crew poor selection of food (just a snack served) great selection of beverages and spirits. I still think the new Recaro seats are comfortable somebody else would argue on that. On the way back to Milan the flight was overbooked. Was supposed to spend a night more in Vienna but they finally managed a seat for me. Austrian is a good airline to fly with. Was by the way impressed with the new Terminal 3 at Vienna Airport: amazing one and the free-wifi is much appreciated.

TXL-VIE-ATH on A320 if you expect to eat better brink your own sandwich. The ordered meal is expensive from €15. Also on the long flights you have to pay €5 for amenities kit. Why bother to fly with them. The cabin was clean and both flights were on time.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-DME-VIE both flights on A320. Cabin spotless and seats very comfortable with good leg space. FA's friendly and helpful. We got a full meal on both flight (pasta and a dessert) and drink service including coffee. Flights left and arrived on time. The experience with Austrian was very positive and nice. The flight times to Moscow are good only complaint is Domodedovo Airport (very crowded) but that's not Austrian's fault.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Vienna-Washington-Vienna. Seat allocation for all transatlantic and onward US flights was possible several weeks in advance. Check-in at Vienna airport could be faster. The new all-flat seats are very comfortable. Excellent food nice wine and drinks selection. Very attentive service even though the flight was operated by not so experienced Tyrolean Airways crew. Online entertainment system is very much ok although the selection of movies and games could be wider. Flights were on time or ahead of time new plane meticulously clean. Good selection of food and drinks in the lounges at Vienna and Washington Dulles.

14 Feb 2014 flight from Vienna to Sofia was not only delayed for nearly 3 hours but the aircraft was not in the best condition to fly. 28 Feb 2014 flight Pristina - Vienna despite of timely departure at 15.00 hrs instead of landing 16.45 hrs as planned landed 16.58 hrs. I had a connecting flight to London at 17.15 and was expecting that ground service would take care of passengers. Instead everyone to whom I addressed my request for assistance to speed up the transfer as I did not have checked in luggage were being extremely unhelpful. Unfortunately Austrian airlines and Vienna airport have kind of monopoly over the connections and destination in this part of Europe so one has to live with their way of talking to customers.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
IST-VIE-ZRH in Business Class. Ticket was issued by Swiss. Couldn't online check in the day before. So at Check In at Istanbul Airport I learnt there was a problem with my ticket. Therefore after cancelling my ticket and issuing a new one at the check in counter which took almost 2 hours they just downgraded me to Economy Class by mistake. Not enough time to re-issue the ticket as boarding had already started and I had to rush to the gate. They promised me they would have it fixed. Arriving at the gate the agent didn't know anything about it and could not fix it. They told me they would fix it in Vienna for my connecting flight into Zurich. So I had to fly Economy Class but had paid the business class fare. Arriving in Vienna I learned that business class for my connection flight was booked out so I had to continue in Economy. Shows clearly Austrian is seriously not caring about business class customers. Never again with this unorganized airline!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
OS456/25 LHR-VIE-BKK and OS 26/451 BKK-VIE-LHR. New Business class seats allow a decent sleep IFE selection is not great. BKK-VIE the headsets were collected in after the arrival video was shown about an hour prior to landing then the video restarted so I missed the end of the film I was watching. Second meal service (breakfast) has small portion sizes flew this airline and class recently on the NRT route and vastly better service and more professional crew. Short connection times at VIE make this a fast route. Worst experience is the seating on OS25. Premium Miles & More customers are usually reserved seats in rows 1 and 3. This works fine except when the airline uses row 2 for families with small children or upgrades. Sleep was made difficult on OS25 by shouting at their children to control them and shouting at each other audible across 2 aisles. No re-seating available as this flight always seems to be full or over-sold. Washrooms could do with a refit on all Austrian aircraft.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-AMS one way bought just few days before departure so quite expensive. Long bus ride from terminal 3 to somewhere in the middle of Vienna airport to board an old Fokker 100. I don't mind flying unusual types of aircraft's but given the engine configuration of Fokker (rear mounted engine) and the fact that I was seated in the 3rd from the back means it was extremely noisy thorough the entire flight. What bothered me the most was that the seats do not have any moveable headrests. Seat pitch poor but unfortunately that is typical to all intra-Europe economy today. Inedible snack and one round of drinks offered during the flight.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew LHR-VIE-BKK return on a full fare business class ticket that cost over 3000 euro. Was astonished to discover that Austrian do not provide fast track immigration pass at BKK where queues at the general passport control can often be very long. They provide on the flight back to VIE but not on arrival at BKK. Spoke to the purser who actually denied knowledge of a fast track system? There is inconsistency within the LH group in this regard. I have generally received a pass when arriving into BKK on Swiss but not recently on LH. Shoddy service to premium passengers and I suspect yet another example of cost cutting. The flights themselves were ok and more or less on schedule. I found the dinner service on the long haul sectors to be disorganised and too time consuming at a time when most passengers need to avail of the flat but claustrophobic flat beds.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
LHR-VIE-DXB. Flight from London left 55 minutes late so very little time to connect. Was hot and a bit tired when boarding the Vienna to Dubai flight for a Business Class sector. Asked on entrance if I could have some water. Not one of the four members of staff offered to help and one crew member said you'll have to go to the front galley to get one. In Business Class I was stunned. Asked at my seat and was told there are bottles at every seat. None at any seat because they had forgotten to put them out. They served a drink snack packet but they did not have a drinks service. Then came the food with a drinks service. Very strange for Business Class. The crew were miserable false cold smiles and they were clearly Tyrolean Charter Crew and not used to dealing with scheduled passengers on a route like Vienna to Dubai in Business Class. The Business Class seat was lie flat but the whole surround was very plastic and cheap. The table needed Einstein's brain to open and close it back into the seat. Finally our baggage did not arrive at Dubai so clearly the 09.05 ex London flight connection will always miss baggage transfer to the Dubai service. We arrived 24th December and our baggage arrived Christmas Day at 16.00 hours. In Business Class on the return flight the breakfast served was quite disgraceful and I couldn't eat any of it except for the fresh fruit. The worst meal I have had in Business Class on any flight in 46 years of travelling. Do not travel with this airline.

VIE-HAM-VIE. Outbound flight on Dec 31st return on Jan 2nd. Flight to Hamburg was delayed due to technical reasons for more than two hours. No information about the delay were given at the check-in. Passengers were informed about the delay 10 minutes before the scheduled departure. They refused to book us on an earlier flight and very unprofessional staff at the lounge. C-Class lounge was clean and calm but in the morning a very limited choice of food and beverages. We were bussed to the plane very old F 100 outgoing to Hamburg. Breakfast in C- Class was ridiculous panini was served with a cold! egg omelette. Cabin attendants did their job but no smile at all. Our luggage in Hamburg was the last on the belt even it was marked with the priority label. Evening flight back to Vienna left 10 minutes late; they served a very tasteless pasta with salad. Arrived in Vienna ontime but again no priority handling for the luggage. I cannot share the good reviews of other travellers of OS C-class in Europe. I will not choose them again for European flights in Business. Disappointing!

I came off my early morning (arriving) flight from Dubai at Heathrow and had to check out and in again as I purchased two separate tickets. I had anticipated a nightmare doing this but it was so simple despite terminal change etc. and the online check in queue had no one even though both Lufthansa and Austrian share the check-in zone. Friendly check in staff. Flight OS452 (anniversary livery A320) was much quieter than I expected and there was one of many spare seats next to me. Reading material was brilliant. The snack was nice as were the drinks which included a range of Austrian drinks such as Almdudler and Julius Meinl coffee. The crew were very friendly and the welcome on board was warm. I always enjoy my trips with Austrian and even though soon I'll be leaving my home in Vienna I hope to use Austrian as my airline for connecting flights in the future.

LHR-VIE-BKK in Business. Short haul flights were comfortable and smooth light meal served and seating is the typical 3 in a row with the middle one kept clear. The long haul VIE-BKK flight was on the new lie flat business seats. They were comfortable and the screen for entertainment very good clear sharp but a limited selection of films. The Sky Chef is a really nice touch and food was good - a really tender steak. Crew are generally reserved - but as a Star Alliance gold member I was personally greeted which is a nice touch. My reservations are basically two. The first is seating reservations. On both legs I pre booked a single seat but got put in both cases onto a pair - with the second seat empty. I thought Gold would have given me priority but it seems the Senator Gold was higher- fair enough but worth noting in future. The second was the space in the seats. On the return leg I had 8A (777-200 config) which was fine but outboard I had 10K - right up against economy and with a tight space to 10H - a real squeeze to get in and out. Avoid this seat if possible.

Booked a ticket through United Airlines Austrian Airlines operated the flight from Vienna Austria to Washington DC. Had a 30 hour delay due to weather in Washington DC had to be rebooked for the next day. Arrived at the airport with the new ticket United had sent me but Austrian Airlines still had the old version in their system. They refused to call United and ask for verification even though I showed them the email I got from United. I was told that if I "book through United and pay them and not Austrian Airlines" that I "can't expect any help or assistance from Austrian Airlines". In the end the result was that I missed my connection in Washington DC which resulted in an even greater delay. I will avoid any flights operated by Austrian Airlines from now on since they don't help in case something doesn't go as planned.

I took a long haul flight from Vienna to Bangkok vice versa (02/12 - 13/12/2013) and I have no complaints everything was pretty good. The seats are a bit narrow but a good fit for me the service was good food tasty entertainment ok and flight smooth so for me everything was OK.

Two adults and 3 younger children flew JFK-VIE-BKK in economy class in December 2013. Ground staff at JFK were inconsistent from a very helpful check in agent to completely unhelpful and nitpicky gate agents. At first it was trying to deny me the 2-bags per person that was clearly stated in my ticket then some back and forth about whether or not my carry on was allowed. Fortunately ground staff in VIE were more helpful particularly during boarding with small children. Onboard the newly refurbished 777 legroom was reasonable however by fitting 10 seats across in a 3-4-3 configuration seat width was seriously reduced. This must have been one of the least comfortable seats I've been on even compared to short haul United domestic flights. Cabin crew were again inconsistent. JFK-VIE had regular water service but VIE-BKK didn't for example. VIE-BKK also missed one special meal that I ordered and was consistently ignoring the call button from passengers around me. Meal service was reasonable and they do have some of the freshest breads inflight I've ever tasted. Overall not the most pleasant of flights I will be avoiding Austrian if at all possible in the future.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Delhi-VIE-Lyon. 2 adults and 2 babies. On the ground in Delhi very good and helpful. In the air the crew were cold but professional. Hardly smiled even at the babies. The breakfast before arrival in Vienna pretty mediocre. The flight from Vienna to Lyon was much more friendly. The crew smiled at us and gave toys to the babies (odd that no toys were offered on the much longer DEL VIE flight). Do & Co à la carte breakfast very good on this segment. Cost 15€€but like a business class meal. All in all Austrian were OK but lacking in service on the Delhi to Vienna flight.

Service very attentive staff extremely friendly and meals delicious (VIE-WAW-VIE - snacks only but full bar service).

I travelled from Vienna to Copenhagen on December 3 Business Class seat 3F. This afternoon service was operated by a Fokker 100. Although this specific aircraft type has been in service for quite some years it had a totally new interior. The interior looked smart and attractive and the seat was very comfortable. I would say the best seat I have ever experienced on an Intra-European flight. The service was excellent and so was the food and drinks served. In total a very pleasant experience. I would highly recommend travelling with Austrian Airlines on Intra- European flights in Business Class.

I travelled with OS318 from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Vienna Airport on December 3. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A319 and I travelled in Economy on seat 12A. This was an early morning departure at 06.40 thus I planned to take the opportunity for a two-hour nap during the flight. Since the aircraft were equipped with the new Slim Recaro seats this was not possible. These seats gives no comfort and you must bring your own cushion since the headrest has simply been forgotten. These terrible Recaro Seats may be cheap but they do for sure not bring any passenger satisfaction. During the flight the breakfast consisted of cinnamon buns. For early morning flights from Scandinavia it is better to omit this service or serve something that reflects the market from where the flight originates from. I am surprised that Austrian still have not realised this and adopted to what the Scandinavian customers expects.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Berlin Tegel-Vienna-Salzburg-Vienna-Munich in business class. Seating is very tight and the new Recaro slim seats are hard and uncomfortable even on short sectors. Fokker 100 seats more comfortable. Standard euro-business configuration as their partners Lufthansa and Swiss regular economy class seating with a blocked seat for more space but my legs suffered. Baggage even with priority tags for business missed a tight connection but were delivered at the final destination a few hours later. Crew is one of the most gracious and attentive in the skies presenting a superior service and food which is plenty and very-well done. Nice wines and small touches this is my favorite business product on intra-Europe flights. Would like to see an improvement on seating comfort.

DEL-VIE-WAW in C-Class. Flat-bed Seats are the same like on LX but somehow more comfortable and more convenient as they offer more storage space. Catering as usual on OS outstanding and easily comparable with other carrier's F-Class offer. The crews on both flights were fantastic and they do really know how to provide excellent and personalised service. You will get your blanket and pillow covered with linen duvet covers (in C-Class). Connection in VIE is most convenient of all airports in Europe which I know. Good value for money considering that OS is a European company which does not work in a tax and social security free environment with huge governmental support like the Gulf carriers. Austrian offers one of the best long haul products in C-Class in the world. Short haul flights are equally good. Strongly recommended!

TXL-VIE-BKK-SYD return. The first leg flight between TXL-VIE with Austrian and BKK-SYD with code share Thai were pleasant journeys. Compared to Thai cabin crews the Austrian cabin crews were unfriendly and unhelpful. Unfortunately the flight VIE-BKK with Austrian OS25 was a disappointing flight. We had a 4 hour delay in Vienna without any clear information from the crews even though we were already on-board. Most of the crews were not caring to worried passengers especially those who have further destinations after arriving in Bangkok. The crews on the flight to Bangkok were rude. The meals were not so special. Return flight from Sydney to Berlin with the same leg SYD-BKK with Thai was good and BKK-VIE-TXL with Austrian was better compared to my first experience.

Flight VIE-TSE-VIE. Extremely disappointing due to cynical use of economy seating "middle seat kept free for your convenience". No inflight entertainment despite the flight being over 5 hours in length. Quite outrageous for the EUR 3000+ charged. Despite helpful and apologetic staff I would not recommend.

Our experience has been a nightmare with this airline today. After flying from Vienna to Chicago we were re- routed to Detroit due to bad weather. Waited on plane additional 2 hrs finally told flight cancelled and we would be disembarking and new flight arrangements would be made after checking in at Austrian Airlines. Instead no Austrian Airlines personnel could 'ticket' us no option to assist in flights home from Detroit no assistance at all. We were dumped in Detroit and loaded on to buses driving 6 hrs back to Chicago airport. When we arrived there was no Austrian Airlines personnel to assist us. Fortunately the wonderful accommodating United Airlines staff were helpful in obtaining flights home. Their employees stayed into the early morning hrs to help us. We will never recommend this airline.

Flight Larnaca-Vienna was a horrible business experience. Seating was as small as Economy. No way you could enjoy the service no drinks offered at departure basic service while flying food acceptable. Absolutely no way you could work on this flight!

Flight on the newly refurbished Boeing 777 from VIE to Chicago ORD beautiful interior comfortable seats even in economy class great entertainment system free alcohol ordered the special Do&Co menu (option for long haul flights from Vienna against a surcharge of 15 EUR - the chicken Wiener Schnitzel and the chocolate mousse to die for were totally worth it).

AMS-VIE-AMS. Inbound flight on an A319 was OK mostly due to only being filled 50%. Thin seats provided some space and comfort. Outbound on F100 was terrible. Old seats (new Leather covers do not make seats new) FA's were grumpy and with a full plane the seats were very tight even on the emergency exit. Hardly any information on gate so it was surprise to find that we had to board a bus that brought us to the plane. Drinks were ok snack was small.

Bangkok to Vienna on Boeing 777-200. The new economy layout is horrible. The seating is 3-4-3 makes the seat very narrow and gives a cramped feeling. Also on a window seat there is no additional space between seat and fuselage. The food was very salty and very spicy. Cutlery was made out of plastic. Drinks are offered twice at lunch and breakfast time. At night time there was only one personal coming through the cabin offering water or orange juice. All at all I had a feeling that a cheap carrier is doing better than Austrian. Next time no Austrian for me anymore.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Sofia to Vienna on an old Fokker 100. The plane itself looks pretty outworn (paint is missing in some areas landing gear was oily). Inside the old seats in new leather design - looks okay. It seems that Austrian is one of the few airlines which is using the airfield for boarding (even Air Berlin uses the fingers). During flight an apple was offered followed by a glass of mineral water. Attendants were friendly. You easily can see that Austrian is saving money where possible. An unpleasant experience.

I bought a ticket for a flight operated by Austrian Airlines from Dusseldorf to Sydney. It was a co-operation between Austrian and Thai Airways: from Dusseldorf to Wien with Tyrolean (Austrian) Airlines from Wien to Bangkok again with Tyrolean and from Bangkok to Sydney with Thai. I could not check in online on the flight as the Austrian Airline web check-in system gave an error for the flight operated by Thai so I got stuck with whatever seats they could offer me at the counter. For the Wien to Bangkok flight (10 hour flight) I got seat 70J which had a wall behind it. While the person sitting in front of me could lean the seat backward I could not so I was left with little room. Furthermore the seat was more narrow than on European local flights like the Dusseldorf to Wien flight! I have to mention I am not big - I am a medium sized athletic person 80KG weight 175 cm tall. The Thai flight was a huge positive difference regarding the seat size. For the way back the same story: No online check in was possible. I contacted Austrian to complain but customer support was useless and the story repeated itself: The flight operated by Thai was ok with enough room while the flight from Bangkok to Wien was horrible! In the future I will avoid Austrian and check seat size online before booking longer flights!

GVA-VIE-ORD Fokker 100 then Boeing 767-300. 30 minute delay on the first leg due to fog in Vienna but all well- communicated and the pilot confirmed before landing that all connections of those on the flight could still be made. I like the Fokker 100 - smooth and quiet (maybe noisier at the back). Unfortunately the breakfast pastry was quite unpleasant and the tea was only served with "coffee creamer" and not milk. Very nice 767 to Dulles - spacious modern and recently refurbished interior large overhead bins excellent IFE selection (and not too much glare on the screens). Food was of decent quality plentiful drinks but a meal and a snack (panini) was not really enough food for a 9-hour flight that spanned lunch and dinner Austrian-time. Friendly staff timely arrival. My return leg was with a US carrier using the same model of aircraft. Austrian just blew them away in terms of quality.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
INN-VIE-ZAG in economy. Ground operations in Vienna were chaotic. The passengers were asked to board the bus after 30 minutes it became clear that there was a technical problem with the aircraft so that everyone had to go back to the gate. Ground staff extremely unhelpful at all times. Due to many contradictory information no lounge visit was possible. Operational upgrade was declined to Star Alliance Gold passengers. Flight manager extremely rude and unhelpful. She stated that there was nobody at the airport who could authorize such upgrade. In contrast they use business class space to "upgrade" luggage from other passengers. It seemed that FA are unhappy with the current situation in the company and showed lack of motivation. It is obvious that OS downgraded most of their services however their tickets in Central and Eastern Europe are still very expensive.

FRA-VIE-YYZ-VIE-FRA in Economy. Short flights FRA-VIE-FRA uneventful. Longhaul flights from Vienna to Toronto (and back) on 767 very good. All flights on time.

Food quality was great quantity just ok. Would definitely fly with OS again!

Actually the ratio quality/price is very low on Austrian flight you pay big money for nothing for no food (a cold muffin or something like that is no food for me) no service and old aircraft with no entertainment. If you have option to fly with someone other than Austrian take it. Because as I'm flying Geneva-Vienna there is unfortunately no other option if it was the case I wouldn't fly with Austrian.

Split-Brussels via Vienna. All flights on time or ahead of schedule. Planes were very clean. Cabin crew not all friendly. Web check-in not possible out of Split maybe because the ticket was issued on Lufthansa. Fortunately for us the given seats directly at check-in where ok. Catering with Austrian on European routes has reduced apparently. Only an apple or biscuit available on an evening flight from Vienna to Brussels is a bit poor! They used to serve a decent hot meal some years ago. A sandwich like you have on Swiss would be more appreciated! Austrian also needs to invest in newer planes. Not sure if I am going to fly them again soon.

Staff were less than friendly or helpful. Monitor in back of seat wasn't working. So no entertainment until they exchanged a monitor from a spare seat after 3 hours. My worst flight.

Dubai to Vienna / Boeing 767 in new business class. Seats are comfortable with enough privacy. Maybe for some travellers a bit narrow as the armrests and consoles are quite high. Cabin staff was ok - could have been friendlier. Food was a midnight snack (had chicken tikka) which was ok. Breakfast was eggs with toast yoghurt and fruit. Was very good and freshly cooked by the chef on board. Cabin was clean. Toilets without amenities (no hand lotion or eau de toilette). Lounge service in Dubai ok with good choice of food (hot and cold). Overall good experience but crew could have done more to make it memorable.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Extremely disappointing. Houston to Dubrovnik Croatia. What appeared to be a 3 stop return all on Austrian Airlines was actually across 3 airlines (Croatian Tyrolean and United) so when we tried to check in we were unable to do so online. We had a 1 hour layover in Vienna and the only reason we made our flight is because Austrian was so disorganized they were delayed in boarding the flight from Vienna to Chicago. Our boarding passes we received in Croatia didn't work in Vienna. When I tried to board the attendant dismissed the boarding pass and said it was no good. I had to check in again. My friend had the same issue so we went to the gate and they reprinted the exact same pass. In addition it is very irresponsible for the airline to book a one hour layover when it would easily take 2 hours at least to get from one gate to the other especially with Vienna requiring customs to get in and out of the airport and you have to go through security again. I give credit to the personnel who kept reprinting our tickets at each stop. But we will definitely avoid booking with Austrian again until they get a little more organized for scheduling flights and online check-in.

I have actually been on many flights with "Austrian" all over the world: VIE-JFK VIE-PEK VIE-BKK and have never really experienced anything bad. Good onboard programme and food on long range flights. Seats are comfortable (even to sleep). The crew are always nice and friendly and try to help.

OS332/OS6 23-24 Sep OSL-VIE-WAW. Inflight service was impeccable. Food/drink very nicely presented and prepared. I was surprised by the seat comfort and overhead bin capacity on the Fokker 100 and Fokker 70 aircraft. Flights operated on time. Very satisfying experience.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
SKG-VIE and VIE-MUC 2 different flights and stories on Miles and More Award. SKG-VIE check in a little bit chaotic and check in staff (not from Austrian) quite rude. Could use the Aegean Lounge which is nice and food/drink choice is ok. However Priority Boarding only for Aegean Passenger direct from the Lounge is possible therefore chaotic boarding procedure (with buses) at the gate and no priority boarding. Flight itself was ok however Service in C-Cl (completely full) rushed. Seating in A320 (new seats according LH-Standard) not so comfortable. Meals on both flights very tasty and still the best in Europe! VIE-MUC: priority boarding and pre- drinks served by the friendly Purser C-Cl was quite empty therefore good service despite the short flight time (35 min). Seating in Fokker 100 much better than in A320! Priority bags arrived in Munich among the last bags although we could see that our bags were loaded in Vienna directly at the door.

Our family flew from Vienna to Bangkok on 21 Sep 2013. The seating we had was appalling the seats did not recline at all and as this is a 9.5 hr flight it was a nightmare. You expect cramped conditions on a long haul economy class flight but this was ridiculous. Staff were rude and unhelpful. I will never fly them again and would not recommend.

BKK-VIE with a 777-200 on September 25 2013. This was one of my best business class experiences so far perfect service great seats great food. In sum comparable to Singapore Airlines and other high rated airlines if not better.

AMS-VIE. I normally use KLM for this flight but I decided to try Austrian. I have to say I was impressed by the professional staff and the seat comfort on board the Airbus A319. Good food and drinks. Flight left on time and arrived 20 minutes early. I found the experience better than KLM. Would choose Austrian again.

We travelled from Athens to Vienna 10/9/2013. While the flight felt safe enough the cabin crew looked tired and disinterested. Packet of dry crackers and drinks (wine or juice and they came around twice which was good). No TV or entertainment of any kind. Perhaps they are better on long haul flights but this short European flight was nothing special. The Lufthansa connecting flight we took two hours later was a huge improvement.

Vienna to Stockholm OS317 Saturday August 31 in Economy Class. Flight was fully booked except one seat. I was lucky enough to be placed in this row. I am a SAS Eurobonus Gold member (Star Alliance) but whether my seating had anything to do with this I don't know. The flight was operated by Tyrolean Airways on behalf of Austrian Airlines with an Airbus A319. I was seated on the last row seat 24A. The leg room was decent and the new Recaro seats are ok but not more. The seats has no head-pillow so you must bring your own to sit comfortable and if you would like to take a nap. There was no food served on this 2 hours flight only a chocolate biscuit (the type that you buy on the gas station for 0.85 Euros or so). The variety of drinks was however ok and drinks were served two times during the flight. The cabin was neat and tidy and the cabin crew were observant and friendly. Probably better than the average European full-fare airline but nothing extraordinary.

IAD-VIE. The flight actually went by very fast with two meal services and comfortable seats enabling me to sleep. I was also surprised by the quality of the food. I will definitely fly with them again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Beijing to Vienna. To summarize the flight I would describe it as First class for the price of business class. There are just 4 seats in a row. The seats are comfortable with a shelf beside for a place to put your bits. When you sit at the window you have no neighbour at all - very nice. The seat can be moved to 180 degree so to a horizontal position. The TV screen is a large TFT screen with a bright picture. Food was good too! Only problem for me is that they fly only 4 times/week. So normally I fly to Vienna on Friday (there is no flight on that day) and return on Tuesday morning (flight is too late for me that day). In all: strongly recommended.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
My husband and I flew to Vienna Austria from Dulles International and return. Despite having paid for our tickets and making our seat selections 8 months in advance we discovered upon arriving at the airport that we had been bounced from our seats and put in the worst seats on the plane many rows apart. We had the dreaded middle seat of the middle row of the plane. I have back and neck issues and require wheelchair assistance which was clearly visible to ground staff. They were entirely indifferent and made no effort to assist us. My husband went to the airline office in Vienna prior to our return flight and was told there would be no problem this time. We checked in discovered we had been bounced again to the same miserable seats. After being brushed off yet again we insisted on seeing a supervisor. After 20 minutes she "suddenly" came up with seats consistent with what we had reserved. On both flights the sears were horrible: worn out padding and absolutely no leg room in any position. In contrast to the unfailingly polite and helpful Viennese the staff of this airline is the worst we have ever encountered. We are returning to Vienna and will never travel Austrian Airlines again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
I was on a return flight from Vienna to Washington DC. On the flight there was a family who were not parenting their two toddlers at all. The 2 year old little girl even wandered into one of the rest rooms and pinched her fingers in the door and the parents had the nerve to yell at passengers nearby. When I had been stepped on enough by the two wandering toddlers I complained to a stewardess and she just shrugged and told me it would be better if I dealt with it myself! I will never fly this airline again!

VIE-BKK-VIE in Business Class. New seats are a significant step up from the previous product. Had 3A on the way out and 7K back and the seats had excellent room lots of space for storage and comfortable for sleeping fully flat and relaxing. Topped off by the excellent food and beverage service with a trolley bringing out soup and 2 other starters 3 hot options and 2 desserts plus ice cream. A standard of food service you don't see on business class elsewhere. Only bettered by the coffee service with about 10 different coffee combinations on offer. The in flight entertainment screens are large and responsive with the only disappointment being the extremely small selection. I didn't mind as both flights left just before midnight so after dinner it was time for sleep. Service from the crew was excellent. Austria's only weak point in the past was the angled lie-flat seats now it has seats that are up there with the best. I'd easily choose Austrian over any other carrier in long haul business class.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Very sceptical flying to Vienna and onto Rome after reading reviews. I was lucky to be traveling business class in their new 777-200 flat bed seats. Staff were very friendly and when the chief came out to hand out menus I was very impressed. The food was delicious and the service was warm and friendly. We took off on time and the new business class cabin was great. Nice flat bed seat with soft pillow and quilted blanket. The entertainment center was great and had many new movies to choose from better choices than most United flights I am on. The snacks offered throughout the flight were plentiful and breakfast was also very good. I would definitely fly Austrian Air again.

Flew Copenhagen-Vienna-Tel Aviv and return late March and early April. Nothing extraordinary on flight down but Tel Aviv-Vienna chaotic caused by delayed flight. Austrian staff at Tel Aviv unhelpful claiming that there would be no delay and the plane had arrived despite no Austrian plane at the airport. Chaos in Vienna as 3 busses have to be loaded with all passengers before leaving for transfer at that time far too late despite being explained that there would be no problems reaching connection flight. The minute before my group arrived at the gate it was closed. Service great from Austrian staff quick arrangement of good hotel at the airport and connection flight the day after. On board meals and service quite good but entertainment a laugh: no headsets and the same outdated Tom and Jerry and Mr. Bean cartoons that have survived for the last years on almost any European connection. Other companies offers full movies and music selections here.

CAI-VIE and VIE-CAI. The food was poor but at least there was a meal unlike LOT! Staff - some very bad and when I asked for a different juice she became angry. Return was much better. As for the baggage allowance - reduced it to only 1 piece of just 23 kg! Inflight entertainment awful no TV for a 4 hour flight.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
ATH-VIE-ATH in Economy class. Poor service for high money. Flight Athens-Vienna was delayed for 1 hour nobody from airport personnel explained the reason of delay. During check-in for return flight machine issued boarding pass with no seat number. Lady at boarding counter said that flight is fully booked nonetheless she "will try to find me a seat". Finally when boarding was almost completed she reissued new boarding pass with the seat. Disappointing considering that ticket was purchased long time ago. Poor food only small pack of crackers on the Athens-Vienna flight and small pack of waffle on the return flight plus a "slops-taste" coffee. Definitely would not recommend.

LHR-VIE-LHR on A320/A321 in Business Class as part of a longer itinerary LHR-AKL Speedy efficient check-in at LHR and timely departure with usual European style business class cabin. Seating is same as economy with middle seat blanked out so could do with at least a bit more legroom. Main benefit is being in front of aircraft and having good quality catering. Service was very good outbound but inbound staff appeared to struggle with a larger business class section (seemed to be about 9-10 rows in business). Food in both cases quite good but unlike previous occasions no choices regarding options you take what is offered or nothing. The inbound trip saw the meals distributed and it taking around 20 minutes before drinks appeared which meant either eating without drinks or letting the hot snack go cold. Finally there was a 45 minute delay in delivering the baggage at LHR apparently due to an aircraft technical failure. Austrian's crew are good and it has done exceptionally good food on this route in Business Class before but efforts to save money are apparent.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
BKK-VIE-AMS-VIE-BKK in Business Class. Excellent Food service nice touch by chef on board. Very friendly cabin crew. Choice of inflight entertainment could be bigger but was okay. Seat was new and very comfortable just cabin temperature was too high for a good-night sleep. VIE-AMS a normal Economy class seat with middle seat free. Too small even for 1.30 hrs flight. For me long haul very good but not for within Europe flights. Food is the best compared to other European airlines.

Flew from Toronto to Bucharest via Vienna and back. Their food was awful I had never seen such tiny portions of food. Although decent the food was much too small. On the leg from Vienna to Bucharest they only served us one small slice of a waffle (hardly recognizable as one). Two drinks had been offered. When flying Tarom from VIE to Bucharest it was much better in terms of services timing and seating comfort. Will not fly Austrian anymore.

Flew OS094 2 July IAD-VIE. Check-in by Lufthansa outstanding! The new business class product of Austrian is a great improvement. Food and drinks were wonderful. Pre-departure/Welcome drinks were only orange juice and water. Why no Champagne? The answer was that it was not allowed as the US customs had a rule about that.

Vienna-Toronto. A B767 was put into service with a complete new interior including in-flight entertainment upgrade. Stewardesses were consistent friendly young and helpful. In-flight service was impeccable we were served a typical Austrian meal. Beverages were served frequently throughout the entire flight. Arrival in Toronto was ahead of schedule. Would definitely recommend Austrian Airlines long-haul service to North America although tickets may be a little pricey in comparison to other airlines.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Vienna (return) Economy class. Outbound leg on A321. Flight was full which made the flight a strictly 'one carry-on baggage' only. Snacks and drinks served and a short programme was shown in the overhead TV screen. Both front and back door were used on arrival and a bus ferried passengers to the airport building. Return flight on an A320. Flight not so full. Again snacks and drinks served for economy class (hot meal and drinks for business class) but sufficient for the short flight. Short movie shown. One thing about Austrian is they are strict about hand carry luggage so be prepared to check-in bags if they are too heavy. Service was good decent legroom and will fly Austrian again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
ARN-VIE-YYZ Business Class. On-time boarding from cramped departure lounge in Vienna's old D wing. Aircraft was an older 767 with an ancient interior (green carpet purple seats wood panelling). Austrian's new Business Class interior can't come fast enough. IFE was 4 movies on a loop. Most other features didn't work. That said the service was very good and the food was probably the best I have ever had on any airline (better than Singapore or Cathay). I would highly recommend Austrian if you are flying on a newer plane.

IAD-VIE 19 May 2013 Booked frequent flier business class ticket to Turkey and routed on Austrian Airlines for first leg. First flight experience on this airlines. Redesigned 767 business class seating comfortable and easy aisle access. Service excellent and on-board chef provided best meal of 9 business class flights throughout my vacation. Sleeping position was uncomfortable - seats very narrow hard and positioned at angle. Some difficulty removing tray and with entertainment system on new seats - even frustrated crew. Would definitely consider Austrian for US to Europe flights especially business class.

VIE-Rome in business class recently. Very impressed with service food and staff aboard a quick flight from Vienna to Rome. From the moment we entered the cabin the flight crew provided a welcoming environment and did an outstanding job. The food service was some of the best I have tasted on an airplane. The Austrian wines were an added treat.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-FCO-VIE. Flight to Rome was very nice. The plane was nearly full but seat next to me was left empty. As a MM Senator I appreciate that. Returning flight was a different story. Plane was half empty and they seated 3 in a row. In my opinion the Senator benefits are a lottery and it is a shame that Austrian does not treat their best customers accordingly.

I was flying from SKG-VIE on A319. The seats were comfortable and seat pitch and width were good as well. The food quantity was not large but it was delicious. Inflight entertainment was okay but not great. Anyway the flight only lasted only for 1.5 hrs so for a domestic flight it was great.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
MXP-VIE-SOF and VAR-VIE-MXP. All those flights apart the VIE-SOF were done by using Fokker aircraft: although not new at all they proved comfortable. In the other leg we flew with a new A320 with slim seats: acceptable legroom quite comfortable. The food that we were provided was acceptable given the length of the flights. Crew polite and efficient but a bit cold (and with terrible uniforms). The only inconvenience was in Vienna airport: in order to catch the connection we had to run because we lost time at an unnecessary additional security control as we proceeded from another EU member State although out of Schengen area. Then the plane was kept 45 mins at the finger in order to wait some more connecting passenger. I think that if is planned to wait long for people it should be better to write "final call" on the screens. In general however I've been satisfied.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-MXP-VIE. Staff friendly and fluent in English dealt quickly and reliable with additional baggage that didn't fit into the overhead storage. Quick check-in extended legroom in the new short-haul cabin. Drinks/Coffee/Tea and choice between chocolate wafer and an apple. Good experience!

VIE-BUD March 2013. As far as I know Austrian isn't a low cost airline however the baggage allowances (23kg and 8kg) and the strictness of shows it should be. Compared to Emirates (from Dubai to Vienna) where I can take 30 kg baggage and actually hand luggage limitation in 'all you are able to carry'. Crew were robotic - no smile. It was a very short trip and they were still stressed with providing drinks however aircraft not full. I will definitely avoid Austrian next time.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
ARN-VIE A319 in Economy. Excellent short-haul experience. Late arrival of incoming aircraft but swift turnaround in Stockholm and efficient well organized boarding process got us in the air on time and ahead of schedule in Vienna. Excellent ground staff at Arlanda - recognized my Senator status and re-seated me upon boarding so that I could have the middle seat free. On board very friendly and efficient service. Simple snack was sufficient for this 2 hour trip. Legroom good and the new seats are fine.

I flew on an Austrian Airlines ticket with the flight operated by Tyrolean. I wasn't happy with the service on check-in by Austrian Air. I was assigned a back seat despite the entire business class being empty. All seats except the first row had very little leg room corresponding to the smallest I have seen in economy. It seemed like the check-in staff did not care much about customer service. Change fee is quite high -100 euros despite business class cabin being completely empty. Once onboard the service was very friendly and the food excellent.

LHR-VIE 4th March afternoon. Check-in no queue staff talked to each other but still good transaction time. Fast Track through Security Star Lounge ok small food choice long way to the gate priority boarding nice welcome flight was early really rare from LHR. Food was excellent (as usual) steward addressed guests by name lots of refills excellent. Downs: IFE (but not really needed for the 2hr flight) reduction in flights the afternoon flight is stopped this season which is strange since the flight was quite full (A320 instead of the scheduled A319) and this allows a normal arrival time in Vienna (7pm) instead of 11pm with the evening flight. The £40 difference from Economy to Business was worth it because of an extra piece of luggage lounge good food and attentive service. Can recommend flying Austrian.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
YYZ-VIE. Probably the worst long haul flight I've ever taken. I was expecting much more and in fact partly decided to try this airline for the first time given its four star rating on skytrax. The cabin is very old school looking. There are no personalized screens instead there are large screens overhead in the middle of the aisle every few rows. The food was mediocre and red wine was tasteless. They watered down the coffee. The service was not friendly or polite. This was my first time flying Austrian and once I'm done with this trip it is certainly my last. Definitely would not recommend.

London Heathrow to Rostov-on-Don in Russia via Vienna on a work trip. Very impressed with the level of service of their ground staff and the air crew. Flight was comfortable and the information given during the flight very good. There were 2 drinks rounds and although food was minimal at least something was offered. On one journey I ordered from the à la carte menu in advance and this was excellent value for money - really good quality. The whole experience was very relaxed unlike flying with a budget airline such as Ryanair. I will definitely fly with them again and have started to look at their other destinations for a leisure trip.

VIE-LHR. Found the entire flight experience to be extremely uncomfortable. Once seated you cannot help but to wonder if there's even a seat pitch to your seat as your leg would feel like its been clamped against the seat in front of you. Another complaint was with how the stewardesses kept speaking to me in German well after it was established that I don't speak German - found it to be both frustrating and uncomfortable. Apart from the drawbacks I found the breakfast muffin quite enjoyable. I would not care to fly this airline again especially for the prices this airline sells its seats for.

LHR-VIE on 21st Dec packed flight. Check-in unable to get me on an earlier flight couldn't speak German. Lounge was ok nothing special. Boarding was chaotic no priority boarding for Business. Inflight service - food was great as usual on Austrian. Arriving was good fast passport but baggage claim was pathetic. After long waiting time a few bags came out not even the priority bags just regular economy passengers. Then the belt stopped I like many others went to the lost and found where an unfriendly manager told us to go back and wait. A real down turner at 11.30pm.

LEJ-VIE-LEJ Economy class - journey paid with miles. Check-in was very quick but Lufthansa ground staff at Leipzig airport extremely unfriendly. Walking distances at Leipzig airport are incredibly long. Due to bad conditions at Vienna airport the plane (Dash 8-400) could not leave Leipzig on time therefore had to wait about an hour. Captain kept the passengers informed on connecting flights. During the waiting time the crew offered free drinks and newspapers. I asked for a special Austrian paper and received it with a smile. In the air we were served tea or coffee and a small snack. Return flight was also pretty good same experience except for the delay as we landed 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Austrian offers a good value for money (cheapest tickets start at 149 Euro) especially on this route where you have no alternatives.

The problem was not the airline aircraft or its crew but some of the passengers on the flight from Vienna to London. Austrian provide all passengers with the choice of seat yet when I boarded the passengers located in the seats next to me requested that I switched my choice of an aisle seat which I did not. The cabin crew are helpful efficient and friendly. The refreshments are good. The check-in services are efficient and useful. The queues seemed more prominent than usual at Vienna but the terminals and gates are very good with a smoking room free WLAN and sofas. Austrian are a good quality airline and the crew are professional.

LHR-VIE-LHR 29/12/12 and 1/1/13. Excellent product in Business Class. Flights on time boarding perfect in flight service friendly and accomplished on both legs. Food by Do & Co lives up to the long haul experience and plentiful. My only quibble is that the Captain takes an awful long time to switch off the seatbelt sign so long on the return flight (after 30 mins climbing and in calm air) that the senior crew member had to go into the cockpit to check whereupon the seat belt sign was switched off immediately and service began. Excellent food and drinks as usual by Austrian. One complaint: on return flight to LHR cabin lights did not get switched on after take off on questioning this was told that there were approx 100 Japanese pax who'd transferred from a day flight from Japan and requested a dark flight. Cabin crew member for business pax rightly asked if I wanted lights switched on I said no but did think that on a short 2hr flight to London not acceptable for a group to dictate the lighting on a plane - but sympathise with Austrian if this is a regular and lucrative booking! All in all Austrian remains a quality European airline in Business Class well worth flying.

We took the flight OS 026 from Bangkok to Vienna on December 30 2012. Overall impression is poor. The seats are uncomfortable and worn out no leg room. Onboard entertainment is below the level acceptable for long flights. Sandwich that we got for breakfast must have been a few days old. In front of us was a family with 3 kids and the father reclined the seats back during take off. He was not willing to set them into the upright position even during dinner. The cabin staff did not want to react - they said that nothing could be done. Will avoid Austrian flights in the future.

JFK-Vienna-JFK. The seat space on the 777 in economy was the tightest and most uncomfortable of any transatlantic flights I have experienced with the exception of a previous trip on Austrian. Even with an aisle seat it was impossible to move seats dreadfully hard. That said the crew were exemplary main meals of good quality though quantity was a bit miserly in quantity the breakfast prior to landing in Vienna and the snack prior to landing in JFK far more substantial and tastier than most other airlines offer. Plenty of drink runs. Seats booked were honored with both flights jam packed.

LHR to Vienna on a mid afternoon flight onboard the Star Alliance 737-800. The mobile check-in service was easy and quicker yet the request for an aisle seat was not available despite earlier check-in. The flight was full and there was an overbooking meaning one passenger was unable to travel. A sandwich was served and two drinks also. The cabin seemed too hot during take-off however the temperature dropped as we reached cruising altitude. All the short haul fleet have been fitted with more comfortable stylish cabins and is a real plus side to the journey with Austrian. Overall a good journey.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flight INN-VIE cancelled. Initially AUA announced delay on the screen however there was no one from AUA in departure hall to assist passengers. They show a complete lack of interest. Some passengers have been approached for rebooking but those with a higher status (Star Alliance Gold). 3 hours later the second flight was cancelled. Again nobody in the departure hall to assist passengers. Announcements were either inappropriate or late. Two staff members tried to identify passengers from their flight to give them a 5 EUR voucher however again they did not care about Star Alliance Gold status at all. Check-in staff in part cannot recognize priority passengers and do not know how to manage situations like cancellations. An agent responsible for the 2nd rebooking was more professional and arranged free taxi transportation after the 2nd flight cancellation.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
From Berlin Tegel to Wien the B737-800 was spotless. The 3x3 configuration with the middle set blocked was not the most comfortable but business was quite empty and it was a short (1 hr 10 mins) flight so cannot complain. Enjoyed the light blue with red leather seats decor of the cabin a nice departure from the frequent dark blues and greys from other airlines. Flight attendant welcoming and professional spoke good English and worked hard to make flight enjoyable. Around 11am a full lunch was served with starter hot breads small salad with black forest cake for dessert. A nice Austrian sparkling wine and hot coffee with pralines to close. Wien airport looked new and huge cannot understand why we parked on a remote area and they had to stuff all the passengers on one bus many fingers where available. From Wien to Frankfurt another spotless plane this time an A-321 with the Euro standard business with 3x3 and blocked middle seat. It was a bit more comfortable than the 737-800 and this time cabin was almost full. During the sunset the friendly FA served a full dinner with starter small salad nice pork schnitzel with potato salad a very good chocolate-mousse tart and coffee and pralines. Landed in Frankfurt after an uneventful 1.10 hrs flight. Both flights on time with professional and hard-working crew and nice looking and clean planes besides high quality meals. Would fly again.

Flew from Bangkok to Vienna very limited leg room old entertainment system could not eat comfortably as the chair in front if me was reclined I asked an attendant to ask the passenger to sit up and was told no ad he is asleep!

The attendant on my side of the plane was rude and abrupt she crashed the trolley into the narrow aisle a few times and dropped cups on the floor!

Took Austrian from Washington DC to Chisinau via Vienna. IAD-VIE leg was on an old Boeing 767-300. Old seats old in-flight entertainment limited overhead luggage space. FAs were friendly and served a good meal although I must admit service was not up to Lufthansa standards. I didn't see them doing any rounds of drinks in between meals. VIE-KIV flight was on a Fokker 70. Good seat comfort and good flight overall although nothing spectacular. The service on this leg consists of a chocolate waffle. Connecting in Vienna's new terminal was a nice experience and so was the Business lounge. Overall the experience was above average mainly due to punctuality food and FAs service but the product in general has a lot of space for improvement to be on part with companies like Lufthansa or Swiss.

PRG-VIE-PEK. First short haul flight on DHC8-400 with enough leg space and comfortable seats. However the cabin crew seemed unkempt. Transferring at VIE was pretty smooth and I consider that new terminal reasonable. The biggest problem of whole my trip was the old B767-300 on the connecting flight to PEK. Shabby interior ridiculous legroom and user extremely unfriendly small AVOD with horrible graphics. Rather use your smartphone when watching movies.

Vienna - New York yesterday on a completely full 767-300. 767's interior was very dated looking with sky- blue bulkheads pea-green carpets and bright turquoise seats. Pillows and headrests were red. All in all an odd design scheme to say the least. Backseat video monitors were tiny with extremely poor picture quality. IFE was not on-demand; all films played on a loop. The female cabin crew were polite but distant. Smiles were hard to come by. On a 9.5 hr flight they managed a remarkable disappearing act for hours and hours on end. A few drink cartons were left on the counter - for passengers to help themselves - in the otherwise abandoned galley. Two meals served and they were both quite good. During both meals warm breads were offered and re-offered. (Only) two 'water walks' were made during the long hours between the meal services In spite of the good catering my transatlantic flight on Austrian felt a bit down-market. Certainly not up to the standards of sister companies Swiss and Lufthansa. The timing of the flight - not to mention the fact that it was non-stop - was convenient for me but I wouldn't go out of my way to fly Austrian again.

C Class FRA-VIE-BKK-VIE-FRA. Two extremes on the same long distance flights. FRA-VIE-FRA was standard short haul business class service. VIE-BKK and back was excellent in terms of food (on-board chef makes dining in the air somehow a special experience) and friendliness of crew and the downside was the ancient seat and extremely ancient inflight entertainment system. Both seats and IFE are rather late 90's style. Not a big choice not on-demand plus blurry screens. Crew apologized and referred to the planned refurbishment coming up soon.

Business from Bangkok to Vienna (and on to London). Boarding quick with a priority line for Business. Pleasant welcome but crew seemed disorganised and seemed to wait for ages before a pre-take off sparkling wine. Chef came around with menus and then the crew took orders for dinner. This was the highlight of the flight as the seats are cramped for Business class and it was tricky to exit from a window seat when the aisle seat was occupied. Dinner started with canapés but drinks served afterwards the starter and soup were good and my beef was served medium rare which was excellent and the accompanying red wine very palatable. Cheese and dessert accompanied by a dessert wine and a Baileys coffee from the Coffee menu rounded off a decent meal. The cabin was too hot so I slept fitfully! Breakfast was for me a plate of eggs with crispy bacon and toast. Overall the flight was good and will be even better when the new Business class seats are introduced.

DUS-VIE-LCA and LCA-VIE-DUS holiday flight. DUS-VIE and VIE-DUS with partner airline Lufthansa so will write only about the VIE-LCA vv flights. Inbound very good with a nice 1.5hr layover in VIE. Transferring takes some time in VIE and the plane was a little bit delayed but arrived on time in LCA. The new seats are horrible but the interior was nice. The food is very good as we had a delicious and tasty pasta with as many drinks you like. Very nice cabin attendants and enough information from the pilot. Inflight entertainment was poor with only some commercials about Austrian destinations and the map where we currently are. On the return flight we we're the last to check in but assigned to the emergency exits which was very nice. The 40 minutes transfer time in VIE was a hassle we had to go through security checks again on a within Europe/Schengen flight so that caused some stress although all the passengers on the flight to Düsseldorf we're transferring passengers.

CDG-VIE-CDG. Outbound got upgraded in Business. Airbus A321 - padding of the new seats is too thin decent legroom blocked middle seat. Got some newspapers but no welcome drink. After takeoff got a delicious hot meal: smoked salmon tasty veal burger with potatoes gratin strawberry mousse. Inbound in Economy - same seats as in Business. Very limited catering on this two-hour flight: quite small ham sandwich drinks. On both flights cabin crew polite but not overly friendly - however pilots were very informative. Senator lounge in VIE fairly small and overcrowded - but good drink selection and delicious Do&Co food offer.

First time experience with Austrian Airlines. Two flights two consecutive days. The first one was delayed 70 minutes the second one - 150 minutes. These changed completely my business schedule. I would rather arrange my travel to a different day just to avoid Austrian Airlines.

MUC-VIE-ATH Fokker 100/A320 mixed experience. Legroom Fokker ok but terrible on the new A320. It seems that OS squeezed some more rows into this plane fortunately the neighbour seat was empty so I could use also this room. Crews also quite different: not very smiling on MUC VIE but very attentive and proactive (2 drinks rounds) on VIE-ATH leg. Free Snacks very small (chicken curry sandwich VIE-ATH). Flights on time baggage arrived very quickly at Athen airport.

SZG - LWO via VIE with Dash Q 800 and F70. All flights on time. Boarding in SZG is quick and they served water and coffee on this short 30 min flight to Vienna. F 70 used to and from Lviv also friendly service by cabin crew. What really bothered me was the terminal in Vienna. Its quite a hurry to change planes as you have to go through security again. I had a 45 min layover in Vienna and due to heavy traffic in the terminal I had to run to catch my next flight. I can recommend Austrian on European routes but only in the air. On the ground its horrible!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Vienna-Prague. Efficient and very quick check-in and security procedures followed by a messy departure area with hardly anywhere to eat and drink. On time departure friendly crew and a drink service offered on the 40 minute flight. Recommended airline despite Vienna airport departure area being awful.

LUX-DME via VIE. LUX-VIE operated by LG. Lounge in VIE crowded and food selection minimal. VIE-DME operated by Tyrolean although the only way of noticing was by looking at the boarding pass. Nice and clean 737-800 cabin crew friendly magazines were offered. Food was good nice portions but not that much greater than regular C class food. It was nice to get warm bread buns however. Nice wines and in general nice service. DME-VIE the Austrian lounge in DME is nice not crowded at all and with nice views. Priority boarding access directly from the lounge to the gangway very nice! Flight was operated by a professional crew who did everything they could to make us feel comfortable. Jackets were taken like on long-haul C class trips. Food good and wine once again nice. Both flights were on time and I must say I was happy with OS on this trip. Would prefer them over LH on this route anytime.

NRT-VIE-ARN (Tokyo-Vienna-Stockholm) with an old 777 between Tokyo and Vienna. Seats were not that comfy and looked like something from the 70s. The entertainment was horrible. The screens had the worst picture ever and they had no on demand. You had to wait for the movie to start on a curtain channel. Food wasn't that good either. We tried two different meals and both tasted pretty bad. Service was slow had to wait 15 min to just get some water after I pushed the button 3 times. After 4 hours wait in Vienna we boarded a Fokker to Stockholm. No entertainment and just a small sandwich were served. I will not fly with them again; there are so much better airlines out there.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
I travelled with my girlfriend from St. Petersburg (LED) to Budapest (BUD) via Vienna (VIE). Flight in SPB was 2.5 hours late and we missed the connection for BUD. Finally we boarded the plane (an old Fokker 100). The catering was poor we were given some kind of broccoli with sauce no meat. In the last 20 minutes of the flight while we were preparing already for landing one flight attendant was asking everybody if they missed any connections in Vienna but that's it she wasn't giving any suggestions for any other flights available. I don't recommend Austrian especially for flights longer than 2 hours.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew AMS-VIE-AMS over the weekend (2 hrs each way). AMS-VIE was OK - though only a muffin. Return boarding delayed by half an hour at VIE. Take-off then also delayed by half an hour or so due to a passenger getting off the plane again meaning arriving an hour late in AMS. In flight staff officious. Only food option was a ham and cheese sandwich. Crew member told me "we don't have vegetarian food. You can pull the ham out of this sandwich then it's vegetarian". Take your own food if you don't eat meat.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Toronto to Budapest with a plane change in Vienna. Vienna plane cancelled placed on a bus for 3 hours with no toilet or food. Ground staff were not professional constantly yelling at passengers. We had to collect our baggage and walk about 1 km to take a bus. No carts as we had to go outside the airport terminal to "find" this bus. Some of the older travellers were not helped with luggage. Ground staff at Budapest were not told anything about when the bus would arrive only that it was coming and would disembark the passengers in the Departure lanes! Huge confusion even in Budapest. Calling Austrian Airlines was useless as they knew even less. The 50 minute plane ride would have been fine instead we had to wait 2 hours to get on a Bus which took 3 hours! Perhaps if the ground staff were more understanding the trip would have been slightly better but they acted towards everyone as if they were doing us a favour! I felt very sorry for the much older travelers who had to take their own luggage.

LHR to VIE and back recently. Online check in and seat selection was good. A321 are clean the leg room in economy not too bad for short haul. Complimentary sandwich and drink served. Crew smiling. I would use it for short haul flights.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-YYZ on a B767-300ER: the check-in experience at the new Star Alliance terminal in Vienna is far from optimal but the trip was OK. Even the older 767s have good seats with adjustable headrests. Personal IFE is not genuinely on-demand but still provides some ten video channels playing in a fixed loop making it possible to catch several movies throughout the flight. There are even live feeds from two outside cameras and an air show channel. Food is good with fresh Viennese rolls and great salads by DO&CO. Arrival to Toronto slightly ahead of schedule. BRU-VIE on A320 was a standard 1hr 25 trip. No entertainment but the slim Recaro seats provide good legroom and a small sandwich plus beverages are provided free of charge. The only downside was the 70-minute delay without as much as a word of apology from the crew.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
CPH-VIE-SKP return. Boarding from CPH was disorganized and messy. Flight staff seemed stiff and uncomfortable snack onboard was a muffin. At Vienna the new airport is very big and everything doesn't seem to work smoothly yet. Flight to Skopje on an older Fokker 100 had friendlier staff however we were offered an apple or a biscuit. Flights went smoothly and on time and pilots are good. But this can not make up for a poor service. Austrian has had a degradation since the last time I flew with them and in the near future I will choose another airline for my East European flight.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
LHR-VIE and VIE-LHR: Both flights left 20-30 minutes late and arrived no later then 10 minutes of the published times. Outward plane a Boeing 737 and return an Airbus 320. The planes looked clean and well maintained. What lets the service down is attention to details and quality of human interactions. The drop down screens show a very old moving map and the safety cartoon. On the return flight the screen was just left down but blank for 40 minutes before some old cartoons were shown. The cabin crew appear to do what is required of them but with no great zeal. Passengers offered a drink and a muffin on outward flight. On the return leg a turkey and cheese sandwich. When I asked for a vegetarian option I was told directly and with no apology that there was not any. Mints offered after we had landed as passengers were on the way out. Another problem is that it is a very long walk at Heathrow to and from the gate used by Austrian. There are various means that help people a long but it can take up to 20 minutes. The new terminal in Vienna had a similar problem although not quite so bad but still a lengthy walk to passport control and I found very badly signposted. Next time I will fly with one of the other airlines. Departure on the return leg at the gate from Vienna was a bit chaotic and could have been better organized.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Brussels-Vienna return July 2012. Nice newish 319s with plenty of room and easy-to-fasten seatbelts even for amply proportioned pax like me! Coffee/tea juice and sandwich served on the out flight with the additional option of wine on the late afternoon return. For the return flight it was possible to check in at the Vienna CAT Air Terminal in the city centre saving me the need to carry luggage into the airport.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Washington DC to Chisinau via Vienna Economy Class. Travelling with my wife and 1-year old son. The overall impression was average-good (7 out of 10). The plane was old and the seats looked worn out. Limited legroom. Limited overhead luggage space on the old Boeing 767-300. The in-flight entertainment was old not an AVOD which is standard for many European carriers by now. The service was OK. FAs were helpful with the bassinet frequent rounds of drink service and good food. I ordered a seafood meal and the salmon and shrimp was tasty. On the VIE-KIV was offered an apple as a snack. Good wine on-board flights on time and no problems with luggage. I've been flying Austrian for many years now and to be honest I have witnessed a constant deterioration of the product. Austrian is still an OK company but definitely not what it used to be.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
LHR-VIE-TSE. New terminal at VIE excellent. Food good staff friendly. VIE-TSE is a 5.5 hr overnight flight on a cramped 737. Business class is just the standard economy seat with a centre seat blocked. I got to Astana feeling battered having not slept. Of course I don't expect a full lie flat bed but they should be having a good look at the new Turkish short haul business class seat which is fit for purpose. Unfortunately I didn't have much option with my schedule but I will try to avoid this in future. It was fine for LHR-VIE though which is exactly the type of flight it was designed for! Book with caution and do your research on overnighters with Austrian!

### Austrian Airlines customer review
One of the worst airlines I have flown. The planes are outdated. The food was below standard. Airline staff literally threw a cheese sandwich at me. Upon requesting if there was an alternative I was informed "I have only this If you don't like you stay hungry". Totally unbecoming of a four star rated airline. The cleanliness of the planes was poor. Flight took off 30 mins late. Entertainment system on the flight was antiquated.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
PAR-BKK-PAR flying via Vienna. I fully agree with all statements regarding Business Class of the Austrian airlines. The catering service of Do&Co is one of the best cuisine's I have ever had on an airplane in Business Class. However the sleeper seats are really not comfortable and I do not understand Lufthansa investing money to these archaic seats. Entertainment system is outdated compared to other European airlines. I agree that fabulous dishes soft and alcohol drinks and service compensate everything else. However I know that the Economy class of the Austrian still needs a lot of improvements and low quality service in comparison with Lufthansa Turkish British and other European companies.

London Heathrow to Vienna Schwechat. Overall this flight was fantastic and couldn't have been better. Organized boarding to stop that mad rush and running to be first. The SMS check-in service was also great very simple and easy was able to choose my seat free of charge. Courteous friendly staff all English speaking. Tasty snacks and drinks served within first two minutes of seatbelt sign being turned off. The cabin of the A320 was newly fitted with the new Recaro seats comfortable stylish and modern. Hilarious in-flight video played via shared (but easily visible) screens on the overhead panels. Whole cabin brand new. New Star Alliance terminal at Vienna clean very new. First time flying with Austrian and my decision has been made to fly this frequent route every time from now on!

Bangkok-Vienna-Tokyo. Flew these two routes with Austrian Airlines. Total of about 20 hrs in the air. Staff are pretty good but it stops there. Entertainment system is old and outdated. Worst I've come across. Food average at best - small and not much variety. Decor old.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
ZRH-VIE-CFU in Economy. I must say both flights with them were very nice. First flight a nice ham and cheese sandwich. 2nd flight a hot sandwich. Absolutely enough for a 1.50 hours flight. Drinks were offered two times on both flights. Crew very friendly despite that they fly now under Tyrolean airways. The only negative point is that the Internet check in did not work and after several phone calls with grumpy agents I called OS here in Zurich and a nice lady explained to me that Swiss is the handling agent in Zurich and that I have to check in through the website of Swiss. How should I know this. The new terminal in Vienna is great. Except that the new smokers lounges were "Out of order". Strange in a new terminal.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
MUC-VIE-NRT. I chose Austrian Airlines because the ticket price was lowest. The seat was too small for the long flight to Asia it was difficult to relax. Food was terrible and quantity not enough. The number of moves was much less than other airlines. I will never use this airline even if prices are attractive.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
This was our first trip with Austrian and except for the seats in Business class which we felt hard to get really comfortable in the total recline position the flight food and service was excellent. The 5 course meal which you select from the menu and served by the onboard chef in his chef's hat and crew was as good as some of the better restaurants we have eaten in. Crew was very friendly and gave us excellent service. Definitely would fly with them again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew MUC-VIE-WAW several times in C-Class during the last months. Austrian Airlines (OS and VO) by far have the best Intra-European inflight product within the LH group. DO&CO catering is outstanding and flight crews show a high level of hospitality. The new Austrian Star Alliance terminal in VIE is a huge improvement and extremely comfortable for quick and easy connections. New HON lounge is a very nice treat away from the masses of fellow SEN and FTL passengers. Together with ZRH and MUC it has become a great and very comfortable hub in LH group. I hope OS/VO will keep their service level as a benchmark for other LH group members in the future!

CDG-VIE-KLU KLU-VIE-CDG. We missed both connections because of delays during first flight. They offered us a 75€ voucher for compensation despite EU recommendations and 6 hrs delay to KLU and a forced overnight stay in VIE on our way back. We even had to ask 3 times to have a bus ticket to go to the train station.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
VIE-CDG-VIE. When I arrived at the airport they told me at the boarding gate that my ticket was cancelled a day before from a service agent. Interesting as I checked in a day before using web check-in and they issued a boarding pass for business class which I hadn't booked. As a Frequent traveller I thought they just gave me an upgrade. Food service - a dry bread with the thinnest slice of cheese and ham which they promote as the best catering by DO&CO. Poorest quality and no recommencing for DO&CO. Ground and Inflight-staff unfriendly. New seats (black and red) look poor and old after a few month in use. I would recommend to close down Austrian and Swiss should start a new hub in Vienna. Sorry. Never again with Austrian.

Flew LHR-VIE-DXB return business. Check in fast in LHR no wait at security although no fast track lane. Star Alliance Lounge breakfast as normal busy with adequate refreshments. Flight boarded on time. Nice breakfast on board. Fast change in VIE in new Terminal up one floor through security and onto plane to DXB. Planes are old yes but clean and for 5 hrs flight all you need. Lots of staff very friendly. On-board food excellent better than many restaurants. Seats are hard but they are okay for the day flight. IFE very poor one screen black and white only. Otherwise very good. All Austrian planes park on tarmac at DXB. separate bus for business passengers. Coming back night flight 0150. Lounge at DXB small but good food and drink. On soon as on board food offered or as I did sleep! Bed is okay hard but put blanket under me was better. Front seats have more leg room but for night flight take other seats they have foot well to stop you sliding down! Used pillow as leg rest. Had good sleep. Nice breakfast. Used new lounge at VIE great showers and refresh then onto LHR. Flight good excellent food again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flight: In last month. Flew Munich-Vienna-Bologna-Florence. The Fokker 100 plane was rather old hence the seats were old. My preferred seat is the A seat in the last row. So naturally I choose this one when checking in. So it was my fault that I was sitting right next to the engine. The noise was incredible. I plugged my headphones in to die down the noise a little. Service was mediocre. Nothing special - regional airline standard I guess. The connection in Vienna was strange since we had to pass security again though we had been cleaned in Munich. The waiting area for regional flights in Vienna is old and shabby. Not much to do. At least they had free internet - but it disconnected every 10 minutes or so. Wasn't too fond of that experience but bet that the medium and long haul product is a lot better.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
After recently having flown 5 star Qatar from Doha to Johannesburg in business class Austrian was a wonderful surprise! I took an old B777 from Vienna to Narita Tokyo and experienced one of my best long haul trips. Boarding was smooth and swift departure was on time. Cabin is colorful and not very trendy but the retro feeling inside is loveable. It was clean and neat. Unparalleled service started right after taking off. Do&Co Vienna restaurateurs' on board chef convert the cabin into an ultra-class restaurant above the clouds. Best cuisine I have ever had on an airplane. Cabin attendants did their best to make passengers feel great throughout the flight. Those criticized angled flat sleeper seats are not that bad not worse that of Lufthansa. Using the control buttons they can be adjusted to nearly horizontal. Entertainment system is outdated compared to other airlines. Fabulous meals drinks and perfect service compensate everything else. 5 star experience indeed.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Very disorganized loading. Planes are so old the fittings are dated and few function well. Seats felt like wood frames with no padding left at all. Business class with supposed lay flat seats really just angle to a very awkward position. Video screens are too small to watch with really no choice of movies only those shown on a loop are available.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew from Istanbul to Heathrow via Vienna the legroom I thought was not too bad the flights went as planned and on time and staff were friendly enough. In Istanbul I thought the check-in desks could have opened earlier than they did less than 2 hours before departure. I would certainly fly Austrian again as the planes were relatively new clean and comfortable. The only thing that I could not do as I have done with other airlines I have flown is try and pick my seat when booking the flight it may just be because the flight came up on the Lufthansa booking site but never mind all in all I was pretty happy with it all.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew IAD-VIE. Aircraft sat on the tarmac for nearly 40 minutes in the baking heat. When various pax asked why they could not turn on the air conditioning the reply was the ac could only be turned on when they turned the aircraft engines on. Screaming children people fanning themselves in vain and no even a glass of water offered. Needless to say the economy class cabin smelt like a pig pen throughout the flight. Terrible IFE with dated movies. Gives another meaning to cattle class. First and last time with Austrian.

CDG-VIE-BKK-VIE-BKK. 10 flights with Star Alliance (Swiss Austrian and Lufthansa) in 2 weeks and I have to say: never again with Austrian Airlines which calls itself a full-service airline. I had a seat reservation on all flights and on 3 of 4 flights I had to move - whether at check-in or onboard! Pre-ordered special meal onboard? Not available. Inflight entertainment - didn't work properly at my seat. Friendly flight attendants - no change. I have supported OS for many years but this was the last time I flew with them. Definitely not a full-service airline anymore.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
BKK-VIE return on 777-200 in Business. Service from the crew and chef was fantastic and the food was excellent especially out of BKK. However nothing can make up for the worst seat I have ever sat on. When boarding you are bombarded by 70's green carpet pale blue bulkheads and purple seats with wood grain shells and yellow pillows! That could be excused if the seat made up for it but it is impossible to get comfortable in any position as it feels like being on a hard lumpy narrow bench. I used 2 blankets to try and soften the seat / angled bed but forget sleeping. The cabin was too warm which only added to the discomfort. The 'entertainment' system is a joke - on a loop with fuzzy screen and cheap headphones. A total disappointment that the service and catering can not make up for.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
DXB-VIE-BRU in business class. First leg on 767-300ER looking nice from the outside (winglets) but 20yrs back to the past when inside. The interior is very dated indeed: very narrow and worn-out seat no flat bed poor IFE odd colours. Austrian flights always bussed to the airplane at DXB. Positive are the FAs and the quality of the catering and the cheaper fees which do reflect the quality of the product. Austrian is not 4 stars long-haul. VIE airport not very welcoming either but a new terminal is to open in June for Austrian. However the VIE-BRU leg serviced by a brand new 737-800 excellent seat excellent breakfast top-notch short haul.

Travelled to Bangkok from London Heathrow via Vienna. Direct flights are always preferable but this trip was actually not too bad as the stopovers both on the way out and back were fairly short. Managed to sleep both ways but found the cabin too hot for my liking - a case of put the customers asleep and then less hassle for the crew? Food was generally good however drinks were not offered very freely. Otherwise service was efficient and professional. The business lounge in Bangkok is provided by Thai Airways and is very good with wonderful showers. By contrast the D terminal in Vienna is not great - a glorified ex-staff room with only one male toilet resulting in a queue for the facilities! I hope the new terminal at Vienna will resolve this issue and a better lounge provided? Also when boarding for the flight to London there was no pre-boarding for Business passengers which resulted in the inevitable crush. The inflight entertainment is ok - in the end if you are trying to sleep you don't need to watch more than one movie a flight. All in all I would certainly fly Austrian again.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Flew Dubai-Vienna-Toronto recently. Courteous staff ok meals. Cons: the plane from Vienna to Toronto was very old (767) with old entertainment system (one TV screen for the whole cabin plus a bunch of smaller ones). For a 9+ hour flight I would expect better than that from a 4 star airline.

VIE-IAD Beautiful new winglets Seat very comfortable screen at every seat with remote to play games even with other seats. Food very good. Beyond normal economy food. Soft pillow and blanket at every seat. Pilot was engaged and flight attendants too. Drink run every hour and a half keeping well hydrated. Large overhead bins for bags.

Vienna-Belgrade-Vienna. Have flown this route 3 times within the last months. Flights were always completely full. I found Austrian a good airline to fly with: cabin crew always very caring and polite flights always on time: you can see they are Lufthansa. What is more I really enjoyed the new Recaro seats. The only drawback are the aircraft's being used: the turboprop Dash I had the chance to fly on twice is quite noisy and pretty uncomfortable.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
INN-VIE-ZAG. Although Austrian onboard service in Europe is still better than service offered by some competitors unreasonable changes were introduced in the premium sector. Until April 1st business passengers and Star Alliance Gold card holders received a voucher of EUR 5 prior to the flight for refreshments since they have no lounges at smaller Austrian airports. This has been abolished from April as a part of down-grading of Austrian/Lufthansa frequent flyer services which already caused many complaints. Austrian/Lufthansa have their own way to motivate premium passengers to consider other carriers and alliances.

DXB-VIE-LNZ-VIE-DXB. Everything was bad about this flight from web check-in to arrival to final destination. Sector VIE-DXB delayed 6hrs 40 min. Service personnel at VIE extremely hostile and unhelpful. Antiquated Boeing 767 planes with poor leg room and poor onboard entertainment systems. Food unappealing. Never again.

No change really from some of the older reviews. Catering is excellent a nice touch is the chef service. IFE very dated on a loop not on demand so didn't bother. Business class seat is very poor angled lie-flat - a nice touch is the duvet and sheet but this cannot mask the extreme discomfort of the seat. Product feels poor compared to Swiss and similar to the Lufthansa seat slightly longer but more angled in the sleep position.

DUS-NRT via VIE. Both outward and return flight were miserable. Used air sickness bag was left behind from former flight. When my wife who felt sick gave the bag to a flight attendant to get a new one she was just told to go to the toilet to wash her hands - no apologies. Majority of staff seemed unmotivated and inattentive. At my wife's seat TV monitor did not work at my seat no reading light staff reacted annoyed to respective complaints. Aircraft dated in general very poor inflight entertainment no video on demand small choice of (mostly old) movies in general. This airline seems to have massive problems. Never again.

LHR-VIE return. Outbound flight delayed 40 mins but arrived on time. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Seating comfortable and adequate for a 2 hour flight with reasonable leg room. Drinks and a muffin provided which were very nice. However plane was extremely hot and stuffy. On return from VIE boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganised cabin crew were unwelcoming and appeared to speak very little English. Drinks and a panini provided however no vegetarian option available (abruptly told they are only available on long haul fights). Further drinks had to be asked for a number of times. Again another very hot flight. Overall flight experience ruined by return flight.

CDG-VIE-TLV. First leg Boeing 737-800 second Airbus A321. Seats not soft enough very attentive crews leg space nice. Catering on CDG-VIE route: small piece of cake. On VIE-TLV route: hot meal.

I have flown with Austrian on previous occasions and have always been pleased.

VIE-BKK. Pre-boarding at Vienna on time with boarding fast. Onboard the economy seats were acceptable if you weren't large or tall. The meal service was fine and so was the drinks run. Entertainment was awful for such a long haul flight 3 films were played on a loop. Each person had their own seat back screen but you had to watch it to schedule. It's an average airline with an average product. I knew what to expect and it did exactly what it stated on the tin. If you can get a good price ticket Austrian is adequate.

VIE-JFK in business class. Okay the seat is not good and neither is the inflight entertainment. But on this flight the crew and the catering were excellent. Attentive service good wines and food was nicely presented.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Have used it twice for a 10 hr flight (Vienna-Tokyo) in Economy class. The problem is the seat space being the smallest I have had on such a long trip. To make matters worse their entertainment system is appalling. You can't rewind or start a movie and can only choose channels that play out like a TV. The food is not horrible but definitely does not fall into the category of good airline food.

Vienna-Bangkok-Vienna. Not satisfied with the flight experience. Tired and rude staff. Food was pretty bad quality and quantity wise entertainment equipment is outdated cabin color scheme awful. Leg room was ok however they just don't seem to make any effort to ensure you enjoy the long haul flight.

### Austrian Airlines customer review
Mumbai-Vienna-Toronto in C class. Agree with the comments that the aged aircraft odd colour schemes and aged video system are initially off putting. From an equipment perspective it's clear that Austrian is the poor relation in the Lufthansa family. On the other hand the attentive and courteous service combined with very good food to make for a very pleasant flight. 5 hour transit time in Vienna allowed visit to the small marginal lounge. Overall a good experience and I would do it again.

Delhi-Vienna-Amsterdam. Service was good food on long haul flight tasty but inadequate. Light sandwich served at midnight after no-dinner is just not enough. Luckily offered a second sandwich upon request. Breakfast was good. The only problem was the plane! Horrible legroom and the whole row had dysfunctional entertainment systems which could not be solved. A pity on 8 hrs long haul flight. Overall good service planes in poor condition - slightly disappointing after flying their partners Swiss and Emirates on same routes which I found much better.

PRG-VIE-YYZ in Economy. Checked in online. Dropped off my bags the morning before the flight. The short haul flight from Prague to Vienna left 20 minutes late but landed on time. Vienna airport awful and the gate for the Toronto flight completely inadequate. Flight to Toronto was 80 percent full meaning 3/4 had to stand for well over 30 minutes until boarding started. Flight left and arrived 25 minutes late. Once aboard everything was good I had no one next to me so was quite comfortable. Food was really nice the selection of movies okay. Flight attendants polite and offered plenty of drinks including beer free of charge.

Flew Astana (Kazakhstan) - Vienna a 5+ hr flight. Freezing cold draft around the feet for the whole flight no entertainment other than cartoons etc not even on the overhead TV screens food wasn't bad but certainly not worthy of the star ratings given. Seat was reasonably comfortable. Main gripe - a long cold boring flight on the wrong aircraft type for this length of trip.

CPH-VIE-TLV v.v. 1-6 Feb. Outbound: Uneventful smooth transfer in VIE. Homebound flights delayed due to WX at VIE (snow). A321 TLV-VIE seats non-reclinable as row in front of emergency exit however the neighbouring free seats made up for it. Hot meals on VIE-TLV-VIE legs were simple menus of good standard hardly seen in economy class of comparable carriers anymore! Staff always efficient and polite.

VIE to JFK twice in less than a month. First was from TLV the second from IEV. The airport is extremely outdated in it's international wing which is cramped and small. Business lounge is hard to find and small as well in the international terminal. The second time around I decided to get my passport stamped and checkout C terminal used for inter Europe and domestic flights. It was much better but still small. The lounge in C is better but still tricky. The plane was a dated 777 with odd colors. Staff on the first trip was ok but my second time around they were extremely nice and attentive. The meals were fine and AVOD good as well. Flew economy both ways. I was impressed.

BEG-VIE-LHR. First leg uneventful. Nice new A320 adequate catering and service for one hour flight. Ground services in VIE were something different. Following 10 min delay due to “surprise” of plane landing early I made a swift move to the gate at the opposite side of the airport only to be met by queue in standstill. There were three OS staff evidently dealing with some queries dozens of people with their boarding tickets in hand and two separate OS members of staff checking visas at very slow pace. This was the most shambolic boarding I have witnessed. There were no announcements about cause for the delay no apology and 45 mins later we boarded the plane via shuttle bus. The staff on B738 were obviously annoyed about the delay which influenced their very swift and somewhat rude service only to be kept on hold for 40 mins in holding pattern above London.

CDG-VIE-IST return in economy. CDG-VIE delayed due to poor weather. Would have missed connection VIE-IST but that flight was also delayed due to weather. My luggage didn't make it to IST unfortunately but it was delivered the next morning. Ground staff at IST helpful. Check-in process easy at all airports. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly. Onboard catering very good. New seats were quite comfortable and legroom surprisingly good. Overall a great product that offers very good value for money. I would not hesitate to fly with Austrian again on intra-European flights.

VIE-BKK on 777-200. Strange interior colours seats are outdated and do not work properly anymore recline did not work when table was out monitors must be pulled out of seat and have very poor quality. Seating 2x3x2 is not contemporary - avoid middle seat since you can go nowhere when both neighbours are asleep. Seat does not fully recline and provides limited comfort. Austrian provides linen and a warm blanket. Food excellent great choice of wines and very good service. Avoid rows 6 and 7 in this plane since they are behind galley and next to economy only separated by a thin wall.

I routinely commute between Vienna and New York. I fly both business class and economy and believe the service is very good. Economy meals are perfectly good. But generally not meritorious of relatively high praise as the meals in business are. The crews are professional and courteous. My only issue with the service is when by bad luck of the draw I get a seat with impaired leg room as a result of those metal entertainment boxes on the floor. Those are only barely tolerable when the seat next to me is empty but horrible during a full flight.

Toronto-Vienna and Prague-Vienna-Toronto. Departing flight was okay except for the archaic entertainment (movies on TV's hanging off the ceiling) which continued through the night. On the return flight the standard screens on the back of the seat were in place but the plane was smaller and extremely uncomfortable. I'm fairly tall (5'11") and there was no room for my legs so they stuck out into the aisle. A flight attendant came barrelling down the aisle and she smashed into my knee. The other flight attendants were quite friendly. The food was barely edible for both flights but the drink service was often. If you have a little extra money to spend I wouldn't recommend taking Austrian Airlines as I was highly disappointed.

AMS-VIE. Had an extremely cheap ticket so wasn't expecting much. Flight was 90% full in Economy and 50% in Business. Boarding at AMS was quick and from the rear towards the front co-ordinated therefor boarded as one of the last ones. Still able to take some newspapers (local Austrian and English ones) for the flight onboard. Service was up to standards with food and beverage needs for a 1.5 hr flight. Arrived early in VIE after a late push back in AMS! Good service seats could be a bit more comfortable but no need to complain.

ZRH-VIE-SOF-VIE first and last leg on A320 VIE-SOF onboard 737. All planes featured the new seats which are quite comfortable for these short-haul flights offering sufficient legroom. We took off in SOF with more than 30min delay the crew provided timely and updated information on connecting flights. Staff onboard and at airports were friendly and helpful. Food service was good between VIE-SOF and a somewhat uninspired sandwich on the last leg. All in all a good experience.

BKK-VIE-PRG. If you don't mind a narrow and uncomfortable seat Austrian is a very good choice. Staff friendly and helpful. Foods are very good and delicious. BKK-VIE plane was very old but VIE-BKK plane was new and cabin equipment worked well.
