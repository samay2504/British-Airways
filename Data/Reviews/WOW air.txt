### "Everyone was very nice"
Not Verified |  Arrived at Toronto airport very early (about 3hrs early). Had no issues checking in. Everyone was very nice. It was my first time flying and the staff were very reassuring during turbulence. Arrived at Keflavik with no issue. The flight home was similar. No issues with baggage or carry-on. No hidden or extra fees. If you don't mind the no frills type of flight, this type of budget airline is great. Its a shame that this airline is no longer running.

### "crew was very helpful"
I loved the flight and service, the crew was very helpful and friendly. Found the seats comfy and because of the low fares we booked make this trip to Iceland. Thank you WOW air.We will miss you.

### "will never fly WOW air again"
Detroit to London via Keflavik. Absolutely awful. Cancels flights, delayed flights, atrocious customer service. Every single thing about this experience was awful. I will never fly WOW air again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. DO NOT use this airline. It's not worth the reduced airfare at all. When we arrived at the airport for departure we were told we'd have to pay extra to sit together, that cost $88.00. Then we were charged $70 baggage, on top of the $140 we had already paid for baggage. On the return flight, they charged us $120 for carry-on's that were not charged on the departure flight, these carry-ons were a backpack and a purse. How can a backpack and a purse not be considered a free carry-on? There was no sizer or weight scale on the return trip, the ticket agent was just plain rude and said if we didn't pay for the carry-on's we could leave them in the airport! Tried dealing with customer service when we returned home for a refund of this nonsensical carry-on charge and it's just dealing with one incompetent after another. They did no investigation, just said whatever their ticket agents say, goes. Another issue that we witnessed on the flight home was that of another customer. In mid air a rude flight attendant grabbed a woman's coat from the overhead so harshly that she ripped the woman's coat, leaving a large tear. The flight attendant was not apologetic and when the customer simply stated all she wanted was an apology the flight attendant began yelling at her. Absolutely ridiculous treatment of a customer. Please save yourself the hassle, don't fly this airline.

### "Absolute nightmare"
I've flown with them a few times and they've been great. However, this time around, I'm not so happy. I woke up at 6am, to an email saying my flight was canceled; my flight home was set to leave at 1035am. I call them and apparently the next flight out is in 2 days! They gave me no compensation, no help, nothing. I'm scrambling to get people to cover my shift because I'm set to work the next day. Absolute nightmare.

### "crew were very friendly"
Toronto to Paris via Reykjavik with WOW air. The plane was smaller than any trans Atlantic flight that I had flown in the past but the boarding process was so smooth. Although food is available for sale, the crew were very friendly.

### "I had a good experience"
After reading lots of reviews I was really sceptical about flying with WOW air. I still went ahead and booked my ticket to detroit as it was the cheapest option for a one way, and I had to book last minute which is always more expensive! I decided to pay for selected seats up the front with extra leg room on both flights and got really lucky with having no one in my row for the first flight. The second flight I chose a seat with no middle seat and was really happy with this decision. As it’s a cheap airline a lot of people do not pay for the seat upgrade, it’s really not expensive to purchase the extra leg room and well worth it for the comfort! Plus you will likely not have many people around. The food and drink on board is very expensive, but as I knew this beforehand I purchased food and water at the airport to take on the flight with me. I think I was lucky with the reliability of both my flights taking off on time as this was the one thing I was worried about! The seats are very dirty (front seat pocket) but all airlines are usually quite unhygienic so this was to be expected. The service on board I thought was great, very friendly staff and attentive. Overall I would say you get what you pay for and you are taking a risk booking with WOW air, but lucky for me I had a good experience with them and would book again!

### "fly a more reliable airline"
Not Verified |  We had booked the Wowair stopover Detroit to Barcelona via Keflavik and just shy of 2 weeks prior to our vacation (family of 5), we received a text and email from Wowair saying they had cancelled our BCN stopover. Because we had already scheduled time off work and school and hotels, cars, meeting others in Barcelona, we were forced to buy connections on Air France. WOW said they could get us as Paris so we had to purchase 5 round air tickets from CDG to BCN, lost 2 days of our vacation, lost a night in a hotel in BCN, had to pay for a hotel at CDG, spent almost 2 full days dealing with connections, layovers (extra costs for food, car etc) Then several days before our DTW to KEF flight, WOW air changed our airplane and scattered us all over the airplane (kids in middle seats in back etc). We were one of the first to book on the flight (Was empty at time) and had paid to purchase upgraded seats together/seats together. Wow did not honor seat assignments. spent close to 2 days on phone / email / twitter support with Wowair and AirFrance and hotels/car rental scheduling, rescheduling, getting seat assignments, seeking compensation. Wow cites an EU regulation that if cancel 2 weeks before, will offer no compensation; they slipped in just before 2 week window with cancelled flights. The staff was very nice but the company is just horrible. We were out approximately $2000 all in and no compensation or accommodation from company. Very sad because this was a long planned family trip that we had saved for and planned for a long time. The day we were flying, the company was offering "free flights to people with the last name Valentine". Very gimmicky and not taking care of their paying customers. Lastly, truly the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. It is a discount airline but so this is to be expected (though not at all discount when they screw you and cancel your flight). The economy / no upgrade seats are the most uncomfortable you could imagine, people were very miserable. Many families, could not move around at all. The first three rows were very large, like the people could do a pike/legs straight out. Makes no sense to give the upgraded seats too much room while the other 30 rows really suffered. The flights were packed and a lot of unhappy people. They charge for even water so the by the time you pay for water, food, definitely consider an upgrade, charges for luggage and if you are really unlucky - cancellation fees - you could fly first class with a reputable airline. Iceland is lovely but fly Delta or United or partners or anyone but Wowair. I read many many complaints on the internet etc. that they did this same behavior to many many other people. Company really does not deserve your hard earned vacation dollars. I would urge you to fly a more reliable airline.

### "I hope they go bankrupt"
Boston to Keflavik. If they had zeros, I’d give it to them. I don’t care how cheap it is, it was NOT worth the pain and suffering my mom and I went through on their airline. Our flight was completely cancelled by WOW Air 3 weeks before our trip. They offered to fy us out of Boston but offered no compensation and we still paid the same price as we would’ve if we left from LA. Their costumer service is horrible! They block emergency exits with their food cart and even sat a 10 year old in the exit row. Unbelievable! I hope they go bankrupt so no one has to make a mistake and travel with this disgusting excuse for an airline!

### "cheap price and direct flight"
I flew with a friend to Iceland from Toronto for a 4 day trip. We were attracted to wow air because of the cheap price and direct flight to Keflavík international airport near Reykjavík. It is important to note for travellers that you do have to pay for a carry on bag and pay for a checked bag, so my friend and I packed our checked luggage together and split the cost, however, make sure to pay attention to the weight. The website advertises that it needs to be 20kg and as long as we were under 21kg the attendant was fine with our bag. On the flight itself, there is a decent amount of space for a backpack under the seat in front and for the price you’re paying, it’s great. I was blown away by the customer service on the flight there. I am a very nauseous flyer typically, I get motion sickness on any moving vessel. I took a different type of gravol than normal and needless to say ended up vomiting 4 times on the 5.5 hour flight. After the 2nd time I vomited, they offered to move me up to premium class but I declined. After the 3rd time they offered again to move me where I had more space to be comfortable and where there would be less intense turbulence. They were so attentive and kept checking up on me to make sure I was okay. They offered me cups of ice continuously and ginger ale and made su.

### "had a great experience"
Toronto to Keflavik. We had a great experience. The service was exactly as described when booking the ticket. The crew members were amazing, I have no complaints. They left on time both flights and the return flight arrived 40 min earlier. I bought the promotional tickets to visit Iceland. Overall 5/5 stars and I would recommend this airline.

### "you will waste time and money in the end"
My husband and I booked our flights months in advance because they were such a great price. Leaving from Pittsburgh, the flights were only 299 USD with cancellation protection. It is a month before we are scheduled to leave and WOW air cancels both our leaving and returning flights. Most airlines that I fly with offer you a lateral alternative so that some indemnity is given to the customer. Not in this case. WOW air only presents customers with two offers: to cancel for a full refund or to cancel and receive a gift certificate worth the cost of your trip and an additional 25%. Although this seems like a nice offer, the tickets to fly out of Boston or New York (as they have cancelled all of the flights from Pittsburgh) are twice the price of what we originally paid. I think WOW air is betting on the fact that customers will have made reservations and would be hesitant to cancel. What a racket. My best advice would be to never book with this company as you will waste time and money in the end. I made some non-refundable accommodations that will now go to waste but in my mind its better than playing into WOW air's deceitful marketing strategy.

### "Staff service was excellent"
Toronto to Copenhagen via Keflavik. Rates were very cheap, I paid for a little extra leg room (still cheaper than the competition). Staff service was excellent, friendliest crew I've met yet. There are luggage requirements that must be met or you pay for extra baggage, do your homework and measure your luggage, no issues here. Meals are not included in the price of the ticket, but food is available in flight at a reasonable price.

### "turned out to be very expensive"
Toronto to Keflavik. It supposed to be cheap but they charge for every single thing. It turned out to be very expensive. I don't recommend. Called support due to an issue and they did nothing. Horrible customer service. I had to call many times to get something back. We ended up paying more than any other airline.

### "disputing the amount I paid"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Keflavik. I purchased a flight in May of 2018 for a flight in March 2019, I have been checking periodically to see if the seats are filling up. I purchased through a third party vendor and apparently it is only for the economy fare, so no luggage or seats. So I have been watching to see if I need to purchase them early. I haven't been able to see the seats since November, so in February I emailed customer service to ask why. They told me because my flight was cancelled. I guess they do not fly out of Los Angeles anymore, much to my surprise because my flight is in 3 weeks. No one ever emailed me or called me to notify me, I would have been at the airport and had a big surprise. Now I am trying to get a refund and they are disputing the amount I paid, they do not want to pay me approx $300, even though I have sent over screen shots of my credit card showing I paid a total of $1300. It is ridiculous.

### "never fly with WOW again"
Paris to Detroit via Keflavik. This was my first time flying with wow. I flew with them initially because it was really cheap. It ended up not being any cheaper then any other airline in the end. I knew I had to pay for my bags but I didn’t look into how much. I didn’t pay for my bags before because I had an oversized bag and there was no option to pay for that. My 45L pack that I always bring as a carry on for every other airline was not allowed to be a carry on for wow. So I had to pay for 2 bags which costs me $150 USD each way. I was shocked by this. After paying this hefty fee, on my way home my bag got lost. The system was down so the lady said she would email me what my bag reference number would be. She did not. I had to email her only for her to tell me that they had no idea where my bag was. I told them I was going on a trip to Hawaii and they said that they would ship my bag there to me. I said absolutely not as my bag was a massive ski bag with miscellaneous other gear in it that I did not want to lug around in Hawaii. One thing that was in my bag that I needed was my hiking shoes. I had to buy a new pair for $200. While I was in Hawaii I kept asking for updates on my bag and they just stopped answering my emails. I come to find out that they actually shipped my bag to my house and never told me. My bag with over $2000 of gear was sitting on my front porch in the rain, while I was in Hawaii. I was lucky it was not stolen. I will never fly with WOW again. They have not offered me any sort of compensation for the massive inconvenience they have caused me and basically have just ignored my emails.

### "I give them a poor rating"
We were scheduled to fly from Newark to Reykjavík and then from there to Dublin on WOW Air. As many know this company is low budget and a cheap way to get to Iceland and some major cities in Europe. We paid for upgrades seats so we weren’t cramped and also got the fare that included a carry on and a checked bag. While we were in the front of the plane if you don’t buy priority boarding passes it’s basically a free for all to board. At that point we sat on the plane and waited for two hours until they tried to figure out what was wrong with a “sensor” on the plane. They deplaned us after two hours. We sat in the terminal for another hour. After that. We waited and it was becoming clearer that we would not make our connecting flight to Dublin. No one on the ground knew the results and what would happen when we got to Iceland and with limited flights out of that airport the choice was do we wait out WOW or get on another flight in Newark on another airline at our cost. So ultimately WOW canceled our flight. As I was on the phone waiting on the phone I got a flight on Aer Lingus direct to Dublin and since WOW canceled our first flight they gave me the option. To cancel the whole round trip flight for my whole family. Which I did. They also said that they would credit me the money for our hotel to stay in Newark for a flight the next day. So I have to submit that claim later today. While I am paying more for my flight to Dublin now I’m not out the money to WOW as I have an e-mail confirmation of the flight cancellation and refund amount. So if they try to not refund me I can dispute the charges to my card. Some other notes the customer service people on the 800 number knew the flight was canceled before the people at the checkin desk. They also sorted me on to another plane 2 days later which would have really screwed me up for the trip. The day delay was not a super big deal. Also with limited options to Iceland I’d be careful booking tours in Iceland before you arrive. Folks were flying to Iceland and had these expensive tours booked and they were going to be out tons of money. While ultimately WOW made it right and I’ll get my money back I would not recommend them at all. However, with limited choices to Iceland if you must fly them to get there wait or give yourself an extra 24 hours before booking those expensive tours that might not refund you the money if you don’t get there. If you are just stopping over and connecting in Iceland to another destination with WOW Air pay more and get on one of the larger carriers. They have larger fleets to add flights and put you on other planes. The person at the WOW desk also was very clear that they have no relationships with other airlines. They won’t be able to get you on another flight out of your airport unless it’s a WOW flight. Unlike say Aer Lingus who has a relationship with Air Canada, etc. For all this I give them a poor rating.

### "Do not use this airline"
Newark to Dublin via Reykjavik. They hook you with cheap fare. Average size carry on luggage 70USD each way. No free meals, no screens but they will charge you for use of a tablet. No free tea or coffee. $3.25 per cup. If you think that purchasing a ticket will save you money you are wrong. Everybody complained about the cost of a bag ($150 round trip). Never before have I traveled with people who were openly critical of the airline before take off. Seats were not comfortable. We ate nothing, drank nothing, watched nothing, listened to nothing, no internet. Be prepared to pay far more than expected. Do not use this airline.

### "continued to ignore our complaints"
Toronto to Barcelona via Keflavik. We never did get to fly with this airline but seeing other reviews of the actual flights, glad we didn't. Our horror story is all about their customer service and flight cancellation process. We had flights to Barcelona and discovered after we called them to look at extending a layover, that they were in the process of reviewing the flight and it likely wasn't going to fly. We were misinformed on multiple occasions about how we could seek compensation for the additional cost of another flight this late in the game. Long story short, they have continued to ignore our complaints (both written and over the phone) and have yet to compensate us as they should. Will never recommend WOW air to anyone.

### "awful check in process"
Baltimore to Keflavik. Absolute awful check in process. Only had one check in agent to check in over 50 people. If you do book, you must give yourselves two hours just to check in. The customer service at the check in desk was awful and unhelpful, in no rush to accommodate passengers.

### "our flight got cancelled"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. Like many people here, we booked several months in advanced and our flight got cancelled few weeks before departure. Without any reason. Wow Air offered an alternative; flying two weeks later or fly from New York rather than Orlando. Both weren't realistic and the customer services agent agreed. We had our hotels, rental car, events, etc. already booked. Since it was in the beginning of January, it cost us an additional 600 euro to fly home with another airline. Hours later than we originally planned.

### "license to be rude"
Boston to Keflavik. Horrible airline! Really WOW - wow the worst ever! Their personal act like they’ve got license to be rude. First and last time I’m flying Wow Air. For the international flight they charged me $70 for a small carry-on!

### "I was blindsided"
Amsterdam to San Francisco via Reykjavik. Never again!! I was blindsided by the seemingly cheap fares. Turns out, it wasn't cheap at all, because I needed to pay for luggage, seats and what not. What frustrated me the most was that my partner's luggage did not arrive in San Francisco. We were without his suitcase for 10 out of 13 days on our vacation. Back home, we filed a request and Wow aiR granted us a compensation (which they are bound to do by law!!) and said that processing the payment would take between 10-12 weeks. Very irritating, how can making a money transfer take up to 12 weeks? Now, after 4 months, the money has not been transferred. Wow air does not answer our mails and the hotline employees keep putting me off. What a scam! Do not book a flight with this airline, it is most likely going into insolvency, seeing as they're withholding money and cancelling destinations altogether.

### "I was given a normal seat"
I booked a seat with extra feet space (between Reykjavik and Chicago with WOW air) because I have knee problems and paid 43 USD extra for the seat, but I was given a normal seat. When I asked for my seat I was told that this was the seat I booked which was totally wrong.

### "licence to be rude"
Baltimore to Reykjavik. WOW has the worst customer service ever seen. This goes across the board from ground agents to the flight attendants. Our flight crew was terrible from Baltimore to Reykjavik. When we board the plane no one was greeting the passengers. During the flight upsell stuff was the only goal of the crew. They barely answered simple questions and when they answered they were plain rude. In Reykjavik during my return the ground crew were so rude I really could not believe it. I understand the company rules and being a discounted airline, but I cannot accept people being rude to a paying customer. Being discounted airline seems like gave these people licence to be rude. Take it or leave it is the attitude! Pay more fly respectfully.

### "Airline is a complete shambles"
Boston to Dublin via Keflavik. Airline is a complete shambles. Sold me a $50 seat after loads of emails they refused £30.99 tho it cost me £42.15. Apparently this is not their problem. I’d recommend paying extra to fly with a respectable airline.

### "Very disappointing airline"
San Francisco to Delhi via Reykjavik. Very disappointing airline. They nickel and dime you for everything. Checked in Baggage: $175. Carry-on bag: $75. Water on flight: $3. Snacks: $5-8. Meals: $12-18. Cocktails: $8-12. In flight movies: None. In flight WiFi: None In my attempt to find the best fare from SF to Delhi and back, I found a fare of $1200 via Kiwi.com. But get this. I had to change my flight dates after booking, and Kiwi.com charged me $400 for that. Plus all these charges by Wow, and a ridiculously winding itinerary, my trip has now cost me $2400. Such a lousy experience. A big rip-off. WowAir and Kiwi.com - 2 thumbs down!

### "I never got paid"
Brussels to Montreal via Keflavik. I got approved for about 350$ of baggage damaged (request number 538729). The issue is that I never got paid and since then I am not getting responses from the baggage team. I am not sure if that is the way WOW air operate or a huge lack of customer support response.

### "non-serious flight company"
Copenhagen to Reykjavik. WOW air asked him to pay an abusive price for his hand luggage (90 euros). The hand baggage had the appropriate size and less than 10kg. I wrote several times to the company and they dont give me a satisfactory answer. The same day my son took a flight with Norwegian and nobody asked him to pay any fee for his hand lugagge. This is an abusive attitude from an non-serious flight company.

### "don't care about their clients"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Milan via Keflavik. WOW has the worst customer service ever seen. I was supposed to leave from Milan to go to Toronto on January 9th, and my flight was canceled. I called WOW in order to switch to another flight, and I had to check the flights myself because the person who was supposed to help me just wanted to refund me instead of finding another flight, or send me to Montreal, which is 600 km away from Toronto. When I asked what I was supposed to do to go from Montreal to Toronto, she said: find another flight. Since I insisted a lot, they found (or better, I found) a flight on January 4th. I was supposed to leave on January 4th to go from Milan to Toronto: the plane was supposed to leave at 9.30 am, ad it was delayed at 8.30 pm. I called WOW in order to understand when my next flight (from Iceland to Toronto) would be, and none was able to tell me for sure what would have happened: they insisted that I would go to Iceland first and then understand from there. I bought another flight. So, don't fly with WOW, when something happens they are just not able to help you in any way, they do not communicate well and they don't care about their clients.

### "super garbage airline"
Toronto to Delhi via Keflavik. Horrible don't buy and save your time. I bought this flight since it was at a decent price. The flight departed 2 hours late all the passenger were carried to aircraft by bus. You can only carry hand bag 12kg and 1 check in 20kg. Aircraft was so small dont even have charging plugs. Keflavik  airport is so small you wont find any US based charging slots the USB ports dont work. You need to pay for everything even a for water, everything i eat i had to pay. They canceled my return flight that was on 14 and asked me to call them. I called them and managed to get it on 13th then few days later they sent me another email that they have cancelled the 13th flight as well and refunded me that half of the ticket as WOW air dont have any flight running for the whole month. WOW air is super garbage airline.

### "a horrible first impression"
On December 29th 2018 a friend and I were flying from Newark to Keflavík. We didn't hear the calls to board and lost track of time while we were eating, we admit fault to this. When we realized our flight was boarding, we ran to the gate. They representatives at the gate were the nastiest I've ever seen. They were talking to us like we were stupid for an honest mistake. They were making us feel so bad, telling us how everyone was waiting for us (which clearly we felt bad about enough) and how selfish we were, even threatening to not let us get on the flight when I snapped back at one of them. First of all, we knew we messed up. But as a customer service representative, it isn't your job to scold us like we're children. It was a horrible first impression of the airline.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Munich via Keflavik. Absolutely terrible. They sigificantly overbooked the flight. More importantly, they offered no information about options except a phone number that put you on hold for 30 minutes. After finally getting through, you are speaking with a call centre in India that had no information about the flight. Customer experience was all downhill from there. Worst experience ever. I will never fly with them again. One star is too many for a flight that never happened.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Baltimore to Paris via Keflavik. Do not fly with this airline! They categorically refuse to honor claims, even when the delay (and mine ended up being 30 hours, because of the infrequency of their flights!) is due to their maintenance issue. Not to mention by the time they finish nickle-and-diming you, you could have flown in comfort with amenities on a "regular" airline. Shudder. Terrible experience. I'm not giving a "0" because I did, after all, arrive safely.

### "an unpleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Copenhagen via Reykjavik. I recently flew with Wow and had an unpleasant experience. I booked for a big seat and they cancelled one of the legs for the return journey where they replaced the big seats with normal seats. They overbook the route and just say "sorry for the inconvenience". They refunded ~$32 as part of the whole inconvenience caused. This is totally unacceptable. Please be cautious when choosing WOW air.

### "I do not recommend WOW."
This is my first time with WOW, when I saw the $500 fare I checked out reviews and thought it looked fine. I don’t mind no meal on a flight, not really a fan of airplane food anyway. I thought the connection seemed tight but it was what WOW advertised. So the flight out of Chicago was delayed. No reason was shared, no real info, it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. They will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the air”. Well that was a lie, don’t announce things that aren’t true. So once we got inside the airport multiple connecting flights were missed so there was a line 30-40 people long with 1 only, 1 WOW employee giving directions. Really WOW, you couldn’t do anything to assist all the passengers at that point? So after waiting 20-30 minutes in the line the lady tells me follow the arrivals signs and an agent will be waiting to direct you. Was there an agent, absolutely not. But I did find about 7 other passengers who were on the same connecting flight all wondering around lost wondering what was going on. We were able to piece together some info a few of us received different emails from WOW giving different info. By sharing with each other we realized we could book an airport hotel and they rebooked us on flights the next day. But not one of us had complete info and only by talking to each other could we piece this together. Finally after over an hour someone who worked at the airport, not WOW, got someone from WOW to speak to us and get a bus to take us to the hotel. We were told be ready for a bus to arrive by 3.30am in the morning to take us to the airport. Was there a bus nope, no bus. There were way more WOW stranded passengers at the hotel who arrived after us. The hotel called their shuttle service to come at 4am and take a huge bus full of all the passengers WOW stranded in Iceland and then again at the hotel. Huge thanks to Airport B&B. Now the rebooked flight is delayed, by how much who knows. Will we ever get to Berlin, who knows. Zero trust in WOW and not booking with them again, oh and that $500 fare ended up being $775 with seats and carry-on luggage. So if you care about getting to your destination in a timely manor and communication when things go wrong, I do not recommend WOW.

### "not honour seating selection"
Baltimore to Gatwick via Keflavik. Be aware, if you choose to book premium seating and change your flight, after paying the penalty fee for changing flights, WOW air will not honour your previous seating selection, even if it was prepaid on your previous booking.

### "very unpleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Berlin via Keflavik. I had a very unpleasant experience with WOW air. They first decided to change the aircraft type on the route from LAX to KEF which resulted in us having to land to refuel in Canada (+1 hour to a 9-hour flight). Then our prolonged flight got they delayed by another hour, and finally placed me into an aisle seat next to the lavatory in the very back of the cabin even though I paid for the reservation of a window seat in the first 10 rows. They also refused to refund me the seat selection price even though I effectively got placed to a random seat (which is their default free option). In addition to this, the ground staff and their call center specialists are rude and unhelpful and there is no entertainment of any sort even on the long-haul flights.

### "made the stupidest mistake"
Los Angeles to Copenhagen via Reykjavik. I’ve made the stupidest mistake of booking with Wow for the second time - first time I booked, made a mistake, called 1 minute later and even though i just wanted to change the flight to another wow air flight, I had to purchase an entirely new ticket. This time, I’m supposed to fly on the 20th December with a two hour layover in Reykjavik. I get a text 3 days before my flight saying that they’ve had unforeseen circumstances and that i’m going to fly on the 19th of December instead. This means that i will have 16 hours of layover instead. I can see that there is a flight from Reykjavik to Copenhagen on the 20th of December that would allow me fewer hours of layover but because my flight is from Lax to Copenhagen, with a layover in Reykjavik, they cant just change my second flight to reduce my layover. It is absolutely insane how inflexible the customer service for this airline is. Oh and you thought that i would get some type of compensation for this inconvenience? $0. Actually i have to pay for this mistake because i am missing an extra day of work.

### "the worst airline ever"
Rekjavik to Amsterdam. This is the worst airline ever. The flight was delayed over an hour on the way to Iceland which made us super late to our appointment on the island. I forgot to take my travel sickness tablet and the flight attendants refused to give me water and asked me to pay for it when the flight took off. Luckily the person sitting next to me offered to give me water. On the way home there was only a 20 minute delay however baggage claim took over an hour to get which made us miss our next flight. We were not able to check in our luggage for our next flight as we had 30 minutes left and the flight was already boarding passengers. Because of this we had to book a new flight to get back home. We were stranded at the airport.

### "no respect for nothing"
Paris to Montreal via Keflavik. I had never ever seen an airline like this. It’s been 7 months that I’ve been waiting for my 900$ compensation for a cancelled flight. I was stuck in Iceland for 24h. They keep telling me the payment is in process, but they are never paying me. It’s in process since 5 months. No respect for the aerial transporters european laws, no respect for the clients, no respect for nothing! Never book a flight with them.

### "WOW air is the worst of all"
Toronto to Delhi via Reykjavík. I fly regularly every 6 months and tried many airlines but WOW air is the worst of all. When you look online the price would be very low and when you go to booking they keep adding price for seats and baggage (I had to pay $113 for 12kg check in luggage and $65 for carry on luggage). In the end it cost me as much as any other airlines. And you have to buy food and even water and no entertainment on 10 hour long flight. It was raining in Keflavik airport and they took us to the plane in a bus and we have to walk and climb the stairs in rain and cold. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. You think it is cheap and yes it is very cheap airline,s but at the price of any good airlines.

### "much better than I expected"
Pittsburgh to Paris via Keflavik. The flight was much better than I expected. My original flight got cancelled, but I was given the chance to be reimbursed or to select another flight (this was about 2 ~ 3 weeks before the departure date), I chose to travel on a different date, and all was fine. The seats were ok, not smaller than usual now-a-days and also not uncomfortable. I was well aware that everything was paid for, so I brought food and water onboard, which is what I usually do anyway. I had a checked in suitcase, a carry-on backpack and a plastic bag for my snacks, I had no problem whatsoever with these. The flight to Paris was delayed by about half an hour, which they claimed was because we were to wait for passengers from another delayed flight. I can’t complain, I would have liked them to do this for me as well, if I were in their position. Overall, I think the airline is good. It is very cheap, and you get what you paid for. I understand many people complaining and I am sorry that they had such bad experiences, but to be fair, I’ve also experienced some terrible things from more expensive airlines as well.

### "worst airline in the world"
Los Angeles to Frankfurt via Keflavik. This is the worst airline in the world. Plane was late 5 hrs. Give you 5$ for food at the airport for a 9hr flight. From five hours turned out to be one day in Reykjavik due to cancellation of the flight,no food or water provided. For hot water they wanted to charge me. After the one day delay, the next plane arrived 11hr late at the destination. I missed my flight. They said they can do nothing about it- "sorry have a great flight" . Had to spent another 300 Euro to buy ticket for the missed flight myself and find my own accommodation in Germany. After placing complaint online - automatic response. On the second flight to my destination from Reykjavik they charged me 70 euro. I have no CC so they told me I have to come up with exact cash, cause they dont have change. I had to run around the Airport to see if some place would give me change Otherwise I am not allowed on the plane. The lady who sold me the ticket, before me getting on the plane - asked me if I paid for the ticket. If you need anything you gotta call India - customer service cause WOW doesn't have headquarters anywhere not even in Iceland. When you call they tell you - I'm sorry we have to follow the rules you can place a complaint.

### "fight to get my money back"
Chicago to Frankfurt via Keflavik. We have a big delay from more then 2 hours. I miss my connection flight to Frankfurt. Wow air not give us any food or even a water. The put us in an old hotel. No information and only “you can open a claim to us” in the service hotline. I spend more the 50$ only for phone calls to wow. Don’t book this airline. I booked ana xxl seat and get downgrade to row 29 and must now fight with Wow air to get my money back.

### "flight conditions are unacceptable"
Frankfurt to Los Angeles via Reykyavik. It's a pity that there is no option to give you zero stars because the flight conditions are fully unacceptable. You cannot perform 9 hour flight from Reykjavik to Los Angeles without offering your passengers even one cup of free water. Your name meets well to your passengers experience. What if the credit card is not working and I don't have cash with me? I can understand that prices are sometimes cheaper than competitors, but passengers have to be informed about this condition before the flight. It was my first and last flight with wow air.

### "Zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Newark to Keflavik. My daughter and 2 friends traveled to Iceland for a week vacation. Wow airlines left their luggage behind. So the first 24 hours with no luggage. Next day the luggage landed in Reykjavik. They had rented a car and were already on their way to the golden circle. If you’ve been there you know their are no stores to buy what they needed without spending an exorbitant amount. WOW air assured them they would get their luggage to them and the girls gave their itinerary. Every day they called and every day a driver never showed up. Excuses, excuses etc. Imagine spending all this $ to go to Iceland and have No boots, gloves, hats, no warm clothes. It was terrible. Some friends of theirs flew in on day 6 and picked their luggage up at the airport which was apparently sitting for 6 days! They went home the next day. Wow was sent all the correct paperwork. No response month after month. They even had the nerve to charge them luggage fees. Zero customer service, never saw anything like this. Do not fly this terrible airline.If you do, wear everything you need or you will be left out in the cold like these poor girls were!

### "I had booked with my nickname"
Baltimore to Paris via Reykjavik. Wow denied me access to this flight because I had booked with my nickname. I fly several times per year and have never had this issue before. Today they decided to use this as an excuse to not allow me to board. I arrived early to the airport and there was plenty of time to think of a solution but they offered no assistance. $30 refund for a $300 ticket and they're telling me to just buy a new ticket. I was a loyal customer for years, since they opened. I didn't mind paying for snacks on board, the outrageous $80 fee for checked luggage (compare to $40 for the average low cost), or even the small seats and tiny tables. But here they could have made an easy fix, and they chose not to. They will change their policies on you if they see any opportunity to get some money from you. I wanted my overall rating to be 0 but the website doesn't allow me to go below 1.

### "overall I am happy"
Keflavik to Montreal. I was dreading this trip after reading reviews, but want to give credit where it's due. I paid for a "Big Seat" which came in around £140 for both legs of the journey and good value in my opinion. Easily the most comfortable budget long haul that I've done. Plane in Reykjavik had a problem after we boarded but they had us off and loaded to another in around an hour. Staff seemed perfectly friendly to me. I followed their luggage rules to the letter given all the bad reviews! I fly twice a week with SAS who charge as much as I paid for this trip to go from Manchester to Copenhagen and their service is absolutely no better at all. So overall I am happy. Just book the big seats!

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Absolutely the worst airline ever. They charge for everything, including carry-on bags—you can’t even get a glass of water on the flight. And ALL of these extra costs are grossly inflated. Trust me, this ticket may seem like a good deal, but once you have paid all of the extra fees this is just an overpriced airline with horrible service. No food, no water, no carry-on, no WiFi, no entertainment, dirty bathrooms, rude staff. I would never use this airline again, and I recommend you avoid it.

### "Not recommended at all"
Not Verified |  New York to Berlin via Reykyavik. Not recommended at all. Sorry for not reading other reviews before buying the air tickets. If possible, the overall rating would be zero stars. The ground staff is not nice. Space for legs on the aircraft is very limited (moreover considering the length of our flight). Every service is extra paid (which I was aware of) but the quality was not worth the money. The personal luggage I wanted to bring onboard was 1cm over limit and I was charged extra 70USD. On 6 hour flight, the staff come once to offer drinks/food and once to offer Icelandic souvenirs.

### "Absolutely horrible service"
Amsterdam to Toronto via Keflavik. Absolutely horrible service. Only those with a payment card they approve may eat or drink, even water. Heaven forbid you should be using the card belong to your wife or husband, they will accuse you of committing fraud. Kids playing tag on they plane while in the air while the attendants do or say nothing. The attendants had several family members on board who were seemingly allowed to enter areas where only crew and pilots should be. They switched my seats without my knowledge.

### "not worth the savings"
Chicago to Paris via Keflavik. Our trip to Paris was wonderful, but we were continually shocked by the lack of service and overall rudeness of the WOW air staff and those at Reykjavik airport. The airport is far too small, is laid out in a very confusing way, and is filled with staff that doesn't know what they are doing and isn't interested in helping people find flights, get information, and transition smoothly. the fare was cheap, but it meant smaller than small seats (and I, as a tall man, had absolutely no room and didn't sleep on an overnight flight because if it), Absolutely no food or water (water is for sale at a ridiculous premium), and rude staff. The WOW air staff seems to have no problem with yelling at passengers to get out of the aisle or sit down, and they either have not been trained on how to handle a gate check or find it helpful to have the people mob the ticket counter rather than line up according to group. I write this to warn anyone flying to Europe to avoid connecting in Iceland or using WOW air; it is not worth the savings.

### "Zero customer service"
Reykjavik to San Francisco. Worst airlines I have taken in my life. Zero customer service and very rude staff. They have no consideration for the customers, they treat them like trash and/or second class citizens

### "Disappointed in the service"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Berlin via Keflavik. Disappointed in the service. There is a policy of no returns or cancellations so even though I called an hour prior to my flight leaving I was told I couldn’t refund or exchange even my return ticket. Inflexible, representatives didn’t explain options and I ended up losing a flight because my service representative didn’t understand my request to hold a flight over the phone.

### "good if you travel with a backpack"
London to Toronto via Reykjavik. I have flown Wow many times (more than a dozen) and have no problem with flying with them. However, this is the first time I have checked my bags. What a hassle. Firstly, what I paid for the bag, when added to the flight would have gotten me on a better airline which included checked bags. Secondly, I checked in 24 hours before the flight but, couldn’t check my bag until 3 hours before the flight, which meant I had to stay in the airport lobby for 8 hours, I couldn’t go to the departures area until the bag was checked in. I have checked in bags in Turkey, Hong Kong, and London , sooner than 3 hours before a flight. Surely Wow is as advanced as Air Asia and Turkish Airlines, and I didn’t have to pay for the bag. If you are going to charge almost as much for a bag as the flight you have to offer convenience and service. Only good if you travel with a backpack.

### "Absolutely worth it"
Brussels to Baltimore via Keflavik. Book this airline from their website and avoid the nasty surprises. There are several levels of ticket class, and many of them include checked bags and extra legroom at a fraction of the cost of buying it at the airport. This is a no frills airline, but my ticket was half price of other carriers, so I am OK paying for water, food, and internet separately or bringing what I need. Absolutely worth it. Don't book through a travel site offering super low prices, or you will be met with hefty fees for everything. Book through their website, and it lets you know what to expect.

### "point A to point B for cheap"
Paris to Chicago via Keflavik. I have used wow twice and they have not failed me. Seats can be uncomfortable but I paid $430 for a Trans Atlantic flight. What can I expect? The service is actually pretty good. I always check in from my phone. Flight attendants are nice. I order food onboard when I'm hungry and it's not bad (+$10). Flight seats have chargers so I download Netflix movies on my phone and I'm good. WOW air is not the most comfortable airline but they take me from point A to point B for cheap (and so far on time). I recommend for students/cheap light travelers!

### "this is cheap and terrible"
Not Verified |  Edinburgh to St. Louis via Keflavik. Awful in every respect. Staff were rude. Seat pitch is totally unacceptable for transatlantic. Don’t take cash on board then give awful exchange rate. Flight late with no explanation. No facilities on board. Cheep and cheerful I hear, but this is cheap and terrible. Avoid at all costs.

### "never fly this airline again"
I will never fly this airline again. The ground service was horrible from London to Keflavik. When we checked in the person at the Wow counter to us we would have to pay for luggage which we thought we did but didn't keep the paper work so she said it wasn't her problem. Then she told us it wasn't her problem that we didn't read the website with all the fees. When we got inline to board the plane we realized that she put my spouse at the front of the plane and I was at the back. In the long run after paying an extra $360.00 just for two small carry on bags it is just not worth it. Also, on the 6 hour flight back we didn't have usb plugs to charge ipad or phone, no entertainment and crazy priced food and drinks. You couldn't even get water for free. Really check out other airlines as in the longer run the cheaper fairs will add up.

### "very disappointing incident"
Not Verified |  Copenhagen to Keflavik. I recently had a very disappointing incident concerning luggage with WOW. At the gate I together with quite a number of other passengers was charged round $US100 extra because my carry on case was marginally larger the the extremely small dimensions specified by WOW. As an international traveller, I can't possibly have a specially small case just to suit WOW. My case is on the small side if anything and to my knowledge acceptable to all reputable airlines. Having paid the excess, I was directed to go on board where of course my bag fitted perfectly into the overhead locker. No need to put it in the hold apparently. As someone who has run a business for over 40 years, I know that firms that pull cheap stunts like this are well down the highway to insolvency. Customer satisfaction and their recomendations are the backbone of a successful business. What else is going on? Think carefully before choosing your airline?

### "My nightmare with WOW"
Berlin to Cincinnati via Keflavik. My nightmare with WOW starts the 26/10/2018 at Berlin, not only because I was traveling for almost 2 days without any support from WOW air what so ever, but also because my bags are still lost somewhere between Berlin and San Francisco. It all start in Berlin when my flight to Keflavik was delayed by almost an hour, from 12.25 pm original time to 13.45. That meant that my connecting flight was almost impossible to reach. Before boarding, I got another email stating that my SFO flight was also delayed but only by 40 min (WW161 KEF-SFO 26OCT18 original time was 15.10 delayed to 15.50) Once landed in Keflavik it was imposible to reach my flight, even when my boarding to SFO was announced I was denied to cut line in customs by WOW personal. They stated that I had time. So when I lost my flight, I went to the WOW counter and was given the solution of flying to Cincinnati even when there was a flight from another airline to SFO that same day. The flight to Cincinnati was at 21.00 the same day. Also, they didn't give me a connection from Cincinnati to SFO, they stated that they where working on it and that we where going to get help by a WOW representative once we got to Cincinnati (other people where in the same position). This never happened, no WOW representative was there once we got of the plane, simply because WOW cease to exist in Cincinnati a few days ago. So, I never got a confirmation of a suppose connecting flight to SFO (some people did and others like me didn't. Their connection was from Cincinnati to Newark to SFO adding a 10 hour plus journey also there was a DELTA flight directly to SFO but was denied by WOW costumer service - I talked to WOW support to try to fix the situation but it was helpless, they even gave me a wrong booking number for my supposed connection, it was named to another person. Luckily I was helped by the United counter, an after an hour of back and forth, they could figure out what WOW messed up. Of course that I had lost my chance to get into the 6 am flight to Newark, so I had to wait for the Cincinnati- Denver 9.25 am flight, and then catch the Denver- SFO at 11.55 am local time (both of this flights where on United) And also, another layer to this nightmare, is that my bags are still lost. They never arrived to Cincinnati in the first place. So to summarize, I was traveling for almost 40 hours, with my bags still lost, and of course the total abandonment of WOW (no food vouchers, no personal, no nothing)

### "cheapest airline I've ever seen"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Toronto via Keflavik. They are the cheapest airline I've ever seen. You are charged for everything, baggage, carry on luggage, all food and you even have to pay for water on the flight, nothing is offered for free. On my first leg of the flight it felt like I was riding on a bus. There was one bathroom at the back of the plane for 30 rows X 6 seats per row. There actually was another "hidden" washroom but you would never know it was there if I didn't see one of the crew using it. Also when I checked in I had a minor spelling mistake in my name, an L instead of and I, and they wouldn't let me on the plane unless I paid 72 Euros, for the check in woman to change one letter. This was outrageous but I had no choice but to pay it. Be very very careful when you book a flight with this company as all the extra charges can end up being more than with a decent airline. Buyer beware and lets hope the consumer speaks and stops flying with this outfit. WOW is all I can say. They wont be around much longer.

### "paying for carry on luggage"
Copenhagen to Reykjavik. Absolutely disgusting behavior from the staff. Almost all the passengers were conned into "paying for their carry on luggage" at an almost 150% premium. The staff were just interested in making money rather than being helpful. It has to be the most disturbing experience of my flying life. I was threatened to be not allowed on the plane because I was discussing with my partner about the extortionate fees!

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Pittsburgh to Berlin via Keflavik. I was hesitant to fly WOW because of all the bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. There is not one thing that was bad about our flights. Every plane was on time and our baggage was there when we landed. No waiting at all. Check in was very easy and the attendants were very helpful since this was my first time flying overseas. The flight attendants were extremely nice and very professional. The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room. They are a no frill airline but they do have onboard food and drink service that you can pay by credit card.

### "Would never recommend"
Paris to Chicago via Keflavik. Terrible check in even though we had premium seats. Had to board connecting plane plane in Iceland on the airfield using roll out steps. Night time and was cold and open to the weather. Due to weather we had a three hour delay near Chicago but were not told the reason for hours later and they did not keep us appraised of what was happening. No TV on a seven hour trip in order to watch a movie. Would never recommend or fly WOW again. Flew to Europe on another low cost airline and had a great trip.

### "Appalling company"
London to Los Angeles via Keflavik. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. After cancelling my flight I had to call them & fight for 45 mins to get a refund! 2 weeks later I still don’t have my money back despite chasing daily! Appalling company.

### "I have no complaints"
St. Louis to Gatwick via Keflavik. Wow air is a fantastic airline as long as your expectations are accurate from the get go. If you want to fly USA - Europe for $200 but expect in seat entertainment, cushy padded chairs, and complimentary food and drinks, you're dreaming. The seats compare to a domestic flight, slightly padded, and a bit uncomfy after a while. But I have no complaints about WOW Air. We flew with a backpack only so can't comment on luggage handling. In flight experience was great, I brought my kindle and slept/read the entire time - got my own food and drink at the airport, and had a wonderful trip.

### "extremely disrespectful"
Frankfurt to Los Angeles via Keflavik. Baggage arrived a week later on our California tour. WOW-Air does not pay! During our 23-day individually planned US tour, my baggage did not arrive in Los Angeles or could only be delivered to Los Angeles seven days later. This was, according to the airline Wow-Air in Boston. In this baggage were all my clothes and all the cosmetics of both of us. This led to significant disabilities and rescheduling of the individually planned round trip. WOW-Air offered me instead of the required € 763 (expenses for clothes, cosmetics, medicine, contact lenses, increased fuel costs and parking fees) only a lump sum of $25 per day. This is €137 and is just a fraction of the cost we had in addition. In doing so, you plead that I can continue to use the newly purchased clothes and cosmetics at home. This is logically not possible, becaus many cosmetics in the end was duplicated and could not be taken home for space and weight reasons. In addition, all these purchases would not have been necessary if my suitcase had arrived properly. In USA you have to visit an eye specialist for new lenses. Even the eye specialist costs in the amount of 100€ were not considered. In addition, 13 calls were required to receive the case after a week in Los Angeles. I submitted a screenshot of it. But this cost assumption is denied. Just the detour from Death Valley to Los Angeles Airport cost us a whole day and is ignored by WOW-Air. WOW-Air employees are consciously playing against each other and sticking to their delay strategy. I have already sent a lot of information and evidence twice, but they continue to be ignored. The way in which a paying passenger is handled here is extremely disrespectful. It becomes clear that WOW-Air is not interested in a fair solution to the problem. Nor are you interested in customer satisfaction. This was our first and will have been our last flight with this airline.

### "Cheapest flight I found"
Pittsburgh to Copenhagen via Keflavik. They delivered me to my destination and back, with no hassle. I made sure to pay for my luggage as I was buying my ticket online, so as not to have unpleasant surprises at the airport. There are no frills, just a seat on an airplane. They were fast at check-in. Cheapest flight I found.

### "two flights and two lost suitcases"
WOW" as in two flights and two lost suitcases. (They will say it is "Delayed", but when they don't know where it is, that is lost to me). No entertainment systems on intercontinental flights? Not even coffee included in the ticket price? I'd like to be positive about something, but all this has done is tell me I will happily pay a little more for a flight that is on-time, with my suitcases, and a lot more comfortable.

### "They rip you off"
Copenhagen to Toronto via Keflavik. The worst company When i came from states to Europe they didn't charge me for my personal item. But when I travelled from Europe to Toronto for the same personal item they charged me 100$. This is ridiculous with the same personal small bag. I will never fly with this company again. They rip you off.

### "a competitive price"
Keflavik to Baltimore. Long flight with comfortable seats and basic services. No entertainment system! Easy short transit in KEF. Wish it were longer since there were lots of food and shopping outlets that looked good. I did manage to have a quick meal because I didn't pre-order an in-flight meal and purchased local chocolate (highly recommend). Flight attendants should make more effort to smile. I thought this was a competitive price for a last minute purchase.

### "Good value flight"
Berlin to Keflavik. Good value flight, with on time departure. Basic services yet comfortable seats. Did not purchase food on board since I got my own from SXF. No entertainment system! Flight attendants are dry and should try to be more friendly!

### "found my experience pretty good"
Detroit to Copenhagen via Keflavik. I was a little reluctant to travel with Wow air after reading the many negative reviews. However I have to say I found my experience with Wow pretty good. While for sure it is a no frills low cost airline, I have to say it is fairly good value for money. I flew from DTW to CPH via KEF, I found the ground staff, cabin crew and all other contact personnel very efficient, approachable and polite. Both aircraft I flew with were modern A-321s. While the seats were not the most comfortable, and in the basic seat the legroom was fairly tight they did recline a little and there were power sockets/USD points at each seat. Selection of drinks and snacks which were available for purchase was also quite good. I would not hesitate to fly Wow again and would quite happily recommend them to others.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
After hearing horror stories U was concerned about my journey with WOW and how it would be, but was pleasantly surprised. The flight was uneventful with even more space between seats than some budget airlines I've experienced eg JQ. Staff pleasant and food to buy. (I bring my own). Paid for large carry on and seat. I did do a name change in advance to include my middle name, because I'd heard stories of pax denied boarding. The only thing I didn't like about the flight was that they didn't dim the lights in the cabin for the entire journey. I would use them again if it was cheap and you lower your expectations.

### "our bad experience"
Not Verified |  Baltimore to Milan via Keflavik. To all travel friends, this is our bad experience flying with WOW air. First about carry on personal bag carries need pay 65 Euro. No  water given free in 8-9 hours international fly. Everything you need pay for that. And always sales on the air plane was distributed. No flying with WOW air more for me and family. The first and the last.

### "upset with our experience"
Chicago to Paris via Reykjavík. My husband and I flew this airline for our honeymoon to Paris. To say we were unimpressed would be an understatement. First off, I was unable to add any baggage to my reservation to fly out of Chicago to Paris, because of this we were charged almost $300 at the airport because we were not even allowed a carry on bag. We travel often and this is not the case with any other airline we have used. If we would have known this we would have packed accordingly. There is not much you can do about this besides pay the money when you are at the airport. Then we find out there is not free in flight entertainment, like the other airlines we have flown overseas. Also, the seats were so crammed together my husbands knees were hitting the seat in front of us the whole time. He could not even put his tray down if he wanted to because of this. Why didn't we pay for extra leg room you ask? Well because we have not had this problem on any other flight we have flown. Then on the way back from Paris I was able to add luggage to our reservation but again, like most airlines, we expected the weight limit to be 23kg per bag. No. It was only 20kg so we had to pull things out of our suitcase to get the weight down. Additionally,the lady checking us in was very rude and was talking about us in French with a very unpleasant look on her face. I am not fluent in French but body language says more than words. The check in attendant also first said that it would cost 10$ per kg over 20 and then after we took some things out she said it was 15$ because we needed to go to Chicago. Well of coarse we needed our bags to go all the way home. I also would  point out that whether our bags were under the plane or in the cabin, there is still the same amount of weight on the plane. Making us open all our luggage to save money in the airport is ridiculous. We were already frustrated and her changing information and being very rude and unprofessional did not help matters. We ended up paying $400 to get our luggage back on top of the $300 that we payed on the way there. This is the price of an extra airline ticket. This being said, we could have flown with ANY other airline and not have dealt with all the inconveniences. We are very upset with our flight experience on this trip. We are frequent travelers and so are many members of our family and because of this experience we are unable to say any kind words about your airline.

### "had to pay or we could not fly"
Amsterdam to Detroit via Keflavik. This is not a complaint about the lack of free meals or in-flight entertainment. I know how so-called low cost airlines operate and have never had a problem with any of them until my partner and I tried to fly WOW for the first (and last) time. This is a complaint about the treatment we received and the fees we were charged at the gate of our flight WW447 AMS-KEF, on the date of September 3 at AMS (Schiphol) airport. We booked our WOW air flights months in advance of our flight measured our bags, which fit perfectly within the very restrictive WOW measurements. We have photographs to prove that the bags fit into the bags measurement frame placed at WOW gates. Prior to our flight we checked in online and received boarding passes into email, that was not a problem. However, at the gate of our flight from AMS to KEF we were stopped impolitely by an individual from WOW ground personnel, who started insisting that our bags were carry-ons just because they had 2 wheels, and that we had to pay in order to get them on the plane. She would not even look at my original ticket, where the definition of included luggage only showed dimensions and had in no way specified that included luggage could not have wheels. She never measured the bags, nor weighed them, nothing, just insisted that "wheels" cannot be placed under seats due to "safety. This individual further refused to provide her name and also prohibited me from taking a photo of her ID for evidence, repeating multiple times that it is not allowed. Every question I tried to ask she dismissed with It is not allowed, to the point that I felt I was talking to a robot. I tried to show her the original ticket on my phone, but she refused to have any human communication or reasoning with me, and kept repeating it is not allowed. When I asked to see a supervisor, she replied, it is not allowed to have a supervisor, after which she moved us to the side and said we were not getting on the flight at all. We had to wait until the entire plane was boarded, when she sent a colleague of hers, who likewise insisted that our small bags were trolleys and were not allowed on the flight for free due to safety. I tried to explain that my original ticket showed no such prohibition whatsoever, but she insisted we had to pay or we could not fly. We absolutely felt blackmailed, humiliated and ended up profoundly disturbed They charged us 160 Euro for our two bags, as we were taking a connect flight to Detroit later that afternoon from Reykjavik, and only then were we allowed to board the flight. Once we paid, however, we were told that we could place our bags wherever we chose, and when I said that the entire affair was not about safety but about paying, they had no response, because this is what it was all about – extorting money from travelers. If the company wants to prohibit the use of wheeled luggage, it must define the included luggage as such excluding wheels, otherwise am free to interpret the shape or pattern of the luggage freely, as long as it complies with the measurements, which it did. Customer service? Non-existent.

### "luggage however did not arrive"
We flew from Amsterdam Schiphol to Keflavik and we stayed in Iceland one week. Our luggage however did not arrive with the same flight to our destination and in fact never made it to Iceland. It was sent to us 8 days later and only when we contacted airport staff. The staff of WOW apparently could not do what we did 1 day after our arrival in the Netherlands in order to find our luggage so we ended up with no personal items for a week. Instead they did whatever was possible in order not to find our luggage. They filed it as yellow while we told them it was red, they put the wrong contact information in their online system and they customer service people were asking for the same information regarding the luggage every time we called for the status. Apart from that the plane seats were quite uncomfortable and everything served during the flight was overpriced.

### "definitely not recommend"
Dallas to Frankfurt via Keflavik. I had the worst travel experience with this airline. On a long distance flight there was nothing provided, not even a glass of water. The seats are very uncomfortable and you won’t find any blankets and pillows. The prices are low but for long distances definitely not recommend. And I am used to very low standards of comfort while traveling! !

### "wasn't bad at all"
Toronto to Paris CDG via Keflavik. I flew yesterday and it wasn't a bad flight. I had no issues. They're a low-cost airline. You get what you expect and what you paid for. Our flight wasn't late, the flight attendants were friendly, the pilots were friendly (we took a photo with them for my daughter's first flight), it wasn't bad at all.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Kevlavik. WOW Air is the worst airline someone could fly. Unfortunately the ticket price looked so attractive that we booked the flight. When we checked in, we had to pay an additional $180 dollars for two carry ones and a checked bag. This is more than we have paid for the ticket. I’m beyond frustrated and will make sure to never ever fly with Wow Air.

### "never fly with Wow again"
Edinburgh to Los Angeles via Reykjavik. The Wow Air employee who checked me in at the airport withheld my passport when I wanted to step aside and explore other options for bag check. I had to demand it three times before he handed it back to me. He was rude and completely out of line. I emailed the airline about the employee's behavior and received an automated message, thanking me for my feedback. As for my in-flight experience, Wow's impossibly low standards continued. They do not give complimentary water on the plane, the USB charging stations in the seats were broken, the bathrooms were dirty, there was no option for entertainment and the seats were very uncomfortable with exposed scratchy velcro on the headrests. I am appalled at what this airline deems acceptable service. I would never fly with Wow again, not for any price.

### "Terrible experience"
Recently we booked a flight through Cheapoair two weeks prior to returning to NY from Berlin. I certainly did not get a bargain but at the time was the only trip that was going to be the least lengthly in comparison to the available options. I paid full premium price for probably tickets that may have been a bargain. WOW customer service is in India and I had a terrible time getting accurate information. There is no onboard wifi, TV screens, no snacks, no meals (unless you buy) you must pay for checked luggage. Anything you may get a courtesy from other airlines you pay a high premium with WOW. So bring your own food and entertainment or you will starve and stare at the back seat of the person in front of view. I had a 9 hour flight so I broke down and rented an Ipad that only lasted four hours before the battery ran out and to boot there are no chargers on board. Terrible experience I do not recommended.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Reykjavik. Worst airline ever. we had previously paid for our checked bag and carry oms prior to and when arriving at the check in gate the lady at the desk continues to try and charge us for uneccesary things. At one point she said we had to pay for our carry ons making us shove things in our luggage and pay an extra 75$ stating we had no choice and that if we didn't pay we would not be getting on our flight even after we showed her our papers. We have documents stating that we had paid for everything yet we were double charged. And because she made us stuff our bags in our checked luggage we had to buy extra things at the airport.

### "not there on time"
We were abandoned in Iceland even though we were in the airport 3hrs before departure and 1 hour at departure gate. Our parents managed to get on the bus to the plane but due to the many lines for different planes all happening at the same time. No call outs on the tannoy, no attempt to grab us out of the line, we were only a few metres from the desk! We just assumed everyone in front of us was still getting on the plane and there would be another bus coming for us all. We weren't the only ones that didn't get on either. We filed a complaint straight away and waited 19 months for a reply which basically said tough luck. Wow air clearly didn't even read our complaint as all they replied was it's our fault because we were not there on time. Our parents were in front of us and they got on the flight. I was emailing them regularly to remind them to reply to our complaint but was always ignored. The airport then closed for the night and we had no where to go. We had to organised new flights with Norwegian and had to find a hotel for the night.

### "customer service is inept"
Berlin to San Francisco via Keflavik. Never, ever fly WOW air. Their customer service is inept to non-existent. One of our bags was lost en route to SFO – it’s been 15 days and they still haven’t located it. 15! Not only that: we have yet to receive any response aside from automated messages that start with stock lines like “we love getting emails and have a team of email-loving experts going over your request.” Be certain, they do not. And every message refers you to a new, different, equally useless address; it’s like Kafka with bots.

### "it is worth it"
Los Angeles to Keflavik. They are a budget airline which does mean you have to pay for food, water, seat reservations, and bags, but this means you get a low fare. You do get what you pay for. The flight attendants are nice and helpful. You get a huge amount of legroom for a budget airline- and I am 6' 2, but in exchange for the legroom, the seats are thinner and less padded. Flight was delayed leaving LAX but arrived in KEF on time. I have flown Wow on a total of 5 flights and I have never had a problem. The food on the flight is ok but not great. I recommend picking something up in the airport and eating it on the plane. The water is also expensive and small so pick some up in the airport (the Icelandic water is cheaper in KEF airport duty free too). There are NO tvs or inflight entertainment so download something on netflix, sleep or bring a book or other activity. There is also NO wifi. While most things I said are negative I paid so little for my flight, it is worth it. I would fly them again.

### "Avoid WOW air"
Milan to Cleveland via Keflavik. They think they are cheap, but they are not. You will end up paying more with other fees, like luggage and for the food on the plane. Their aircraft are basic and no TV. They will change your seat number at check in even if you have selected online. They sale the food 5 times the real price, like 99 cent noodle sup for 5 euro. Not comfortable at all. If you do the calculation right,you do not need to fly with them. Wow air has its destinations with a stop in Keflavik airport in Iceland, where you have to wait long hours and deal with rude airport staff and the most expensive food in the planet. 10 dollars for a bowl of soup or 9 dollars for chicken tenders or 7 dollar capucino. Avoid WOW air and Iceland airport.

### "Expect flights to be late"
Tel-Aviv to Chicago via Keflavik. You can expect that you'll come to the destination. Expect the flights to be late. At least 30 mins late, but my last plane was 2 hours late. The flights are quite stable in being late, so usually being late for the same time. Eat just before flight and buy a bottle of water just before flight. Usually you can do this in airport just before flight, but if late-evening flight (after 22:00), then it make sense to eat before entering airport. 3. Come to Wow air registration anyway (even if you printed boarding passes in advance), so they would print new boarding passes for you. This can prevent some issues. Do not rely on anything to be on-time. For example, I bought 12:30 Gold Ring tour on plane (being sure that flight arrives at 11:00 and then enough time to be at 12:30 to BSI-terminal for taking this tour), but actually plane arrived at 11:12AM and then bus arrived at 12:34, so I was 4 mins late for the tour (and I've seen the tour bus going away trying wave my hands to driver, but it didn't help). As result, lost the 60USD ticket for tour and didn't see Gold Ring that I wanted during flight connections. Better to take rent-car after the flight (because even if flight 2 hours late, you could still take rent car, but this doesn't apply to buses or even could be worse if next-connection-other-companies-flight). This is not about Wow air, but just about Keflavik airport flight-connections during night. During my way back, I had a night in airport. I didn't reserve any hotel. I had a boarding pass in advance and did some walking in Reykjavik during day-time (latest Flybus from BSI-terminal to airport at 20:00), so first I did some walking around outside airport during the evening and then entered at 23:30 the boarding zone without any problems. Then slept about from 00:15 to 4:30. The border (for zone D) closed during night hours, but still if having boarding pass, then can sleep somewhere in zone C just before border. There are no special places to sleep, but if you can sleep both sitting, then it is Ok. The good news that Wow air not so strict on baggage size. The limit is 42x32x25cm for free of charge baggage item, but during my flight back I used school bag with exactly these sizes (and with much inside it could be even 43x33x30cm), and this still was Ok. Used USB charger during the flight well.

### "luggage into the measuring stand"
I was travelling from Baltimore to London via Keflavik on the 18th Aug 2018. I was waiting in the queue for almost 45 min and was noticing what was going on at the check in counters. When we went for check in, first of all staff was not polite at all and she was very difficult with us. She made us put all our hand luggage into the measuring stand despite us telling her that these were checked on our arrival flight from London and are the same ones. Extremely disappointed. We spent almost £5000 on tickets with wow air and this is the treatment we get.

### "a huge risk flying this airline"
Los Angeles to Reykjavik. The only reason I considered this airline is because it was the only direct flight and they had "big seats," that we could upgrade to so I thought why not. We paid a lot extra to get the biggest seats, plus bags, meals etc. Well, the night before the flight, we check in and they have put us in standard seats with no extra legroom. They have four types of seats and they put us in the very smallest despite us paying several hundred dollars more per ticket for bigger seats. So, I call the customer service line and they just tell me that I will have to file a claim when I get back! So, my husband calls and they move our seats to what they say are bigger seats. Guess what? They were standard seats on the seat map. So, at that gate they start selling our seats that we already paid for as upgrades! So, my husband goes up and tries to find out why they are selling seats we already paid for and they just offer him some other seats that are supposedly XL but they are in the back of the plane. He says, we don't want seats that don't recline. They say they do recline. So, he agrees and they try to charge him again for an upgrade! Guess what? They are regular standard seats and they don't recline and for extra good measure the plug between the seats doesn't work on either row of seats that they put us in. This was on an overnight flight with my 8-year-old daughter. So, it comes to our return flight - same scenario. They put us in regular standard seats. We called the night before and my husband paid for another upgrade even though we already purchased their highest tier because he doesn't want to argue with them, we just wanted better seats. So, they move our seats, but when we get to the airport, they put us back in the regular standard seats! So, we spent the entire 3 hours at the airport trying to get better seats by talking to 3 different service desks, to no avail. We tell the crew when we get on the plane in case they have any extra decent seats and they offer us one free water. Plugs don't work on this flight either. Every single person we dealt with told us our seats were XL until I showed them the seat map and they will charge you for upgrades in seats that aren't upgrades at all. Everyone just said you'll have to file a claim. Guess what. When I filed a claim when we got back, they declined it and said that we had to contact customer service. Customer Service claimed that they don't deal with refunds. His message told me that I would have to go through an airline rights group. So, they basically tried to steal our money and make it as difficult as possible to get some of our money back. We never got our meals that we paid for or our seats. You are taking a huge risk flying this airline because even if they cancel your flight, you might not get your money back based on their customer service practices of denying legitimate claims. My only solace is that I already convinced two people not to fly this airline. I hope I can continue to convince.

### "know what you are getting into"
Tel Aviv to Chicago via Keflavik. Trying to balance the sometimes justified negative reviews. Clearly you must know exactly what you are getting into when you choose Wow. Do not use them if you cannot understand their rules, or if you really need to get somewhere at a certain time, or if you cannot deal with sitting in a full A321 for 6-7 hours, or if you can't deal with irregularities, or if you need a hot meal, IFE, etc. If that is not the case, it is hard to beat a mid-August one way TLV-ORD for $300. TLV-KEF left about 1.5 hours late, not good for those with tight connections. Oddly I noticed no checking at all of hand luggage size or weight either TLV-KEF or KEF-ORD. Full flight, but economy seating not much worse than other economy. Newish plane, very friendly flight staff. Very slow security at KEF. Nice small airport. KEF-ORD departed on time, landed early, taxied forever, and got to gate on time. Immigration in Chicago entirely different story. Global Entry not working, enormous line, skeleton staff. About an hour to get through.

### "bumped down two classes"
Saint Louis to Reykjavik. Being the first to book WOW Premium on our travel dates, we did not expect three family members to be bumped down two classes of service – from Premium to Basic – and the other two members to be bumped from Premium to Plus. But, that’s what happened two days before departure. How do I know we booked first? Because the seat schematic in premium class was completely empty when we bought tickets 8 months before departure and selected our seats. Plane change was given as the reason, but the real reason was that WOW reconfigured their seats and classes of service, and didn’t notify anyone – at least not us. So instead of re-assigning seats according to booking dates or giving you the option of selecting new seats based on an early-booking priority, we were evidently randomly selected to downgrade even though we would have re-booked different dates had we been given more than 48-hours’ notice. The same thing happened on the way home. We were again bumped to lower service levels. On the way to Iceland, we at least received a few of the Premium perks, including a “meal” that consisted of a 10-inch baguette with two deli-thin slices of ham. But, this time, we were asked to show our receipts to the flight attendants in order to receive the meal and two drinks – one hot and one cold. Yes, that’s right, one hot and one cold. And we were informed that if we wanted two cold drinks we would have to pay for one, even if we were to forego the hot drink. Our luggage arrived with us on the flight to Iceland. It also made it home, which we were happy to discover after a suspenseful, 40-minute wait at St. Louis’ baggage claim. Others weren’t so lucky. At least a half-dozen passengers mentioned that their luggage had been lost. Some on a non-stop flight; others on a connection through Reykjavik to and from Europe. One individual was on his way home after two weeks in Europe; he still hadn’t received his suitcase. Another person mentioned that her luggage never made it onboard the non-stop flight to Iceland. Then, when it did arrive, WOW refused to deliver the bags. They kept them at the airport until her week-long tour returned for the trip back to the States. Fly WOW if cost-savings are paramount and you’re willing to chance the service for the savings. Seats are really small, unless you upgrade. But, the planes are clean and the flight attendants smile a lot, even as they wish you an enjoyable, seven-hour flight in cramped conditions and charge you for a second 6-ounce can of ginger ale.

### "Worst airline ever!"
Baltimore to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Worst airline ever! We got stuck in Reykjavik on a base for 24hrs and then they flew us to Berlin instead of Frankfurt and provided a bus to bring us to FRA. We took the train and wanted to get our money reimbursed but they couldn’t even do that, worst airline ever do not book with them, it is cheap but you will regret it soon!

### "refused to reimburse us"
We flew from Boston to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Our tickets were approximately $1,300 per person round trip (expensive traveling in July). We checked in two bags at $70.00 per bag. When we arrived in the Netherlands on a Sunday one of the bags did not arrive. This bag contained everything for two people in our party. Our bag finally arrived shortly before midnight on Tuesday and we flew home on Saturday. So we were without our belongings for almost half of our visit. While WOW air reimbursed us $133.48 for purchases they refused to reimburse us for the $70.00 we paid to check in the "misplaced" bag. After multiple challenges, they held firm to their no baggage fee refund policy because our luggage was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.

### "Seats were incredibly cramped"
Berlin to Chicago via Keflavik. A pretty good airline that tries to be stylish and relatable to customers. The biggest problem everyone had with this airline is that they don't provide water on the flight, even if it is 7 hours long. You ask for water, they say you must buy a bottle for 3 euros. Seats were also incredibly cramped and uncomfortable. There are thankfully charging ports onboard so you can use your tablet.

### "terrible customer service"
Absolutely terrible customer service. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I arrived two hours before my flight (last of the day) and they had already abandoned the check in booth. The neighboring companies attempted to call them to come back for me but there was no answer to their paging. I then called the customer service line. I was treated with disrespect. The customer service can do nothing at all to help you and informed me I was late to my fight and had missed it and my money was just gone. I requested a spot on the next available flight and even offered to pay full price if they could still honor my charges for my bag and my meals. They said the only thing that they were able to do was refund me $40 in taxes. They openly admitted the flight had open seats but they were “greyed out” and couldn’t be filled. I have been sitting in JFK for 9 hours now. WOW air will not do anything. Will never be booking with this company again.

### "a lack of care from WOW"
Cincinnati to Edinburgh via Keflavik.Our baggage was missing when we arrived to Keflavik. We had plans to take a short walk to the bus stop, this was impossible due to the cold weather and our lack of appropriate clothes. We were not asked where our address will be and a multitude of appropriate questions that could have possibly helped with the recovery of our luggage. We were told to check in with the luggage office before our 6:50am flight.The office does not open until 8:30am, we left our hotel early and did not have time for breakfast. ( Our flight was moved to an earlier time.. We were not informed about this at all, on any type of communication platform. This caused us to be denied check in. The lady at check-in was abrupt and unwilling to check my pregnant wife in while I was at the (CLOSED) luggage office. As I returned from the luggage office to the check-in desk we were told check in for our flight was closed so I asked to speak with a supervisor who then rectified the situation by checking us in. Me and my wife (34 weeks pregnant) were given the option to hurry up to terminal D (7 min jog). No care, help or advice was offered. It was clearly explained that we were not informed of the flight time change and that my wife is pregnant. We actually asked ourselves to get in-front of people at the security check and when we arrived at gate. We were a total of 13 days without luggage. This is our first child and we were getting married on July 15th. Our wedding clothes and child birthing equipment were in the suitcases. WOW air have stated that we should have packed all essential clothing in our carry-on. We were told to go to Edinburgh airport to collect our bags, at our expense. One bag was still missing when we went to the airport and upon arrival the second bag was damaged. Customer service was really bad throughout the whole process. Calls to wow air were not helpful, some were put on hold, in the worst case we were on hold for 25 minutes and the deliberately disconnected when I asked to speak with a supervisor. Emails did not answer very simple questions. On our flight was a couple from Cincinnati who were traveling to Scotland for their honeymoon, this was the second time WOW air tried to get them to Keflavik. As we were not informed of the flight change and the couple were not on the Edinburgh flight on the 21st of June, it stands to reason they missed their flight due to a lack of care from WOW.

### "I can’t be upgraded"
Keflavik to Chicago. Traveling from Dublin to Iceland I was told that the flight was overbooked and I would have to wait until the very last person to board to see if they could “find me a seat.” Everyone was let on during normal boarding except me. Flying from Iceland to Chicago I asked to purchase a seat upgrade. The woman at the desk told me she was going to put me in an emergency row and “assumed” that I couldn’t perform the duties necessary because I’m pregnant. Wrong. She told me I should go speak with them at the gate to be upgraded. When I went to the gate, after being ignored for a few minutes while all the flight attendants gossiped, I’m told that the flight is full and I can’t be upgraded. There was about 2 minutes in between these encounters. Don’t assume someone has restrictions without asking. I asked them to show me the requirements and pregnancy and wasn’t a disqualifier.

### "No one was helpful at all"
Keflavik to Cincinnati. The night before we left for our trip I was checking in and noticed that there was only 1 seat reserved on the way home. I had purchased 2 seats and even picked them 3 months prior. I called and they said that only 1 had been reserved. I looked at my email that had 2 confirmed seats I had chosen based on a diagram of the plane. The seats were upgraded for extra legroom. He told me the seat I had picked wasn’t even a seat and asked why I picked it. Like I was the idiot. I responded with “ why did the diagram let me if it wasn’t a seat?  I also wanted to know why I hadn’t been informed. He was rude and told me that they could not accommodate my upgraded seats that I would now be in a standard seat and separated from my husband. He told me to just get a seat at the airport. I demanded he assign me a seat and send me confirmation. 45 minutes later got moved and confirmation. Day of checkin they sent me an email stating we would be in row 17. We check in and they gave us row 37. Last row. I was furious. What’s the point of picking certain seats 3 months in advance. The flight was 7 hours so I purposely picked comfortable seats ahead of time. I paid over 1600 for 2 seats. Not quite a bargain. So now I’m in the process of getting a refund and it’s a process. I guess they are hoping you will not follow through. I also repaid for a mean. I ordered a pizza. The package literally said child’s meal. Wasn’t cheap either. There were at least 15 people sitting and complaining about not being in the seats they paid for. I’m sure there were more. No one was helpful at all.

### "never felt more disrespected"
Last night my wife and I were supposed to travel from Los Angeles to Keflavik. Upon arriving at the terminal to drop off our bags, I was denied boarding for my international flight. I was told by the attendant that I could not travel because my valid passport was due to expire in late August. We were booked to be in Iceland only 4 days. The woman representing WOW was neither sympathetic, helpful, or apologetic, and told us it was WOW policy and there was nothing to be done. I asked to speak to someone in management and was denied. My issue is that I checked many websites about this before we left which all say Iceland is not on any list that has a limitation. My wife, and traveling companion, broke down in tears because she did not want to travel without me, and we were given a number to call for a refund. Upon calling this number, I was treated with irritation and hostility by a call center employee. I asked if we could get a refund or at least a credit towards a future flight, and was told they could not help me. We had a return flight from KEF to NYC which we were told there was nothing that could be done either. I am beyond angry about this and am out thousands of dollars of flights, hotels, cars, excursions, etc. I've never felt more disrespected by a company and am extremely disappointed with this service.

### "charge you for everything"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to New York via Reykjavik. I have never reviewed an airline before - but I have to review WOW because it is so awful, I hope no other passenger has to go through what I’m going through. I bought the ticket because it seemed amazingly cheap. But warning: they charge you for everything. You pay a high price simply for a carry-on bag of the size every other low cost airline permits for free. Even the sticklers like EasyJet. Then the food, unhealthy and extremely expensive. The website promised inflight entertainment screens but in fact you have to rent ipads (at a cost of $25.) By the time I had changed my ticket once and paid all the extras, the total cost was more than economy on a decent carrier like British Airways. Then the journey. Only one woman at check in, meaning that although I arrived in very good time I nearly missed the flight. Check in staff knew very little and cared less. On the plane, uncomfortable seats, very few staff. The airbus had to make an unscheduled fuel stop in the middle of the night (delaying already late arrival to early hours of the morning) simply because there were headwinds. Didn’t feel safe to fly across the Atlantic in an aircraft that can’t handle headwinds without making an unscheduled stop. If I could give zero stars I would.

### "worst ever flying experience"
Keflavik to Toronto. Simply my worst ever flying experience! I kept calling as line check in did not recognize my booking number, waiting time was very long and customer service agents very difficult to understand. I was told my number was correct and I had to wait until 24 hrs before flying, still did not work, called 3 times on day of flight as wanted to check in to ensure my family sat together, was then told booking number was incorrect and to try a different one, still no good, eventually paid extra over the phone to reserve seats. When getting to the airport I was told to check in at a machine, guess what? Booking not recognised again so queued up. There was a very long queue and only 2 desks open, 2 other staff just sat there filling in forms, we queued for nearly an hour and was down to 50 mins to departure. I spoke to staff several times to open other desks but they said others were busy and most staff were at the gates, eventually got to the desk to be told my seats had been given to other passengers despite me showing my email confirmation, again they were uninterested and shrugged shouldsers, my family ended up all split up including quite young daughters. The plane was the worse legroom I have had for a near 6hr flight, extremely cramped and uncomfortable. So it is fair to say will never use Wow again, iny opinion they are terrible and any saving is just not worth it.

### "my flight was miserable "
Chicago to Paris via Reykjavik. You get what you pay for - WOW air's a discount airline & this shows in the seating arrangements (it's cramped) and they'll charge you an arm and a leg for every additional piece of luggage you check. Regardless of the standards of the airline, my flight from Reykjavik to Paris was miserable - the airline ordered the wrong plane for the trip (it was too small) and ended up having to randomly split all of the passengers between one flight and another hours later. The check in for the second flight was brutal, with the line itself taking more than an hour, and I didn't end up at my location until the late evening despite my first arrival time being 11AM. I'd try any other airline in my price range (maybe not Ryanair) before I end up flying WOW air again.

### "disregard for people with disabilities"
St Louis to Gatwick via Keflavik. Flight themselves were fine. Just know what you are getting for your money and it's a great deal. My problem was with the service. I have glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, and use an FAA-approved device called a Novocure Optune for treatment. I called WOW approximately a month before my flight to have it authorized. The customer service representative told me he had approved it but I could tell that he was lying and just telling me what I wanted to hear. I called again a few days before my flight and of course it hadn't been approved. After spending 15 minutes trying to explain my issue to a limited-English representative, I asked to talk to a manager or to somebody in charge of ADA issues. I was told I would need to hang up, call the Iceland number directly, figure out which option was for the Icelandic language (because if I chose English it would send me right back to him), then hope whoever answered spoke English. I tried and didn't get it to work. The result was that I had to either lose my money or go without treatment for 9 days. I should not have been forced to make this choice. This has to be against the law, right? Finally, I wrote a complaint letter, mailed it to the correct office in Iceland, and never received a response. As I mentioned previously, I enjoyed most aspects of the flights, but there is no way I would fly with a company like WOW again due to their disregard for people with disabilities.

### "it is not worth it"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Dublin via Keflavik. Worse airline ever! Absolutely the worst customer service.You have to dig to find customer service phone number and then wait on hold for hours, for me 1.5 hours at one point. On our way back from Iceland in April we waited on late travelers from Paris, we then were late arriving and missed our connecting flight, and had to rent a car and drive 4 hours home to work the next day, out of our pocket. You have to submit a claim to be compensated and this was denied, after waiting 3 months for a response! Do not fly with them it is not worth it for a reduced cost flight.

### "customer service was just rude"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Boston via Keflavik. My wife and I flew this route home from our honeymoon. We waited for 90 minutes to check in in Dublin, paid $180USD to check two bags (which would be considered carry-ons on other airlines), and we were not able to sit together. Our flight left late, so we had to sprint across KEF airport to get our next flight. Needless to say, our bags didn't make it. We got to Boston and were without out luggage for six days. The process to file a claim for these bags was painful at best. Finally we receive our bags and they're heavily damaged. We were advised to file a claim for the lost bags, damage, baggage fees, and a per diem. This claim was flat out rejected after providing photos of our damaged bags and customer service was just rude.

### "not worth the purported savings"
In one itinerary, Copenhagen to San Francisco via Reykjavík, we had inconsistent treatment with our luggage, where the same luggage size authorized for any other airline worked from SFO to Copenhagen, but not Back. I ended up spending, in front of hundreds of amused onlookers about 20 minutes moving things around, getting drenched in sweat, just to have them charge me anyway for 1/2 an inch which fits on any airplane. All to just say in the end “we need to charge you 201 DKK or approximately $25 additional dollars. On top of this, when my son had to make a change to his itinerary on the website, it shows $99 to make the change, then charged his card $548 USD! It is not worth the purported savings, it’s just not! Power didn’t work, no entertainment, didn’t deliver our prepaid food, horrible  airline! Forget customer service, they have none. They hung up on us 3 times and are only served from India, don’t acknowledge any bugs on their site are possible.

### "Customer service non-existent"
Paris to Baltimore via Keflavik. It's difficult to write a review because I do not know where to start. Lets begin with the booking. Customer service (if it is deemed it exists) is non-existent. The average phone wait is about 40 minutes. I lost my luggage in Paris, and I had asked that I not be charged for the baggage. At the airport (where the wait was approximately 3 hours, since they had 2 flights to KEF at 6:30 and 6:35) I was assured that I could contact the office in USA to be refunded. When I came to the USA, I was politely told by the Airlines that once they had the money from me, there is no way on earth that I could get it back. i.e. I was being charged for service that I was not provided. Lessons learned is that you pay no money upfront. Well the airlines is cheap, i.e. cheap that they do not even provide a blanket. They will sell you a Cheap blanket with their advertisement for $20. I understand the concept of No-Frills airlines. I am ready to shell money for the extra services that I need like food etc. But $12 for a $1.50 vodka or $3.80 for a tiny black coffee is in my opinion a bit too much. The staff in the plane were helpful. But on the whole, this experience sucked. Needless to say they get 1 out of 10, and that is only because of the staff in the plane. Customer support should be revamped.

### "had delays left and right"
Worst airline I've experienced so far. We had delays left and right. When we arrived to KEF airport they notified us that they overbooked our flight and that we are now getting flown to a different airport in Lyon, France instead of CDG. Upon arriving we were thrown on a bus and had a 6 hour bus ride to CDG. Every connection we had was late and cut our vacation short one whole day. Never again with this airline. Garbage.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever on any airline. Charged $69 for a suitcase I have used 9 times in 15 years from BWI to Europe. Always carried on with me. Never have a carry on or purse, only my suitcase. My godchild was charged as well. This trip was for her a first time Europe visit because she has stage 4 cancer. Our seats were separate coming and going as were most passengers around us. Return trip I bought a small carry on and thinned my suitcase. This time I was charged $80. Other passengers boarding were even speaking up that this was wrong. No food, tv or perks - the steward was great but he should be with a more customer friendly airline. I would never ever give anyone a tip on flying this wow.Awful

### "absolutely dreadful"
Stansted to Cleveland via Keflavik. Appalling airline. Arrived in Iceland after diverting to Belfast. Flight cancelled, had to stay in Iceland (not a bad thing) for 2 nights. The customer service was absolutely dreadful - I know these guys put up with a lot, but the two ladies we spoke to were rude, bickering between themselves and downright ignorant. The return flight from Cleveland was even worse - sat on tarmac for 3.5 hours, so we left the plane of our own accord - good job - the flight left around 4 hours after schedule, arriving in Iceland where it was delayed for a further 12 hours. I understand from texts I received from the airline that they ended up charting a Ryanair aircraft that flew via Dublin to Gatwick! Do not use this airline. Nothing to do with it being a budget airline, I am not convinced they pay their airport fees/slots on time.

### "disappointed and angry"
Gatwick to Keflavik. Will never fly this airline again. They had terrible customer service, and were quite rude while checking bags in. In addition, I had to pay 100$ to check my bag, and they only allowed one small carry on bag. This is completely absurd as this was an international flight! Extremely disappointed and angry at the unexpected extra charges.

### "customer service if offensive"
Dallas to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Worst customer service ever. Cancelled flight to Dallas and dumped me in Ohio in the middle of the night. Not met by anyone from WOW till 3 a.m. No help in getting home. Finally bought a ticket on my own to Dallas. After two weeks, the bags eventually showed up, and only after I called wrote and email a dozen times. Applying for compensation is a nightmare. The "simple" forms which WOW requires one to file out are not simple. The whole enterprise is a Catch 22. You need a booking number, I am told. There is none. WOW sends an email saying the booking number is on the email. It is not. I cannot tell if these actions are intentionally or negligently plain stupid. WOW's customer service if offensive. The money saved by booking WOW was and is not worth the effort.

### "Terrible experience with WoW"
Terrible experience with WoW. We flew from Pittsburgh to Amsterdam via Rejkyavik. The first flight was slightly late, making us slightly late to our 2nd gate, however we still got there 30 min ahead of time. We were told that the plane was full and that we couldn't get on the flight (they actually first tried to tell us that our boarding passes were wrong and we were really on a later flight, until we showed them our flight confirmation email). We had to wait 2 hours for a 2nd flight (the flight we were "really supposed to be on") and it didn't end up taking off/landing until 3 hours after our original flight. We submitted claims on Wow Air's website, stating that we were denied boarding even though we arrived at our flight on time. WoW Air's terms and conditions state that boarding closes 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time. It took them 3 months, and then they denied our claim because they said that our "flight was not delayed more than 3 hours, and therefore under the EU policy, it is not claimable". I tried to call them and explain that we weren't submitting a claim for the flight being delayed, but for being refused the seat that we paid for and pushed to another one, even though we followed their terms that they set out for arriving to the gate on time. I was transferred to a supervisor, he called WoW Air's claims department and said there was nothing he could do and there was no one else I could talk to.

### WOW air customer review
Toronto to Copenhagen via Keflavik . It was one of the most terrible airlines I have travelled with. There was no services provided by the airlines. They don't even provide water on board (I paid 1000 dollars for flight and I had to pay for water). In flight Entertainment is too much to ask for from this airline. The principle of WOW is to provide the cheapest fare with nothing included. They have 0 flexibility regarding the baggage size and weight. I highly recommend to choose any other airline even if it is a little bit higher fare. Overall I would give 1* out of 5.

### "not to bother ordering a meal"
Not Verified |  Keflavik to Stansted. I didn't have the awful problems a lot of others seem to have but I warn potential customers not to bother ordering a meal. I did order meals on two flights, and although they had them, and obviously had my name and seat number attached to them, they didn't bother actually serving them to me until I asked several times. The first time I got to eat the meal just before we started descent into Reykjavik. They had done the trolley service and the duty free service, and in the end I had to ask for it as it looked as if they weren't going to serve it, and then the attendant asked if I really wanted to have it heated up, which was obviously an nuisance to her, and would take another 10 minutes. It would have been disgusting to eat mustard chicken cold! On my second flight, it was again obvious they weren't going to give me my pre-paid meal unless I asked for it, and again they delayed heating it up until they'd finished the other services. I understand it's a budget airline, but if you pre-pay for their crap meals, at least they should make an effort to serve them up in good time. By the way, the check-in at Dublin was a nightmare - massively long queue and no online check-in facility or self check-in machines. Reykjavik self check-in was really good though. I got through in a minute flat.

### "nickel-and-dime you to death"
Not Verified |  WOW looks appealing because of the price. Don't be deceived. They'll nickel-and-dime you to death. First of all, we had to pay an extra $110 each way to be allowed to bring our carry-on bags on board. If you want a seat that tilts more than an inch or two, you pay for it. In-flight entertainment? Forget it. One of our planes didn't even have USB power jacks to keep your device charged. And there was no in-flight Internet either. They were perfectly willing to rent you an iPad for $25, however. Everything including water was charged. A lady on the plane asked for water to swallow medication. She had to buy bottled water. The flight attendants were almost superfluous since they did very little other than chat in the back and swipe credit cards. Really disappointed and have no intention of flying WOW again. I thought Icelandair was rough, but they're luxury compared to WOW.

### "obliged to pay a compensation"
Baltimore to Frankfurt via Keflavik. I am writing this review based on my experience with the WOW air customer service, after issuing a complaint. I was flying with WOW air in Dec 2016 from the USA to Germany. The comfort on the flight is low. Beverages and food are not included in the ticket fare. My flight left BWI 3 hours late. I missed my connection flight in KEF to FRA due to that. I was told, that I would take the same flight that I had missed on the next day. Instead, I was send to COP where I had to take another flight to FRA. This resulted in a 36h delay. There were direct flights available from KEF to FRA, but WOW air refused to book those. Moreover, I had to pay in COP again for my luggage. Up to this day, I did not receive any kind of compensation. I registered a claim right after Christmas in 2016. I called and contacted the customer service several times and was always told, that my case would be send to a supervisor as a priority. Nothing happened. WOW air is obliged by EU regulations to pay a compensation of 600€, but instead is intentionally delaying the process and hoping for its customers to abandon their rights.

### "never travel this airline again"
Not Verified |  Left Toronto on time. If I'd known before leaving Toronto that the connection from Reykjavik to Dublin would be 8 hours I would not have left Canada. There were literally hundred of people stranded with 3 planes that did not arrive. One from Dublin, Paris and Germany. So hundreds of people and no one thereto advise until 4:30am when one lovely man tried his best to advise people and who didn't have any vouchers to hand out and absolutely nothing to offer to elderly, people with babies, children and all the others got nothing. I tried to get on Icelandair which was leaving and was told that one ticket remained and one way was 850 US$. The planes and staff are fabulous, no water on board only ice cubes. Everything is very expensive and in US currency. I have yet to claim but don't expect to get any compensation. I would never travel this airline again.

### "Literally the worst airline"
Montreal to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Literally the worst airline I have ever been on. The employee at the Montreal desk did not give me the tag receipt for my luggage. When I landed in Amsterdam my luggage was not there. All they told me to do was fill out this form and wait for them to call me until they found. But I knew that these airline could careless about finding my luggage. So I called so many numbers and emailed the airline/ handling agent and they all keep telling me to wait. In addition, the handing agent is "responsible" for your luggage and not Wow air. I could not wait no longer because they gave me no information at all,  they did not tell if it's delayed or if it's totally missing. Anyways I asked my mother to go the Montreal airport which was where I checked in to talk to a wow representative and after 2 trips going to the airport and 3 hours a employee finally went down to luggage loading area to look for it and magically their it was still in Montreal and it did not have a bag tag. I do not recommend choosing this airline. I know the prices are cheap but it's not worth it all the customer service is a 0/10. I am never going on this airline again.

### "did not mind paying fees"
Frankfurt to Dallas  via Reykjavik. Overall the experience with Wow Air was good given the fact that we knew it was a budget airline. We did not mind paying fees for checked bags, carry on bags, seat selection and more, because the fare was very affordable. We did not expect excellent service but we were pleasantly surprised. The aircraft were new and clean. Both flights were delayed about 30 minutes but the planes could catch up with schedule in the air and we happened to arrive almost on time.

### "did nothing to help"
Dallas to Gatwick via Keflavik. I normally do not write bad reviews, but I feel obligated to let others know about the trap that I fell into. If you’re planning on flying with this airline, please consider reading my experience and the lesson that I learned. I will certainly never fly with WOW air again. To summarize it, WOW delayed our flight nearly 8 hours causing us and everyone on our plane to miss our connections in Iceland. It was said that we were delayed because "technical difficulties that led to overbooking". We got to the Dallas airport more than 4 hours before the scheduled flight, but ended up waiting in a line of several hundred people for almost 6 hours before the WOW staff even bothered to show up at their check in desk. Apparently, there were about 3 plane-loads of people, and only 1 small plane, so they made a randomized list of who was going to get to fly that day, and we were "lucky" enough to be on it. Eventually, about 8 hours after the flight had ben scheduled to leave, we finally boarded the plane. Everyone on the plane had connections to somewhere in Europe, and it was pretty obvious that all of us would be missing those connections being so late. We were all worried and asked about what would happen. We were told that we would be "taken care of" once we got to Iceland, but instead, no one was there. Not a single WOW employee was in the airport who could help us. They did absolutely nothing to help anyone, basically stranding all of us in Iceland. Everything through WOW was booked for days, and we waited in lines for hours hoping for help, but eventually we had to book another flight ourselves through a different airline to get out of Iceland, costing me more than $1300 just to get to a destination I had already paid to get to through WOW. They had absolutely zero concern for helping anyone and basically canceled our flight after bringing us half way and into a foreign county. It was a horrible experience, and even though I was told I would receive a refund for the flight that they did not provide, I have still not received it more than 2 weeks later. Although I was lucky enough to get out of Iceland that day, I believe that most people did not. I remember leaving the line at the unhelpful service desk to look for other flights and seeing a line of a couple hundred people, including families and small children, sitting on the concrete floor waiting and hoping for Wow air to do something. I don’t have a problem with cheap airlines and I understand that sometimes unforeseeable things happen that cause problems and delays. But the way that a company handles problems matters. I have flown many times with many different airlines, and I have never had an experience as terrible as this one. If you have a week to spare, no plans made ahead of time, a lot of extra cash, and you don’t mind being stuck in an airport for days at a time, then go ahead - book a flight with Wow. Otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else. I will certainly never be lured into flying with this company ever again.

### "tried to reschedule"
New York to Berlin via Keflavik. The worst experience of my life. Got to JFK and forgot my passport, tried to reschedule but Wow said no changes! A 1200$+ ticket totally lost. Unreal.

### "staff clueless and indifferent"
Flight from Toronto to Reykjavik was cancelled at last minute. I find out only after arriving at airport. Airport staff were clueless and indifferent. Was given an email address to claim refund. Four months later, despite over 20 letters and despite having completed their online claim form numerous times, have only been refunded for my air fare. Have received absolutely zero refund for hundreds of dollars spent on WOW air website booking hotel, tours and airport flybus. Their "customer swrvice" comes down to: delay, delay, deny claim, keep money. My advice: Stay very far away from this terrible company.

### "did a mistake on the check"
Tel Aviv to San Francisco via Keflavik. Really bad customer service before my flight. I did a mistake on the check in and paid for an extra lauggage that I dont need called the customer service 5 min after I did the charge, spoke with 3 different people for more then an hour. At the end this guy over the phone saying that he cant help me and I wont get my money back. When I asked to speak with a manager they said that he's not available at the moment.

### "get what you pay for"
You get what you pay for. Long story short the name on my ticket was different from my passport. Obviously a problem but normally easily fixable with other airlines. I was told by the woman on the checkin counter to call customer service and they would fix it. (Three people from my flight had the same issue resolved). I called customer service and was told they couldn’t fix it because my flight was leaving in less than 3 hours. The man hung up on me. I called back. He hung up again. Same guy two more times before they blocked my number. Called from a friends phone. Got through. He heard my voice, and hung up. Then after a while I got through to them and after them stalling for three hours (15 minutes after my flight left) they suddenly were able to change the name! It took 30 seconds to make the change and I lost the flight with no refund.

### "same price as Air France"
Not Verified |  Although the flights seem cheap, it will end up costing you more if not the same if you booked with a better company and a lot less is included. I bought by ticket for about $550 to go from Newark to Paris but had a 7 hr layover in Iceland on my way to Paris then a 19 hr layover on my way back. I bought it because it was the cheapest flight I could find but after paying an extra $150 jut for luggage it was the same price as if I would have just flown with Air France. Luggage is not included and neither is food and drinks. The seats were not comfortable at all and very little leg room. My seat from Paris to Rejkavik had chips on the floor. They also changed to gate twice on me at the airport and did not inform anyone. Luckily, I went to the information desk to find out what was going on since it was boarding time. The flights attendants are not pleasant, they look at you like something is wrong with you. All four flights with Wow the attendant were all the same. Unless your traveling very light, like only a book bag, then maybe book with them. Other than that, they even charge for carry ons. When I was buying my luggage, which was $75 each way, I remember a carry on being $54 each way. They even check how big your back bag is though and if it doesn’t fit in this little metal thing they have they will charge you. I seriously do not recommend. I could have spent $700 on another flight and had everything included. This trip cost me much more than I wanted it to because no one wants to spend 19 hr in an airport so I rented a car to travel around. For 1 day it was $150 and gas to fill up a smart car which was just under half a tank was $50. Food is also overpriced in Iceland as well. I would definitely average $30 a person each meal.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
San Francisco to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. We were informed our flight would be delayed by five hours and we would miss our connecting flight but that we would be booked on the next flight out. When we got to Reykjavik, I think half of the travelers about 200 people had missed their connecting flights. We were routed to one line, all of us, and were told one by one that we were told to go to another line where we would be told our new connecting flights. We were told to go pick up our baggage and then go to another line to be told of our connecting flight. This took us until three hours later. They told us we were booked on the 6am flight and to be outside the hotel at 3:30 in the morning. While were were sleeping they sent us another email that we were now booked art 12 o’clock flight which was already delayed an hour, but we were to be ready at 9am for pick up. So loss of valuable vacation time and sleep! We could not even go to the town because of their ineptitude at the airport, plus they did not have sufficient staff to service all of the delayed people. While in one of the lines next to us was another line of people from a different wow flight waiting to find out their destiny. With the significant amount of delayed flights they have, wow should have this down to a science, but instead they are bumbling buffoons. They gave us a voucher for dinner, only one restaurant, and when we went to order they told us all we could order was the pizza and soda. I cannot recommend this airline, please heed my advise, until you see better reviews. Traveler be warned, travel with wow at your own risk, inconvenience, and displeasure.

### "never received any notification"
I didn't have any negative opinions of WOW air until I got stuck in Keflavik, Iceland. I arrived to the airport 3 hours before my flight time and never received any notification via email, text or during check in at the airport. Once I got through security, only then did I slowly come to the realization that something was wrong. My gate was unlisted and all WOW air attendants at gates were absent. There was no one to ask for help except for the service desk in which 30-40 people were lined up, frustrated and angry, because almost all outbound WOW air flights were delayed to varying degrees. Only 15 minutes before boarding did I discover that my flight was going to be delayed from 9pm to 1am the next day. The worst part is that I met many other stranded people who had wasted 14 hours because of the complete lack of organization of this slapstick sideshow that calls itself Wow Air. My suggestion on future improvement for WOW air is that they halt all expenses towards their peddling ridiculous pink gaudy outfits for their attendants and redirect their time, money, and energy towards getting their customers to their destinations on time. This lackadaisical airline is an international equivalent of Frontier Airlines and despite an economical ticket, the real cost will be your time.

### "Flight gets cancelled"
. Terrible experience! Flight gets cancelled due to plane issues, after 8 hrs sitting at the airport all 200 passengers got put in a hotel and promised to receive an email within 2 hrs for a new flight confirmation for next day. Nobody had received any emails till next morning after which people start calling , sitting for over an hour on hold, given wrong information. Eventually by late afternoon we were booked on flights to Baltimore and NYC. WOW air keeps asking us to buy our own tickets and refund us later. In Baltimore - same story - several hours at the airport and nobody booked. whoever could afford bought their own tickets. the others were sent to hotels and promised again an email for confirmation with a flight for next day WITHIN 2 HRS. No emails for the next 12 hrs. Its already almost 48 hrs , people are getting anxious and start calling. I personally called 3 times , first time stayed on hold for 45 minutes second 1 hour and 3rd 1.5 hours. Finally he tells me I am booked for a flight to Dallas with Delta at 6 pm. I go to the airport and meet the rest f the guys who were also told same thing. turns out flight was actually 6am not 6pm. Delta tells me they can send me to Atlanta and then Dallas but I have to pay $75 to reserve a seat and $25 for my baggage, otherwise there is no guarantee they will put me on the flight. Finally almost 60 hrs after the whole adventure started I am home in Dallas. I contacted many times WOW by email and nobody responded. Contacted the by personal message on Facebook with no response. Finally made a public post on Facebook and they responded told me to log in their website to claim for a refund. The log in requires a booking number, but I purchased the ticket though a third party so the booking I have doesnt log me in. I told them and they never responded back. I would never recommend them to anyone.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  Edinburgh to Toronto via Reflavik. Do not fly with this airline no matter the seemingly low price! On our way home from Edinburgh, our flight was delayed 5 hours with no explanation. A representative told us to arrive at the airport the usual 3 hours before for check in, so we did. We get there and check in is closed. Then, because of the delay, we miss our connecting flight and need to spend a night in Iceland, without our luggage (because they lost it and were unable to tell us where it might be/when we would get it). At least WOW Air paid for everyone's hotel and food, as Iceland is expensive. Then, the next day, we try to board our flight home, and multiple peoples' tickets are denied. They assigned seats to multiple people. A line of about 50 was waiting for this to be resolved. Then, the plane leaves an hour later than scheduled after the confusion. We get to our destination and again need to sit on the plane as the doors won't open. When we finally get off, our baggage still hasn't made it and we have to wait and hope they ship it. They give little explanation, no apologies, and don't seem to know the information themselves. Our bags still aren't trackable. I do not trust this airline and neither should you. Horrible. And this is on top of their ridiculous fees for carry on and checked bags. And we had to take extra vacation days and paid double for parking as we arrives outside of our planned date and lost our deal. We're just lucky this was on our way home -  this could ruin a vacation and I think it did for some other people.

### "$100 just to bring our bags on"
Gatwick to Keflavik. My issue with WOW Air didn't start in Gatwick it actually started the day before in Stansted. My connection from Edinburgh was a bit late arriving to Stansted and the bags took   longer than expected. I arrived to the check in counter with around an hour before my flight was departing. The first thing I saw when I got to the check in counter was a woman was being denied on the flight to Iceland, the flight I was getting on. The woman behind the counter could care less. And this was assured when I stepped away for just a minute to tell my two other travel mates we aren't going to be able to get on the flight. When I arrived back to the counter two minutes later the Wow employee was already gone. We decided to give Wow another shot and book a flight with them the next day departing out of Gatwick. After spending $300 a piece, so $900 total for one way tickets, we found out that we would have to pay another $100 just to bring our bags on. 51 pounds to check a small piece of luggage which is normally a carry on for every other airline and 37 pounds to bring on a small carry on item. Onboard when the refreshment cart came by, the staff asked me what would I like to drink? I responded water. She said, we only have bottled. I said okay, that is fine. She then responded with that will be 3.50 pounds. I just spent $400 dollars on a one way ticket and you can't pick up the bottled water for me?

### "should have let us deplane"
Not Verified |  Reykjavik to Cincinnati. We have not taken off. Still sitting at gate due to mechanical problems on another flight. It is 1.5 hrs taking off late, likely will be 2 hrs. While we all appreciate customer service to all travelers, it is inconsiderate to leave 200 people on uncomfortable seats for 2 hrs. Announcements were made that it would be a few minutes. 90+ minutes is a lot more than a few. They keep apologizing but should have let us deplane.

### "Overall not impressed"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Detroit via Keflavik. Hands down the most miserable flying experience I have had. Akin to Ryanair but long haul. Wasn’t allowed a glass of water had to pay €3.50 for cheap mineral water. Gin and tonic was a rip off at €12.00, flights both delayed. They charge for everything if you add it all up with the inconvenience of being late and the additional costs you could fly direct with a reputable and rather nice national airline like Norwegian. WOW air bring a whole new meaning to airbus cramped, uncomfortable. Overall not impressed.

### " a nightmarish trip"
Amsterdam to Newark via Keflavik. I had a nightmarish trip home with WOW this week. As is common with budget airlines, you get a low fare, but must pay extra for food, drinks, a comfortable seat, etc., and the fees for checked bags are high. Fair enough, customers know this going into the purchase, and for many it might be a good choice. Our trip to Amsterdam via Reykjavik went smoothly, and I have no complaints at all. We carried our own food on to the flight, and paid to check our bags. But the trip home was awful, and explains to me why WOW has such a poor reputation. First, we were delayed five hours in Amsterdam. The first hour delay was due to weather, but the rest of it really did seem to be the airline's fault. We sat on the tarmac in a packed plane for almost 5 hours, and air conditioning was run only briefly a couple of times during those hours. The heat was extreme. The crew served beverages (for payment) only once, early on; given the heat and the delay, offering water for free would have been the humane thing to do. The children and elderly passengers suffered the most, I think. Due to the delay, everyone missed their connecting flights. The one service person left on duty to help about 150 passengers with connecting flights did her best, and we were put on a later flight to Newark. But not ONE of the passengers from Amsterdam who were rerouted to the Newark flight got their luggage. The three hours that we had in Reykjavik apparently were not enough to transfer any of our bags. Today, the luggage desk explained their very unusual way of handling delayed luggage. All American passengers' luggage is sent to Boston and then handed off to Fed Ex., and you won't get it for 3-5 working days after it is given to FedEx That will add up to a week for me, since the weekend will intervene. And I'll have to take another day off from work to wait for delivery. No one packs a week's worth of medications and toiletries (or clothes) in the carry on, since no one would anticipate such a long delay. So WOW charges high luggage fees, but has much slower and poorer delivery. It's not worth the savings. Avoid WOW, I certainly will, after this!

### "Waste of money with WOW"
❌ Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Stansted via Keflavik. Terrible from start to finish. I never thought an Airline could be worse than Ryanair, but WOW have taken that title. At least with Easyjet & Ryanair they are only short flights so you do not mind but with WOW what they offer, although cheap for a long haul flight WOW is awful. The charge for carry on luggage is incredibly high as is the cost of food & drink. I have no issues paying for this, but at reasonable amounts. The seats are uncomfortable and sub par for a 10 hour flight. The lack of entertainment, even paid is poor and the chargers did not work on both legs of my journey. My main issue was the poor customer service. My wallet was stolen in London 1 day before I returned. I arrived at Stansted and asked what are my options to pay for my luggage as I went to the bank prior to withdraw cash. After 5 minutes I was told to approach other customers and ask them to pay for my luggage on their card and take my cash? Hardly helpful. I refused. Due to the lack of wifi at Stansted I could not make calls so I asked to please use a phone to call family who could pay. I was told they had no phones? After 15 minutes (to her credit) the staff member allowed me to call from her mobile. Onboard the plane, the gentlemen behind also only had cash and was given water. When I asked another FA for a cup of water and she refused saying my only option was to buy water. When I explained I only had cash which they do not accept she said "Who flies without cards?". I explained my wallet had been stolen to which she apologised and after I begged for some water on a 10 hour flight she reluctantly offered boiling hot water which apparently was all she had. Forget customer service, what kind of world do we live when such simple aspects to help someone becomes a chore or challenge? This was easily the most uncomfortable experience I have ever had in all my years travelling. In the end I think I saved $20.00 in the difference to buying a ticket with Norwegian who I find a much higher level of airline. Waste of money with WOW.

### "do not fly with them"
Do not fly with them! Delayed flight from New York to Brussels meant that I missed my connecting flight in Iceland to Brussels. The Wow Air staff lied saying that I wouldn't miss my connecting flight as the pilot would "make up the time in the air". What angered me most was that the Wow Air employee told me there was no more flights out of their airport in Iceland that day (I was panicking as I had an embassy meeting in Brussels the next morning). Luckily I got WiFi and found out there were plenty flights - another flight leaving that day to Brussels with another airline. I paid $600 for that new flight. Afterwards I called, emailed, tweeted customer support for months with nothing. I also submitted a claim online on their website and months later I was told I could get a flight voucher for 700$ (however most of their trans-Atlantic flights are nearly $900 meaning I'd still be losing money). I declined and asked for a monetary refund - I got $742, whole process took 4 months so if you're asking for a monetary refund stick with it and submit a claim on their website.

### "Be careful with their timings"
Stansted to Detroit via Reykjavik. During purchase, the schedule indicated that my flight would be on the 19th May at "00:50. I even checked with a representative that the flight was on the 19th when I quizzed here about getting there 3 hours before (for security processing). So according to the representative, that would mean the evening of the 19th. Imagine my surprise to receive this message: "Dear WOW air guest on flight WW122 DTW-KEF 19MAY18. This is a friendly reminder about your flight timings since it’s our experience that a departure time shortly after midnight tends to cause confusion. The departure time of your flight is shortly after midnight 00:50 and the check-in closes before midnight the day before the scheduled departure day, at 23:50. Have a WOW flight! Kind regards WOW air. This shows that they know about the confusion that their after midnight flights cause! When I received the message, I checked with the airline again, only to find that my flight was on 18th May in the evening (if I get there 3 hours before the flight). This conversation was difficult since it took the representative a while to understand the concept of arriving a few hours before the flight, and consequently had to check. I was then told the bad news that my flight was actually on the 18th May. In my opinion this is a very dishonest way of dong business! I had booked my hotel up until the 19th May, and it was really luck that I checked my messages, otherwise I would have missed my flight and probably would have been fleeced for a reschedule! Do WoW Air do this deliberately? I  suggested to WoW Air to use the 24 hour clock system (incorporating the 24 to 25 hour indication) to avoid the confusion. For example, my flight schedule should have actually read: 18th May, at 24:50hrs. They told me that this was under consideration, but because complaints are currently not processed by the Aviation Authority regarding dishonest trading, I am doubtful that they will. They only offered me an apology, and no compensation for the extra night booked with the hotel. Be careful with their timings! Any "00:50" schedules are actually the day before

### "pay their extortionate baggage fee"
❌ Not Verified |  Gatwick to San Francisco via Keflavik. Worst airline experience I have ever had. Their cabin baggage allowance is less than everyone else, meaning you will almost certainly have to pay their extortionate baggage fee for exceeding their allowance - unless you are going somewhere for such a short period of time you can make do with pretty much one set of clothes. They also charge you for any refreshments onboard - even water!

### "staff friendly and competent"
❌ Not Verified |  Chicago to Keflavik. WOW air is billed as an economy airline and that’s what it is. However I found their staff to be friendly and competent. We were double charged for our cabin bags and I believe this is how they make their money. My luggage was lost on a direct fright from Chicago to Keflavik, Iceland on day 1 of a 16 day European vacation. It took 10 days to get my luggage returned to me. This was a very frustrating process but Wow air baggage services put in much effort to locate my luggage. They updated me by email at least once a day until it was found and subsequently returned to me.

### "experience was so positive"
Copenhagen to Toronto via Reykjavik. My experience was so positive, I needed to share. Cabin crew was extremely friendly and helpful. The pilots were informative and provided information to the passengers when needed. There was also a minor medical incident with one of the passengers during the flight that was handled flawlessly by the crew, so much so that a majority of the flight had no idea there was an issue. The pilot went above and beyond to check on the passenger as well. The plane was clean, bright and comfortable. Certainly a great value for the price. I would highly recommend flying with WOW.

### "not worth the trouble"
❌ Not Verified |  Toronto to Copenhagen via Keflavik. First time to fly with WOW Airlines, I was very apprehensive and nervous because of all the negative reviews. We paid the WOW Plus so we could have a carry on and a checked in luggage. In spite of all the bad reviews, we had an uneventful flight going and coming back. As previously stated in other reviews, there's nothing that WOW will offer, no water, no coffee, no entertainment, no food, extra charges for carry on, checked luggage, and extra leg room, so if you're okay with these, then go ahead. But if you are a tall person, the regular seats are really, really very tight, you might want to consider paying for comfy or extra leg room. We arrived 30 minutes early in Iceland, and the rest of our flights were on time. The only time staff would go down the aisle was to sell beverages, food, ipad, duty free and to collect trash. Flight staff were cheerful, professional, friendly and I should say young and good looking as well. The only thing negative I experienced was with the ground staff, upon check-in at Toronto, lady at the counter said that we didn't pay for checked in or carry on luggage, and I said we did, she said no, I showed her my phone and my printed ticket, still she said no and said "Show me, show me", in spite of the tickets already "shouting" in front of her that said included, she refused to budge then finally she said, "oh there's another group of 3 with the same last names. Yeah right - our last name is not common at all, so that showed, she was careless, quick to judge and quite rude, too. Ground staff are really quite strict with carry ons, they check at the gate, if you paid for one and you had a shopping bag, they'll let you put that inside your carry on, so, what I did was to get extra duty free bags and used those. They do check the weight as well, if you have over weight luggage, be ready to pay $21/lb, but they'll give you the option to move some stuff to your carry on instead. I don't think I will use this airline anymore, not worth the trouble, after all the fees and extra charges, fare comes up the same with other airlines (but with food, water, entertainment, etc)

### "terrible across the board"
London Gatwick to San Francisco via Keflavik. Most pathetic airline - rips off people - the cabin baggage size is smaller than normal airlines. Oversize cabin baggage rates are atrocious. Was forced to pay almost £260 at Gatwick by the most unhelpful check in staff. So, if you are ever thinking about WOW, because it "seems" less expensive - think again and again. Add up the rip offs on cabin baggage and the service (charges even for water onboard). The total cost is way more than other classier airlines. Don't be fooled. And the service is terrible across the board.

### "lower fare is not worth it"
Boston to Berlin via Keflavik. The lower fare is not worth it. My flight was cancelled on 2.11.18. I did not receive a call from WOW that day, so I called, and was on hold 5 hours! My flight was supposed to leave on Sunday, and I was rebooked for the following Friday. I paid extra for a priority seat and boarding, and this was not honored on the rebooked flight. They said I would be reimbursed $100/day for the days delayed. I have been unable to collect this despite numerous calls to the "customer service" number (India). This airline stinks.

### "don’t recommend WOW air"
❌ Not Verified |  Keflavík to Boston. I don’t recommend WOW air at all. Although ticket prices were great, they charge you a bunch of fees and for everything else (a bottle of water was $3.29). But the main reason why I discourage this company is for their customer service. All their employees are rude and talk down to you. Arriving to the airport I went to the self check kiosk but apparently in Keflavík they don’t open until 12pm. So I went into the baggage line since I need to drop off my bag. An employee finally arrived around 12:22 yelling at everyone that they need to you the kiosk because the line was too big. But the kiosk still didn’t work. On the plane itself, the staffs didn’t greet anyone but were on their phones. One looked at me asking if I needed help finding my seat, but I told her it’s ok, I know where it is, and she told me to stop and show me her ticket because she didn’t believe me. Then on the flight she continued to watch me and harass me for the shades being down, and me grabbing something from my bag underneath while the plane wasn't taking off or landing.

### "5 stars from me!"
Toronto to Keflavik. My girlfriend and I were a little skeptical about flying this airline after reading all of the negative reviews, but after our round trip vacation from Toronto to Iceland and back, we had no idea why this airline had so many negative reviews! Maybe our standards for a good flight were low, but if it weren't for all of the pink, we couldn't tell the difference between this and a Delta flight. My recommendation is to just know what you're getting into before you leave and you will not have any problems. There isn't any complementary food or beverage service, solution? Eat before you leave and buy a drink at the airport before the flight. Our luggage got their fine and in great shape. I have read a lot of negative reviews about how WOW lost passengers luggage - it's not their fault! The airport handles the luggage, not the airline! So stop giving WOW a hard time over this issue if it happens to you. Another negative review I have seen is people complaining about the airline switching their seats around - we booked our flight 4 months in advance and chose seats and those were the ones we were given. We also got to the airport 2.5 hours before our flight (like you should for an international flight) and were able to check in perfectly. More negative reviews I saw were about how they don't give you your boarding pass if you spell your name wrong when you book - how is this different from any other airline? Even if you somehow spell your own name wrong at the time of booking, I believe you can alter it up to 24 hours before your flight - WOW even sends you a reminder email (and text if you sign up for it) to make sure you have spelled your name right and have all of the necessary documents to travel to the country you are going. In conclusion - for 900 dollars total, my girlfriend and I got a round trip flight from Toronto to Iceland with 3 checked bags (we camped and brought our stuff so we had to have a additional bag for that stuff). The next cheapest option was going to be around 1400 for the two of us. We had a great experience on this airline and were surprised how great it was after reading all of the negative reviews before hand. The seats were fine and they actually had more legroom then some of the domestic US flights I have taken. Our luggage got there safe and sound and we had no problems with our boarding passes because when we booked we looked at our passports and put our names in the computer the way they are spelled on the passports. WOW air definitely has my trust and we will fly with them over and over again - 5 stars from me!

### "no one tried to help me"
Montreal to Barcelona via Keflavik. I had a very distasteful experience with WOW Air. On the 29th April they didn't allow me to get onto my flight. I booked this flight with three months advance. It was my first time traveling with Wow Airline and I was pretty excited with this trip because I was doing a stopover in Iceland and I have planned to visit the Blue Lagoon, so I reserved and paid in advance to get in, as I only had around 8hrs in land. As a frequent traveller you can imagine my surprise when I was doing the checkin at 5pm at Montreal airport and the ground crew told me that WoW airline will not aloud me to travel because in my reservation there was only my first and my surname, missing my middle name. As a frequent traveller, I take care of all my reservations and I always use the same information, my first and my last name. Apart of that I also provide my passport number and the expiring date. So the person that have booked this trip could only be me, no one else had the same data. I tried to talk and explain my situation to the gentleman at the airport and he told me that he couldn't help me so I asked to speak with his supervisor, Anne Marie. The ground crew supervisor told me that I couldn't travel for the same reason. I have tried to find different solutions but I guess she wasn't patient enough to help me with that. After 4min conversation she told me to speak with the customer service supervisor by phone. I was really frustrated to understand that no one took responsibility for the problem and no one could or wanted to help me. Once again, I follow her instructions and I called the customer service supervisor. I explained my situation and I asked for help finding out a solution. I have suggested a lot of thinks like paying for adding my middle name on the reservation, paying a fee to enter at the flight. But his answer was the same as everyone else, he couldn't help me and he is following rules and the airline policies. All this situation was really frustrating and it also shows us (the passengers) that you don't invest the enough time/money in your customer service. During the three times i have speak with people that work for your Wow Air, no one ever provide me a solution or tried to help me. Everyone just told me that I will have to buy a new ticket for the day after and wait at the airport. After all I find out they always do that when their flight is overbooked. So they find this excuse to don't allow us to get in and make us paying for another flight and losing twice the money. Apart of that the customer service is just bad, no one ever want to help you. I'll never travel with WOW Air again.

### "a very positive experience"
San Francisco to Dublin via Reykjavík. I was aware of the extra charges many reviewers have commented on in their reviews. Therefore, when booking I could clearly see the true cost and was aware of additional fees. For two people (My wife and I) we paid €750 for a one way ticket from San Francisco to Dublin with a short stopover in Reykjavik. This included check in luggage up to 20Kg, carry on luggage (10 Kg) and a personal item (rucksack, handbag). This was more than sufficient and the extra fees paid for this luggage allocation are included in the €750. The flight from SFO- Reykjavík was on the Airbus A330 aircraft with a flight time of 8 hrs. Although the leg room was tight, it was by no means uncomfortable, once you took a regular stretch or walk as you should do on any airline. Limited food menu was available onboard. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The one negative was that the universal charge points beneath the seat were not working, however, the staff obliged by charging in their rest area. After a short stopover in Reykjavik we boarded a new Airbus A321 to Dublin and this plane had all the modern comforts of a brand new aircraft. Although we had to pay for food onboard both flights, the difference between travelling with Wow and Aer Lingus was saving in the region of €800 for two people with the stopover adding 2.5-3hrs to the journey. I found the stopover good to break up the journey and this may suit families travelling with children or those who value their Cash at the expense of a few extra hours travel. Overall a very positive experience.

### "a very pleasant experience"
I got scared reading negative reviews and want to offer a different experience. We flew on a XXL (BIZ-Class) ticket from Baltimore to Frankfurt and back and had a very pleasant experience. WoW Air operates one of the newest aircraft fleets and all four planes we flew with were 2016 or 2017 build. Our ticket included priority boarding, seat selection, free luggage, free meal and drink. Nothing to complain about. Staff on the plane was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Now, here seems to be the trick: We did a little research and talked to folks who had flown WoW Air before and got some insights. Make sure you adhere to their luggage requirements. Understand that an XXL seat is a seat of the exact same size as any other seat, but it's in the exit row and gives you the additional leg room. There was mention, however in the magazine that the airline has started to add "real" Business Class seats to their Airbus 300 planes and plans the same upgrades, with confirmed seating option, to their 321/320 fleet. Know that you do not have in-board entertainment unless you bring your own I-Pad or pay 25$ to rent one. Understand that everything, from water to food, will cost you money. So the bottomline: If you pay only $126 on-way to Frankfurt and expect a 5-star service, you'd be thoroughly disappointed and write a review like the ones we read. If you pay about $400, you get the premium treatment and write a review like this. One thing I can't comment on, is how their service develops once something goes wrong, like many reviewers experienced. We may just have been lucky that everything went well.

### "our flight has been cancelled"
I had bought a round trip ticket with my girlfriend from Toronto to Amsterdam return via Keflavik. On the way back, we arrived in Schiphol Airport. We lined up to give our luggage and the person helping us informed us that our flight has been cancelled. She could not give a reason for this. We soon after received an email detailing this cancellation. It said it was cancelled due to "operational restrictions". We inquired and it was never made clear to us the reason for this. Either way, alright. Flight is cancelled lets check our options. WOW Air gave us an option of either getting a full refund on our flight, no refund but next available flight (which was in 4 days. I had a huge backpack and they were not willing to make hotel accommodations), or to later file for compensation. My girlfriend decided to opt for a full refund. Fair. She got her money back. I opted to file for compensation. In this case, we had to get back to Toronto in 2 days maximum. We then found the next available flight out. It cost us both around 900$ CAD each. Around $1800 total. So at this point she's out $500 and I am out the full $900. I then wanted to file for compensation. Here we are 8 months later. After waiting and waiting and waiting we were promised $1200 CAD compensation. I said great. That is perfect. However, last second I got an email informing me that the airline did not want to pay such a price and slashed it in half. Now we are only getting $600 CAD which will not come close to even covering my ticket home not to mention the discomfort of sleeping in an airport chair for 2 nights. I am now in the process of inquiring about this. I called a representative who was nice but basically couldn't do a thing but tell me he would speak with his supervisor. Not too confident on the outcome here. If you ever have the idea that WOW is cheaper and you want to save a buck keep in mind there is a good chance you will have to pay much more if anything goes wrong. This is not the only story out there like this. Also, I spoke with my dad who mentioned airlines sometimes cancel flights if they cannot fill the plane. Come to think of it, the group of people that got cancelled were about 10. Very interesting situation if that is the truth.

### "by far the worst airline"
Brussels to Los Angeles via Keflavik. This is by far the worst airline. First they told me I have to pay 135 euro for my 1 check in luggage. Ok got a catch the flight. Got into the flight,I asked for water, they asked me to wait, then again I asked they said the CC machine need to be on. They said its 3.75 euro - I have to pay even for a water. Then I asked for food to buy. They said once we start serving we can help you, after long wait here they are 2 sweet lady's asking me if I need anything - I tell them nicely anything and of course CC in hand, they reply no more food available sir, we only have soup. Seats are small and when I say small I mean like no movement possible. I slept only maybe 3 hours with sleeping pill, very noisy aircraft old dirty. Never again ,even if wow is my Last choice I'm passing on. No music, games, tv or similar entertainment and of course no Wi-Fi.

### "will definitely regret it"
Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik. This company is awful! They will not get their customers back, and therefore, will not make any profit with the way they treat their customers. My mom who doesn't speak English. She couldn't understand why they wouldn't let her on the plane and was trying to get them to talk to someone who could explain what is going on, but they refused to take the phone and talk to someone on the phone who could both help them and help my mom. Although the tickets are cheap, they do not include good customer service. They were rude and unhelpful. I flew with the same airline. Nothing was included in the price of the ticket, not even water or a simple carry-on. If you think you're getting a good deal with the airfare they offer, you will realize you were tricked into thinking that as soon as you purchase your ticket. I have never had a worse experience with any other airline so far. Do not use them or you will definitely regret it.

### "No water unless you paid"
By the time we got the baggage and legroom for one it totaled to about the same as much better airlines. Six of us flew to Amsterdam from Los Angeles through Iceland. LA to Iceland is an 8-9 hour flight. No water unless you paid for it. I sat in the dry air for 6 hours before I finally caved in and gave up my credit card. We bought water bottles during the trip and filled them at the airport before our return flight. On the first long flight we didn't know how to recline the seats. I purchased the extra leg room but had to sleep sitting up. No one said anything about the red button until the second flight. The poor guy next to me was 6'4" and couldn't recline. Bring your charger. The outlets didn't work on the return flight. I asked the attendant (once I saw one) about it and she said they would reset it. There was no reset. All six people who flew, we were spread out, had the same problem. The three in premium class had the same problem as the ones in the cheapest seats. Eight hours and the batteries to our phones were dead. We had to charge them at the airport in order to call for our ride. We were in row 16 towards the front of the plane. We were roasting. The group in front were freezing. There was no air control on the return long flight. The staff was selling the duty free products, cigarettes and makeup, during every flight. It was making me nuts. The only good thing about the airline was that the staff looks amazing. Barbie and Ken perfect. They didn't do anything except charge credit cards but, they looked great.

### "I was so upset"
Los Angeles to Paris via Keflavik. My friend and I checked in three hours early at LAX airport on 12th April for a much anticipated trip to Paris. From the beginning we noticed an uncaring, unfriendly attitude from everyone at WOW. We fell asleep whilst waiting to board  (we are both almost 70) and arrived at the boarding 8 minutes before take off and refused boarding! There were two girls there, the first girl was going to let us on but her manager refused, stating they had called us over the loudspeaker twice. This was not true. They could have easily let us on board. This was pure meanness. We were offered no alternative flight and so we lost our money, not to mention the Hotel cost of $150 a night that was already paid. We had to drive four hours back home and look for another flight. We ended up finding one with Air Tahiti two days later and had to pay an additional cost of $500 each. I was so upset I didn't want to fly back with them either so I cancelled my return trip and have not even been refunded the taxes! It couldn't have been worse. This so called budget airline ended up costing me so much money.

### "Don't be fooled by cheap tickets"
❌ Not Verified |  Don't be fooled by cheap tickets! You will end up paying the same price, if not more than other airlines. So please save yourself the agony. I purchased my ticket only to find out out have to pay separate charges for bags (they're not cheap). There's no convenience with WOW air. They charge 20$/kilo if you go over and will refuse to check in your bags if you don't pay on the spot. WOW air doesn't provide free food or water. The person seated in front of me woke up coughing asking for water, the stewardess refused to give him the cup until he handed over his credit card and successfully made the payment. If you're thinking about booking because you can squeeze in a visit to the springs during your layover, forget it! It's a hassle and will cost you close to 100$ for 1 person to just reach the city centre.

### "no service on board"
Toronto to Paris via Keflavik. Worst company, didn't check reviews before, my bad. Don't make mistake, no service on board without paying, you can't get water! Overall more expensive if you have normal airlines flight. Wanted visit Iceland using WOW in the summer, but now cancel all plans. Friends stay away.

### "Absolutely miserable"
Keflavik to Paris. First time visiting Europe, age 21, stuck in Paris, because Wow air cancelled the flight. I was excited to try wow air because i love how they offer affordable travel. I was hoping to leave a good review and share recommendations to friends. However I would never ever book again because it is not worth what you end up paying after they cancel your flight home last second. They told me the soonest they could get me out of Paris was a week. I could not stay another week, as I had already been there for 6 days. I had to pay $1,300 to get home to the United States, to Chicago. I submitted a claim on Jan. 9 for reimbursement of my added expenses due to my flight being cancelled and I did not hear back until April 12 when they told me that they are not responsible for reimbursement because the cancellation was due to weather. Even though the plane completed its route all the way to Chicago, without certain passengers on it. They did not even reimburse me the cost of the fare that I paid to get from Paris to Chicago! They cancelled my flight, kicked me off an overbooked flight, and neglected to pay me back for a fare I was unable to use. Absolutely miserable.

### "silly automated email responses"
Baltimore to Gatwick via Keflavik. Flight from BWI to KEF delayed 1 hour. During air time, there was a snow storm in Iceland and we spent two extra hours in the air and almost had to find a different airport to land at. Extra complaints - no options for a free snack like peanuts or even water; the flight attendants are rude and made guests feel uncomfortable. Missed our connecting flight to LGW. WOW gave us a bus voucher, hotel voucher, and food voucher. Our bus voucher could not get us on a bus - the bus drivers said "no, you go that bus over there" (broken English) - eventually there were no more bus options. We went inside, wandered for a good bit until we finally found a WOW employee, who told us to go outside (into the blizzard, I'll add) to look for the bus that originally told us we could not get on! After much arguing, WOW put us on a taxi to our hotel that was 45 minutes from the airport. The hotel was not ready for us and we waited, sleep-deprived in the lobby for two hours. The food voucher could only afford us bowls of soup from a restaurant that was not friendly. We were told to meet in our hotel lobby at 2:30AM and a bus would pick us up. The bus never came. Time was cutting close, so we opted to call a taxi to take us to the airport, or else we would miss our flight. The taxi ride costed us $200. There was no WOW air gates, so there was no representatives available to talk to. We stood in a random line in the middle of the airport which was our "gate". The line then turned into waiting in line outside. We were put on a shuttle and eventually walked outside (into the blizzard) to get on the plane. We filed a claim, multiple claims actually, and only receive silly automated email responses. I messaged their customer service on Facebook, and someone responded saying it takes up to 6 weeks to get a response on a claim. After a couple weeks waiting anxiously, I responded to one of the automated emails. Someone replied and said responses to claims can take up to 10 weeks -  basically, WOW just passes you around until you're too tired to complain anymore.

### "absolutely horrible experience"
Paris to Boston via Keflavik. What an absolutely horrible experience. We booked months in advance and paid for priority boarding, "XXL seating" and in-flight meals, we got none of what we booked or paid for. When we asked at the gate the WOW agent actually literally laughed at us and said so sorry nothing we can do! We flew economy on both legs of our trip even though we paid for premium seating. The in-flight crew was however very nice and appeared to care. We left the gate 2 hours late on the Iceland to Boston leg. They say buyer beware. In the case of WOW, just don't do it, you will be disappointed. We learned the hard way.

### "experience was rather pleasant"
New York to Amsterdam via Keflavik. My experience was rather pleasant. The cabin was new and clean with nice purple dimming lights to add a little flair to the experience. There was ample room in overhead bins for carry-on bags, so be sure to check the measurement requirements before paying the high fee to check your bag (I paid $75 but ended up stowing my suitcase in the bin.) The crew was nice and professional, and even alerted us as to when we might see the northern lights as we approached Iceland. The seats were basic but with plenty of leg room, and the window seat was close enough to the wall so I could lean against it while sleeping without getting a backache. I took a red eye flight and wanted to get good sleep so I didn’t mind not having inflight entertainment. There was one passenger in the front seat who freaked out because he thought the passenger next to him was chanting “Islamic hymns” but the guy he was referring to was clearly not a threat as he was sitting next to his wife and wearing quite fashionable sweats and sneakers. I was impressed with the crew who addressed the situation calmly and professionally and was able to assure the disgruntled passenger that he was safe. I’d highly recommend this airline, but be prepared: you’ll have to buy bottled water on board or before your flight as they don’t offer it for free; make sure the name on your flight ticket matches exactly what’s on your passport (with middle name spelled out); carry-on and checked baggage fees are higher than normal. Read all the fine print!

### "Worst flight ever"
Pittsburgh to Gatwick  via Keflavik. WOW air simply don't. Worst flight ever and that's saying something. I tried it out to see if it gave an option for those in the team flying to the US. Home leg i arrived at LGW 10 hours late, not a sign of free water in our 2 three hour tarmac stops even though passengers were standing at the door so as not to pass out. Flying narrow body planes to the US is madness a weather event gave us excess head winds and the pilot had to divert to Goose Bay to top up the fuel. Given a 1 star as zero was not offered.

### "do not have any customer service"
Tel Aviv to Chicago via Keflavik. The worst company I’ve ever flew with. It’s basically easier to say that they do not have any customer service! Know that if you’ll have any problem with your flight you’ve got no body to rely on!

### "Worst experience ever"
Frankfurt to Toronto via Keflavik. Worst experience ever. The flight got canceled and we were informed about the cancellation when it was time for the check-in. No help was provided at the airport concerning alternative options and we were advised to call the help service. The help service offered the options of taking a different flight three days later or canceling the trip and use a different airline. I opted for the different airline which was three times the price due to the last minute booking I had to make. I’ve been waiting for 8 months now for my compensation of 600€, and after sending about 25 emails back and forth they still haven’t managed to send the money. Conclusion: Avoid this airline at all cost, it will only cause you trouble which won’t be resolved in months.

### "middle names on tickets"
Montreal to Keflavik. The only one company to force European travelers to have middle names on tickets. The issue has been fixed for free for my first flight, but they asked me to pay for my return flight. Middle names are not mandatory for European travellers, but they can refuse the boarding if they want. It seems to be random when we search for similar issues on internet.

### "Worst flight experience ever"
Frankfurt to Baltimore via Keflavik. Worst flight experience ever. We were delayed 2 hours leaving Frankfurt. WOW provided no information about our connecting flights despite multiple requests until we landed. The majority of those flights, including mine, left without us leaving about 80 passengers stranded. Wow did not immediately confirm seats for the next day, instead leaving us to deal with their Horrible customer service staff and terrible online service to get a seat on the next day’s flight. They housed us in a “hotel” they own near the airport in a former military barracks. It’s really a hostel with common bathrooms and is a complete dump. We spent hours trying to confirm we were on the next flight out. Of course the flight was overbooked but we made it on, thank goodness. We will never fly WOW again

### "the worst experience ever"
Berlin to Baltimore Washington via Keflavik. Absolutely the worst experience ever. I read the reviews and should have bee warned. But I took a chance. I was denied boarding to a flight that took off and landed in Iceland. I was told my flight was canceled and there were no hotel rooms in all of Iceland. I showed a gate agent, who was not an employee of WOW available rooms and was still denied boarding. Given a piece of paper to call WOW and rebook. No WOW reps were ever available at the airport. After 45 minutes of waiting and a lot of struggle WOW could get me home 4 days later 4 days. They offered to put me in a roached out motel at the airport. with nothing to do but wait. I rebooked with a reputable carrier and came home. After a long horrible customer service experience they agreed to refund the cost of the ticket home and nothing more. 2 weeks later no refund. Another painful call and "there was a glitch your refund is coming" I was told I was speaking to a manger. of WOW. they must station their managers at a call center in India No refund out a lot more than had I booked with a real carrier. Never again and you have been warned.

### "customer service does not respond"
Boston to Reykjavik. This airline customer service does not respond in a timely or appropriate manner. Airport staff are rude and not helpful. They place young students on a class trip scattered throughout the plane amongst strangers. Think twice about using this airline.

### "employees became extremely rude"
I was flying with my husband and 2 babies (age 1 and 2) back from Tel Aviv to Baltimore Washington via Keflavik. Our first flight was first delayed by 55 minutes. Then, we boarded and waited for another 2 hours before taking off (we were told that the original route was not approved and a new route was being submitted for approval). 6 hours into the flight, we were casually told that we were stopping in Edinburgh, Scotland to refuel. The stop ended up taking 2 hours, and then we had a 2 hour flight to Iceland. By the time we arrived, we had been on aircraft #1 for 12 HOURS. (My kids were not delighted). We obviously missed our connecting flight, so we were put up at a hotel overnight, and told we'd be on the next flight to BWI the next day. We get to the airport the next day, only to be told we'd be flying first to Chicago, then to BWI. This is after travelling with kids for 36 hours. Our kids were falling apart, and we were too. We asked to be put onto an IcelandAir flight directly to Washington Dulles Airport. We knew that other WOW Air travelers with our exact itinerary were put on that flight. At this point, the WOW Air employees became extremely rude. Two employees deliberately hid their name tags after we politely asked for their names, one even yelled at my husband "never to do that again!". WOW Air employees lied to us, telling us that IcelandAir was no longer selling their tickets to WOW, and that the only way home was via a (WOW Air) flight to Chicago, then a (Spirit Air) flight to BWI. As this was all happening, I get a text message from WOW Air, telling me that my flight to Chicago was delayed. We ended up going to the IcelandAir desk and asking if they still had tickets on their flight to Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. that day (in 4 hours time). They said yes, and they were happy to sell them. We asked if they'd sell to WOW Air, and they said yes- but they were selling them at full price at this point (which obviously WOW didn't want to buy). After a lot of begging, pleading, and arguing with WOW Air employees, we told them we were just going to buy our own flight home, and then seek reimbursement and then some. One WOW Air employee agreed that this was the best thing to do. In the end, we spent over $1800 buying tickets on IcelandAir just to get home in the most straightforward, timely way possible. When we boarded that flight, I was physically and emotionally exhausted, nauseated, and had to ask the crew for painkillers. I could not imagine another baggage claim, security check, and flight home after that just to spare WOW Air a few bucks. We ended up arriving in Dulles at 6pm on 04/12. Our original arrival was scheduled for 7 pm on 04/11. If we took the Chicago flight home, we'd have arrived at 12 am on Friday, 04/13. We know because that happened to our friends. If WOW Air had been helpful we would not be so embittered. But they were not at all and that's why we'll never fly WOW Air again.

### "dissatisfied by my experience"
Gatwick to Keflavik. I must express how ineffectual WOW Air have made my claim by responding to me 13 working days after the fact; that is 19 days altogether. The result is that I was forced to, grudgingly, pay for additional flights at a greater cost to me and for fewer days on my trip. In the mean time, £190.46 of my money is out of my hands and I am struggling to reclaim it. I paid for WOW air's service on the 19th March, the funds were removed from my bank account but no error was brought to my attention by WOW air. I was not receiving an email with confirmation or a booking number. As my emailed inquiry yielded no response, I contacted WOW air's customer service line by phone, where I was told that no money had been received and the whole transaction had timed out. Where was my notification about this? No additional help was offered, certainly no offer of discount or priority to be seated on flights of similar dates. I simply had to purchase new flights. The last injury was to be charged an additional (approximately) £80 at the airport in Keflavik, moments before the flight as our hand luggage was assessed by WOW air's staff members and deemed to be far too large to be considered a carry on (it won't fit under the seat, therefore it must go in the overhead storage)- the difference being a matter of centimeters larger than the example cage available. We had no choice but to pay, or to abandon our luggage. An absolutely unreasonable policy, as the website states clearly that assigning luggage before the flight will cost much less than to do it at the airport, yet what is the justification for this price difference? The system is computerised, that's why we the customers are typing in all the information that WOW air needs to arrange flights, and the staff member that charged us this outrageous price (whilst apologising, stating it was the worst part of her job to enforce this) simply took our passport information and entered it into her computer. Was that typing what we paid for? We were blocked entry until we paid so I can only see that it was WOW air generating more labour for itself in this occasion. The perfect punchline to this experience was discovering that there was no more space in the overhead storage anyway. Our carry on bag that was apparently too big to fit under the seat, remained under the seat for the entire flight. I am so dissatisfied and frankly irritated by my experience with WOW air that I will make it a personal endeavor to avoid its service until some recompense and apology is offered. A budget airline indeed.

### "worst experience I ever had"
Tenerife to Washington via Keflavik. Very rude unprofessional get agents no respect for elders. We fly from Spain to Keflavik and then we were asked to pay extra for small wallet size hand bag on our connecting flight from Keflavik to Wasington which we end up shoving it on the side pocket of our carry on luggage . We were disappointed by the inconsistent, unprofessional, cold and rude behavior of the agent. She even said "you will not board this plane if you don't behave" just for trying to explain that we had the same carryon items that was allowed on our flight from Tenerife to Keflavik. My overall experience with this Airlines was very bad. What seems a cheeper price at the begging ended up being more than the other airlines. This was the worst experience I ever had.

### "avoid them at all costs"
Copenhagen to Montreal via Reykjavik. Absolutely terrible customer service, the flight staff was rude, did not assist passengers and were hard to find at the airport. The first flight was mildly better than the second, but both were delayed by a couple of hours and I almost missed my connection in Montreal. Also, no issues with my baggage on the first flight and then was charged ~$130 CAD for my next flight with no explanation and there was more than enough space (even empty spaces in the overhead compartments). I get they are a discount airline but they are BY FAR the WORST airline I have ever travelled with. My first and last time travelling with them. Save yourself the headache and avoid them at all costs. Oh and $3.50 for 500ml of water on a 5&1/2 hour flight is ridiculous.

### "Just avoid it at all cost"
Worst airline ever. I thought Ryanair pulled some questionable tactics in the past but Wow Air goes beyond that. I'm 6'3" (1.90m) and I couldn't fit in my seat (Glad I had the aisle seat, so I can put my legs to the side, although it's not pleasant to seat for almost 5 hours sideways). They don't even offer refreshments for long flights and the charged us 88CAD to carry our carry-on on board. Which wasn't big and had no issues with it in any other airline. Just avoid it at all cost, it's not worth it, really. They also don't have any kind of in-flight entertainment. Cabin crew was good and kind.

### "exhaustingly disappointing"
Beginning this review with "Worst Airline Ever" would be injustice to what WOW air actually is. Incapable, uncaring, rude, unprofessional and overall, exhaustingly disappointing. I had purchased my ticket a month in advance, checked in 24hrs in advance (3rd person to check in) and I was denied boarding. First reason I was given by the ground staff "Aircraft has been switched, the seat you were assigned does not exist on this plane. I called WOW, on hold for 30 minutes, to be told that the exact same thing by the agent over the phone. They were offering to book me on the next WOW flight, which was two (2!) days later. I refused. Told I had to wait 60 minutes and follow up then. Spoke with another agent 60 minutes later (after being on hold for another 30 minutes), to be told I was denied because the flight was overbooked. Put on hold multiple times, for the call to be "dropped" and for me having to call again. The third phone agent I reached asked me for the same information, and then proceeded to tell me that the reason was because I had misspelled my middle name on the boarding ticket. I do not have a middle name. They were grasping at straws trying to find an excuse. I emailed my passport information to them as well as the boarding pass so that the agent could review it. After 1.5 hours I was finally told I was denied because it was overbooked. No fault of my own, next flight was in 2 days, I could be booked on that. I refused and wanted a refund, as well as WOW covering my hotel charge due in Brussels. We are not able to refund you sir". Overall, absolutely horrible experience. Awful customer service, both in person and over the phone. Irresponsible. Mistakes happen, but you should take ownership in them. In one word - awful.

### "I recommend another airline"
Toronto to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Although I didn't have the worst experience with this airline, I was still quite unhappy with it. I know that airlines are now moving towards charging for carry-ons and bags separately, but the costs with WOW are absurd. I cannot say for certain, but it also looks like their carry-on measurements are below the average so be aware of this. They will measure your bag, and if it is over, they will not allow you to bring it on and you will need to pay a hefty fee to check it in. We saw them reject several carry-ons. The seats on the flight were tiny, and they do not provide any refreshments on-board. Considering the flight from Toronto to Reykjavik is 5 hours, not providing passengers with even a glass of water or a soda is unreasonable, especially because you cannot bring liquids through the gate. Since you are stuck at the Reykjavik airport, this is your only option to purchase food and drinks where a sandwich alone will cost you 20CAD. Our flight home was also delayed, so you end up spending more time in the airport than you plan to. Their business model sounds good in theory, since they offer cheaper flights with flexibility on what exactly you want to pay for, but the experience is just not worth it. The hidden costs add up quicker than you think, and your "cheap" flight only ends up being 100-200 less than a non-budget airline. Just pay the extra money since 1) you won't have to worry about showing up to the airport with a carry-on not up to their standards 2) you'll receive at the very least water so you don't dehydrate on board 3) the plane will be larger and more comfortable 4) you'll land in a bigger and cheaper airport if you have a stopover, but we often find direct flights with comparable prices. We travel oversees at least 3 times a year, and this experience was definitely the most unpleasant and uncomfortable, and took us an entire week to recover. Bottom line: if you really want to save a few extra bucks or travel very short distances sure. But if you want a smoother, efficient, and positive experience, I recommend another airline.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Keflavik to Los Angeles. People complain about no wifi or in flight entertainment but it is a budget airline. So as long as you know ahead of time that there are no TVs. You have to pay for anything you want including water ( the water was cheaper on the plane then in the airport!) You shouldn't have a bad experience. The flight was smooth. Flight attendants were nice. Plane was clean. Seats were comfortable. This flight was 60% cheaper than the next airline was. I would fly again in a second. No hesitation!

### "a pleasant experience"
I was apprehensive to fly WOW air after all the bad reviews I read. However I was pleasantly surprised flying from Newark to Reykjavik. Flights were on time and smooth. Cabin crew were very nice. The only complaint I had was the seat got uncomfortable after a while. I will bring a cushion next time or upgrade to a nicer seat. All in all a pleasant experience.

### "worst airline I have dealt with"
This is by far the worst airline I have ever dealt with and that is a very hard title to get. My son booked the the return tickets for me, himself and his 6 year old daughter about six weeks prior to the flight. We were going to visit my other son and his three children on spring break. In Ireland much to my horror we were refused entry to the flight because the name on my ticket was Gary C King and the name on my passport was Gary Charles King and my son had the same problem as the name on the ticket was Matthew Simon King and on the passport was Matthew King. On their web site is does not clearly state that the passport name must be used exactly on the ticket Had their system checked at any time prior to flight, they would have see the difference and could have and should have notified us to change the data. At the airport I pointed out that I had four pieces of picture ID, three government issued and my son had three. WOW's response, these do not count are we will not correct these tickets - call this number in Iceland. My son spent 1/2 hour on hold till he got an operator and another 3/4 hr trying to get Wow to correct the data. They refused and we thus missed the flight. We were not the only ones. A least 5 other people had the same problem and I presume some missed the flights. I was told from WOW'S staff in Montreal it is your problem not ours, Montreal never changes anything, if  Iceland want to it is their decision; you should have read the fine print. Lastly when I asked to see the person in charge she at first refused to see me, and after insisting, she finally showed her face and said she could do nothing. She also as a parting comment stressed that we should have read the fine print and then pulled out a blow up of that data underlined in yellow to prove her point to us customer with this problem. Obviously WOW Is totally aware of this problem and does nothing to solve it. At no time did they offer to change the tickets to a later date and when I asked to go "standby" as at least our three seats were now open, they refused. So my conclusion is correct. They now have the title as the worst airline I have dealt with in my entire flying life starting in 1963.

### WOW air customer review
Not impressed with WOW air, should be 'Woah Air'. They will allow you to carry on your hand luggage free of charge out of London Gatwick but you have to pay £70 to carry it out of Reykjavik Airport on the flight home! Is Iceland not expensive enough? Not happy.

### "Lesson learned never again"
Paris to Newark via Keflavik. The worst experience I had with them. Do yourself a favor stay away from them. Save money and time. They made me pay small little bag they didn’t tell me that I can carry on the board. They still made me pay 55€. Not to mention our flight is late one hour. Well I am still here in the airport in Paris, so who knows how much longer I have to wait. Lesson learned never again.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Keflavik to Alicante. Worst airline ever please avoid, starting with delays, lots of hidden charges so ticket will end up being more expensive than with other airlines. Terrible staff that doesn't care at all about passengers and is rude and unhelpful. Avoid at all costs, there are much better options for that route.

### "It is the worst airline"
Amsterdam to Baltimore via Keflavik. It is the worst airline that I had to deal with. They don't care and will, when they get a chance, deny everything. Lost two of my baggage on the way back to US, after a month got one of them shipped back to my house and the other was never shipped. As of today, I'm still waiting on my luggage and calling their "Lost/Delayed Baggage" team almost every other day for the status and get the usual run around and exact that I know by heart now "Please give us 24-48 hours to send this through and we will get back with you" but nothing happensl. I am the only one who keeps calling back. All they know is that my luggage is at the airport but nobody at the airport is answering the claiming dept to ship the item back to my house? I keep calling the airport for hours but no one answers. I keep calling the corporate and spent over $100 of phone minutes waiting on the line for hours since it's long distance but it's useless. Do yourself a favor and do not book with this airline.

### "a great budget airline"
I bought my ticket from Paris to Toronto via Keflavik from Wow air and didn't expect much because the ticket was $250 whereas the second cheapest ticket was $850. I traveled light with just a small (12x10x17 inc) backpack so I didn't have to pay extra. If you need a carry-on luggage, you will need to pay extra around $30 (pay online will be cheaper than pay at the door). All of my flights were on time. I notice that Wow's flights between Iceland and European countries are often overbooked (might be because Wow air is a budget airline) so you might want to check in online (very convenient) to secure a seat well before you get to the airport. Again, the ticket is cheap so you will have to pay extra for many things (food, water, entertainment, booze) but you definitely don't have to pay extra for good attitude from the flight crew, as long as you are respectful to them. I sat next to a smelly passenger (got headache from it) and kindly asked a flight attendant to switch my seat and she promptly found another seat for me. When the flight was going through turbulence, the flight attendant sitting near me constantly tried to calm me down (I was scared and sobbing). These two events prompted me to believe that Wow air is a great budget airline and I will definitely fly with them again. Buy your food before your flight if you don't want to eat/pay for food on the flight. You can buy the water bottle on the flight or fill an empty bottle before boarding to save money. Since Wow air sells their ticket from different countries' website, you can buy the same ticket at a lower price if you have one of those travel credit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fee. For example, I bought my ticket from the Canadian website which charges the ticket in Canadian dollars, which is cheaper (after currency conversion) than the same ticket bought in USD (from US website).

### "will fly Wow Air again"
Keflavik to Copenhagen. I enjoyed the flight and was able to sleep for about two hours. The automated check in was very easy. The boarding procedure was easy but did require us the wait in walk way for about 5 minutes before entering the plane. The plane was new and the seats had a place for a tablet to be mounted so as to watch movies (see photo). I will fly Wow Air again.

### "terrible customer service"
Los Angeles to Paris via Keflavik. I have never flown a worse airline or received worse customer service. Staff is nothing short of rude, abrasive and utterly unhelpful. I must say that with the cheap tickets you get what you pay for. Not only did they give my husband and I the run around, they denied us entry onto the flight and tried to sell us tickets for 5x the original price. Arbitrary fees, and terrible customer service. This cheap trip ended up being one of my most expensive and least pleasant (complete with tears from the rude treatment I received). Not only was the customer service awful, when I did complain the staff waited an entire month to return my email and when they did they simply said that it wasn’t their fault and that they closed the case. Isn’t the point of customer care? They nearly destroyed my entire wedding anniversary trip.

### "worst airline I ever tried"
Copenhagen to Chicago via Rekyavik. The worst airline I ever tried, the crew is so slow. Both flights were delayed, one was delayed half an hour and the other two hours, I missed my connecting flight from Chicago to Detroit because of that. They did not offer an overnight hotel for those missed their flights and we had to sleep at the airport overnight to catch another connecting flight in the morning. On top of that I paid extra 230 euros to add luggage and they did not deliver it to my final destination so I had to spay extra 60 USD to charge them from Chicago to Detroit. All in all the experience was awful. Do not use it.

### "didn't like my attitude or language"
On my way back from San Francisco to Frankfurt via Reykjavik, after an 8 hour flight and a 2 hour wait, as I was boarding my connecting flight they said I had to pay extra because my hand luggage was too big. I argued that it fit fine, after putting it in the metal container, and I had already done 3 flights with no problem, and wasn't willing to pay extra, so they said I couldn't board the plane unless I paid it. They said that because the wheels were sticking out of the box that it was too big. The gate was closing, and they threatened to close it if I didn't pay. We were arguing about it for about 5 minutes, so I paid it, and angry and frustrated I ran to the entrance of the aircraft to board the plane. Down the aisle they stopped me at the aircraft door and wouldn't let me on the plane and said that they didn't like my attitude or language. The police arrived and escorted me back into the check in area and told me to get another flight with another airline. They charged me the baggage fee and then left me stranded in Reykjavik. I missed my next connecting flight, and I had to to buy another one last minute in order to make it home in time for an important event. I have never had an issue with my suitcase in the past with other airlines. I have read countless negative reviews about this airline and would like to warn other passengers to avoid this airline if they wish to avoid hidden fees and bad customer service.

### "irresponsible and arrogant"
San Francisco to Keflavik. Didn’t get my luggage, no luggage fee refund! I flew to Iceland for a winter vacation. However, when I landed Reykjavik, my check-in luggage did not arrive with me. To make a long story short, I didn’t have any belongings with me the entire trip. It was not until when I return at SFO airport did I pick up my luggage again. I filed a claim ticket online with WOW air the next day on 12/19. Because I was not aware that I need to retain the receipts for reimbursement, I could only hope to get refund for the additional check-in luggage fee that I paid for (and receipt submitted). It’s been way over 3 months now. During this time, I have emailed them numerous times, checking on the status. But no, they are not going to give me the full refund and have cut off communication with me. I’m done dealing with them. It’s a shame that this airline can be so irresponsible and arrogant.

### "no joy on a flight with them"
I would advise people to avoid this airline. Yes the prices are very cheap but there is a reason. The seats are hard and flimsy like cardboard, leg room is minimal, and they will not even offer you tap water for a 7 hour flight. There is no inflight entertainment, no wifi, and no joy on a flight with them. Long flights have smaller cabin space and they have stiffer weight/size requirements on both carry on and check in luggage. Everything cost extra and you were constantly asked to donate money or purchase things on your flight. Additionally delays are plentiful and unexplained. They were consistently late on departures and arrivals which was a pain for connecting flights. They also delayed my luggage and their customer service was rude and nonexistent. Hands down the worst airline I have ever flown. I regret trying to take the cheap route because the poor traveling experience has put a damper on my vacation. I wish someone warned me before I got on the WOW plane.

### "rude, impatient and unwilling to help"
Our WOW air flight was cancelled out of Miami 10 minutes after boarding was scheduled to commence. This was on a Monday. We were given 2 choices, be put in a hotel until Friday for the next flight or be refunded our tickets. No-re routing or other choices for those of us who had to be at our destinations the next day. The staff were very rude, impatient and unwilling to help. This observation matches moat of the comments on the airline. I took a chance. Never again. You'll be tempted by the pricing but the headache and inconvenience are not worth the savings.

### "Poor service on board"
I was sitting in row 3 on both flights, Brussels to Reykjavik and Reykjavik to Miami. For the first time I have experienced flight crews that limit the use to passengers of the forward toilet. An absolute never-again moment for me. There was a gaggle of cabin attendants continuously in the front galley of this A330-200. They did their normal thing in the cabin and spent a lot of time eating and drinking and chatting behind closed curtains. Before take-off the lavatory lock was set to closed (normal procedure, lifting the tab and closing the lock) but I noticed that the red light in the cabin remained red for a long time, well into the cruise phase of the flight. I assumed that unlocking the lavatory was somehow forgotten so I got up to ask and go to the toilet. I was told by a cabin attendant that the lavatory was “inoperable”. Which is not a word a cabin attendant will voluntarily use. Unserviceable” maybe, or “broken”. I got back to my seat and started paying attention to this. With no inflight entertainment I had plenty time to do this. And what happened? From time to time the lavatory occupied light in the cabin went from red to green, then back to red, and so on. The lavatory was being used. At the same time, every passenger who came forward to use the lavatory was told to go to the back. Each and every one. I’m actually really upset by this. The cabin attendant who told me that the lavatory was “inoperable” lied to my face. If for some reason WOW has a policy of limiting the use of the front lavatory for (flight) crew only, then so be it. But then be open about it and do not lie to me. After the flight I had the urge to wait for the captain to appear from his cockpit to congratulate him on having such a strong bladder because during the almost 8 hours that they have been in their seats, not once did I see either one of the flight crew making a trip to the back of the aircraft to make a lavatory visit. There was no need of course. They had their own “inoperable” lavatory. Else: Poor in-flight food / I find the meal choice a very slim one for a 7.5 hour flight. Also weird that on my first flight I was given 2 meals for both flights (“this is how we do things” said the cabin attendant on my first flight). Then on my second flight I was given another meal. Now I had three. Cabin on board not clean/comfortable / The cushion of my big seat was flat and loose. The big seats don’t have enough pitch, and I could not use my laptop when the passenger in front had his seat back in my lap. Poor service on board / My biggest gripe on these flights. While the WOW PA is not bad, certainly better than most I've listened to and funny at times even, the cabin crew really is not interested in the passengers, other than milking money. They spend as much time as is possible behind their closed curtains (front) unless a passenger needs something (which means buying something) and then it’s all smiles and “how can we help?”. Poor in-flight entertainment / So I found out that one either brings their own device or can rent an iPad. Lost opportunity for WOW there, assuming they understand about aircraft connectivity, sales channels and the further benefits this may bring in aircraft operations and customer information tracking.

### "you get what you pay for"
I would advise against flying WOW air. I flew out of BWI and they straight up lied to me saying that my connecting flight was down for maintenance. They lied because the connecting flight left on time but was overbooked and it was their way of getting around the fact that they were supposed to compensate people who were bumped (I literally watched my connecting flight leave from Reykjavik). I have since been in contact with WOW air for 4 months and they continue to lie to me about compensating me. For four months they have said that the will be making this right and yet, nothing. I know that this airline is cheap but you get what you pay for. Something is always wrong with the flight and you will never get to your destination on the day you’re supposed to. Also, expect to pay for literally everything, cup of water, packet of peanuts, any entertainment, WiFi. I used the lavatory when I boarded the flight before takeoff, when I put soap on my hands I realized the water did not work, I immediately notified the flight attendant and she told me to just rub it off on something. I said that I’m not going to rub lathered soap on my clothes so she eventually went and got a bottle of water and gave me the smallest drop, like as if we were rationing for the upcoming siege. Eventually I was able to use some of the toilet paper and get the soap off. What a joke of an airline.

### "checked baggage was left in Iceland"
Horrible - First there was a mad dash in Paris because the flight was leaving half hour before expected departure. Second, Iceland was a mess and the gate changed a few times. A fight broke out. We waited in Iceland for what seemed an eternity. Upon landing we are informed that the the checked baggage was left in Iceland for transfer passengers. It took a week to get my things, but I had to go myself. The one attempt to deliver my luggage was at 1am and they provide no fedex tracking just a reference number and a few 72 hour windows. If you work a job, you would need to call off to be 100% available for the mysterious courier. I had medicine in my luggage so had to get emergency refills which were very expensive plus going back to the airport. Not worth the few hundred saved. Fly Norwegian, they haven't let me down yet.

### "most inconsiderate lying airline"
I had reserved 2 seats on WOW flying from San Francisco to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. We live 2.5 hours from SFO so we went to San Francisco the night before (Friday) to stay and get on the plane on the next Morning (Saturday). During dinner on Friday I received an email from WOW stating that our flight was canceled due "Operational" issues. I called customer service at WOW and asked if the flight was cancelled, meaning no plane on Saturday or were we Bumped. They stated due to operational issue the flight was cancelled and there was no plane for us on Saturday morning, keep in mind i was already checked in and had electronic boarding passes. The airline sent me a email stating we could re book on another flight or have a full refund for our tickets. Being we had a boat booked in Amsterdam to sleep in on Sunday and Monday which was too late to cancel as well as a connecting flight on Tuesday to Prague with another airline as well as a hotel then fly back to Amsterdam and then a return flight on WOW to SFO I opted for another flight, all along asking if Flight 162 on Saturday was cancelled or were we bumped??? WOW answer was flight 162 is canceled but we will rebook you on flight 162 on Saturday the 24th February. A whole week later. This would not work, so we cancelled and took the refund. We rebooked on SAS,  tickets cost us an additional $800.00, in Addition we lost a night on the boat in Amsterdam, had to book another night in San Francisco, meals, parking etc. we were out about $1500 because WOW had no consideration for our plans. On Saturday Morning we slept in. About 1140 a.m. i walked out of my Hotel near the airport and looked up to spot a purple plane taking off. It was WOW 162 en route to Reykjavik! I confirmed this with flight tracker! So WOW lied to us saying flight was cancelled. In numerous emails to WOW they finally confirmed that the flight was not cancelled but that all via passengers were bumped off the flight. Meaning if you were passing thru you were cancelled! WOW had no consideration for our plans. Take a look as many other reviews as you can regarding WOW before you book. You will see most of them are not good. My advice is don't ever Fly WOW. By far the worst most inconsiderate lying airline out there. By the way, I flew WOW in December 2016 so I have been on WOW.

### "a very unfortunate travel experience"
This was the worst travel experience I have ever had. On our departing flight, our flight was cancelled and WOW could not put us on another flight for 48 hours. Please note that no other airlines work with WOW so it is impossible to be picked up on another fight. Then the flight we were put on two days later was cancelled as well, effectively making us lose three days of our vacation. We were notified of the cancellations only about an hour before the flights each time. Then, on our return flight home, our bags were lost. Overall, this was a very unfortunate travel experience. Take it from me: it is not worth the extra few hundred dollars for service. Do not fly with WOW air.

### "Boarding was reasonably fast"
Flew WOW air from Chicago to Frankfurt via Reykjavik. Meal service was not available, so we were allowed to bring our own food. Being the third airplane I ever stepped on, I did not notice any other deal-breaking inconveniences. Boarding was reasonably fast, the seats don't have screens in them but that's what smartphones are for. The lights were turned off to let us see the northern lights for a solid half hour. The interior looks a little sketchy, but it flies and it's cheap. That's all I need.

### "like the service they offer and the price"
I traveled on Wow air from Chicago to Reykjavik in Basic Economy on 14th February 2018. They now do have Basic, Plus, Comfy and Biz. I checked in using the machines and it was very easy. The flight overall was very comfortable without any turbulence. The pilot kept us updated about being able to see the northern lights which was quite exciting seeing them from the plane. The flight arrived 20 minutes early at 3.50am. I will fly Wow air again as I like the service they offer and the price.

### "not a terrible experience"
Found cheap flights to Iceland and booked on WOW air, mainly because they were the only airline offering non-stop flights. Then, I read all the mostly-negatives reviews. I decided that I knew what I was in for (no entertainment, no free meals or drinks, etc.) and decided the reviewers were probably just hard-to-please. I paid for the checked bag and carry-on. Turns out, we didn't need carry-ons, so that was a waste of money. Also paid for "priority boarding". Found out that meant you get to board a bus first that takes you half way across the airport to get on the plane. Not so bad in L.A., but when landing in Iceland at 4.00 am, in cold and blowing snow, one really doesn't want to wait at the top of a flight of stairs while a second bus is brought up to carry passengers to the terminal. And, it's annoying to see empty gates at which the "real airlines" get to park. Obviously, one of the ways WOW saves money is by not paying to use those jetways. The bus trips are a true annoyance. Flights not so bad (paid for a "comfy" seat in front, a must!) as long as you bring a sandwich and water. Flight crews not especially helpful or friendly. Found out that it's much cheaper to buy the food on board (which didn't look bad) rather than buy food in Iceland. $45 for 2 cheeseburgers in the terminal opposed to $11 for a meal on board. All in all, not a terrible experience, and it beat 5-24 hour lay-overs on other airlines.

### "You get what you pay for"
This was my first time using WOW air flying from Newark to Reykjavik. I was skeptical going in, and then I was pleasantly surprised. I can excuse a two hour late departure time. And I can get over not having a blanket, pillow or even a glass of water without having to pay for it. This is a budget airline so that's the way it's done. Coming back to the USA, the line was very long but they let me cut it so that I could make my flight. You get what you pay for! My experience was good.

### "A horrible experience!"
Amsterdam to Miami via Reykjavík. A horrible experience! Everything seemed to be extremely uncoordinated, there was a huge delay, and when I finally could enter the plane, and I reached my designated seat, 30A, I found someone already sitting there. The other passenger was trying to explain to me that their family was split so they changed seats to get together. But he was harshly interrupted by the horrible plane crew who tried to push me around in a hurry, with not the slightest trace of politeness. They seemed to be in a hurry, but that’s not my problem. I had, at that time, just entered the plane. They put me on seat 16E instead. Again - it's not an issue for me to relocate, but the sheer impoliteness of this staff is outrageous. They didn't even offer me anything as a courtesy (what about a glass of water, since you let us pay for anything and everything!). Apart from that, a few times it occurred that the speakers were squeaking loud as if they had problems with microphone feedback. Not pleasant, either. And in general, I want to remark that having no real meal on a transatlantic flight is sheer craze! What you sell for expensive money is only roast, wheat, pizza. Not a single offer with vegetable and/or meat. I checked the food reservation for my flight back already - only a pizza is selectable. That’s nothing to choose from. I will still have to endure the flight back to Amsterdam with this airline. I hope it won't get cancelled out of nowhere, like many others have stated here. Never ever fly WOW air! They think they are hip and funny, and they say "We hope you enjoyed our service", which is a sheer farce - what service are they speaking of?

### "everything about this airline was quite awful"
I bought a return ticket from Paris to Toronto and I liked the option of not having to pay for a checked-in luggage on the return trip so my ticket was cheaper than usual. (I had a check-in luggage going but not coming back). However, everything about this airline was quite awful. Because the flight stopped over in Iceland, each trip took 2 flights so altogether, I was on four flights, and each flight was late. It seemed like they don't know what they're doing so everything took longer than normal. Due to cancelled flights (snow storm), the flight I was supposed to be on was already full so they bumped me to a later flight, that was one version from a WOW service agent. Another version was that they split the group into two flights using smaller airplanes with one departing as scheduled and the other departing one hour later and they put me on the later flight which I contested but they said they couldn't change that even though when everybody boarded, there were seats left on the earlier flight. They said that the names of passengers on each flight was fixed one hour before departure and these names cannot be changed. The flight I took was one hour late so in the end, I arrived 2 hours later than scheduled. So if you're on a budget and have all the time in the world, then WOW air is ok, but if you're on a schedule, this is an airline to avoid because it seems like most of their flights are late. I've checked randomly WOW air flights that have landed for the day and so far, I have seen that every flight has landed late. It's possible that certain flights are on time and I didn't see them, but you can do that as well, just check on any given day any airport with WOW arrivals.

### "can't cross your legs"
I know it's a new trend. Several airlines are cutting down on costs and services. I have recently flown WOW and Volaris. I will never fly either one again. No blanket, no food, no water, nothing. No leg room. You can't cross your legs. Almost $4 for a bottle of water? Same for coffee. Seats don't even have a head rest, so good luck trying to sleep.

### "appalling attitude and service"
London Gatwick to Keflavik. Our flight was cancelled on the morning of our departure. We were made aware of the cancellation by text and told to "fill in an online form" and await a response. We did not get one until 24 hours later, at which point they tried to put us on a flight on the day we were due to return. We attempted several times to call the UK phone number advertised for them on their website and found the line had been switched off so we could not speak to anyone. With no other option we ended up having to travel 2.5 hours to the airport to be given a cold and unsympathetic response by the check in staff and no available options for an alternative flight. Although this was due to bad weather in Iceland no attempt was made by the airline to reschedule our flight. To make matters even worse we learned whilst we were at the airport that they had used our flight slot instead to send an earlier scheduled flight. I have never known such appalling attitude, service and lack of communication. God forbid anyone who books with them and has an issue with their flight. It just seems that nobody at WOW Air wants to know about it. I'm now £1500 out of pocket for a break I could not get to and going through the stress of now trying to get them to organise a refund.

### "found the experience value for money"
Montreal to Dublin via Keflavik. I found the experience value for money. I only flew them because I had left my booking 'till the last minute and the fare was $780 USD versus $1200 on BA. But in nearly every aspect of the journey it was fine. You prepare yourself for flying an LCC by dressing super casual, bring your reading and a loaded Ipad, plus a pillow and of course food. Cocoon yourself and the journey does go by. One key suggestion is to pay the extra $100 each way and get seat selection in their "XXL" cabin which has 35" of pitch vs 32" on the left side which is just "XL" and the back 2/3 of the plane which is a cramped 30" or even worse. With the exception of one nasty gate agent in KEF - who shouted to get everyone upstairs to board while the bridge was jammed and people tripping over the stalled escalator, all staff interactions were fine. The crews on all 4 segments were either good or great. Yes you pay for water, so bring your own bottle and fill it at the airport! Yes you pay $12 for two beer. The A321 has much wider seats than the 787 or the 10 abreast 777 so that made things more comfortable. However, be careful when booking as it appears only 4 of their 321 fleet have such a large XXL or XL cabin in the front. I would dread to be on one of their super high density A321s at 220 seats (these 4 have only 200 seats). The connection in KEF was too long in both directions but plenty of super expensive cafes and power outlets. Plus the cleanest toilets I have ever seen in the world, this is a great plus for a transit. My only complaint, and this is major, is that the seats had cushions that were squashed flat. They were so thin that it felt like you were sitting on a sliding metal pan. For God's sake WOW, put new seat cushions in. If it wasn't for that, I would have rated the experience an 8. If the fare was within $200,sure I would have flown on someone like BA (for points, IFE and booze) but overall it wasn't that much of a torture. I suspect sitting in the back half of the cabin would have been however. Just realized, I had an empty seat beside me on all sectors. That does make a big difference on the journey!

### "food good, seats comfortable"
Toronto to Paris via Reykjavik. I had a passport issue and a staff member went above and beyond assisting me with renewal of my passport, as well as booking another one way flight. Also during the flights all staff members were friendly with smiles and manners. They were probably the best flight attendants I have seen from any airline. The food was good and the seats comfortable. The only complaint would be to have some sort of on-board entertainment and charging stations.

### "customer service is atrocious"
I understand why they call it WOW air now. This is the worst of the worst! I am a very seasoned traveler, and I have never encountered such an inept series of errors that caused me to move my flight a week before travel, get refused boarding at check-in, and be forced to fly on Icelandair. Their customer service is atrocious, their policies are purposely deceptive, and the entire experience was tantamount to theft. I was traveling from Los Angeles to Reykjavik. A week before flying I received an email stating that the flight on Jan 31 was "seriously delayed" and to call customer service to arrange a new date. A new date? That's called a cancellation! After spending 20 minutes waiting for their Indian call center to answer, the lady would only tell me the flight was delayed indefinitely, however, if I could book through Chicago at the same cost since there were no other flight options for me that same date (WOW has only one flight per day from LAX, and not each day) I could get myself to Chicago before their 4.50 pm departure with nominal effort on United since I couldn't change my vacation dates. I was told to file a claim via their website to have any consideration of refunding the difference between flying from LAX and Chicago, especially since they charged me an additional $12 to have an assigned seat. After several attempts to file a claim and arguing via Facebook with their customer service, they admitted that their website didn't have a claim service, so they sent me a link via email saying they would get back to me within 72 hours. It's now 11 days with no response. I get to Chicago, but their check-in is only open 3 hours prior to boarding. I try to check-in, but they refuse to check me because my passport name was different than what was on my ticket (Tim versus Timothy). They tell me to step aside to call customer service to have it corrected since the gate agents can't do anything. After waiting in line for 25 minutes, the guy spends another 15 minutes making me hold before telling me there is nothing he can do because their policy does not allow changes within 4 hours of boarding. So, if you have any type of issue, they can't help you since they open three hours before boarding. So, I'm left stranded in Chicago. The best part is that the flight was delayed 1.5 hours, so technically my change was within the four hour window, but they wouldn't help me. The good news is I found my way to Icelandair, and had a very pleasant experience because they had a flight that left at 6.40pm. The agent told me when I bought the ticket that they get a lot of business from people kicked off WOW at the last second. Another funny thing is WOW sent me a customer service request via email, but their link failed! Bottom line: Do yourself a favor and take Icelandair to Iceland. WOW is totally incompetent.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Flew WOW air from Newark to Berlin via Keflavík. First leg of flight out of Newark, NJ, US was delayed by two hours with no explanation given. Upon finally landing in Reykjavik, Iceland, the staff read out the gates for all the connecting flights (there were at least six different connections), and didn't say whether or not the connecting flights were waiting for the passengers or not. What should have been a layover of about an hour was reduced to almost nothing after we finally got through customs and literally ran through the terminal to our new gate. When we landed in Berlin, Germany, we went down to baggage claim only to discover that our luggage had not, in fact, been put on our connecting flight, and had been left in Reykjavik. With only our carry-ons and no changes of clothing, all we could do was go to our hotel and fill out WOW's online lost luggage form. It was unnecessarily confusing, vague, and repetitive, and there's no guarantee we'll even get our luggage back before our trip is over. Literally the only positive in this event is that the seats were decently comfortable. Do not fly this airline.

### "worst airline I have ever traveled with"
Having flown with Wow air almost 60 times since they first began operations, only because they currently have a monopoly on the Dublin - Keflavik route, I can safely say they are the worst airline I have ever traveled with, worse than Ryanair ever were in their heyday. They are slow, inefficient, late - I have had a flight depart on time, I believe, twice - the staff are unfriendly. In May this year, Icelandair begin a Dublin - Keflavik route and I will be saying goodbye to Wow air forever. No amount of money, no price difference, could entice me to book a Wow Air flight again of my own free will. I will gladly pay double to fly with Icelandair and collect my points with their loyalty programme. If you have a choice, I would never recommend flying with Wow Air, unless you are on a strict budget and the price difference is substantial, spare yourself and pick another airline. I thought I could submit a 0/10 overall rating, but it appears I cannot, so they get a 1/10.

### "just have delays upon delays"
Gatwick to San Francisco via Keflavik. Gatwick To SFO was delayed twice and eventually cancelled. The next available flight they offered was after 3 days, and that to with another stop in LAX. There is no real staff at airport counters or gate. They all advise to email or call support number On calling support number, they say systems are down! They left me abandoned without my EU passenger Rights. They only booked hotel for one night, second day I was removed due to non payment by WOW. No lunch was available and dinner was offered in one garden restaurant. I went home after the hotel not being paid. This cost me £120 one way, plus the money I paid arriving to he airport originally. The United flight I had to pay for my checked in bag even though staff promised it would be taken care off. All WOW air say is keep your receipts and email them to see if they will approve and reimburse I’m not holding my breath. I am not prepared to use the return flight in summer now. These fools just have delays upon delays. Not worth it

### "poorest customer service I have had"
Toronto to Frankfurt via Keflavik. So far the poorest customer service I have ever had with any airline so far. They will never admit that they need improve despite the fact that they already have terrible reviews online. People tend to fly through them because of the their cheap price just to give their airline a try. However, after paying for your carryon luggage fee (Not including check in bags), and meals, or anything, it is pretty much the same as you are flying through the rest of the airlines. I strongly would not recommend this airline to anyone for any reason. I recently purchased a round trip tickets from Toronto to Germany, the staffs there made me check my bag's size excessively (even after I have explained that it was checked previously). Not only that, I felt like I was singled out for some unknown reason. I was the only one sitting in the gate who was asked to be checked, no the staff didn't ask anyone else. I was self-conscious of the bag and had weighted it multiple times before, and made sure that it wasn't over the weight since I know the policy with WOW airline how they would charge a large amount of fee for overweight/oversize luggage. when I have contact their costumer service regarding this, I was replied with following email by a staff "WOW air fully trusts their employees at the airport to follow the carry-on policy. The rule is simple, the carry-on bag has to fit horizontally in the bag sizer, which is located at the check-in and by the gate. If a guest arrives with baggage exceeding their allowance, our service agents will request an extra payment. Not only this message did not address my concern, it was not helpful at all. it was completely waste of time try to contact them and wait days for any reply. Therefore, if you have any flight related questions or issues before flying, I would not expect them to reply before your flight even if it is a week ahead. I also called them before my flight because I Had a question about the carry on actually, and was put on hold for over 25 minutes, and no one answered in the end. I sent them a email regarding carry on questions on 1/16. No one replied until 1/27, which was not helpful at all, because my flight was on 1/22. Overall, all around terrible service. The ticket does not include any food (not even cracker) drink (not water either). So expect them to "kindly" tell you no to everything.

### "Terrible airline company"
Paris to Montreal via Reykjavik. Terrible airline company. Flight attendants who don’t even bother to try and speak your own language, no matter what the city of departure or your destination is. No food, no water, high cost for what they consider to be an extra size luggage (actually even a small carry on luggage fits in this category). This flight is a nightmare. Don’t expect to arrive on time. You’ll be late for absolutely no reason (they won’t even bother telling you why the plane doesn’t take off). Don’t expect watching a movie either. This is no low-cost company.

### "flights were on time"
After reading a few reviews prior to flying with WOW, I was nervous. I flew with them from Toronto to Amsterdam and back. Flights were on time, and if not, they would give a (very valid) reason why they were not (we had to wait for 15 min once because a passenger was late due to a delayed incoming flight he was transferring from). In flight service was great. Although food or beverages are not provided, you can buy them on board, and they are not that expensive (given that the cost of our ticket was $550 less than the next cheapest return ticket to Amsterdam)! We ended up buying food at the airport in advance. Although the planes are quite small, they were very new. I have a fear of flying, so to me that was very important.

### "horrible customer service"
San Francisco to Frankfurt. Worst airline, horrible customer service. I bought my ticket to Frankfurt in October. I called WOW  air to verify that I wouldn’t have to reserve my seat online that it can all be handled at the airport, because when I tried to reserve online it would cost me $200 extra for regular seat. I come to my flight on time get my baggage checked in (paid extra 80$ for my baggage) and get told what gate to go to, I go thru TSA and get to my gate to have my ticket scanned and to get told that there is no room on this flight and I would have to rebook! How does that make any sense I have no idea! I requested a full refund. Waste of your  money. And when you try to solve a problem and figure out how to not be stuck at the airport all  day the workers don’t even know how to do their job and help you. Just tell you what they can’t do.

### "never fly this airline again"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles via Keflavik. This review is after my second time flying Wow. The first time my flight was great. My second time was challenging to say the least coming home to LA. After Security I had to walk to the furthest corridor to reach my gate. Once there I noticed that the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. After 30 minutes of sitting at the gate, the flight had a gate change. Now we have to walk to the other side of the airport. We reach that gate My flight from AMS-KEF was delayed again an additional 20 minutes. My original flight was due to depart at 10:50 and the new departure time is 12:15. Once on board the cargo hooks were not working. Maintenance had to come and fix that issue prior to us taking off. The pilot said it can be anywhere from 5-30 minutes. The passenger were irate because WOW cancelled a slew of flights the previous day for some non existent storm. When we departed AMS it was well after 1pm. My connecting flight to LA was departing at 4:00 and my flight from AMS-KEF was 2 1/2 hours. We arrived in KEF at 3:15. We didn’t pull to the gate instead we departed the plane in the middle of the air field and took the shuttle to the terminal. Plus I still had to go through passport control. When I looked at the monitor upon entering the terminal the LA flight was on “final call”. I made the flight to LA, and landed safely.I pulled my bag from the baggage carousel and attempted to pull up my handle and it would come up. I looked at my bag closer and I noticed snow and mud marks on my bag. When I checked my bag in at AMS my bag was fine. I wasn’t quite sure what to do, so I tweeted WOW Airlines asking them what I should do and till this day 2/2 they never responded to me. I left LAX and proceeded to call WOW the next morning. I had the rudest customer service rep. As I am explain what happened he is cutting me off and is just plain rude. I asked to speak to a supervisor he told me that they were busy. I told him I could hold and he said that wasn’t possible and hung up on me. I called again and he answered again I told him I have all day to wait. It was 5 am in LA (clearly I had all day). He hung up again and this time I was pissed. I called the ticket customer service and explained my situation. I asked the representative for WOW corporate address or phone she wouldn’t give it out. I then went to my public twitter that has about 500 followers and stated my disservice and surprise surprise someone responded. I called the baggage claim department again and the same person gave me a number for LAX baggage claim. I called the number and the number was out of service. I called again and he finally sent me a claim form. By this time it was about 7am. I filled out the form and sent it back. A few days later I received an email from WOW stating that my bag looks “fixable” and to take it in. If it’s not fixable then submit a letterhead from the luggage repair shop stating such. I took my bag in and the metal located inside the suitcase was busted. My bag is not fixable. I sent in the documentation and they still will not honor it. I will never fly this airline again!

### "Do not travel with WOW air"
Toronto to Brussels via Keflavik. If I could give WOW less than one star, I would. I will start off by saying that WOW give you nothing - even water costs money. We were fully prepared for this, bringing our own meals. Our problems started with a three hour delay as the plane was stuck on the tarmac with us in it. They didn't even give us water during this time. As a results we missed our connection to Brussels. WOW did put us up in a basic hotel, but the hotel was not infant friendly (i.e. no pack and play!). As a result of these delays, I missed my business interview. To top it off, they broke our baby stroller. We reported the damage in Brussels upon arrival and filed a claim with WOW. Surprisingly, they said the broken stroller was not their fault as we had "not packed it properly". We always bag our stroller and have never had issues on other airlines. Do not travel with WOW air.

### "Newish planes. Luggage arrived"
Needed one way Tel Aviv - Chicago, and at $119, even adding the $90 for luggage/carry-on/seat selection to make it $220, WOW air just can't be beat. Not even close. Easy enough to bring food and water and entertainment, and they are very upfront about it, so I don't understand complaining about that. On the plus side, flights left and arrived basically on time. Newish planes. Luggage arrived. Small airport in KEF, relatively comfortable, easy connection, Working outlet by the seat. I've had a lot worse. But it is sitting on a A321/320 seat on a very full plane for 8+ hours and again for 6+ hours. If you're good with that, it's a reasonable experience. And if something goes wrong, you're pretty much on your own.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Keflavik to Boston. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I paid for the XXL leg room as I was traveling with a lap infant, the plane was over 3 hours late, had to stand in gate hallway for over an hour, then the plane we were bussed to did not have the XXL seats! I've been trying for weeks to get a refund for the extra amount I paid for XXL seats. Customer service hotline has taken over 2 hours to finally speak with someone, and then when I spoke to a person she told me to email the complaint with image of boarding pass. Received an email 2 weeks later that I could tell was automated and basically said sorry for the delayed wait time "if you still need assistance relay to this email. Absolutely disgraceful. I will never fly Wow Air again. Worst airline I have ever flown.

### "Stay clear of this company"
Extremely bad experience with WOW! I called to cancel my booking 20 minutes after booking it and they refused to refund me. They said that the reason I'm not eligible for a refund is that I paid in £ not $ but I live in the UK and when I pay with my card over the internet, I have no control over the currency it's paid in. They also refused to put me through to a manager and hung up on me. Stay clear of this company. I've never heard of them but as far as I'm concerned they are a scam and I will be taking this further to get my money back.

### "connecting flight was canceled"
Miami to Keflavik. My flight was delayed and then our connecting flight was canceled, therefore they denied us boarding. We were instructed to call customer service as there is no physical help desk, but of course no one answered. Many people were in this same situation. I filed a claim for tours and hotels booked, but they were dropped as well. No compensation was given.

### "not be the airline I'll fly with"
Toronto to Berlin via Reykjavik. We flew to Berlin with WOW November 30th, 2017 with a short layover in Reykjavik. I checked a suitcase and paid the fee. The suitcase arrived in Berlin 24 hours later with a red sticker, indicating it had been opened at customs. The problem was two brand-new items, Christmas gifts, were missing from the suitcase. When I informed WOW of what happened, I got a polite response about how sad the felt and for me to contact the police. They could not prove anything. They were responsible for my luggage since they charged me a fee to take it. If I ever need to check-in luggage, WOW will not be the airline I'll fly with. They don't take responsibility for your luggage and obviously some people open suitcases and take/steal passenger's belongings. So be aware of that, if planning to check-in your valuables with WOW.

### "the worst flight experience"
WOW air definitely managed to wow me to the fullest by offering the worst flight experience in my life. I was flying from my vacation in the US from Baltimore to Amsterdam with a stopover in Keflavik airport. We got on the airplane in Baltimore without any problem and never expected what was about to happen. After all passengers were on board the captain announced that they have hard time closing the luggage door of the aircraft. He said that it is not supposed to cause any serious delays. After waiting for one hour on board the captain made another announcement that the door is still stuck and they need to find some equipment with hot water to unfreeze it. In the end, we stayed for 3,5 hours on board waiting for them to fix the luggage door. Upon arrival to Keflavik, we were just told to go to the meeting point to receive further information as all flights to Europe by WOW air left without waiting for any passengers who flew from the US or Canada. We waited for 8 hours for any information to arrive without any support or assistance from WOW air. No food or drinks were served, no communication was done whatsoever. In the end, after 8 hours of waiting, all people who missed their European flights were told to fly to Brussels instead and take a bus to their final destination. When we got on the Brussels airplane, we were told two things. First, we will fly with a stopover in London. Second, we need to leave the airplane because UK is not in Shengen so we need to pass the passport control. In the end, our trip took us 28 hours to get to Amsterdam from Baltimore with a total delay of 18 hours. I would not recommend to fly with WOW air even if they offer you a ticket for free. The only reason to fly with them is if you really want to have this WOW feeling that they guarantee with each flight.

### "flights were very late"
Pittsburgh to Keflavik return. The checking had no line at all so that went very smoothly. The flight attendants were pleasant and professional. The seats were small but we flew the cheapest seats possible. The flight was quite pleasant. The pilot kept the seat belt sign off for most of the flight. Much better than domestic US airlines. The flights in both directions were very late. Since we did not have a connection that was not an issue. But other passengers were very concerned about making connections. The return flight was overbooked but I guess enough people chose the free round trip voucher so no one was bumped from the plane. On returning to Pittsburgh the baggage was very delayed as the tugs were stuck in the snow and could not get the baggage to the terminal. But that may be the ground crew and not WOW's fault.

### "company is just a real nightmare"
Paris to Chicago via Rekjavik. I am highly disappointed with this airline company. This flight has been cancelled last minute and the communication was super bad. They couldn't put me in another flight before January, 16th (at least!) so they offered me to change the arrival destination. I did it for Boston, thinking that they would take in charge the ticket from Boston to Chicago. They didn't. They provided me a hotel in Paris. I didn't need it so I let them know, thinking that the price of the hotel that they didn't have to pay could cover my plane ticket or at least, a night in Boston in case of a night stopover. Despite all these efforts, nothing is done to help me. I am now 4 days late on my agendas, and I have to pay for another unplanned ticket. Plus, since I didn’t know if the flight would be canceled or not, I have to buy a hotel night in Boston as well. The communication is really bad, slow, not effective, nor helpful and definitively not reassuring for their customers. Then, finally the flight arrived but not without any trouble either. The flight from Paris to Iceland has been delayed for more than a hour, I had less than 15min to change, go through the security check and arrive at the opposite part of the airport for the connexion. After a cancellation, you can’t even imagine the stress this late arrival has generated ! And obviously: no communication from WoW whatsoever. The personnel on board told us that we will have time to go to the plane no problem : I had to run like crazy and to beg a security agent to let me pass in priority. Is that “no problem” ? ! Final point, the confort on board. Take the larger seat! It is needed if you don't want to spend your flying time with your legs stuck into the front seat. There is absolutely no place to put your legs, your arms, nothing. There is one plug for two. Very convenient if your neighbour already uses it for his/her computer, phone or anything else. Don't even imagine to have a TV for your transatlantic flights. It doesn't exist! Flying with this company is just a real nightmare, very long and boring! I hope you bring your own bottle, because event a glass of water isn't free. After that, just do what you want and pray for a safe and easy flight if you choose this company. That is the only solution not to get to many troubles!

### "never fly with them again"
Reykjavik to Boston. Horrible customer service, our flight was delayed an hour and a half which made us miss our connecting flight and had to find our own lodging in Boston for the night. They were rude over the phone and said they would not help us because our flight was delayed less than 3 hours and they were not responsible because our connecting flight was booked they another airlines. Will never fly with them again.

### "This airline is a joke"
Do not fly this airline. I have flown from Baltimore to London with a layover in Iceland once a month since November. I am currently sitting in the Iceland airport yet again due to my flight being late causing us to miss our connection. Of my nine flights with WOW all nine have been late and in one instance overbooked causing me to stay a night in Iceland in route to going home. WOW does nothing but tell you they don't know and have accommodated you with the next available flight. My recent issue is my flight from Baltimore to Iceland was delayed due to late arrival. We made up time in the air only to find out our flight left on time ten minutes prior. They held our flight for late arrival in Baltimore yet for over 60 people going to London they couldn't do that for us. This airline is a joke and isn't worth the cheap flights.

### "I will never fly them again"
Reykjavik to Newark. WOW air definitely does offer a cheaper alternative, which is the only reason anyone would ever fly it. They don't give you water on the flight and there are no screens unless you want to pay a lot to rent an iPad (don't waste your time, it will have like 4 movie options on it). They charge an arm and a leg for luggage, even just for carryon (only one small personal item is included). But you know what you're getting and the point is that it's a value airline. But, I will never fly them again and the reason is that they have the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Their system denied me from online check in and would not let me add my checked bags in advance of the flight. So when I got to the counter and let them know I had tried to do this, the attendant said he had to charge me the desk price but if I wrote an email to them, they would refund me the difference (it's cheaper if you pay before you get to the airport). So I do this and attach documentation of the receipt and instead of refunding me my $20, they refused. Even though it was their fault and I was misinformed by their employee, they would rather lose a customer than return $20 to me? I wrote them back nicely asking again if there was anything they could do to make it right (future bag voucher maybe?) and they said no and I wrote one last time and they have since ignored me. It's just absurd that they aren't willing to bend on such a small amount, but out of principal, I will not be giving them any more of my business. It's not worth it to fly with a company that doesn't care one bit about service or their customers. When you add the outlandish bag fees, the prices don't end up that much cheaper than IcelandAir anyway. Save yourself the headache and terrible experience and fly something else!

### "do not get what you pay for"
Berlin to New York via Keflavik. This airline will suck all of your money out with hidden fees. You have to pay for  carry-on bag, all checked luggage, your seat and even water on the plane. I was absolutely shocked when I was charged $4.00 on my 11 hour flight for just one water. After booking my flight for the advertised price of $350 from Berlin to New York, the overall end price I paid was about $800 after my check-in luggage and carry-on bags. The worst part of my experience was during my first leg from Berlin to Iceland: I had walked onto the plane that had obviously not been cleaned from the previous passengers. I go to my designated seat and there was baby-puke in front of my seat that smelled putrid. The flight attended simply poured some detergent over the mess and did not offer to move me to one of the free seats located in the exit row, since I had not paid for an exit row seat. Overall, I highly regret not going with better-rated airline. You do not get what you pay for on WOW.

### "Very poor online systems"
Gatwick to Miami via Keflavik. Very poor online systems. Kept showing errors. Customers service not answering phone call at all. My emails response just went missing in action. Tried Facebook messenger to no avail. I am still trying to add a carry on baggage but system is down and each time I go back it double up the charges - not straight forward at all. Been trying for 6 days. Such a hassle and so stressful.

### "the price isn't even competitive"
This is supposed to be budget priced airfare but is nothing of the sorts, in the end the price isn't even competitive comparable to other available airlines with same departures. So I travelled with WOW air on return from Copenhagen to Toronto with a layover in Reykjavik both ways. The price could have been half off with another airline, that granted has a longer layover than WOW. That being said, double the price of other airlines, with WOW does not include luggage which was another 180 dollars. On board services are so cheap, which would be alright if the same could be said of the ticket prices. Not even a complimentary glass of water on a 6 hour flight. All four flights in the course of my travel was delayed, with the final destination so late I missed my transport home costing me an additional 30 dollars. To top it all off I just arrived home without my luggage because WOW air displaced it along with about 15 other fellow travellers from the same arrival. They will send it to me if they find it, I dread hearing they lost it because I cant imagine they will not try to screw me out of due compensation. Deplorable business practices.

### "very, very uncomfortable"
Flew Los Angeles to Keflavik and Amsterdam. WOW air is a terrible airline. The airplanes beside cheap seats don't have anything else. No monitors, no UBS port, nowhere to charge your phone etc.. Asked for a cup of water and was told I have to purchase a bottle of water for $3. The economy seats are extremely thin and lacks cushioning so they are very, very uncomfortable. They invest minimal in a plane so that it just takes off and drops you off with nothing else to offer. I had a bad backache when I arrived at my destination and it impacted my entire trip. I will never fly this airline as their goal isn't customer satisfaction but just to drop you from point A to point B in horrible seats.

### "never again with WOW"
Baltimore Washington to Stockholm via Keflavik. Leaving Baltimore/DC the flight was delayed by 3h due to the fact that WOW didn’t have equipment to de-ice storage hatch of the aircraft. So we missed the connecting flight in Keflavik. In Keflavik was a full chaos, with little competence to organize new flights or even queuing: wrong info, wrong lines, waiting w/o information and so on. Finally received hotel and food vouchers (to a budget hotel of course). When needed to leave to airport the next morning, the bus picked us up at 2.00 am! That’s 5h before our flight! Well, the bus was of course 30 min late, but hey, it’s ok at 2.00 am to wait in vain. At the airport we were checked to Copenhagen. Not to Stockholm where we were heading to. The person at the desk was super hostile when I said we needed to get to Stockholm, not Copenhagen. She just ticketed us to CPH. So, finally got the connecting flight to STO, but we needed to take the luggage out in CPH, check them again, go through security and so on. Not nice when my wife goes with crutches and we’ve 3 kids with us. Never, never again with WOW. When things go south, they only have a phone number to call, but nobody on the ground. Guess how long it takes to get through in the phone?

### avoid this airline"
Baltimore to Reykjavik. Rock bottom low cost. Flight was nearly 3 hours late leaving due to cold-weather problems closing cargo door. (WOW's hot air blower was "broken" and at least 2 hours were spent trying to find a loaner from another airline, ultimately supplied by Southwest, with passengers onboard.) The seats are so uncomfortable that by the time the plane finally took off, remaining seated was already unbearable. Minimal leg room (tall people advised to choose another airline because knees literally will not fit in a normal position). Seats "recline" very slightly (given the short distance between seats, more would put the headrest in the face of the passenger in the seat behind). Seats also quite narrow. (The older aircraft on the second leg of my journey - Reykjavik-Barcelona - which was shorter, had more comfortable seats, oddly enough.) Lots of purple and cute slogans on everything to make the airline seem young and fun, but no amenities without paying extra. No anything without paying extra. Checked bag ($64.99), carry-on ($69.99). Note that passengers can bring one small "personal item" (purse, backpack, computer) and that an additional carry-on is extra in keeping with the low-cost tradition. Cabin crew grim, no doubt the flight is an ordeal for them as well. By the time you factor in all the extra charges (luggage, food, entertainment, even water), the ticket price is not that much lower than a full-service airline. Anyone who can afford to pay a little more and wants a comfort level somewhere above endurance should avoid this airline. Shudder to think of flying from the west coast to Reykjavik would be like.

### "my wife’s luggage was missing"
My wife and I travelled from Pittsburgh to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Once we arrived in Frankfurt, my wife’s luggage was missing and we issued a lost luggage claim. We stayed in Germany for 4 days between December 28 to 31 and then travelled to Thailand. During this time, we were referred to different contract parties, none of which seem to take any accountability or initiative. The luggage was delivered to our German address 2 days after we left Germany and now we are in Thailand without knowing whether we we get the luggage delivered to Thailand or not. WOW Customer service is useless and the contractors that WOW is using in Germany have no clue what to do and how to communicate with each other. So, if you plan on checking luggage with WOW air, there seems to be a high chance it is getting lost and then it seems almost impossible to find out what is happening.

### "they do not offer free food"
Los Angeles to Keflavik. You have to pay for a carry-on and there’s no point in spending extra on priority boarding, etc. because the airline separates “priority” from the general boarding line yet still lets both board at the same time! It’s disappointing that as a low-cost airline they do not offer free food or drinks to their customers. Overall, would not recommend, it would be best to splurge a bit more on a better quality airline.

### "cancel under the 24 hour rule"
Baltimore to Barcelona via Keflavik. I purchased a ticket 11/15/17, and before leaving the website noticed that the bag for which I paid on the outbound flight was not charged for the return flight; the new charge was absurd, so I called WOW air to cancel under the 24 hour rule (tickets purchased for a flight 7 days or more out are refundable per USDOT regulation if purchased on wow air US website (in this case) and cancelled within 24 hours). They agreed to cancel and refund. That was the easy bit. DOT regs require a refund to my credit card in 7 days. After intervention they finally paid up on 12/21/17. WOW air states that all tickets are non-refundable on their site; this is not the case as above; in addition, they seem to require refunds for taxes and fees to be requested separately as they have language that requires that refund request to be made within 30 days of flight. Finally, their online agents have no idea what the status is of your refund - they continue to tell me now after the refund has been received that will (again) receive it in the next few days - as they have perhaps a dozen times already. As it appears many others have refund issues here is the address of their registered agent for service of process: The Corporation Trust, Inc, 2405 York Road, Suite 201, Lutherville, MD 21093-2264. File in your small claims or local district court, then have the airline served at that address. That may get their attention.

### "It is absolutely horrendous"
San Francisco to Amsterdam via Keflavik. It is absolutely horrendous to fly with WOW air. The seats are paper thin and there is no screen or any in-flight entertainment in order to cut cost. In addition, on a flight of 9 hours from SFO to KEF and from KEF to SFO, the cabin crew did not serve any beverages. The food costs money and the airline did not carry enough of the food so it was sold out. I will never fly this airline again and this airline should really go out of business.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Montréal to Berlin via Keflavik. The luggage did not arrive to Germany. When I contact the airline I was told that it is the responsibility of the airport to assist me in the process for the first 5 days. The airport tells me to contact the airlines. I still have no idea where my luggage is and do not know when it will come. I've emailed the airlines several times that I will be leaving Berlin within 72 hours of my arrival and that I need my luggage. No response. Absolutely terrible experience. Will never fly WOW air again. Do not advise. Save your money and mind.

### "such a poor customer service"
Wow air makes Ryanair look like a first class experience. Whatever you do, do Not book WOW air. I have never experienced such a poor customer service in a modern airline. WOW air is not on time, Ever. You miss your connection and get stuck in a hellhole hotel for 24hrs without help or news. I don't feel the crews to be professional and staff at airport are rude. Boarding 1h late, and then 30min after every one is in, remark you need de-icing and add an other 1h30 to delay? Our flight was delayed 3h, closed inside aircraft. Missing connection and WOW air didn't have a same day solution.

### "Never again will I fly with them"
Newark to Berlin via Keflavik. Never again will I fly with them. Bad organization, no communication, passengers are left to handle problems all by themselves. I’m stuck in the middle of nowhere and I don’t know when I’ll fly to my final destination yet. Lost my luggage, didn’t inform me how to get to desk, when I was there I was given little to no info.

### "I would never fly with WOW air"
Keflavik to Gatwick. They have charged me £74 for cabin bag where you can take the same cabin luggage in other budget airlines for free. The staff who was charging me for the bgg he was like "either you pay the money or leave you bag". No courtesy whatsoever. I would never fly with WOW air nor recommend anyone to fly with them.

### "offloaded me with no reasoning"
Toronto to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Don't waste your money and fly with this airline. Absolute worst customer service! I was forced to pay $200 at the airport for luggage I wasn't allowed to take on board. On top of that they tried to make me pay $400 at the gate for an extra carry on until they decided they just didn't want me on the flight and offloaded me with no reasoning. Even explaining to customer service and writing several emails my claim was denied because of their "policy" that wouldn't have been followed had I payed the $400 extra that they wanted!

### "Customer service was horrendous"
Paid and reserved seats weeks before the flight only to find that they weren’t reserved at all, had no apology and no explanation. Customer service was horrendous, we were told to “take it up with Wow” nothing could be dealt with face to face. WOW representatives laughed at us when we explained we had booked seats. We were made to pay for hand luggage even though we were told we were allowed 10kg at no cost. Our flight home was cancelled and we weren’t informed! Had to come home a day early! Spoke to 4 different representatives who couldn’t even get my email address correct despite me spelling it out. All staff are incompetent, rude and unhelpful! When boarding passes were printed two of us were booked into the same seat. Pay the extra money and go with a decent airline! Our trip to Iceland was cut short by a day due to WOW’s absolute incompetence and terrible customer service!

### "They were positively clueless!"
Flew Chicago to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Cheap flight sounds great, except it’s not actually cheap. Once you add on charges for baggage, seats, water on board, etc., it’s about the price of a standard ticket on a quality airline. (Plus they didn’t actually reserve the seats I paid $20 for, even though I have the receipt). Amenities on board are atrocious. No Wifi, no inflight entertainment (except an iPad you can pay $25 for that features 10 movies from 1992), no USB ports, you even need to pay for water! My flight was delayed twice in one week causing me to miss my connecting flights both to my destination and back by 5 minutes. Because they are not a member of an airline alliance, my only options were to wait until the next day and stay in a shared hotel room or rebook on another airline for $600 which they couldn’t guarantee I would be reimbursed for. The general apathy and lack of communication provided by the staff is abhorrent. The least they could do is apologize and help direct me. They were positively clueless! Spend a little extra and book on a respectable airline that values their customers and maybe you won’t be out $1200 (in addition to the cost of the “cheap” tickets).

### "they decided to cancel my ticket"
Dublin to Toronto via Reykjavik. Never fly with this company. Sold out too many tickets and got short with the seats. So they decided to cancel my ticket. Send me an email with an option either to change my flight for the next available, which was the following day (but it wasn’t an option for me as I have to go back to work that day) or refund my money! Then I called another customer agent and he told me that it wasn’t cancelled and I can fly on the original date. After I received another email saying that it was cancelled. They didn’t pay for my extra expenses (hotel, taxi, phone calls talking to them on the phone). Would have not given them even 1 star in a rating but there’s no such an option.

### "you can't beat the price"
Before making the purchase, people have to read the airline's policy on checked baggage / entertainment / foods. You get the basics - flights, and you can bring your back-pack on board (it's weight is not even specified, only the dimensions). I have read hundreds of bad to terrible reviews on this airline, and I came to the conclusion that people don't realize what a low fare airline is. First of all, I have to praise the ground services staff, working at the check in for WOW, as I have witnessed both in Miami and Berlin, how offensive and rude the travelers are, pushing the staff to let them bring an over-sized (by WOW standards) bag on board free of charge. The logic behind this is: If you have to be in Miami for a conference on Friday, you would probably not risk on taking the WOW air on Thursday, as they only fly twice per week. This means if there is a mechanical problem with the plane and they cancel the flight, they are not going to reroute you, and you are going to miss the conference. WOW will offer you a refund, or travel after 3-4 days, IF there is space. To make it on time, you have to pay more and pick the "classic" airlines, which are part of the alliances and can take you to your final destination on time. Having purchased the tickets, and having read all the terrible reviews, I have been following on WOW flights stats for flights from Reikjavik, and saw that in average, they only cancel one of their flights out of a hundred. Of course, the people who complain are always those who were on a cancelled flight. That said - if you want to travel cheap and don't care if, in worst case scenario, your travel dates will be switched by few days, take WOW. We have enjoyed - the air-crafts are new, staff are great, and you can't beat the price!

### "getting worse and worse"
London to Baltimore via Keflavik. This airline keeps getting worse and worse. For a few years, they offered the cheapest flights from the DC area to London. You had to deal with 1. No free food/drink (not even water) 2. A short stopover in Iceland (I actually prefer this) 3. Extreme limitation on carry-on, and big fees if you do not comply. I learned to bring water/food the hard way, I learned to bring a small bag the hard way. These are in your control as an inmate on WOW air. Unfortunately, not much else is. On my 3rd or 4th (and last) flight, the bag I always took for free suddenly no longer qualified. This was a surprise to me, and as there was a big checkin line behind me, I kind of panicked and paid the fee of 50+ pounds that brought the total cost above competitors (WOW has been getting less competitive, and is no longer always the cheapest option, even without extra fees). Before boarding, I consolidated my luggage, rechecked in and was told I could be refunded via the website. The only contact on the website is an email. They were quick to respond to my email, but just with a cookie-cutter 'we do not offer refunds' - depite what I was told. I re-explained the situation and soon they just stopped replying. There is no phone number on the website, I later got it on my return journey when checkin attendant opened a safe, and ripped off a number from a sheet with the number written on it like 50 times - like some kind of interest flyer. I called them and the phone operator was just as impossible to deal with - no refunds, despite the fact that I rechecked in and was told I could get one. At the end, he told me to have a 'wow day. This seems trivial compared to what other reviewers have had to deal with. This airline grew due to being legitimately cheap, but now that they have become a big player they A. are becoming almost as expensive, while retaining all the extra expenses and B. Do not care about customer service. Not flying with them any more. PS. Both of my flights back had delays on the ground because someone didn't show up. The person sitting next to me on the flight over ordered 2 pizzas and 2 beers for over $30 - the pizzas looked like the cheapest frozen pizzas you can buy at a supermarket - about 5 inches diameter. No inflight entertainment unless you rent an ipad for 25$

### "I’ll personally stay away"
I decide to book with WOW air since it was this only one available for the hours I was planing to fly from Los Angeles to Keflavik. Honestly, the price was about $100 less than any other and I thought it was a great choice but in the end you spend way more. Each drink is about $4. in between $8-12. Any snacks $4-6. If you add up what you would pay for in a 9 hour fly it’s a realization that this company is actually more expensive than any other airline around. I’ll personally stay away.

### "I'll stay away from WOW"
San Francisco to Reykjavik. I booked my flight to Reykjavik on May 2017 to meet in there with our friends we didn't see for a long time. The flight should happen in November this year. I was quite excited about this trip as it might provide me with completely new experience in combination with good memories and warm reunion. The WOW kept keeping me informed through the email about options for my upcoming trip and sent me reminder 48 hours in advance offering to do online check in which followed with the reminder via SMS for the same. By some technical reasons I wasn't able to do it deciding to do at at the counter in airport. Now you can imagine what a shock I experienced when I arrived to SFO and found that my flight doesn't exist! I immediately tried to contact their customer service and found that flight "was cancelled by technical reasons in August". The clerk in the customer service mechanically was repeating that the cancellation notice went to every passenger in between August and September. I checked my email where other notification were sent and didn't find any cancellation notice (email) not in the main inbox nor in the spam folder. Besides - why on the Earth they were sending check in notifications if the flight was already canceled. My request to re-book flight was declined as well as I was informed that WOW doesn't assume partnership with other companies to back up the flight. So WOW canceled my flight w/o notifying me in advance. I don't care what their operators say - I didn't get the cancellation into my email inbox. WOW used my money for the cancelled flight w/o any commission between August and November. I lost hotel money which is too late to cancel. Travel insurance will be questioned as they keeping claim they sent cancellation notice. I'll stay away from WOW as much as I can even if they were last air carrier on the planet.

### "attendants are helpful and friendly"
Keflavik to Copenhagen. There is something in WOW Air that I don't like and it doesn't meet my expectations, but they provide a safe trip and that is enough for me. I had a trip to the Iceland in the last summer and I had bought cancelation protection which I had supposed that would allow having a refund, but I was wrong because they had mentioned on their website that cancellation protection is for the case of serious illness or loss of close relatives and I hadn't read it carefully. when I wrote to them, they refunded just the airport tax. Although I think they need some improvements on some issues. Their airport check-in time was short and they closed the gate very soon. Their baggage dropping process needed extra check-in similar to complete check-in process, meanwhile, I had checked-in online before. Their ground service is not very friendly and helpful. Flight attendants are helpful and friendly.

### "The most dishonest company"
San Francisco to Gatwick via Keflavik. The worst company that I ever deal with, they make move my allowances from my back pack to my luggage and later they suspiciously lost my luggage. Now they don’t want to take responsibility for their negligence and want to give the third part of my losses. They took eleven months to answer me after I expended hours trying to reach them by phone and by mail and they tried to said that was my fault for carrying expensive goods with me. I am not the only person with this problem, at least 20 more in the same situation than I know because “They block your account and delete or spam your posts in their website” because they don’t care about your losses. The most dishonest company I ever deal with.

### "I followed all of the rules"
❎ Not Verified |  Baltimore to Copenhagen via Keflavík. I booked the flight with a 3rd party for WOW air which I don't recommend. You should book directly with WOW. Because of the third party WOW will not do anything regarding your booking until the night before the flight when you will finally be granted access to confirm. I read a lot of bad reviews regarding WOW, so I started trying to cancel my reservation and book elsewhere. WOW has a policy that you can cancel with 24 hours with no penalty. But, if you book with a third party they don't honor WOW policy. I paid for a carry-on $54 before the flight and I paid for my seat also. I did not want to be stuck in a middle seat. I did not find the seats that uncomfortable. The thing to do is strictly follow size and weight requirements. I was extremely apprehensive because of the negative reviews. I followed all of the rules and had no problems at all. It is true that you are not offered a beverage or anything, and that you have to have a credit card to purchase anything. The prices of the food was approx. $2 higher than the high prices in the airport. I brought a sandwich, water and juice from the airport which was costly. I would fly WOW again. I was going to be gone for 3 weeks so I needed the extra bag.

### "cancelled by technical reasons"
I booked my flight from San Francisco to Reykjavik on May 2017 to meet in there with our friends we didn't see for a long time. The flight should happen in November this year. I was quite excited about this trip as it might provide me with completely new experience in combination with good memories and warm reunion. The WOW kept keeping me informed through the email about options for my upcoming trip and sent me reminder 48 hours in advance offering to do online check in which followed with the reminder via SMS for the same.

WOW used my money for the cancelled flight w/o any commission between August and November. I lost hotel money which is too late to cancel. Travel insurance will be questioned as they keeping claim they sent cancellation notice.

### "no effort of trying to help me"
Montreal to Reykjavik. I had found out that my passport was expiring the night before my trip, so I had to get an emergency passport the day of my flight. I had a legal name change so I wasn't sure what name the passport office was going to issue me (since I didn't have my original legal name change document with me in Montreal). But I called WOW the night before my flight asking if I could change my name on my ticket and the lady informed me I could, within the next hour. I didn't change it that night because I didn't know what name was going to be on my passport so I had to wait until I heard what the passport office said. By some miracle, I ended up getting a brand new passport in 7 hours and when I called WOW again at 2.30pm (my flight was at 6pm) they informed me with new information that I couldn't make any changes to my flight within 4 hours of departure. Essentially, WOW airline's call centre is very inconsistent and had provided me false information that first time I called. I wasn't restricted to 1 hour, I realistically had up to 4 hours before my departure. Because of that misleading information, I was unaware of that time constraint and thus prevented me from changing my name and the airline crew denying me access. On top of that, the airline crew treated me with such disrespect, rudeness, no empathy and showed no effort of trying to help me find a solution. Basically they were blaming me for everything. Especially the supervisor. I had called the call centre numerous times to try and get any compensation, even if it was just to get on the next available flight, which is a reasonable request as other airlines would try to put their customers on next available flights even if you missed the flight due to something like lateness. I am shocked  by the customer service this company gives. They don't care about you as a person and show no sympathy whatsoever. The customer care reps are trained to say the same line over and over again like robots, it's like you are talking to a brick wall. It took me an hour arguing with one person about wanting to talk to a supervisor, they wouldn't let me talk to someone with higher authority at all which makes 0 sense (what company doesn't let you talk to a manager?!) Once I finally managed to talk to a supervisor, they feed you nonsense about how they don't have authority to do anything. I find out later that this is not true - as they mention how other options would be mentioned to me if the airline was at fault. This proves that they have options and the authority to do something but they just don't want to. All this company does is lie to you so they don't have to pay anything. They wrote in my file that I talked to a senior supervisor in the Icelandic Headquarters which I never did. Then they listened to their call recordings and said that the lady I talked to on the first night informed me of the 4 hour policy! I remember that conversation crystal clear in my head and she had never mentioned anything about the 4 hour policy.

### "never flying them again"
Toronto to London via Keflavik. WOW air sells tickets under the guise of lowest cost carrier around. It is not true. To begin with, I paid $600 CA for a ticket to London. Not a bad price. But, then only a small carry on is allowed, no regular size carry on. Luggage is extra and it is charged per leg. So, if you are heading from Canada westerly, it means 2 legs, one stop in Iceland and then on to London. That's about $80 if you decide to bring a small roller luggage. Then, when you reserve your seat, closer to departure, there is a charge (varied) for all seats, depending on where you want to sit. Again, per leg. So, that added up to another $60, for the cheapest seats possible. They will not even provide you with a drink of water on their flights. A water bottle is $5. Dehydration on board, is a health issue, for an airline not to be aware of this is unbelievable. I don't know what they charge for food since I didn't buy any. There is no entertainment on board, which was fine for me. However, you can rent an iPad for $30 or so, again per leg. I doubt anybody rents one. Why would they if they are flying on a cheap flight? There is always a stop in Iceland, and their airport is small and not setup for many international flights coming in. They bus you to the terminal. The doors from outside open directly into the terminal. The end result, buy your ticket with Air Canada or British Airways. Just watch the prices, you can get direct fights at same price point. Oh, and by the way, you have to do everything on line. Book your seats, print your tickets, boarding passes, etc. Ok, if you are setup for but, some people may not have ready access to printers, and it's always dangerous to rely on the eticket. I was never able to access WiFi in the Iceland terminal. Oh, and they overbooked the flight and requested people to accept another flight. Long and short, I'm never flying with them again, not even to go to Iceland.

### "Will never fly WOW again"
A horrible storm hit Iceland on Sunday afternoon. We were required to wait at the gate for ten hours because they refused to cancel the flight from Keflavik to Boston. Had to take a bus to the plane and board by climbing stairs in the cold, wind, and rain. Seats are very uncomfortable. No refreshments provided, only for sale. When we got to Boston, the pilot announced that no checked luggage was on the plane. We all had to stand in a line at the Boston airport to fill out a form to file to declare our missing luggage. Very unhappy. Will never fly WOW again.

### "experience indicates a lack of protocol"
Arrived home yesterday evening to Chicago (from Keflavik), via flight WW153, scheduled for Sunday, 11/05, but delayed until yesterday, 11/06. Following the cancellation of the flight, we were given vouchers to local hotels and unclear assurance that we'd hopefully be flying home the next day. We were then bused to the hotel, only to find that it was already too full to accommodate us. We were then bused back to Keflavik airport and received vouchers for a new hotel. As the buses came and went throughout the next two hours, it became abundantly clear that there was no plan for transporting us to the newly assigned hotel. We only ended up reaching the hotel because an airport employee not connected to Wow arranged for taxis to transport the nine or so of us and ensured the drivers were paid. We did not receive any confirmation of our rescheduled flight until the following morning. Moreover, we never received written confirmation of the bus that ended up picking us up from the hotel the next morning. We had been told the previous evening that it was tentatively due to arrive at noon, but it arrived at 11am, leaving some of us to rush at the last minute to board this bus. This flight, in similar fashion, was delayed by nearly an hour due to an argument between the crew and a passenger, concerning the tickets he had purchased for the flight. Overall, this entire experience indicates a lack of protocol, planning, and internal communication on the part of Wow air, which came at the expense of its customers.

### "ended up having a cancelled flight"
Keflavik to Chicago. This airline is such an abomination, I wish I were able to rate in the negative. They are very unprofessional, convoluted, and had the undertones of passive aggressiveness in all aspects of staffing. Anyway, flew out to Iceland from Chicago with some friends for a week excursion. The flight in was So/So, was somewhat in-different about there not being complimentary snacks/WiFi, but you get what you pay for. The flight back I ended up having a cancelled flight, blaming it on weather. Come to find out it was because the pilots hours were over on time. Many WOW flights went out later that day. Anyway 26 hours of waiting for the flight to leave, and rebooking flights for the connecting ones out of Chicago. We finally started boarding. Once on the plane, the attendants tried to feud with a family to try to get them off because WOW air overbooked the flight. Which in the grand scheme of things made us very late, and we had to yet again rebook connecting flights out of Chicago. Anyways this airline is a joke.

### "poor quality of services and amenities"
San Francisco to Berlin via Keflavik. I fly with Wow Air every 3-4 months, not because I particularly like their poor customer service or their true lack of amenities (like movie selection or internet) but because they claim to have cheaper flights than other airlines. However, this isn't really true. Once you add all of their baggage fees, the cost is roughly equal to that of Turkish Airlines which is far superior. It's only for people like me- who often don't know when we need to return and thus can't book a return flight-- that it can work out in our favor to not lose money by missing a flight. My last trip, however, will stop me from purchasing a ticket from this airline in the future. Every time I fly, I use the last part of my hyphenated name, and I've never had issues. I do it because it's such an extremely long name that it generally doesn't fit, and I do it because it's so automatic now; I don't use my hyphenated name for anything other than legal documents and even then it's so rare. Wow air had never said anything. But last time, on a day when I had a ultrasound for potential breast cancer and was horribly sick with the flu, they barred me from my flight because my name didn't fully match my passport. I apologized and said it was an oversight on my part and asked them to change it. The young man who helped me was incredibly rude, making fun of me to his 2 colleagues as I broke down and cried, begging them to change it. They refused and continued to make fun of me. I demanded to speak to supervisor, claiming that their behavior was inhuman and that i deserved better and to be treated with respect. He refused. I showed him emails of 6 past bookings with WOW Air which contained only the last part of my name, like this booking. He refused. I begged, I cried, I yelled. It didn't matter. I lost so much money, stranded in San Francisco for 2 days until a check finally came through. I emailed customer service for assistance because their phone numbers weren't working (I called US and Germany). I called every day for 10 days. But no one answered me for 14 days. And their answer was short and incredibly disappointing. I emailed the other 6 boarding passes as proof, recounted the actions of their desk attendant, and begged them find me another flight. I said I was a loyal customer despite their poor customer service, and asked them to take care of me. Their answer "Your boarding pass did not match you documents. We are not responsible. Unbelievable. Never have I had an airline be so unwilling to keep their loyal customers happy. To see the humanity in their customers. All they see is dollar signs. They find any way to avoid responsibility. It's not the first time it's happened to me with them regarding bags or food or pricing that changes, but I always took it because of one-way tickets. I always supported them as an airline despite their poor quality of services and amenities. But not anymore. I will forever be a Turkish Airline customer now.

### "We were really disappointed"
Flew from Frankfurt to Reykjavik. We were really disappointed when they made us pay for our cabin bag. I have traveled around the world and truly never experienced, that you would have to pay for a standard size cabin bag, content of which would fit in a small backpack. Really, watch out, when you travel with WOW air, and don’t expect the worldwide standards of cabin bags to be recognized with this company.

### "really good experience"
Really good experience with Wow Air. Flying Montreal-Berlin on October 18, coming back London-Montreal on October 29. Following the comments on the thread decided to fly only with the free item and a bigger carry-on bag (paid extra. On the way to Berlin, there was a delay in Montreal (they had to clean the runway) so we arrived late in Iceland (which was a problem since the layover was only 45m), fortunately they gave us an express access card to customs / border control and we were able to arrive to the connecting flight (thanks to the board for the suggestions, if I had checked a bag for sure it would have not arrived). The way back London-Montreal, the first leg was on time (London to Iceland) but the second one was delayed by almost an hour (they told us because of strong winds on Europe). Overall a good experience on my first time to Europe. Wow air is not an airline for everybody / every occasion (wouldn't have used for a business meeting / honeymoon or if you expect free food / free seat assignments / free bags). In fact if you're saving less than 100$ vs a traditional carrier (Air France / Delta / Lufthansa), go with the other airline - the perks are probably worth more (food / bag allowance / seat / entertainment). But if you're flexible on your travel and getting serious savings (in my case the ticket - even after the 140C$ paid for the bigger carry on bags was 488.21 C$ round trip - around 381 USD or 327 Euros), Wow air might be worth for you.

### "airline denies any responsibility"
45 years of frequent flying, a lot of mixed experiences, and I would have never imagined that an airline like WOW could actually exist! This October, my flight from Berlin to Toronto via Keflavik (KEF) arrived at KEF late. Originally, there was a 65 minutes time period to make it to the next flight. Passengers were not allowed to disembark the airplane for an additional 15 minutes. Upon arriving at the arrival terminal (25 minutes behind the schedule), the direction signs advised that there is a 20 minute walk to the departure gate at terminal D. In addition, we had to go through a passport check line and a security check. Somehow, I did manage to make it to the departure gate in 25 minutes (20 minutes before departure time), only to find that the gate was closed! Not my first missed connection, so I kept calm. Knowing that the airline was at fault, I prepared myself for the inconvenience of a later flight and/or even an unwanted night in Reykjavik. Upon asking for directions to WOW's customer service desk, I was advised that WOW air does not have a customer service desk at KEF (its main hub!). Only a local phone number. I called and I spent 20 minutes listening to elevator music until my phone ran out of charge. All other WOW employees that I approached after that, rudely refused to even talk to me. Frustrated, I approached other WOW employees who were checking-in other flights and firmly demanded an answer. After a short phone call (presumably, to the secret location of their "customer service"), I was told (in a very rude tone) that WOW air only allows 30 minutes from the time of touchdown (and not actual disembarkment) for connecting passengers to arrive at their departure gate. This is notwithstanding of any delays on their airline's part, distance between terminals etc.. Therefore, I was told, the airline denies any responsibility with respect to my situation. With that she waved her hand in my face, ordering me not to utter any words and walked away as fast as she could. I was forced to purchase a ticket for Toronto from Icelandair at a full price of $1070CAD. During my one hour wait for my next flight at KEF, more than once I was told by the airport staff that I am not the first WOW passenger with that kind of experience! All of this could have been a run-of-the-mill missed connection story, and I would have put it behind me, if it wasn’t for WOW’s abhorrent, deliberately condescending and accusatory (obviously rehearsed) mistreatment of their passengers. Based on my online research after my return to Toronto and reading very similar experiences from other abused passengers, I have come to believe that my experience was not unique or a fluke, but this is part of a deliberate business model. A business model designed to shortchange their customers.

### "avoid them at all cost"
San Francisco to Amsterdam via Reykjavík. WOW air don't serve water on a 9 hour flight, you can buy it for 2.5 euro (small bottle). Just to add, the flight was 700 CAD (as opposed to 800 by Air Canada) and it didn't include carry on luggage, only personal item. With an addition of the luggage (65 CAD each way) it already cost more. They don't allow to cancel the flight within 24 hours, they don't include carry-on luggage in a transatlantic flights, don't serve water for free, don't have any kind of entertainment on board and staff is quite rude and inattentive. It was my first and the last time I ever flown with WOW air unless I'm absolutely out of options. Do yourself a favor and avoid them at all cost.

### "handled with the utmost efficiency"
I boarded my flight in London Gatwick for my final destination of Miami, USA on October 25th 2017 at 10.55am. We had a four hour stopover in Keflavik, Iceland. The flight from Keflavik was about 40 minutes late in departing possibly due to the late arrival of the aircraft from a previous destination. The Gatwick to Keflavik was a fully booked flight and took a little longer than usual to board. On boarding my first flight I found my seat occupied. I asked the flight attendant to talk to the occupant and he did. I did offer to give my seat up but the other passenger declined. My seats were 20D & 46K respectively. No on board flight services were utilized on either flight. Both flights were handled with the utmost efficiency. I always fly WOW whenever I can. I understand that WOW in a discount airline and extra services are unbundled.

### "canceled my flight from Paris"
Paris to Boston via Keflavik. Run as fast as you can as this airline will not deliver in emergency situations! They canceled my flight from Paris coming back to US from a funeral. I have 2 children and had to be home that day so I was pretty much forced to get on another flight costing me over $2,000 since WOW customer rep informed me there are no flights available next 5 days. When I complained I was told to file a claim. I'm beyond upset over the fact my claim was denied. Considering I saved WOW money on food, hotel and rebooking I get an email this is unclaimable? I have 2 little children at home, was coming from a funeral, got no delay but flight cancelation, then I'm told it may take 5 days before I can even get home! I can't even believe this is happening and customer is being denied just like that. It shows that customers satisfaction is not your #1 priority. I'm literally speechless!

### "has collected its last dollar from me"
Flew Amsterdam to Los Angeles via Reykjavik. When I booked the flights, on June 2, 2017, more than three months prior to the journey, I paid a great deal additional for Business Seats. For some unexplained reason, my husband and I were bumped from the seats I selected at the time of booking (2G & 2E) and had to fly home in seats 36F & 36G, at the very rear of the plane, right next to the delightful toilet. We also had our seats changed on the flight from Amsterdam to Reykjavik. We chose XXL seats (and paid for XXL seats) but instead we were in seats that didn't recline. This was completely unacceptable. I would never have booked a seat on Wow Air, had I not been able to purchase the larger seats. This is a 9.5 hour flight and to be stuck at the back of plane is infuriating. Wow Air is ever ready to nickel-and-dime its customers for each and every tiny little upgrade, from blankets to baggage, yet when it comes time to fulfill its end of the bargain, it drops the ball. When we spoke to the gate agent upon our arrival in Reykjavik from Amsterdam today, we were informed that "Wow air has been doing this a lot lately. Not words that instill comfort or confidence in one's clients. Another gate agent actually told us, "We can't just bump someone from their seats for you. Well of course they can. It's exactly what they did to us. I urge anyone who is considering purchasing a flight on Wow air to seriously reconsider, especially if you're thinking of upgrading to the Big Seats. For roughly the same price, you can fly another airline, one that has its act together a bit more, and you'll actually keep the same level of seat you pay for. Good luck, Wow! Hope your trying-way-too-hard-to-be-clever marketing efforts pay off. But now that I've flown your airline, I think you're paying whatever low-level marketing team you've hired way too much and your logistics people way too little. Wow air has collected its last dollar from me.

### "What kind of customer service is that?"
WOW air canceled my flight from CDG in Paris to BWI with a layover in Reykjavik. I received an email the day before saying my flight was overbooked and offering incentive to passengers who would re-schedule their flight. I was supposed to work the following day, so I did not take this. The day of, I showed up at the airport and signs said "delayed". After checking in for my flight and getting through security, I waited at the gate while passengers around me started receiving emails that their flights were canceled. Some passengers flying to Boston were very upset since this was the second day in a row their flights were canceled by WOW. No airport employees knew what was going on, and suggested we call WOW customer service. After calling, we found out all flights out of Paris from WOW were canceled that day. WOW gave the option of taking the next available flight or getting a refund. The next flight they offered was 8 days later, due to overbooking on flights before then from canceling flights 2 days in a row. They also offered a hotel voucher for only one night. I had to take a refund for my original flight (which was a low cost since I purchased so far in advance) and pay out-of-pocket for a new ticket on a different airline the next day. I was told by customer service that WOW was not obligated by law to provide me any other options for getting home. What kind of customer service is that? Spend a little more money on customer service, and maybe you won't have to offer flights so cheap for people to fly with you.

### "Absolute nightmare"
Flew WOW air from Brussels to Reykjavik. Absolute nightmare. No transparency and simply not cheap once you add in all the surcharges they can come up with. Us as customers should avoid such airlines at all cost to not give them a chance. Paid 82€ for a carry on. Same price as my actual flight.

### "airline is terrifyingly negligent"
Keflavik to Toronto. This airline is terrifyingly negligent. Three hours before I and my two children were supposed to fly to Toronto from Keflevik, they kicked us out of the check in line and off our flight telling us that our seats had been cancelled and moved to a flight two days prior. No explanation or apology, they just asked me to leave the line, as I stood there dumbfounded with my children starting to panic at my side. They finally provided me a local WOW number that I had to call and remain on hold for close to an hour before an agent got on and squeezed us onto the flight, 20 minutes before take off. They have since taken my complaint and ignored any follow up or accountability.

### "stay away from this airline"
Chicago to Reykjavik. Don't purchase any extras such as large seats as you will not get them. I purchased an extra large seat for $49.99. Big mistake! Don't do it as you will not be seated in a bigger space, instead you will be seated in a regular seat as everyone else on the plane. I emailed WOW about this, they said they would reply within 72 hours, and I never received anything from them. Unless you like paying for nothing and not having your emails responded, stay away from this airline.

### "seats were comfortable"
Los Angeles to Berlin via Keflavik. Our group of 7, including 2 seniors, 2 adults, and 3 children from LAX to Berlin this past week. All I can is that for the price, WOW air is a wow in my book. The only issue we had is that in Iceland our baggage was held because our layover was less than 24 hours. This was clearly stated on the WOW FAQ, but we missed it. As long as you know what to expect, there is no better value than WOW. The food on board is no more expensive than food we have purchased on US Domestic airlines, and was better quality. The only negative is that they can run out of things sometimes. The legroom was excellent and the seats were comfortable, but not luxurious. The aircraft was very clean and well taken care of. The in flight crew were excellent and very nice. No issues what so ever. For us the next best price for LAX to Berlin was $300 more per person flying Aeroflot with a layover in Moscow. For the extra $2100 it would have cost, we paid for our lodging and food for a week in Germany and still had money left to buy food to take on the plane. Advice: As long as you know what to expect you will be very happy. Make sure to read all of WOW's FAQ's and you will be prepared.

### "should not be allowed to operate"
Chicago to Bristol via Keflavik. Travelling with elderly Grandmother, disabled in wheelchair. Flt late from ORD to meet the connecting flight to BRS. They did not hold flight for a few minutes for incoming passengers. Incoming passengers dumped in meeting area. No information told to wait. Requested CRO assistance for elderly grandma, medical needs issue. Totally ignored by WOW ground staff, they left and did not come back for considerable time. Showed up and said next flight to Bristol, UK in 5 days. Again asked for CRO. Zero response. Wheelchair company staff at airport were great. Chasing the WOW ground staff telling them it was unacceptable. They too were frustrated with no response. It took 7 hours to get CRO response. Their CRO representative Open Doors Organization spent more time interrogating as to why she didn't have her own wheelchair with her and threatening she would not be let her on a flight. Disgusting! She arrived at Gatwick 8HRS later and was told she had to find her own way to her destination, that WOW would not accommodate her because she refused their alternative that was KEF to Gatwick, change planes to Dublin a further 9 hours in the wheelchair in the terminal and finally a 6am flight to Bristol. This is the best they could come up with. After great expense she finally arrived at her destination at 2.00am 16hours after her orginal arrival time. She was the lucky one. Numerous other passengers stranded. The only contact is their worthless call centre in India or social media where they delete your posts. Appalling service all around. Clearly violating the ACAA, although the representative of Open Doors Organization claimed no violation because there is no time frame that CRO assistance has to be provided? WOW and the organizations they contract with for services, ground staff and CRO representative are completely sub par. They do not care. Galls me that a non profit supposedly to protect disabled passengers contracts with this despicable air air carrier assisting them in flaunting the law. Never subject your family or yourself to this airline. They should not be allowed to operate.

### "the flight was overbooked"
We booked our flights in April and only chose 'Business Class' because I don't fly well and needed a window seat at the front of the plane. Wow's 'Business Class' seats were available, indicating our rows 2 and 3 selections with window seats, and confirmed in April. A week before departure, without notification, I noticed that our seats were changed from the 3rd row window to the 25th row exit, no window - middle and aisle seats - for the long haul arms of the return trip! I called WOW immediately and was told the plane was changed and other people already had our 3rd row seats. But we booked 5 months ago - did everyone from rows 1-11 book before then? I explained I don't fly well and why couldn't someone else be moved 22 rows down the plane, no window, instead of us, who paid almost $1,000 more to be at the front. I asked for another flight. She said "sorry" there wasn't one. She said we'd get $47 back for being moved if we applied for a refund. Ridiculous! I emailed WOW that our involuntary downgrade was unacceptable and requested to be moved near the front, but I didn't get a reply to my email until after we returned to Canada. Even at the departure gate the airline rep. told us the flight was overbooked, with no hope of moving us near the front of the plane. The email response was "We would like to inform you that there is no Economy or Business class with WOW air, it is just the inclusions which make a difference. Because we were moved to an exit row, with extra legroom, they considered that "you have been provided with the seats for which you have paid for. But obviously not the location we paid extra for. They conceded that we didn't get quite the legroom we paid for, and will be issuing a $29.24 credit. The email next said "Moreover, we would like to inform you that booking WOW Biz does not always include the best available seat, it depends upon the availability. WOW air lured us into believing the only way to sit near the front of the plane comfortably with legroom, was to purchase their Biz Class seats, for which they clearly indicated on the plane seating diagram for our flight. Then they changed the plane a few days before departure to one with 2 less total seats, even though the flight was overbooked, and moved us 22 rows down, no window, and gave us $29 compensation for that.

### "absolutely horrible airline"
Reykjavik to Pittsburgh. WOW air is an absolutely horrible airline. Not only was my luggage lost twice for the first three days of my trip, but the customer service lied to my mother and I about being reimbursed for my belongings. I was told by a airline representative that this was the airlines fault, and would be reimbursed for travel and any items purchased as a result - only to be offered $25 USD per day it was missing. I actually had to complain to even get my baggage fee refunded - what a joke. My transportation to the airport was extremely expensive, however I needed my belongings for an Ice climbing excursion the following day and WOW didn't even have the decency to deliver it before I left for my trip. The clothes, boots and other necessities needed when staying in Iceland where deemed "of further use" to me, thus I received no refund. The issue is I only purchased these due to fault of the airline. My travel fee's to stores, to the airport, and inconvenience cost me well over $500 dollars and a day of my vacation in Iceland. I was told "if you are not satisfied you can contact the Icelandic Transport authority.

### "incompetent and unprepared"
My experience with WOW was disastrous. On my flight from Paris to Los Angeles via Keflavik, my flight got delayed (initially). After I was already in the boarding gate another customer (not a WOW Air representative) came to the gate and told us that any customers having connecting flights to the US except for a couple of locations wouldn't be able to make the connection and need to go to the front desk. So, I did, only to find out my flight was canceled. WOW didn't have any employee at Paris, so the representatives were third-party contractors who knew nothing, some told us the delay was due to a medical emergency, others due to overbooking, and others due to problems with the airport. It was a mess! Then they made us get in line again just to give us a paper to call WOW directly. After waiting for 40 minutes on the phone and around 1.5 hours to get my baggage back, WOW offered me to get me on another flight almost a week later (what a joke)! After spending several minutes discussing with this person over the phone I realized he couldn't do anything and I took their offer for a reschedule flight almost a week later. Then I was told to head back to the front desk (again) to get help on the hotel accommodations for which I had to wait in line (again). When I finally got there, the representative told me he didn't know if WOW could cover my hotel and meals, which was ridiculous because WOW put me on a flight 6 days later! So, I had to wait for them to get an e-mail from some mysterious people in Iceland to approve. I waited more just to find out that they wouldn't cover my stay and that every day I had to call WOW to find out if I was going to be covered (unbelievable). For that day at least, I was covered and I was personally exhausted after spending all the afternoon in the airport. Then the next day I found out that WOW would cover my expenses for that day as well. Then WOW changed my flight (again) to one departing from Brussels, and was told that shuttle from Paris to Brussels would be arranged for the day after (at least I was leaving sooner), just to find out around 9pm that my arrangements were canceled as well. WOW air offered me to put me on another flight, but after all that I had gone through, the uncertainty about covering my hotel expenses, multiple flight changes and 2 days being stranded, I was emotionally done because WOW doesn’t care about its customers and had zero guarantees I could get home anytime soon. So, I told them that I wanted a refund for my ticket. That same night I bought a last-minute ticket back home and submitted a claim to WOW to get a full refund for that ticket I had to buy. To my surprise (or not so much surprise at this point), I was told that my claim would be reviewed in 8 to 10 weeks! It's been almost 2 weeks and nothing from WOW Air. After this experience, I didn’t believe how terrible an airline service could be until now. I will definitely be avoiding WOW Air for the rest of my life, their cheap prices are not worth the risk as they are simply incompetent and unprepared to deal with situations like the one I just described.

### "planes are new and the staff are friendly"
Flew Berlin to Newark via Iceland. The morning before my flight I decided to read up on WOW air. It was very unsettling to read all of the poor reviews about the airline. After flying with them however I think the majority of those reviews are from people's lack of an understanding of what a low-cost airline is. The cost for the airfare was extremely inexpensive compared to the next normal carriers price i.e. American / British Airways. The flights were on time and the food purchases weren't all that unreasonable especially compared to the prices in Iceland's airport. I did upgrade to sit in the first row which is what I would recommend for the best legroom. I still paid less then the next lowest priced carrier. The planes are new and the staff are friendly. They could however use some in-flight entertainment such as Internet however each seat did have a power portal to charge up your devices

### "Horrible customer service"
Baltimore Washington to Keflavik, plane was delayed by about 1.5 hours. While we were sitting in the plane, the pilot kept saying that it was due to bad weather and that they had to get more fuel. This might have been true but what he failed to mention was that during this wait, they were uploading most of the passengers checked baggage. People only found out about this via email when the plane landed. We were "lucky" that our bag arrived the next day on the next flight (some people had to wait much longer) however I had to drive 3.5 hours to the airport the next day to pick it up. WOW basically ruined the day for us. They refused to deliver it to the hotel where we were staying because they are a "discount airline". Most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced. Horrible customer service and most staff were unfriendly and cold.

### "expensive lesson in never sacrificing quality"
I just got WOWed, and it definitely wasn’t as good for me as it was for them. I’ll spare you the gory details, but they have a pretty well oiled operation of kicking you off your flight if you don’t have your middle name on your ticket. They’ll stop you as you are dropping off your bag, hand you a card they’ve got at-the-ready with a handwritten number for a call center in India. They say they can’t handle reservations from the airport, so call that number to fix your ticket, and wave you over to join the section of people seriously freaking out in the terminal. Your new friend in India? He’ll tell you that he can’t make any changes within 4 hours of a flight, so you’ll need to buy a new flight the following day. He’d be happy to refund you the $30.90 airport tax on your forfeited ticket. They offered zero solutions. Pay more. Come back tomorrow with a new ticket. Sorry, not sorry. With the help of the awesome team over at United (and my credit card), I'm finally on my way to Tel Aviv. For the record, they don’t care about your middle name. This was a very expensive lesson in never sacrificing quality. Never WOW.

### "Worst customer service I've ever experienced"
Flew Wow air from San Francisco to Reykjavik. Worst customer service I've ever experienced, including from the legacy carriers. Gate agents were surly and unhelpful, overheard that they were in the process of denying boarding to two different people (not traveling together) who had middle names not listed on their reservation. Never heard of this in my life! I understand I'm paying for cattle car conditions, and that doesn't bother me given the price. But customer service is the difference between that experience being manageable and awful. This was awful. I hope they swap their entire SFO ground crew.

### "never had such unfriendly staff"
Frankfurt to San Francisco via Keflavik. I often travel long haul low cost but never travelled WOW air. I have never had such unfriendly staff like the women who worked at check in / drop off this morning in Frankfurt. Incredible. Hopefully the flight staff won't be as bad. I will try to avoid WOW air in the future for sure.

### "wasted thousands of dollars"
Despite traveling from Montreal to Keflavik, then Keflavik to Gatwick, when trying to leave Gatwick to return home to Canada, WOW Air decided to go above Canadian Law and revoke my citizenship rights. At the check-in, staff were rushing to get people through and when it came to my turn the clerk did not know what my Permanent Resident card (I'm a British citizen with residency in Canada) was, so she put me through with my passport only. This made it come up as Do Not Board, as it looked like a one-way trip from a foreign citizen. The supervisor also did not acknowledge my PR card, instead he chose to repeat over and over that I needed an F1 visa to get back home. An F1 visa is a US study visa, even though I live and work in Canada, so his information was inaccurate. My wife and I spent 26 hours in Gatwick airport waiting for a flight with another airline (who did not have any issues with my documentation) and wasted thousands of dollars in the process. I would not wish this kind of service on my worst enemy.

### "the worst I've experienced"
Gatwick to Boston via Keflavik. Appalling service which is the worst I've experienced in 22 years of flying. Booked to fly to Boston and paid for selected seats. When boarding found we were split up and they had placed children away from their parents on their own (no refund offered for lack of service). Then they lost all four bags and couldn’t care less. They were missing for 4 days, made no effort to contact us. When they turned up they weren’t willing to courier next day (4 days they said) so I had to drive a 3 hour round trip to pick them up. They refused the legal compensation for clothes and toiletries. Have tried several times to get a response from their customer service and haven’t heard anything. Disgraceful service and even worse attitude.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Chicago to Frankfurt via Reykjavik. This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I wish I would have paid a little more on another airline. The flight was about 250 dollars less than another airline at the time of booking. However, my back was hurting so much from sitting on these seats (not much cushion on these seat feels like wood, I sat on my jacket for 3 hours, and the whole way home). This airline charges you for everything and anything, be aware, the price of baggage is high (and this is were they get you). I feel they supplement the low ticket cost with baggage fee - anything you need you get charged. I was told at check in to make sure I carry something to drink, and food with me, because they do not offer anything to eat or drink (the whole flight), not even a cookie. I paid 10.00 for 2 small bottle of water on way back (either dehydrate or purchase). During the flight they hawk perfume, colon, beauty products made in Iceland (their main hub). After calculating the cost of this flight, I actually paid 18 dollars more than the other airline (and I would have received a meal for such a long flight. I still have no idea why they need 4-5 flight attendants on each flight. The only plus: staff was nice

### "Probably the worst airline ever"
Baltimore to Keflavik. Probably the worst airline ever. They removed all the luggage from the flight before it left BWI, citing a weight issue. When we arrived in Iceland they was a long line of passengers reporting missing luggage. This was after charging $60 for one bag! It is now two days later and they have not deliver the luggage to Iceland. They have no customer service and no explanation for the missing luggage. I suspect that they collected all of the baggage fees and just never sent the bags. Using the overhead cost $44.00. Seats are really small and everything costs money on the flight, even a cup of water.

### "the worst airline I have ever flown"
Paris to Chicago via Keflavik. This is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown on. We were prepared for a cheap flight but not one that cancelled the flight then told you that you were on your own and they couldn't get you home for ten days. On top of this they have no customer Service whatsoever. The help that they have are contracted labor and are given and are allowed to only do boarding passes and luggage tags no other no abilities - except to use the same line for every canceled flight. That Line is "someone died on the flight the day before so we had to cancel all flights". So they canceled three days of flights told us we were on our own and they couldn't fly us out until 10 days later. Be aware you will get dumped on and left in some foreign port. Fancy airlines uniforms down make good customer service. It would be nice if they simply told the truth or had a Customer Service Representative which they have no training in and no customer service. I'm sorry that I am rattling on here but I just found that gave me a full refund - except it didn't include my wife's ticket. Nor did it include the cost of two other tickets and rooms for another night.

### "it was totally worth it"
Los Angeles to Keflavik. We had no trouble with this airline and our trip to Iceland turned out spectacular! Knowing that this was a no-frills carrier we only packed our backpacks to fit as personal items and brought lots of snacks just before boarding so we wouldn't have to pay extra. Outbound flight was delayed but return was very timely, and the crew was very nice to us. The only downside is sometimes they don't dim the lights while flying at night so bring a sleeping mask and headphones and you'll be fine. For $1100 round trip for both me and my girlfriend it was totally worth it.

### "worst airline I ever came across"
The worst airline I ever came across. I was traveling to Paris from Toronto via Keflavik on September 25. Upon arriving to Toronto to check my luggage in, there seemed to be an issue with my passport. I was terrified thinking I wouldn't be able to fly for some reason. It turned out that because I didn't add my hyphenated last name they couldn't verify if it was me or not - mind you I have a unique Islamic first name and my last name is also unique West African. Not only that, but I could verify through my photo that it was indeed me. The seats were terrible, I haven't even been on seats that small whilst traveling within my own country. They don't serve anything (food & beverages) not even water. We connected in Iceland to another WOW Air plane. This plane was no better than the last. There was an emergency in the sky and a woman had a seizure we promptly landed in Scotland. I admire the way that the pilot and staff handled the situation and I'm glad that the woman is alive and well. Upon arriving in Paris my luggage was nowhere to be found. The ground team told me I would get it by "tonight or tomorrow morning" well at this exact moment it's "tomorrow night". This company has no customer service agent who can tell me exactly where my bag is after 24+hrs. It's ridiculous. I'm in one of the most expensive cities in the world with no money or clothing or even hygiene care items. I will never ever travel with WOW Air again.

### "Horrible customer service"
Paris to Toronto via Keflavik. Horrible customer service and they have no staff or representatives at airports. Our flight home was cancelled less than 2 hours before take-off, and WOW Air told us the next flight they could book us on is in 7 days. The only other option they gave us to full refund of the return journey and a hotel voucher for one night. The only way to even reach a WOW air rep is by telephone, and most of the time they either pretend not to be able to hear you or drop your call. If you're lucky enough to speak to a rep, they flat out tell you they cannot help you get on another flight and are generally unhelpful. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, my call was dropped. Stay away!

### "seats were cramped"
Check-in was terrible; no signs in airport, not obvious where to drop baggage. Baggage fees are totally ridiculous! Paid CAD 165 to check one under and take a carry on. Was allowed a personal item for free. Seats were cramped and only reclined 5cm, not enough to be meaningful. Have to say cabin crews were nice and friendly. I did not purchase any food (no freebies, everything for $$ on an international flight) In the end, I wish I sprung an extra $200 on a 'real' airline that would check my bags and feed me without gouging me at every turn. Will not fly again.

### "This team is not professional"
Boston to Gatwick via Keflavik. This was an unfortunate experience that cost me $1500 in addition to the $900 wowair ticket. My advice: stay away. The online check-in service confirmed that I checked in on the leg back. When I got to the airport, they hadn't emailed my ticket, but only a PDF w/ the additional bag charge. Then they literally didn't have a check-in service at Gatwick to check-in. i.e. There wasn't a "WOW air" window. The agents at Gatwick were like, "Yeah I don't know where they are, actually. I don't really get them. So, the cost of you trusting their online check-in service is not being able to board the flight. That's a serious cost! I tried to reach out to customer service. They emailed back 6 days later, citing a terms and conditions clause that didn't apply to my scenario. Fly other airlines if you want to go the economic route. This team is not professional.

### "modern-looking purple décor"
I wasn't expecting much when I booked a $279.99 ticket from Berlin to Boston via Keflavik 2 days before I made the trip. I saw that food as well as baggage was for extra purchase. Knowing I would only be carrying one suitcase I did not make any preparations regarding food or baggage. The ticket attendant told me that it would cost me money to ship my baggage. However, after my card was declined, she waived the fee. I was pleasantly surprised when I boarded the plane with its modern-looking purple decor. Clean seats and nice carpet. Pleasant experience on the aircraft. The attendants wearing magenta and looking like models. It's also convenient that all the seats have American as well as different varieties of European electric outlets for your laptop, phone, whatever. I just wish that the aircraft had wifi. I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 and a drink for $3.50. A little on the expensive side but okay. Both legs of the trip, Berlin-Reykjavik and Reykjavik to Boston went smoothly. My only complaint with the airline, besides the lack of wi-fi on board, is that they lost my baggage from Reykjavik to Boston. However, since it was the heavy suitcase they had shipped anyway for free, I'm not complaining that they eventually found it (a week later) and are now shipping it to my home for free. That means it has made its way from Berlin, Germany to the Midwestern United States for no cost whatsoever to me.

### "lack of service is friendly"
Miami to Copenhagen via Reykavik. I couldnt book a ticket online because it kept "Declining" payment and I got an Error message saying that I should call hotline and give them the error message. I called their Hotline and they didnt care about the Error Message. No matter what I said, they declined and kept talking and talking without listening. They claimed it was not possible to book other than Economy seats through their hotline then suddenly they found my Pre-Reservation through my Email and could confirm that I indeed had their Extra Economy Seat up front. They went ahead and processed it and I ended up not getting Food or Extra luggage. I had ordered extra luggage (2nd check-in luggage), but if you havent flown with them before before and you order the full package and it says 1 luggage (and not the other things like seat and carry on extras) you assume that the 1 luggage stated is the extra luggage, so I ended up having an argument with them at Check-in. There were several double bookings on the flight where people had the same seat number in their Premium Economy seats. The service is friendly or rather, the lack of service is friendly. They could learn a lot from Norwegian that just make everything so simple and fast. They constantly jabber in the loudspeakers before and during the flight.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Washington to Amsterdam via Keflavik. On my way to Amsterdam, my bag did not make it to my flight from Iceland to Amsterdam. They informed me that it would be on the next flight to Amsterdam and they would deliver it to my house. I called every day of my vacation, from August 21 to August 26 and Wow Air said they still could not locate my bag. I decided to go to the airport (AMS) early on my way home to the USA to see if I could find it. When I got to the airport I found my bag in less than 10 seconds. It was sitting right at the baggage claim help desk and it was quite evident that no one even looked, because If they had, they would have found it in 10 seconds, like I did. Wow Air left me in Amsterdam for a week with no clothes and made no effort to help me. Wow Air is the worst airline I have ever flown. Absolutely terrible.

### "reviews are 100% correct"
I am writing this review from the airport. I believe most of the reviews are 100% correct. The day I booked my ticket to Amsterdam I called WOW and asked to order a special meal for myself. The customer service guy told me that I can order it on the counter at the airport, but at the airport WOW air representative told me that he can not do any thing and told me that I had to order the special meal 24 hours prior. I don't know what I am going to do?

### "great way to travel cheaply"
WOW air is a budget travel airline. Baggage fees, paying for food, etc is disclosed on their website. Bring your own food, snacks and drinks on board are expensive. Bring an empty waterbottle, fill it after security. Or, factor paying for your drink into the price of wow air. Factor bags into price. For me, I brought my school sized backpack and managed to fit a week of clothes into it. Every airline has delays, late flights or even cancellations. I flew 4 flights, and one of my flights was delayed two hours. Wow air is a great way to travel cheaply.

### "given a flight 3 days later"
Montreal to Paris via Keflavik. After cancelling my flight at the gate due to technical difficulties, I was put in a hotel near the airport and given a flight 3 days later. I was then told my flight was moved to the following day, spent another 7 hours at the airport only to be told it was still in 2 days and also that I had to change hotels. I was put in a disgusting non-functional Holiday Inn (stains everywhere, broken power outlets) for the remainder of my stay. No further compensation was offered, I am still waiting to be reimbursed due to the flight cancellation.

### "staff were so unfriendly and rude"
Flew WOW air from Reykjavik to Düsseldorf. Where should I start, the purpose of the check-in staff is just to generate as much money as possible before passengers can enter the plane. If just one inch of cord was hanging over the personal belongings measurement box you had to pay, this is ridiculous. Girls in tears and startled elderly passengers. The staff were so unfriendly and rude, told the girl to shut up and pay or just stay in Iceland, are you serious? The seatpocket from the seat in front of me was broken so I had even less room for my legs, when I asked if someone could fix it or if I could have another seat they just ignored me. Never again.

### "the crew were very friendly and helpful"
I was terrified of flying with WOW air after reading the reviews on this site, but my own experience was fantastic. It is true that having to pay for carry-on luggage is quite annoying, but we only paid for one carry-on and then we brought two big backpacks and a handbag as free 'hand baggage' and nobody said anything. The flight from London to Keflavik was extremely punctual and arrived at our destination half an hour before the scheduled time, which was great. The flight from Keflavik to London was delayed two hours, but they told us beforehand and therefore we could enjoy two more hours doing sightseeing in Reykjavik. Due to the lack of in-flight entertainment, the planes might be quite bad for intercontinental flights, but for our three-hour flight, it was way better than Ryanair and other similar low-costs. I'm a very anxious flyer, but the crew were very friendly and helpful, and I found the fact that it was a very modern aircraft reassuring. And most importantly, the price was unbeatable.

### "worst flight we ever had"
Miami to Bristol via Keflavik. That was the worst flight we ever had. They changed the departure time on the same day without consulting us. We barely made our flight on time! We specifically required to be sitting together but we were not (same with many passengers). After negotiating for 15 minutes, some of us were allowed to change. We got reprimanded by the crew for daring to raise this issue. The plane was unbelievably small. Sitting for 8h like that was very painful (in the literal sense of the term).

### "It was just impossible to sleep"
This was a three hour early morning flight from Keflavik to Brussels with barely any service and no inflight entertainment, but this is what you expect when booking a "low cost" airline such as Wow air. The three positive points of the flight where the seats, which where comfortable and had enough leg room for tall people, the on-time arrival, and the aircraft, which was brand new. However, the ambiance on board seemed more like we were in a bar than in an airplane. It was just impossible to sleep even with ear plugs (departure was at 6.15am). Some young people in front of us were talking loudly and buying several bottles of strong alcohol. Even though they seemed pretty happy and kept speaking very loudly, the air hostesses seemed to find it funny to sell them even more beer or strong alcohol. The air hostesses should have noticed this and asked them if they were still sober to buy any other alcoholic drink. I spent two thirds of this early morning flight breathing alcohol. Moreover, the cabin staff were not very enthusiastic and acted, in general, very robotically.

### "worst flight experience ever"
San Francisco to Paris via Keflavik. It was my worst flight experience ever. First of all, the price you see first, is no where near what you end up paying at the end. It was originally around $50), when I finished the booking it already went close to $900. They don't give water and you have to pay for anything. I had a tea for $4.5 They charge for carry on too so I didn't bring any carry on. The limit on luggage is only 20kg. I also purchased $50 for travel protection which I thought includes cancellation. Later I decided to go back sooner. On the website you can change the flight and first I saw I have to pay $100 for the change. It sounded ok to me after I put my card information I realized they'll charge me another $216 for fare difference. I hit the cancel button and even closed the browser but I already received the confirmation email about that. So I tried to contact them to cancel the change and was on call with them for an hour or so. They said they are happy to change my flight to the original thing but they won't refund me. Then I tried to cancel the flight but they say they'll refund me around $80 only. They said travel protection is for medical emergency only. With the money I'm paying at the end, I could get a much better flight.

### "our vacation is ruined"
We booked our tickets with WOW to go to Paris from Boston from August 29, 2017 through 9/4/2017. The booking is for 3 adults, 2 kids and a lap baby. WOW wrote me an email at 4PM on August 29, 2017 to cancel my flights to Paris because they have overbooked! My children are devastated. I spent my afternoon contacting WOW and spoke with a guy who refused to give me his last name or let me speak a supervisor. The earliest flight they could get us out of Boston was Sept 1, 2017. I cannot do that. It was not acceptable. Now he told me I had to go through a series of steps to get my money back. Unprofessional and unacceptable behavior. I will never fly with WOW air, our vacation is ruined. This is their letter to me. Dear WOW air guest on flight WW126/404 BOS-CDG on 29AUG. We regret to inform you that your flight today has been cancelled. Due to technical reasons, which led to overbooking, we are unable to fulfill our agreement of transporting you to your final destination. We sincerely apologize for this disruption to your travel plans. We kindly ask you to please proceed to the website where you can select options that suit your travel plans. We kindly ask you to finalize options within 5 hours. More information is to be found on the website mentioned above. Please accept our sincere apologies for this disruption to your travel plans.

### "this is a nightmare"
Toronto to Lyon via Keflavik. First thing I do in the morning is check in online. Later on that day, I arrived at the airport at 4:45 pm and in the line for my baggage. All good until the attendant at the counter said I needed to add my second last name to my passenger information. At this point I had 1 hr 45 mins to my flight and had no idea that had a problem with my last name on my ticket during my purchasing. I called the Customer Service line the attendant told me to call which they can fix my name ticket issue. I talked to one of them and he is like 'sorry but we can not do anything because you already checked in'. I asked to talk to the supervisor and she said 'sorry but we can not add any info to your ticket because any changes should be made 4 hours before the flight'. After talking to customer service for a long time, the only solution was to get a new ticket - this is a nightmare! The girl from the counter was confused and didn't understand why they can't do it because it has happened before. After that, the supervisor contacted WOW customer service to inquire for me and got the same answer I got, which was 'they can't change your info now and sorry but they don't say why not'. I missed my flight, time, money.

### "stay away from this airline"
My advice, stay away from this airline. You get a seat and absolutely nothing else. No meal or drink, be prepared to pay $5 for a cup of water, no entertainment of any sort, TV or music and no blanket or pillow. On a recent return flight from Iceland to Los Angeles, we were once again met with a $100 fee for carry-on luggage, which did not weigh much, however exceeded the airline’s size parameters. We checked-in upon opening of the counter, in order to reserve a window seat. Upon embarking the plane, that seat had been assigned to another passenger. The passenger refused to leave, stating that she got there first. The airline crew placed us in aisle seats at the very back of the plane. These seats could not recline. The entire flight we heard the sound of the lavatories flushing. The air-conditioning was set to very cold, however after several passenger complaints, the temperature was adjusted. The flight departed at 6.00 p.m. After three hours into the flight, I requested the crew to turn off the cabin lights so that we and everyone else on the plane could get an enjoyable night’s sleep. My request was greeted with denial, I was told that for safety reasons all the lights must be left on the entire flight. To which I responded, so every other plane in the sky is flying in unsafe conditions? We have flown on many carriers, to Europe, Asia and Africa, they all turn off the cabin lights so that the passengers can have a pleasant night’s rest. I concluded that the cabin crew are given strict instructions to sell as much product as possible, food and duty-free goods. Two hours later, the lights were dimmed. This may be a discount airline, but being charged for every frill, in my opinion, adds-up to more than the potential saving. Besides flying an international flight, more than nine hours and not having a crew that wants to please and accommodate is not an experience I would recommend to anyone.

### "a great deal even with these fees"
Had to add my positive review, as a counter to the negative reviews of WOW. Our experience flying with them Toronto to Stockholm (Aug 13/17) and return (Aug 23/17) was nothing but positive. I was fully aware of their no-frills approach, their pay-per-bag-per-leg, their pay for on-board food/bev policy, at the time of booking. This factored into my decision to book with them, which was a great deal even with these fees, and I would not hesitate to do so again. All of our flights left within a reasonable time of their scheduled departure, and all of them arrived at their destinations early. Transferring in KEF was hassle-free for us, including the automatic baggage transfers. Staff at all terminals were friendly, and on-board staff were extremely friendly and professional. Aircraft were fairly new (especially the YYZ-KEF flights) and were no less comfortable than any other discount/charter airline we've flown with (and we've flown with many). Sure, if you want to compare WOW to first or business class on a brand airline, you might be disappointed. But if you book fully aware of their policies, then I believe you will find them to be near the top of their class. Again, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.

### "they're hopeless amateurs"
Montreal to Dublin via Keflavik. Paid top dollar for flight and was denied boarding on connecting flight to Dublin due to inbound flight delayed 1hr. Aircraft for connecting flight still on tarmac but gates had just closed. 40 passengers from Montreal flight stranded in Keflavik for 9 hours but 4 of us going on to Dublin were stuck 12 hrs with 4 vouchers for snack food. No lounge, no showers, no voucher for transport to/from Reykjavik. Nothing! Horrible experience. Flight WW854 KEF-DUB should've waited for 4 missing passengers WOW knew were on the incoming WOW flight. They shouldn't have connecting flights with less than 3 hrs transit time because they're hopeless amateurs. Being in transit 5 hours in KEF for return flight wasn't any better. Like being in a cattle yard - in this case most of WOW's overbooked flights asking volunteers to take later flights.

### "not a company, it's a scam"
Has anyone else experienced something similar with WOW air? Obvious answer: Yes! I had booked a return trip with this company to go visit my family in Canada. I was supposed to depart 13 August and arrive in Toronto on the same day at 17:30. At the airport I discovered that the flight was delayed, and then cancelled. Strangely - as is the case when flying with other airlines such as Lufthansa, Delta, Air Canada, etc. where one is assisted in person at the airport - none of their airport personnel was able to assist us passengers with rerouting our journeys and we were told to call their customer service numbers. This was unproductive; I spent more than an hour and a half listening to elevator music and their automated message about how busy their super helpful customer service representatives were. But their customer service representatives weren’t helpful at all. As I was unable to contact anyone over the phone, I sent in my information via email and got a new itinerary for 18 August. How this is a “solution” to a flight cancellation on 13 August beats me! There were other, more indirect flights available with WOW air (which I found on my own, so perhaps they should hire me as a customer service representative since I’m doing their job for them) that the customer service told me I had to pay extra for. This is the same CDG-KEF-YYZ route, but with an overnight stopover in Reykjavik - so why I’d be expected to give another cent of my money to a company who hasn’t delivered on the initial service I paid for is baffling. I was also told that I should sort my own accommodations for the extra nights that I’m stranded here in Paris. What “wonderful” customer service. Another example of WOW air’s “wonderful” customer service is when at the airport a customer service representative told a customer who was trying to arrange speedy boarding for her son who has some sort of disability that she was “crazy” (she was understandable irate because whoever she was dealing with was so unhelpful/rude) and “to go away - I don’t want to see you anymore”. This is unacceptable treatment of a customer, especially someone requiring special services. It’s almost ironic that a company that named itself “WOW” because it’s “a universal positive saying” and because they “believe it captures the best that [they] stand for and also what Iceland stands for” (words of Skuli Mogensen, CEO of WOW air) has such terrible customer service. Also, apparently if you turn WOW upside down it reads “MOM” because they like to think of themselves as “being a part of one big happy family”; the planes on their fleet also have names like “Dad, Gma, Gpa, Luv”. What sort of corny nonsense is this? I have never been stranded somewhere for 5 days because an airline can’t deliver. Most airlines have customer service at the airport, assist their customers immediately and see to it that they get to their final destination as soon as possible (i.e. within 24 hrs, without making one pay more to cover for their incompetence). This is not a company, it's a scam.

### "I have had nothing but trouble"
San Francisco to Copenhagen via Keflavik. I have had nothing but trouble with this company : booking directly with the company, they made 2 separate tickets for my flights Copenhagen - USA, which caused problems. It took me several phone calls + emails to have my name corrected on all tickets, when a mistake was discovered. On top of that I was charged for it. Luggage could not be checked in all the way. Cabin luggage and seating together with you traveling partner costs a lot extra! Be very careful on the size (not normal size) and weight of luggage, they charge extra for all overweight/size. When they broke off the handle of my new suitcase during a flight, I had to go through different agents in different countries before I was guided correctly in making a claim. Then they told me to have a new handle made (they lost the original) in a local shoe repair shop, since they have assessed that the suitcase can be repaired. How is that even possible? I am shocked by the rudeness and treatment by that company.

### "avoid this airline"
You should never fly Wow Air between North America and Europe - that's unberable. The seats are uncomfortable. No in-flight entertainment. A glass of water costs five dollars! The staff of Wow Air are in war with the passengers. They charge you up to $100 for bringing a normal carry-on luggage on board (one way) - which means that you pay up to $ 200 for a single carry-on between US/Canada and Europe. Wow often cancel their flights a couple of hours before departure. They offer you a refund but they never offer you an alternative route with another airline so you might buy a last-minute ticket that costs thousands of dollars. There are endless hidden charges. In the end you'll get much worse service than on traditional airlines. And you pay more than for a ticket on KLM, SAS, AA or Delta. You can fly Wow Air on short distances between Europe and Iceland, but you should never buy a ticket on Wow Air between Europe and North America. Avoid this airline.

### "not be flying WOW ever again"
Stockholm to Reykjavik via Toronto. I ordered a meal from the in-flight menu. It was a margarita pizza and cost CAD $12.37. The flight attendant said it would take 15 mins. One hour later after inquiring about it he replied that he had forgotten. He later returned with a small burnt pizza that was so hardened, the plastic fork broke when I tried cutting into it. He said to try it and if it tasted bad that he would replace it. It was served on the plastic wrapper which had burnt cheese and melted to the pizza, upon a piece of paper towel. It was disgusting looking and tasted mediocre. Did u eat it? Yes, I was starving! The plastic and paper towel garbabge remained with me the remainder fb the flight as no flight attendant ever came by to collect the waste. I will not be flying WOW ever again.

### "know what you're getting into"
If you're from the states, WOW air is Spirit's Euro cousin. You will extra pay for everything! A bag of chips, a soda, even water. There are no freebies! And yes although you're flying internationally, you'll pay an extra $60 for a checked bag, each way. So, be sure to factor in the additional costs when comparing flights. Planes aren't new, but legroom is pretty decent (they surpass Spirit here). Staff are courteous. Just know what you're getting into!

### "never recommend this airline"
Copenhagen to Chicago via Reykjavik. I got to Chicago 4 days ago without my luggage and the customer service is incapable of telling me where my bag actually is. It's absolutely irresponsible and unprofessional to not be able to even tell me where my bag is at the moment. The customer service I received was severely untrained and could not help me at all. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "were barely kept in the loop"
Miami to Gatwick via Keflavik, Worst experience ever regarding luggage. Our luggage was delayed when we landed on the Friday night. The staff at the airport were slow unhelpful and didn't even give us the information we needed. Wow air did little to help with the situation. We were left without our luggage until the Wednesday. The biggest joke of all was that the luggage arrived on the Monday night and we were 50 miles away from the airport and they were going to get it to us Thursday evening. In the end I had to spend 4 hours on the phone and then had to pick it up from a Fedex on the Wednesday. Throughout the whole experience we were barely kept in the loop about what was happening and had to constantly phone.

### "crew were very helpful"
On an impulse, I decided to fly Icelandair to see Reykjavik (KEF), and a few days later, with much trepidation after reading reviews here, WOW air to San Francisco as they are the only nonstop for that leg. At KEF, I asked the clerk if my extra-legroom seat assignment could be moved closer to the front. Not only did she move me 5 rows from the door, but she came around the counter and put a tag on my too big and way overweight carry-on bag that said - You Shall Pass. I also had two other large shopping bags which everyone ignored and went into the overhead easily. There were three passport and BP checks, which didn't really have to do with WOW. Getting to boarding reminded me of the Tokyo subway at rush hour. Then buses across the tarmac, schlepping my stuff up the stairway. Flight crew were very helpful. Extra legroom is always worth the dough on a nine hour flight. The plane was a spotless A333 with no bells and whistles. No chargers, no wi-fi, no screens, but the seats themselves were cushy, a happy trade-off for me. One neighbor volunteered he preferred no screens, he read a 400 page book. Left the gate on time, arrived 20 mins early. If you are willing to give up some frills, take this airline. They deliver.

### "my worst airline experience"
Amsterdam to San Francisco via Keflavik. Do not book a flight with Wow air. It is not worth the trouble, their staff is abysmal and flights are rarely on time. I am currently sitting in the Iceland airport waiting for a flight that was supposed to leave 6 hours ago. The new scheduled departure is for 430 am. I am looking at families, children, elderly people splayed throughout the floors of the terminal. We were not told any information, and we given a meal voucher after 6 hours of waiting which equated to a single sandwich, no drink included. We were initially delayed, not told anything, put on the bus and left to sit in the tarmac for 30 minutes. A fellow passenger pulled the emergency door switch because they refused to open the doors for a man suffering from overheating. This has been my worst airline experience to date. I would have gladly spent the extra money had I known what WOW air had in store for its customers. Terrible company, terrible business model, terrible staff. Never again. I would give a zero out of ten and no stars if possible.

### "they were extremely rude"
Amsterdam to New York via Reykjavik. Refunds for tickets are not allowed. I called the customer service and they were extremely rude. On the plane you have to pay for water and food, even on the long-distance flights from Europe to the US. A small bottle of water was around $3.50. It's a so-called budget airline, but my ticket was around $800. There is zero in flight entertainment. The seats are weak, so you can feel everything the person behind you is doing. There was an hour delay on the ground, but the staff didn't bother to let the passengers know. When we got on the plane, we had another hour delay. Most of us missed our connecting flights.

### "check-in person poorly trained"
Montreal to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Airport check-in person was poorly trained. I booked 2 seats (for my son and niece) at their premium price to allow for the supposed added leg room, baggage costs inclusions plus a meal. When I asked my son to reconfirm with the check in counter agent about the meal included with the additional BIZ fare, he was told that there was no food on board for him on his flight to Reyjavik. Later that evening my niece checked in and was told her baggage was overweight by 7 Kgs. The agent failed to advise her that her fare included 1 carry on bag + 1 personal bag! Had this been done, she would have thought of grabbing a bag from an airport shop. The situation caused panic and she was pressured into paying $200 dollars for the added weight and a threat of checkin closing. After communicating with the airline the response I received (10 days later) a reply that a home worker is paid to produce and one without any evidence of an actual investigation or contact with the negligent agent. Quite a joke. Yes there were easy means for her to get a bag from any airport shop, that happen to be in the terminal prior to passing through security. The agent was likely the same one that told my son that there were no meals or food for him on the flight, when he asked at his check in after I had told him he had a meal with his ticket. If you employ staff, you need to fully train them before you put them behind a counter.

### "learn from these mistakes"
Dublin to Miami via Keflavik. I'm going to preface this review by saying that 40% of the problems I had with Wow Air were not directly their fault. However it's the 60% in which the way they handled the situation is what made me never want to fly with them again. So allow me to give a little backstory. I was flying from Dublin airport to Reykjavik so that I could get to Miami by that evening. Immediately when I got on the flight we all got texts saying that the flight to Miami was delayed and could be delayed for up to a day (8 am the following morning) due to technical reasons. A little disappointing but what can you do? It happens. We landed on time in Iceland. Now here is where the review turns sour. So I didn't have any checked in luggage or anything just carry on but other passengers did. Not only did a lot of baggage not get through but they were forced to sit there and wait for over 2 hours until Wow Air sorted it out for them. I spent at least 45 minutes with them until I went to go find a Wow Air rep to handle it. They were nowhere to be found. We were told to go to a meeting point to see what would happen next? They said they'd provide us with a hotel and complimentary meal as compensation. So i went to the meeting point and there was no one there. Eventually people showed up. We waited up to 2 and a half hours for reps to come along and start handing out information about the hotels we were booked in. Eventually I was given a hotel and comp for a meal and I went onto the bus. The bus did not leave for 3 hours. 3 hours of waiting and all the while Wow Air did nothing to tell us what was going on. This company leaves you completely in the dark and does nothing to help you when your in a dire situation like this. They should really learn from these mistakes as judging by the other reviews? This isn't the only time that they have done this or something similar. Both flights back home on the other hand we're fine.

### "flight had mechanical problems"
Baltimore to Amsterdam via Keflavik. In 2015 we used WOW from Baltimore to Paris and return. Everything was fine and we again booked them, this time June 2017 for Baltimore to Amsterdam and return on July. It is my opinion that as they have grown in passenger numbers they have done nothing to increase their workforce to compensate for the increased work load. The result of our trip in both directions is a definite “we will never return to WOW.”  Baltimore to Keflavik. Delayed about one hour. The WOW employee on the bus to the terminal directed us to an incorrect Keflavik gate, resulting in a missed connection to Amsterdam. Luckily, WOW rebooked us on a flight later that day. Since we now had an 8-hour wait, I requested they pay our lunch. Refused. Prior to boarding the new flight, I asked the Keflavik WOW Customer Desk where my luggage would be. The answer was that it was on the new flight because, “it must travel with the passenger”. Keflavik to Amsterdam. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, we waited until every bag on our flight had been processed at baggage claim. I was then redirected to the freight handler for WOW who had our bags, having received them on the morning flight we had missed that day. They did not travel with us on our evening flight. Flight 3 – Amsterdam to Keflavik – The WOW ticket area in Amsterdam is poorly marked and you cannot see it until directly in front. Consequently, we walked the terminal near gate M for more than 15 minutes before finding the WOW line. It extended deeply into the terminal because WOW had only 4 of 7 desks open to receive people. The wait time to the check-in was about 45 minutes. This flight had mechanical problems and managed to depart about 3 hours late. Flight 4 – Keflavik to Baltimore (July 19). Arrival in Keflavik was at 3:15 PM to catch a 3:30 PM connection. The helpful WOW attendant at the end of the gateway said, “Read the sign”. She gave no guidance on how to reach that gate, or the requirement to go through passport control. Our BWI connection was at gate D22b. There were no WOW personnel to help at all. We made it to gate D22 to find no attendant. About 150 feet away from D22 is a very small sign “D22b” at the stairs. The WOW attendant at this gate said, “No worry your flight is delayed 30 minutes. I no longer have your reserved/paid seats but will give you seats 1B and 1C. Go down the steps and get on the bus.” At the bottom of the steps was an open bus full of people with no driver and no WOW personnel. This flight, scheduled for 3:30 PM finally departed at around 5:30 PM because “we are waiting for an attendant who needs to get to Baltimore”. Naturally, our luggage remained in Keflavik. I made several phone calls the next day to attempt to locate it. This resulted in everyone saying “we do not have a manifest but we will call you when WW117 luggage is downloaded tonight (July 20). I received a telephone call at 8:15PM on July 20 “we have your luggage in Baltimore. We can deliver it to you in 4 to 6 days”. Naturally, I went and picked it up at the airport that evening. I will close my comments for those of you who do not know that seat 1C is considered the worst seat on a plane. It is impossible to relax or sleep, as this is the waiting and traffic area for both the bathroom and the stewards.

### "not be choosing this airline again"
Brussels to Toronto via Reykjavik. There are many reasons why I will not be choosing this airline again. There is no value in doing so. Baggage is extra (checked bag-$95, carry on-$70) You have to pay to choose your seats online and if you don't, you will be seated separately than your travelling partners. No food or beverage is provided and even items such as water are about $5. There are no TV screens on the plane. They hassle people about the size of their (paid) carry on and warn people that if it seems too large there will be an extra charge. When all the extra charges and hassle are taken into account, the value for the money is 0. You can find other airlines that are very similar in price that include all of the things that WOW air deems extra. I cannot think of a single positive thing that this airline provided me, not even a cheaper price than other airlines. I found myself saying WOW alot, but only out of shock and frustration.

### "Do not fly with them"
Bristol to Keflavik. They pride themselves on being very "Wow" and are all humorous and fun when flying with them, but if you have any issues post flight they are incapable of providing any kind of customer service. I left my phone in the pocket of the aircraft, which was then (we assume) stolen. I have so far spent around 5-6 hours trying to communicate with them. They are not able to provide me with any kind of loss report (which my insurance company require) and they persistently refer me to the Icelandic police at Keflavik airport who will not provide this either. If you try to call them to speak to someone, it goes through to a call centre where they hardly speak English or Icelandic and then they just say that they deal with fares and tickets only. Facebook contact is an option but they have just replied with exactly the same (copy and pasted) response each time. Complete amateurs. Do not fly with them, fly with Icelandair instead. Add to this, dirty seats, torn seat pockets and constant up-selling - it's a winner - not!

### "I'm getting the run around"
Keflavik to Boston. On my return flight from Iceland, I was placed on standby. At the last minute I was able to board. I was told my luggage would be on the plane. When I got to Boston, it was not there. Someone representing WOW (and possible other/all the airlines) was there to file a claim and assure me the luggage would be delivered to me in person. I would be contacted. I was not. At this point, airlines are notorious for placing the bags on the next flight (when placed on standby), but I was not contacted. The WOW site directed me to a couple of phone numbers to contact the Boston airport baggage. All were bad numbers. At this, I was still in Massachusetts (eventually on my way home to San Diego). I contacted the airport for another bad phone number to the luggage ground crew. I contacted the Iceland airport and they verified that my luggage was sent to Boston the next day (all kinds of confirm #s were provided). I contacted WOW regarding the fact that the airport isn't getting back to me. I would soon be leaving Massachusetts, making retrieval a bit tricky. I told them that I had at least three bad phone numbers for the baggage handlers in Boston. I still got nothing. I then flew Southwest into San Diego. As I arrived home, I got a call stating that my baggage was in Boston (no kidding, I had been stating that fact. I simply needed someone to call me back). I was told that the luggage would be shipped overnight to me. It was not. When my bag arrived (10 days later), it was damaged. Now, I have been in a run around battle with WOW regarding damages. I try to remind them that if they had gotten back to me when I sounded the alarm, I could have retrieved my luggage in Boston. Instead, I'm getting the run around as to who is responsible. Had WOW been responsive, I would have received my bag a day late. No big deal. Now, it is a big deal. WOW refuses to take ownership of a problem created by themselves.

### "did not wow my family at all"
WOW air did not wow my family at all. Our flight from Miami to Iceland was 7 hours and 40 minutes and included no complimentary water or snacks. They charge for bringing bags into the cabin ($49.99 online or $99.99 at the gate. Yes you read correctly, for carry-on). They charge for water about $7.00, terrible food in ultra-small portions is $11.00 or more. If you want to watch a movie they "rent" ipads for $25.00. The temperature on the plane is freezing and I saw 2 passengers complain and were told something would be done about it, however nothing changed. In the middle of the flight, they move a cart down the aisle, selling "Iceland merchandise" and drinks. Also, they prohibit passengers from opening liquor purchased at the airport on the plane, but will gladly sell small liquor bottles for $9.00 each. If you must fly with this airline, buy food and water at the airport and bring it on-board (also have a blanket or jacket with you). It is up to you to make the flight comfortable.

### "never again WOW air"
I don't know where to start because there were so many unbelievably awful things about WOW air and this trip from Stockholm to Baltimore via Reykjavik. The fees for the bags are outrageous! Charging $50 to take a bag into the cabin with you. And $75 to get your bag checked and taken into the cargo area. The money we "saved" on these tickets plus the baggage fees for roundtrip actually cost more than a ticket on another airline. We will not be duped again. The seats on the plane between Stockholm and Reykjavik were okay and there was adequate knee room. So why did the plane for the longer flight to BWI from KEF have smaller seats with less knee room? Ridiculous! Charging for drinks? Including a glass of soda or juice, and not offering free glasses of water. No snack packs of pretzels or peanuts. Now our flight from KEF to BWI was diverted due to horrible thunderstorms was understandable for safety reasons. No problem with that especially after we'd already experienced some really bad turbulence earlier. However, keeping us on the tarmac with the "fasten seatbelt" sign still on, telling people not to get out of our seats for almost an hour while we waited for the captain to get information and directions was unforgivable. And when people started to get out of their seats to stretch their leg muscles, etc we did NOT appreciate being castigated by the flight crew for not obeying the lit seatbelt sign. We were tired of sitting for hours and hours and needed to stretch our muscles. There were several passengers who expressed a desire to deplane and were told 4 different stories from 4 different crew members on why that was not possible. During this waiting time, the crew hid themselves at the front and back of the plane behind the bulkhead so as to not see or be seen by passengers. This was not helpful to a plane full of frustrated anxious passengers. When we finally got word that we were going to get refuelled and fly back to BWI, the crew continued to hide and be not helpful or communicative with the passenger questions about connecting flights and luggage. You would have thought, that due to the inconvenience of being diverted, the crew would have offered all passengers a free soda or juice but NO they continued to hide from us. We were 4 hours late in arriving at BWI with many people missing their connections and we were offered absolutely nothing by this cheap, unfeeling ridiculous excuse for an airline for the anxiety, frustration and inconvenience - no apology, free drink etc. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. Never again WOW air. Never again.

### "such poor quality"
This was the worst flight I ever took and I fly a lot. During the 9h between Los Angeles and Reykjavik, WOW air staff never turned off the light even though it was a night flight. Seats were not only uncomfortable but it was also impossible to expand them at all. I asked for a glass of water after 6h of flight, and they told me I have to pay for the bottle. And they were quite rude. I felt sorry for the staff, because keeping people happy with such a bad plane and awful policies must really be a challenge. I can somehow understand the policy "0 water" when it's a short flight. But on a 9h flight, it's dangerous not to make sure the passengers stay hydrated, and it's completely immoral not to give them even a glass of water. I paid 1,000$ for the trip (back and forth), and I have never experienced such poor quality in a flight. I am very disappointed with this company. I am telling everyone I know not to fly with them, and I will surely never book another flight on this airline ever again.

### "stay away from this airline"
Los Angeles to Keflavik. What a joke this airline is. Engine trouble delayed this flight. Rude customer service agents both at the terminal and at there call center They were clueless in how to help rebooking and tried to put me on a flight 2 weeks after. Clueless about everything. Frustrating trying to solve my issues as they really did not care. Customer agent stated that's what you get buying cheap tickets. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this airline.

### "had a great experience"
San Francisco to Paris return via Keflavik and I had a great experience. I made sure to measure my carry on and personal item before flying, and had no problems at the airport. My carry on was weighed once at check in at SFO. I am a person who drinks a lot of water, so I made sure to bring 2 water bottles onto the plane (I refilled one from the bathroom sink while on board as well!). They do sell water, coffee, snacks on board, for a fee. I recommend bringing snacks for the flight as well. The KEF airport has lots of dining options, and I bought a sandwich on my layover for the second leg of my journey. The plane was very roomy, I had lots of leg room in my standard seat. The flight attendants were very nice on all the flights. Overall, I would fly WOW again. The price can't be beat and the experience was hassle-free and a great way to start and end my trip in Paris.

### "I was extremely disappointed"
Several months ago I purchased 6 'Big Seat (essentially Wow Airlines premium cabin), one-way tickets from Paris to San Francisco via Keflavik. I spent over $5,000 USD. Yesterday we took those flights. From Paris to Keflavik we did receive the “Big Seats”, and they were good. However on the long flight from Keflavik to San Francisco we did not. We were simply handed the economy boarding passes and without any explanation or apology. We were given a very confusing excuse and suggested we get a refund. I was extremely disappointed, especially since we had paid a large sum well in advance of the flights. No one from the airline informed of us of this change. We happened to notice the seat numbers on the tickets and two encounters with WOW employees resulted in a very glib response of, “we’re all sold out. You’ll have to get a refund.” Incredibly incredibly frustrating as I was a person they were in fact sold to. And to add to the frustration when on board - we had paid for meals as part of the premium tickets, which their on-board crew had no record of (luckily I had the confirmation email). The whole thing was an incredibly frustrating debacle. It felt like an airline run by indifferent teenagers.

### "Very uncomfortable seats"
Miami to Frankfurt via Keflavik. It's the worst ever. Very uncomfortable seats from Miami (aircrafts from Keflavik to Europe had much better and comfortable seats). They advertise low prices but you end up paying way more. Seats are expensive if you want to reserve one. Bags are super expensive (checked or cabin). They actually charge you 4 times for a round trip flight. Since all their flights connect in Reykjavik, you have 4 segments and they charge bag fees for each segment. The flights are crowded, food is not great and it costs a lot. Reykjavik airport is also super expensive. After you add all these extra money you spend, you realize you come close to what other major airlines charge for the same flight. Without the hustle and stress. Their airport and gate agents are really bad, very strict at enforcing bag size. If you think flying with personal item is ok, I did it but it was very difficult. You have to limit to min and it's very inconvenient. Your vacation or once in a life time experience becomes a stress and you will be super tired. Nothing to be Wowed, to be amazed!

### "pulled off for overbooking"
I was scheduled to fly from Miami to Copenhagen via Keflavik on June 24th and return the 5th July to visit my kids in Denmark that I have not seen in over a year. On Friday 23rd in the afternoon I received a text message stating my flight will depart 1 hr earlier and will stop in Maine for refueling. At first that didn't make any sense as I know their hubs are in Miami, NY, Boston or Pittsburgh. Nonetheless I was going to be there at the time indicated. Saturday morning around 6 am I got another text message letting me know that I was pulled off the flight for overbooking. Art this point I didn't know what to do, my trip was well planned and my kids were waiting for me. The problem now the options given to me were to get a full refund or choose another date to fly and a third option was to change my booking to the next available flight. After almost an hour on the phone they told me the next available flight from Miami is 4 days later or I can buy a ticket on my own and travel to another hub to catch a flight to Iceland and then Copenhagen. I didn't want to ruin my kids vacation so I purchased a ticket for over $200 US dollars to catch the next day's flight out of Pittsburgh. Now on my arrival to Copenhagen, I was scheduled to take a domestic flight with Norwegian to another city and I had to call and rebook a flight for another $300. When I contacted customer service regarding compensating me for my expenses i was told I have to get online and file a complaint which I did an that could take at least 8 to 10 weeks. I advise everyone not to fly with this cheap airline as their costumer service is mediocre. They don't really care. While in Denmark I called many times and never get thru their customer service. While I was returning back home on my layover in Iceland, I contacted their representatives at the airport and I was told she couldn't do anything. I was told to call their office in Iceland to see if someone will compensate me for my inconvenience and the money I spent . After an hour on the phone someone told me she couldn't do anything and I have to wait til someone contacts me. There's a queue and I have to wait for my turn". Til this day nobody from the airline has contacted me about my ordeal neither by email or by telephone and yet every day my inbox is flooded with offers from WOW air.

### "never received a penny back"
Miami to Stockholm via Keflavik. Thank you Wow Air for cancelling my flight as I am on my way to the airport and then telling me that the next flight was in 2 days. You then tell me that I will be fully reimbursed for my flight and waited 3 weeks for the reimbursement. I call because I still had not received my money back and then you tell me that I will only be reimbursed $29 out of the $149 because you "booked" me the flight for the 2 days after the original flight and I did not board after I told the gentleman on the phone that I could not wait another 2 days because I was in a wedding and I needed to fly out that day. Needless to say I had to spend $900 to fly with another airline and Wow Air did nothing to help the situation and had terrible customer service. I will never use them for any other flights ever again! And oh never received a penny back from what I spend on my flight!

### "penny wise and pound foolish'"
Montreal to Frankfurt via Keflavik. This airline is a fine example of 'penny wise and pound foolish'. It was a few hundred dollars cheaper with WOW to fly from Montreal to Frankfurt. But in the long run, it was more costly. Our flight arrived about 80 minutes late into Iceland which caused twenty of us to miss the Frankfurt flight by about 15 minutes. WOW chose not to hold the Frankfurt flight for us, and they only have one flight per day. WOW does not have any arrangements with other airlines to transport passengers like us. So you are stuck in Iceland until they can get you on another flight in the coming days. No person at the airport (including uniformed WOW personnel) has the authority to re-ticket you. It has to be done via email or phone. This was shocking, given that this is actually their hub airport! My emails took two days to have a response. By that point I had purchased a one way ticket to Frankfurt on Icelandair, which more than negated my savings with Wow. If you do not purchase 'extra legroom' seats, you will be sorry! That was the tightest legroom I have ever had, and I am not especially tall. Everything, including water, costs extra. My advice: think twice or three times before choosing the Wow experience.

### "Never again fly WOW Air"
Montreal to Dublin via Keflavik. Never again will I fly WOW Air. 5hrs before scheduled take-off time of 19:50 yesterday I get a text and email saying Montreal to Keflavik Flight 252 is delayed 1hr10 so we left YUL around 21.15. Captain assured us we had tailwind and would make up time and flight attendant assured us if we landed at 5:50 I'd make my 6:20 connection to Dublin. We landed Keflavik at 5.45 but it took 10mins for staff to open the aircraft door and another 15mins for the bus to get us the 100m from aircraft to terminal. Short story - Flight no one letting us through to the Dublin flight (we were 4 for that flight) even though plane still at gate. Next flight to Dublin flight is at 17:55 today - 12 hrs later! And how does WOW compensate - vouchers to eat airport junk food. Keflavik airport has no restaurant, no showers, no lounge, no hotel, no secure lockers for luggage. Does WOW provide a voucher for a bus into town? No. Zero customer service. Oh and don't get me started on the 'well you can ask for a refund of your flight' song, because how do I get another flight out of KEF to DUB within a reasonable amount of time to justify the cost of being gouged by another airline while stranded in KEF? I don't, so it's a totally empty gesture.

### "It's not worth the savings"
Keflavik to Dublin. This is the second time I flew WOW and they completely ruined my vacation and my budget. I got a text that my flight to Dublin from Keflavik was delayed (leaving at 7:00am instead of 6:15 am). I checked in online the night before and the boarding pass said "boarding 6:15. When I got to the airport there was a huge line to place your luggage on the conveyor belt after I printed out the sticker for it. This time there were no humans manning the conveyor belts and luggage. When I got to the belt, it was 6:30 am. The message that it gave me when I scanned my boarding pass was "Gate closed, see agent. Tricky because they don't have an agent! Not only was it a half hour before the plane was about to take off, but there was no one to talk to. Realizing that WOW does not keep anyone except flight attendants on hand (and they were gone too), I called the 800 number. I got a series of rude people at the call center. I could either pay again for a flight to Dublin and incur the fees for another night in Reykjavik, along with a  taxi ride or go home. I had to buy another ticket from Reykjavik to SFO since they wouldn't honor the one I would have used to return on July 6th. One of the airport representatives told me they have pulled representatives from Keflavik airport and don't even have anyone to speak with in Reykjavik. I wasted so much money and no one cares. That was the trip I had saved for and it was 48 hours in Iceland - most spent at the airport. Don't fly WOW! It's not worth the savings.

### "I would fly Wow Air again"
For the price of £393 which I paid, a return to America can't be sniffed at, you just need to temper your expectations of what you get for this. The planes were pretty new, clean and while the seats did get uncomfortable on the hop to America I think you'd struggle to find an economy seat that doesn't get uncomfortable after 6 hours. All 4 flights left time and arrived early. If you are travelling with luggage that needs to go in the hold then it does push the price up, I paid £105 in total for this, but my family all took advantage of the 10kg personal item and took all of their belongings in rucksacks to keep their costs as low as possible. Make sure that you buy your food and drinks in the airport as it is expensive onboard the plane and there isn't great choice, but this is just a budget airline model or certainly is in Europe and Asia where I have flown extensively using budget airlines. Bring your own in flight entertainment, books, kindle, tablet, Ipad etc as these do cost, but again, it's low cost flying and this is how they can offer cheap flights in the first place. Overall I would fly with Wow Air again, they are cheap and get you where you need to me, in my experience, on time.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Pittsburgh to Dublin via Keflavik. I was very apprehensive about this airline after reading reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was concerned my carry-on was slightly oversized, but no one said anything. The staff was friendly and courteous, conversational but professional. I was surprised the room in the seat; I am very tall, and am often uncomfortable on other airlines, but these had more room, plus there were open seats elsewhere, and I was permitted to switch. The cushions did get uncomfortable, but most will after six hours. I experienced no problems. Sure, the extras cost extra, that's what you're paying for. Bring snacks and empty water bottles to fill up after security. Weigh your suitcase and make sure your carry-on is a decent size, and you should be fine. I'm not saying my experience was typical. I'm told this was only the third flight from Pittsburgh to Reykjavik, but I had a perfectly fine experience. I would both fly again and recommend Wow Air.

### " fly any other airline"
As I sat in Miami Airport wondering how I was going to get myself to Europe after having my flight (Miami to Amsterdam via Keflavik) cancelled by WOW air it dawned on me. After first being told that the soonest they could have me and my brother on our way was 2 days later and then being confronted with the reality of their lies after speaking with another lady that had already been holed up there for 2 days and was being fed the same line again - "WOW" is simply the only thing that I could think of as I pulled the trigger on $2600 seats on another airline. That's surely why they chose it as their name. You'll be saying that a lot if you choose this as your airline and I don't mean in a good way. Save yourself some money and fly TAP or any other airline.

### "file a claim under EU law"
Baltimore to Lyons via Keflavik. The four of us (two adults and two young children) checked in online early in the morning for an evening flight and obtained our boarding passes. A few hours after checking in online we received a first text/email from WOW indicating that the flight was delayed. We received another such email around 13:17 EST indicating that the flight was further delayed. We received a third text/email from WOW around 16:53 EST (two hours before the flight was to take-off), when we were already at the airport and in the process of trying to check our luggage. We kept trying to obtain information and support from the desk agents, but they simply handed us a small slip of paper with the telephone number to customer service; the desk agents informed us that they were routinely not provided with flight information nor were they empowered to provide support. We called customer service multiple times; for the first hour, the calls would either not go through or the line was so bad upon answering that nothing could be understood. As we were not able to immediately reach anyone by phone, I sent a text response “Can someone please call me?” to which I received the response “Hi, Thank you for the text message. More information and support please go to our website wo”. Finally, after nearly two hours, we were able to speak to someone, who was rather dismissive on the whole, by phone but were then placed on hold for nearly 45 minutes while they consulted someone else. The representative indicated that we would have to be re-booked for 1 July or have our money refunded. Again, no justification for our being bumped was provided and the representative told us it was too late to board the BWI-KEF flight, even though the flight crew had not even reported yet (they passed us while on the phone). We asked for a WOW connecting flight to Paris since we could see that there were open seats; the representative stated we could not be accommodated although he refused to provide any justification. We stressed that we had two young children, no place in the area to stay, and non-refundable obligations in France. He held firm to the 1 July re-booking date; we therefore had no choice but to request a refund. As it was growing late and our children were tired, we re-approached the desk agent regarding a free hotel room that had been mentioned, but she informed us that the hotel room was only available for those who re-booked their flights. Having no options, we booked an expensive (US$10,330) last-minute flight with Air France. We were shocked to find out that both WOW flights actually occurred without issue except for being late. Our suspicion is that WOW was concerned that the late departure from BWI would have prevented our being able to catch the connecting flight and WOW would have had to accommodate us in accordance with EU Flight Compensation Regulations. Icelandic Transportation Authority (where WOW is based) directed us file a claim under EU law. Besides our own young children’s bad experience, we also feel bad for the other families with even younger children that were impacted by this transgression; some of these families obviously lacked the financial resources to secure other flight arrangements as we did and were subject to WOW's whims.

### "WOW was OK overall"
The flight from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik with WOW was OK overall. The boarding seemed to be a bit slow, crew was nice at first but seemed to act a bit superior later inflight. The legroom was pretty good for a low cost airline and the plane was rather clean. It arrived on time but it took a while to get to the terminal (using busses). The 2nd leg was pretty crowded, crew was not interested in anything, seat was pretty bad and the legroom was a lot worse than the first flight. At least we got to AMS on time. Overall feeling was good for a low cost airline but not amazing, I will be thinking about it before I use them again considering it is a bit expensive to get a normal size carry on, to get a checked bag and you don't get any water, drinks or food or any kind of IFE. The only really good thing about it was that I got this at an offer and paid a small amount!

### "very disappointed with them"
Do not go with WOW Air for your flights. They made us go through TO our gate for the flight from Reykjavik to Boston and wait 35 minutes before sending a guy who very quietly asked us to return. They then tell us they started a 2 hour unplanned maintenance and were 1 hour into the maintenance (so why makes us go through the gate and make last calls?) On top of that they charge you for absolutely anything they can like almost $70 for a carry on bag, we were also separately charged for check in bags. The flight was also $500 for a one way flight. We are very disappointed with them.

### "you will definitely regret it"
Gatwick to Newark via Keflavik. I paid $400 for a one way ticket and nothing else was included. So it wasn't even cheap like they advertise. Online WOW air was like we provide nothing for you no food or entertainment and we expect you to bring that for yourself and the expectation is upfront. I then checked me emails and I got no emails from them saying that. So it's not upfront at all. Also how can they expect us to bring our own beverages when we can't take them through security? They were like we can do that because we offer really cheap flights starting from $185 but I paid $400 one way not round trip and totally got ripped off. We don't even get free water we have to pay for that over a 6 hour flight! Not even one glass of water! I've been on other cheap airlines and gotten much better service! Please don't take this airline you will definitely regret it.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Keflavik to Boston. This is the worst airline I have ever used. We had so many delays. A 5 hr flight turned into an 8-8.5 hr flight. We were offered a water or a cup of coffee for this inconvenience Wow - 8 hrs on a plane mostly time spent sitting on a runway waiting not my idea of a great time. I will not be in a rush to use this airline again.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Gatwick to Boston via Keflavik. This is the worst airline I have flown. I have been in worse situations before (longer delays etc) but never have I seen such confusion as I saw yesterday. My flight from Gatwick to Keflavick was delayed 35 minutes, it made me a little concerned about my connection but not too bad as I had 90 minutes. The once we boarded it was delayed longer and longer, now that I had no internet, no food or water we just sat there for an hour never knowing when we were going to leave, then they made an announcement that we would leave in a half hour, then 5 minutes later we took off! I still arrived in Iceland after my connection but they announce when we landed that they had held the plane (good for me, bad for everyone else) they rushed us onto the plane and I was disappointed I didn't get a chance to have some Icelandic food on my layover but happy I didn't miss my plane - then the plane just sat there on the runway for over an hour, again no food, no water no internet. During this time I found out that about two dozen people on the plane were not even going to Boston, they had booked for other destinations but were being flown to Boston now as the was only option left to them to at least get to the US. When we finally arrived in Boston they lost all our bags, baggage claim was insanity with people wondering how their bags would get to them as they were now left on their own to get to Pittsburgh, New York, Denver etc where they actually paid to go. At least I live in Boston but I had another trip coming up Saturday so I called 1st thing Friday morning to inquire about my bag and they said it wasn't there responsibility for 5 days. Luckily my work credit card insurance compensates me for what they lost. I also paid $19 for a cup o noodles (50 cents worth of food) and trail mix since i had been trapped on WOW planes for the last 12 hours. Pay the extra $100 (or even $300) whatever it takes to avoid this airline.

### "satisfied with my experience"
I have been flying from Boston to Paris via Iceland, and back. After reading online reviews of WOW air before my departure, I was really concerned that my flight might experience issues. However, everything went really well. We got a little bit of delay before taking off in Boston, but there was still more than enough time to catch the connecting flight. The connection ws very smooth, Keflavik is a small airport and the passport control went really fast. There is not much space for sitting of course, but at this low price, you know what you are going for. The crew (ground and cabin) was really friendly. If you have a carry-on / checked baggage, I would recommand buying it when booking, as adding it online afterwards, even before checking-in, will bring extra fees. Bring an empty water bottle, as water is not free. I am overall satisfied with my experience and I would recommand WOW Air to anyone flying on a low budget and who doesn't need extra confort (there is no inflight entertainment, reduced leg space, everything is for sale even water).

### "Not bad at all"
San Francisco to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. Not bad at all. A lot of people seem to fortget that it is a budget airline. So you have to pay for everything on baord but if you prepare there's no problem at all. They are not as budget as you might think since, when you add bagage (and yes you pay for handluggage as well, only one personal item is allowed, but that can be the size of a normal (day) backpack) they are not much cheaper as a regular airline. The internet booking went smoothly, i booked row 3A/ C for the first flight. About 2 months before my trip I checked my booking, only to find out that row 3 had completely disappeared from the aircraft. They did respond to my email, but did not seem to understand the problem. So i phoned the call centre (in India but against local fares) and after 20 minutes spoke to a call centre employee. He explained they changed the airplane (row 3 did indeed not exist but was a "big chair") but changed my seats to row 19 H/K against no extra cost. The leg space on those seats (it appeared they had given me a extra legroom space at no extra cost) was amazing! The seats were comfortable and the flight left on schedule. I slept through most of the flight, so I cant tell you about their service. After a short transfer in Iceland, the second flight was amazing. I booked chair 2 E/F (normal economy) but since there was no row 1  we had a gigantic leg space. Best of all is that we arrived about 35 minutes early of schedule. So no complaints about my flight. Ok they lost one of our bags, but since it only contained dirty laundry, I did not bother (it was odd size bagage they lost). They returned it 2 days later at my front door. For a budget airline I thought most of it was smooth! You don't get any food or drinks, but they allow you to bring it on board!

### "seats were nearly insufferable"
Flew San Francisco to Berlin via Reykjavik. Like many unwitting customers I found WOW air because of their seemingly low prices, that is until one adds up paying additionally for, seat location, extra legroom, bags, and any consumables. Never have I taken a flight where I had to pay for my seat after considering the posted ticket price. Never have I taken a flight where I had to pay for water! The seats were nearly insufferable as they hardly reclined, there was very little cushion and no entertainment of any kind. In addition to all of this it was unclear in my receipt that I received from wow whether or not I was charged for baggage as it read that I had paid nothing for checked and carry on bags. By the time I was leaving for the airport and reviewing my ticket I had a minor panic as I didn't want to pay the exaggerated fees at the airport for checked bags should I need to buy them there. Turns out I had paid with the price of my original ticket. When I asked to be refunded for the additional bag fee they made no concession whatsoever. Wow doesn't save you any money in the long run but it does make you resent sneaky business practices.

### "the hostesses left much to be desired"
The plane was stuck in Newark for one hour on Jun 11 (due to security surrounding President Trump's family flying out from New Jersey). Some passengers and I were due to change flights at Keflavik with only one hour in between. We thought we had no hope of catching the transit flight to London. The pilot made it, we arrived into Keflavik one hour earlier than expected. However, the hostesses left much to be desired.

### "horrible experience with WOW"
Paris to Boston via Keflavik. My sister and I had a horrible experience with WOW air. All of those things a customer dreads about flying not only occurred, but surpassed any other experience we've had. It started with the hidden fees. When we checked in, we were expecting we would have to pay to check our bags. This had been communicated in an email, however an additional 65 euros for a backpack is unacceptable. The size or weight of the bag is also not considered, so you pay the same for a backpack that weights 8kg as luggage that potentially weighs much more. So I told my sister since we were early, maybe we could do some rearranging and that way we could only check one bag and carry on another. To this, the representative informed us that even a carry on bag would be 57 euros. To WOW air, are you expecting your customers to enjoy Iceland or wherever without clothes? We were exhausted at the end of our trip, but excited to return home and this was the obstacle that we had to face: an extra 130 euros to take our belonging home in our medium sized backpacks. After our experience checking in, I knew not to expect anything from this horrible airline. And I was right, in a three hour flight with 8+ staff members we didn't even receive a cup of water. When we landed we were really hungry. What is a big deal to me is that when we were in the terminal in Iceland we got ripped off on food and drinks like never before. I bought a tuna sandwich and coffee and paid $18. I will never fly with WOW again. What a sad, disappointing, contradiction this airline is.

### "seats become torture devices"
Miami to Paris via Keflavik. Flights were on time and flight attendants were helpful, courteous, and very nice. However, the seats, which would be fine for a short or medium length flight (up to 3-1/2 hours), become torture devices during long flights (8 hours). It is also unacceptable that passengers must pay for everything, including for a cup of water. I've flown economy overseas on several airlines, none offer true comfort, but none are as uncomfortable and harmful as WOW Air's seats. From now on, I'll be happy to pay a couple of hundred dollars more for a long flight on an airline that actually cares for the well-being of its passengers. And, hear me, I'm not asking for comfort, I'm asking for conditions that do not cause bodily harm to passengers.

### "unless you are desperate, check out other airlines"
My daughter and I flew WOW air from Paris to Miami via Keflavik, and we made the return flight using the same airline and airports. Although the flight attendants provided impeccable service, the airplane as a whole left too much to be desired. We were like sardines in the plane from Keflavik to Miami, and it was not possible to get a cup of water. This was for sale. Talk about profiteering from human misery. The seats are so hard and uncomfortable that I spent the full 8 hours in excruciating pain in my back and legs. Unless you are desperate and this is the cheapest flight you can get, check out other airlines. WOW Air charge $70 for each checked bag and $40 or so for carry on the exceed the size of a little purse. Big thumbs down.

### "the staff were cheerful"
Frankfurt to Toronto via Keflavik. bWe were very hesitant to fly with WOW because of terrible reviews we read. However we needed to get back to Canada and decided to give WOW a shot. We flew from Frankfurt to Keflavik. The aircraft was crisp and clean! My husband and I were not seated together which wasn't a problem as we both got a window seat in the same row, there was plenty of leg room and having controls of the air conditioning was a plus, the seats went back a bit and the head rests move so you can lean on them if you wanted to nap. The flight attendants were cheerful and nice to speak with. Our second flight was from Keflavik to Toronto. When we saw the tickets printed I noticed we weren't together again so I mentioned it and she changed it right away. This time we were near the front of the plane. Our seats had a bit more leg room then the last flight. We found out from one of the attendants that the first 5 rows have more leg room. Again the staff were cheerful, approachable and nice. Another thing we found cool was that the each aircraft had a name. We flew on TH-Pro the first flight and TH-Neo the second.

### "no more WOW air for me"
My flight from Frankfurt to Toronto via Reykjavik was cheap with WOW air if you don't count that you have to pay extra for everything - baguette with some cheese and ham and a Coke (12 euro). My hand luggage was too big (59 euro) and so on. You can rent an iPad for extra money and then you can get a movie. Next time I will go with Lufthansa with a direct flight for the same money. No more WOW air for me

### "a stripped down airline"
San Francisco to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Be aware that WOW is a stripped down version of an airline with the very least they can offer. Surprised they even offered seats! For the 8 hour flight from San Francisco to Keflavik they never once offered a drink of water. Mind you, one could purchase a bottle of water for an outrageous price. Then, one of my bags was lost. There is no rep at Amsterdam so the group of us were directed, in Dutch, no info given in English, to go to the baggage service desk. They collected info forms and said they would call (I have no phone) or email when my bag arrived and they would deliver it to the address I'm staying at. But, I have no place to stay because they lost my camping gear. This cost me $90!

### "this is the worst airline"
Worst flight I have ever been on in my entire life. My boyfriend and I decided to book a flight from Newark Paris for his birthday. To start we get to the airport 3 hours in advance, and there a very rude man tells us that we cannot check in our bag as it is 12:30 and they do not open until 3. We say thanks and walk to the USO. When we check in our bags finally the process takes about 30 minutes with confusion and changing seats and questions passengers have. The flight we are told is delayed an hour and a half, as you may or may not know the flight to Iceland which is our layover is about 5.5 hours. We are already behind and are running late. They board us in a hurry, there is no entertainment or refreshments provided without a fee. Okay we bypass that and realize that the seats are so small we cannot sit properly, they seem almost childlike and are very hard seats. As we land it is raining and they tell us we have to be rushed through because we are delaying the other plane from taking off. When we depart the plane they rush us through security and every other measure available for safety. Now we are wet and pushed into another uncomfortable flight without any answers as to our bags. When we land in France our bags are not there and we are told to wait an hour until they are located. Fast forward a couple of days when we are set to go home. The flight is delayed 2 hours and we change gates 3 different times. this plane to KEF is much nicer than the original 2 planes we had been on. Once again we are told that we are late but will make it on time. We land and they rush us once again on another plane to EWR, this time we are assured our luggage will make it. But we notice the plane takes off rather quickly and I do not see them loading any luggage into this new plane who by the way is smaller than the first 2 planes for this 5.5 hour flight. We arrive home where some representative tell us that our bags have been left in Iceland and will be flown to us the next day. Upset that all of my medication and gifts were left I write multiple emails and make loads of phone calls. The WOW representatives tell me its my fault for not verifying my bag was on the plane. We go home and now it is memorial day, we have to drive out of our way to pick up our luggage. I realize that my luggage is broken, my Samsonite I have had for years has its locks broken by TSA agents who did not have anyone to open it for them because of course it was not on the flight with us. WOW is refusing to pay for my luggage and is telling me its my fault for not verifying the luggage before leaving the airport. I swear this is the worst airline I have ever been on, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. P

### "engaging in gotcha-practices"
This airline is engaging in gotcha-practices. You will end up paying more than for a regular airline. The best one is that they sized their carry-on boxes just slightly smaller than the standard carry-on bags. So you end up prepaying for your carry-on (something like $45), and then they charge you oversized fee of $90 because "oops" the wheels are not completely getting in. And no, you don't get the original fee refunded. And then they still let you carry it on-board as a carry on, without actually checking it in. Also, don't forget to buy a bottle of water before you board, because "gotcha", please pay for water on-board.

### "worst flight experience ever"
Miami to Frankfurt via Keflavik. For me my worst flight experience ever. The main reason were my seats. I bought 2 Big Seats directly thru the WOW Air homepage which cost me a little over $200 but when I got my tickets I had gotten 2 standard seats. My flight was completly booked out so of course the flight crew didn't move me (even tho I showed them my account details with the reserved seats) cause some other couple already sat in my seat. Even tho they've purchased it at the check-in counter. So whoever is to blame for that mistake it was terrible to be sitting in such a small seat especially with an infant on my lap for 7hrs. On another note. I understand this is a low budget airline but don't expect any inflight entertainment nor blankets or pillows. And on top of that NO beverages or sandwiches are for free. I've paid $6,38 just for a water and a juice box. Of course later on was more drinks and food added. Don't get fooled with the cheap tickets when in the end you pay tons of money for better seats, every checked in bag costs you plus extra hand luggage and drinks and food.

### "my trip was so pleasant"
I had problem free airline from Gatwick to Keflavik. I paid half the price I pay for a normal thicket. I was worried after seeing lots of negative review about the airline but for me it worked okay. Flights were on time and my trip was so pleasant.

### "Never WOW again"
Dublin to New York via Keflavik. Absent Customer Service! We paid extra for XXL legroom on our recent trip. First experience with WOW Air. We were seated in a normal seat. When I asked the flight attendant I was told our seat is one with extra legroom. It absolutely was not. When questioning a second flight attendant, she told me the truth which was that they changed aircraft and didn't adjust our seat location. Once home, after repeated, never answered calls to customer service, I finally sent an email. After about 5 or 6 days, I received a reply asking for my boarding pass! (I had given them my booking, confirmation number) Luckily I had them and sent them a new email. This time I asked for a contact number so I can speak to someone. After another couple of days I again received an email, telling me they are issuing a refund. They did not send me contact information. This refund is for only a small portion of what I paid for the upgrade. Never WOW again! !

### "It's bare bones no frills flying"
Flew Keflavik to Boston. If you must fly with Wow Air you should keep a few things in mind. This is a no service airline. In the sense that you will not get any service unless you pay for it. Furthermore, the airline has little or no regard for such things as keeping to a schedule, responding quickly to complaints from passengers and as numerous people have pointed out. Might just have the worst customer service in the airline industry. So you better hope and pray that your luggage doesn't get lost. That you don't have a connecting flight. That you'll never have to contact WOW air for any reason at all. The product itself is basic. Actually before getting on the plane the website should be warning enough about what to expect. It's all about trying to get you to purchase add-ons. Stuff that you'd normally find included in the ticket. Airport staff seem capable enough. But once you get on the plane. Well there's no entertainment nor any wifi, so you better hope they won't implement that ban on laptops and tablets on flights to the US. There is a power outlet which hopefully will be working by the seat. But that's it. Cabin is all economy, staff will go through and sell food items and duty free, but won't bother you that much otherwise. It's bare bones no frills flying. If you can find a rock bottom price ticket, are fully flexible about your time and won't worry about luggage, then this might be an option to consider. Otherwise, simply pick another carrier.

### "do better to have robots running it"
Toronto to Berlin via Keflavik. Have flown on Icelandair for a holiday in Iceland and couldn't say enough positive things. Thought WOW Air would be the same friendliness etc. minus the food and entertainment. Obviously it is a discount airline so I expect to get what I pay for. Paid for extra leg room and got at the front of the plane which was great. Totally didn't realize that water wouldn't be served, but I always travel with my own thank goodness. I was sorely disappointed in the service manner of the stewards. This airline would do better to have robots running it. Not a friendly face or smile to be seen. I couldn't believe that in a service industry these people were allowed to be so dull. This discount airline is going to give Iceland a very bad reputation. First leg of approx. 5 hours the stewards would not discipline a rowdy group of young people ordering drinks a mile a minute. Wouldn't have cared if this had lasted an hour or two but enough is enough. Nobody could sleep.

### "staff weren't overly friendly"
Flew WOW air from San Francisco to Keflavik. It wasn't a terrible flight, we were boarded quickly and departed the airport quickly. I had the premium package which included checked luggage and XXL leg room and a meal/free drink. This package was with it as it can be expensive to add things individually. The staff weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude. The food wasn't great it didn't taste like anything. We arrived to Keflavik on time. They didn't turn off the cabin lights the whole flight and it was very warm during the flight to the point of nearly sweating. Otherwise my legs hurt and they let me stand up and just chill as long as I wanted.

### "Emotional trauma, stranded"
WOW is right. Emotional trauma, stranded and $3,500 to get to destination. Budget airline treated us like budget cargo not human beings on our journey to see my elderly mother who was very sick - march 2017. Maybe WOW was oversold and took our seats on a costly random pretext and were then caught in the middle when we showed up with boarding passes. Maybe their San Francisco ground staff were just incompetent and their management decided to be unaccountable. Whatever the reason for denying us passage you could not make this up. We made our connection arriving in SF from Seattle on Alaska which was delayed due to weather. In Seattle WOW told us via phone from Iceland after confirming it with management to leave our bags in SFO and claim them later so we could make our flight to the UK. We arrived in time - we would claim them later and actually we were prepared to never see them again due to the seriousness of the trip. But in SFO the WOW gate agent refused to let us board unless we checked our bags from another airline. This was not an international flight and TSA and Alaska Airlines did not require bag collection and both plus WOW themselves said leave them as they were the other side of security and would be kept until claimed or disposed of as lost. I told gate agent why it was critical to board and we would claim bags from the other airline later. Go get your bags now! I asked if the flight would wait but all the agent would say gruffly is "We are boarding!". We were ordered to get the bags even though the check in counter was obviously closed The WOW manager then spoke to someone at the closed desk to tell us to bring the bags through TSA passenger check point?! Of course after going back through the long security line we were turned back by a TSA supervisor who could not believe that WOW had told us to bring suitcases through the passenger security line. Needless to say having sent us on this futile mission quite unnecessarily the plane left without us. The WOW manager came up from the gate and told us you should not have followed our (WOW's) advice. She left us stranded. No offer to put us on the WOW flight the next day. It would have cost them nothing. It cost us everything we could muster up financially. We had to pay 3,500 one way from SFO to our destination on another airline. We filed a complaint with WOW. After weeks of waiting WOWs only response was the baggage check in closed an hour before the flight - I'm not sure they even read the complaint.

### "probably won't fly WOW air again"
Newark to London Gatwick via Keflavik. I probably won't fly WOW air again. I understand their business model, and I expected nothing more than to get to London and back for a low price. But the physical discomfort wasn't worth the great price. WOW did fly me to London and back in a timely manner, which is saying something. But the add-on price for choosing your seat (I think it was $50) was just unconscionable price-gouging, and I wouldn't do it. I'm sure that allowing a customer to select a seat on line costs the airline pretty much nothing. And if you don't pay the $100 round-trip to select a seat, you're going to be miserable. Maybe even if you do select a seat. I have been on many types of aircraft and many different airlines. I don't think I have ever been on any flight, anytime or anywhere, where so many seats were crammed onto the plane and so little room was available. On all four legs of the flight, WOW put me in a middle or window seat, which was extremely confining and made me feel imprisoned. This was complicated by the people next to or in front of me, who reclined their seat or spread out where no spreading-out was really possible. I just have never been so physically uncomfortable on any flight ever. If you pay to choose a seat, you can be slightly less confined, but then your bargain ticket is not a bargain anymore.

### "extra charges for everything."
Paris to San Francisco via Keflavik. Bare Bones. Extra charges for everything. No free water. No entertainment. Customer service at checking in Paris was very bad. Arrived 3 hours early to check in bag and barely got through line in time for flight. But cheap! If price is the only concern, you might want to try. Stopover in Iceland is expensive. Everything at airport is overpriced.

### "customer service was beyond poor"
Los Angeles to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Once we arrived to Frankfurt, we discovered our bag had not arrived. While completing the paperwork for them to look for our bag, I was told by the airport employee that it was my fault for not knowing how to pack. We completed all the necessary documents and provided a phone number and email address in hopes of being contacted a day or two, at the maximum, regarding our bag. However, I had to call multiple times and after being placed on hold for a significant amount of time, they always hung up on me. After over 30 emails inquiring about my bag, I was informed that it was found and sent to Barcelona (on April 13) and we were scheduled to fly home on April 15. At that point I asked to have it sent back to US. Again, I had to inquire on that and was provided with inaccurate information on the airline that was bringing it back to the US. I did not get my bag until April 18 and it was in such poor condition that I had to throw it away. After sending multiple emails to the [email protected] asking to at least get reimbursed for the check bag fee (the bag was brand new, it was bought a few days before our flight and I included a receipt of that when I emailed them) I had to pay to fly it from LAX to Germany, ($119.98) I received an email thanking me for letting them know about my unfortunate experience and nothing about getting reimbursed. I asked again, and received a response stating my ticket has been closed. I would not fly WOW again, since I had to spend money to fly my bag to Germany, never to see it, had to reach out to them over 30 times via email before being informed my bag had been found 2 days before I was scheduled to fly home, got hung up on multiple times, had to buy clothes there for me and my husband, had my bag completely destroyed and was not reimbursed for the fee I paid to fly it to Germany to travel through Europe without me. Their customer service was beyond poor, their lack of replies and inability to accept responsibility for misplacing my bag and not agreeing to reimburse me the check in fee left a bitter taste in my mouth and created unnecessary stress and frustration during a trip that should have been one of the most memorable ones with our daughter while she's stationed so many miles away from home.

### "customer service by far the worst "
Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik. I paid online for 1 carry-on bag and 1 check bag and arrived to airport with 1 carry-on and 1 check bag but on arrival at check in counter I was charged additional check bag (I have now paid for 3 bags when I only have 2 and I don't want to miss my flight). The carry-on bag already paid for online that was then additionally charged (full airport price) at counter for check-in was denied to get measured with their fit bin and deemed too big by appearance. That very same carry-on bag that was denied as carry-on was accepted as carry-on on flight home. I have been going back and forth with customer service on phone then online about this because they initially responded to me in a automated fashion (I have the suspicion they didn't read my email thoroughly which is rude and lazy as well as not taking their guest seriously) and as I continue to try to get this issue resolved they do not seem to see the problem I am trying to point out which is to please refund the additional amount charged at airport for bag in question because that bag was already paid for as a carry-on (a charge I previously paid online and did not utilize) and proved to be carry-on size when it was accepted on return flight as such. Throughout this process, their customer service is by far the worst due to incompetence and/or just simply lazy and rude.

### "It was a great bargain"
Toronto to Berlin via Keflavik. I read several worrying reviews before booking, but decided to still give it a go because the price was unbeatable ($330 CAD, or about 250 USD) for my trip from YYZ to SXF via Reykjavik. I'm usually suspicious when things seem too good to be true, so I still had a funny feeling about it until the day of departure when, at 3 AM, I received a text message telling me that the second leg of my flight had been overbooked. I was told I could volunteer to take a later flight and receive a round-trip voucher, which didn't interest me, nor did I want to get stuck in Iceland. Strange start. Upon calling the customer service hotline the next day, and waiting on hold for about 10 minutes or so (not too bad), I was told the situation had been resolved and I could go ahead with my usual trip. Not the smoothest and most relaxed start to a departure day, but at least everything was to plan in the end. Check-in and baggage drop at the airport was fast and easy, boarding quick and efficient. There was an issue at the gate with the weight distribution of baggage in the plane but this could be down to local Toronto staff so no minus points for the airline. The planes for both legs were new A321s, the seats weren't great in terms of spacing or padding, but this is a discount airline. The majority of the flight attendants were not especially warm but were very professional, with a few exceptions who were both. No complaints. While the Toronto to Reykjavik leg did feel a bit long with somewhat tight seating and without a meal or in-flight entertainment, I knew exactly what to expect and got exactly what I paid for. I brought food and an empty water bottle that I filled up behind security in Toronto, so I didn't buy the expensive on-board food. My bags and I arrived safely in Berlin, exactly on time and without incident. This was the cheapest transatlantic flight I have taken, and while I wouldn't want to fly with WOW every week, it did exactly what I asked of it. It was a great bargain. I don't doubt that the others who have left reviews have had genuinely difficult experiences with the airline, but mine was on the whole quite positive and I would book with them again - just not too soon.

### "never ride with them again"
Baltimore Washington to Paris Orly via Keflavik. On my way there my first flight was delayed by about 2 hours, I was fine with this because it gave me time to talk to my fiance on skype. We leave BWI and arrive in Iceland but the minute I arrive they tell me my connecting flight to Orly (Paris) has already departed. Everybody on my flight waits at the airport for at least 10 hours before another plane comes over to take us over. Spent a great time in Paris but I was pretty afraid of my way back. So I leave Paris this time knowing ahead of time that I was going to wait for 12 hours at the airport because they just decided they would. They then tell me that I need to pick up my luggage in Reykjavik in order to continue on back to BWI. In doing so they actually trapped me on the outside part of the airport for 12 hours with disgusting food and no charging ports. So I tried to go to sleep because I'd had none at all (it was about 3am) but people from the airport would come to wake me up because you weren't allowed to sleep during open hours. So I had no sleep no food until like 5am when their dunkin donuts opened and had some nasty donuts. I then waited past the security part of the airport and paid 35$ for a pizza and sushi which where both super disgusting. And flew back off to Washington. I will never ride with them again and I pray all of you have the privelege not to

### "told they don't need my business"
I got a screaming deal with WOW air to Reykavik (under $400) so I pulled the trigger. I was excited to see the blue lagoon and explore the glaciers. Well I got to LAX, went through security, met some fellow Icelandic explorers and handed my passport to the stewardess with childlike excitement only to be promptly denied for having a frayed corner on the cover. The stewardess hands me a 1-800# then turns away ignoring me completely. I call it. No answer. I run to security, show TSA, show a cop, show customs. All are as flabbergasted as I am. The TSA supervisor comes to the desk with me. Conveniently all employees had left but one who completely ignored both of us. I call the customer service number and miraculously get through. They tell me I should read the terms and conditions. No refund for me. I am suppose to drive back to San Diego and get a new passport then come back and try again the following day. Now in the meantime a mother and a young daughter have arrived. They had a trip planned to visit the military dad but had car trouble. And while there was a service agent at the desk and while the plane was still at the gate. The agent impervious to a child's tears continued to ignore the family and walked away talking on her phone.and it gets better. I run downstairs. WOW air has closed up shop. I find their office. They won't come out and talk to me. In fact they have a baggage boy tell me, and I quote "you were told to go home, order a new passport buy another fare and comeback tomorrow". Needless to say I've repeateably called the company only to be told they don't need my business. They should not be allowed to treat people like this.

### "will avoid WOW in the future"
Paris CDG to Miami via Keflavik. At CDG, we (1 adult, 2 teenage sons) were able to check in the evening before, and the ground staff was exceptionally cooperative and friendly. Next morning, a quick check in of baggage, and the journey could begin! The 4hr+ layover in KEF was uneventful, but long - prices there are all very high (as everywhere in Island apparently) flight to KEF uneventful, but no food, drinks offered. Meals to MIami must be booked latest 2 days before departure, only 2 choices, drinks, even water, payable only. Our return from MIA, we were informed 12 hrs prior per SMS that there were problems, due to an accident, a smaller plane and less seats. Our half hour telephone communication with WOW was an Indian call center and no help - just told us to check in earlier. We did, 4 hrs, then at the gate we were informed of further delays, 2 hours. They had chartered a 747 from a Spanish company and combined two flights -  at the Terminal confusion, frustration, limited info and dismay. Departed to KEF and arrived with a 10 minute window For our following flight to CDG, (also others to AMS and London) our baggage obviously didn't make it and was delivered 4 days later. No flight entertainment, was a disappointment, on board staff sometimes arrogant, but ground staff more accommodating. Baggage €200 extra, food (from MIA a free sandwich and a glass of water was offered, for a 6.5hr flight) drinks, all made the cost of 3 tickets no better than regular airlines. We will avoid WOW in the future, it was an experiment, we travel 2/3 times per year cross Atlantic, the airplanes are colourful, the journey not so.

### "swear never to fly WOW again"
Amsterdam to San Francisco via Keflavik. If you are traveling without luggage and willing to pick yourself sandwiches and buy drinks at the airport, then it's as good as any I suppose. The jets are newer and the attendants uniforms are supposed to be some sort of draw. The problem becomes when you need customer service. Absolutely atrocious. Undertrained, understaffed, under the weather possibly. Such a sour, slow bunch ready to nickel and dime you for everything, including water in the plane. The that luggage cost us an additional $150 on the way to Amsterdam, somehow cost us $320 on the flight back. Each leg of a flight incurs a separate baggage fee including carryons. The carry on that fit easily in the measure device for a "free" carry on in SFO and at the counter in Amsterdam Schipol suddenly didn't fit the same carry on when we got to our gate to leave. That was another $70. If you have time and effort willing to research prices, I'm sure you will find better deals (and better service) on competing airlines. I solemnly swear never to fly WOW again.

### "everything went smoothly"
Keflavik to Toronto, everything went smoothly. No delays, no lost luggage, no cancelled flights. Just be aware this is a budget airline and does not include anything with your ticket. No food, no drinks, no in-flight entertainment, no luggage. Everything cost money. So if you think that you will spend less on another airline then go book on another airline. I personally went with my sister and we shared a checked piece and our tickets were way under the other airlines. One downside was that the seats we got were at the very back and they couldn't recline which was annoying especially trying to sleep on the flight. On the way back I had to wait super long for my luggage, but I believe that is Pearson's fault. Pros that it is cheap. Cons: no in-flight entertainment, no free stuff, everything is paid.

### "the worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. I got an email and a sms message a day before the departure from Paris to Toronto that WOW air have to operate with 200 seats aircraft instead 350 seats as originally planned. As a result of this the flight is overbooked and they are looking for volunteers willing to either cancel the flight or change for a later date. Since I have to be in Toronto, I didn't change anything. I went to the airport and denied to board the plane. The fun part is there were not a single representative of the airline to handle this situation, only an airport staff member was giving the airline hotline to call and get a new date! After 40 minutes of waiting I managed to get an operator, and she said the next available flight would be on the 26 April, which is a week later! Since my visa will expire to stay in France from the 21 April, I have request on the 19th April to get me a letter from the airline in order to show the French customs in case of an overstay issue, they have promised me on the 19th April itself that I will get this letter within 48 hours. For now it's 6 days passed and still not a single letter from them.

### "happily fly with Wow Air again"
Myself and my girlfriend paid £250 each for a flight from Berlin to Los Angeles via Keflavik. An unbelievable price and we thought there would be a catch, there wasn't. All the flights were on time, no delays and we boarded planes efficiently. The seats were fine and staff were very pleasant. Take food and drink onto the flight with you to save yourself from buying expensive food and drink on board (like any flight). There was no entertainment, but there was a plug socket and two USB ports too which worked perfectly fine. We both flew with hand luggage and we had the choice whether to have it by our feet or in the overhead storage. We would both happily fly with Wow Air again.

### "the worst customer service"
Baltimore to Bristol via Reykjavik. I arrived in Reykjavik from Baltimore and my connecting flight was not on the departure board. When I went to the desk I was advised the flight had been delayed for 9 hours. No explanation was offered and absolutely no sincerity. After my trip I submitted a claim and 6 months later Wow Air have yet to respond. The claim ticket just shows as open. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced from an airline and I will never travel with them again.

### "terrible experience"
WOW air is the Worst airline, terrible experience. Our flight from Miami to Keflavik was cancelled after a 4 hour delay. No information or explanation was given. Then, after 3 hours in line waiting for any refund or rebook of our flight with no answer, they just tell us "call customer service". We were left alone with no help. We had to rebook our own flights and paid our hotel and food. We have been trying to talk to someone in customer service and the call center never works. No answer after one week. We're still trying to contact them for our refund.

### "worst airline I have ever flown on"
Los Angeles to Berlin via Keflavik. This is hands down the worst airline I have ever flown on, and I travel a lot. They charge for everything , even for water. The staff are brisk to rude. The service at the airport is a mess. The baggage policy (you basically pay for everything) is misleading and abusive. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable. No blankets or pillows are offered on all night flights. No food. Avoid this airline unless you want to feel like you're riding in a crowded city bus, trapped in the air, with no amenities.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
Los Angeles to Dublin via Keflavik. The worst airline I've ever flown. I purchased the ticket because of the stop over in Iceland. I could have flown Los Angeles to Dublin nonstop for the same price on Ethiopian. WOW air is bare bones. No TVs or entertainment, no wifi or electrical plugins for ipads, no leg room, the $17 sandwich and tea could have been prepared by my 4 year old niece. My aisle seat was not available so I had to fly in a middle seat for the 8 hour flight. I"m 6'1" and always get an aisle. No apologies from the staff or attempt to swap seats.

### "Worst airline ever"
Los Angeles to Paris via Keflavik. Worst airline ever. They cancel flights and don't let you know until last minute. They give you terrible seats even when you pay for premium seats. The staff is generally nice but inexperienced and the aircraft is dirty. No food. No entertainment. Horrible airline.

### "staff were rude and evasive"
Baltimore to Paris via Reykjavik with WOW air. We were sent a text 4 hours before our flight departure time that the second leg of our flight was overbooked and asking for volunteers and offering compensation. One hour later we received a text that our flight was cancelled. When we called, we were routed to a call center in India. After waiting 30 minutes on hold and then speaking to two different people, we were told the passengers to Paris were "offloaded" because the Paris leg was overbooked. The staff were rude and evasive. Contrary to EU rules they would not offer us passage on another flight except for 2 seats 2 days later. At the call center they would not confirm whether our entire flight was cancelled, which the text stated, or if just the two of us were "offloaded". By reading the reviews and looking at our experience it is apparent their business model is to seriously overbook and then obstruct communication with any staff to basically leave you with extremely limited options

### "look forward to using them again"
I can't fault my flight from Keflavik to Amsterdam with WOW air. I had some of the best legroom I've had for no additional cost, as it was just a regular seat not an exit row, and was also sat next to my partner for no additional cost. Boarding was quick and we arrived in Amsterdam 35 minutes early! Staff were extremely friendly and I look forward to using them again!

### "multiple staff was rude"
Keflavik to Boston. One customer service staff rude. We brought a carry on one received a purple ticket on flight over. Customer service staff ripped it off on way back without warning. When the bag clearly fit the dimensions she claimed the wheel was sticking out too much and they charged 3x the price to check in the bag. My girlfriend and I separately booked our flights. They would not move us together at check in (the only reason we even needed to get in line when they removed the bag tag.) Overall I would not write a review for this but multiple staff was rude and had negative tone. More training on customer service needed in Iceland. Experience was good in United States.

### "seat wouldn't recline"
Edinburgh to Miami via Keflavik. Attendant refused me water with a breastfeeding child. Pizza was awful, seat wouldn't recline. Booking did not mention baggage fees, and didn't have any option to add baggage during purchase. Then after paying £50 to add my bag, WOW air lost my bag. 10 days now and they still haven't found it! This was their first Miami flight, and owner and friends were partying loudly on plane. Lights were only dimmed at 1am Iceland time, whole plane was very restless since it was difficult to sleep with lights on full, and many sleepless children were crying. Also no inflight entertainment, not even shared overhead screens. I've taken many cheaper flights with AirBerlin and Norwegian, and had full amenities + fee disclosures.

### WOW air customer review
Paris CDG to Los Angeles via Keflavik. After 4 hours of waiting WOW cancelled our flight due to "technical difficulties" they sent us all to a hotel for one night and told us to call there 1-800 number to rebook. They would not issue an immediate refun. We were told they would pay hotel until they could arrange a new flight. Upon arrival the hotel stated that was not true it was for one night. No one would answer their 1-800 number to reschedule. When they finally answered they said there was no flight for one week. Pretty much everyone had to get a new flight on another airline at there own cost. From what I see online WOW isn't refunding costs when they cancelled flights. Passengers also already paid a hefty baggage fee which should be refunded immediately. They left a plane full of people stranded and the few staff that were there were rude and unhelpful. They said they couldn't do a thing and gave us all a phone number to call.

### "a sad experience"
Reykjavik to Amsterdam with WOW air. I was denied boarding on WW442 flight at 0605 because the plane was to small to fit all passengers. I had to take another flight (WW444) which was sheduled at 1200 which was also delayed. Eventually I boarded the at 1900, so I waited more than 13h at the airport and only got 4 vouchers of 1500ISK which doesn't get you a lot of food. It was a sad experience to say the least. Despite being told WOW air would follow up, it has been 6-months and I haven't heard anything.

### "best transatlantic flight"
Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik. A great flight with an outstanding crew. This has been my best transatlantic flight. Shout out to the entire crew. Made the 9 hour flight seem like 30 minutes.

### "is the worst airline"
WOW air is the worst airline. Flight in 2016 from Dublin to Boston was delayed and they did not hold the connecting flight in Keflavik. They offered to house me with no guarantee of whether I would get out the next day or ever. I rebooked on another airline and since have tried to get a refund from Wow Air. They have not responded to my claim on their website and multiple calls to Customer Service have promised someone would contact me but that never happens. I asked to speak to a Customer Service Supervisor on my last call and was refused, and staff instead told me he would place me on hold and no one would ever pick it up.

### "ridiculous to charge extra for this row"
WOW has cheap flights to/from Reykjavik and the USA but you pay for everything additionally, including luggage (both carry-on and check-in), a seat assignment, food and drinks (including soda and coffee) and even water. Our flight was on time and the staff at every step of the way were extremely polite and positive. My big complaint is that I paid USD $60.99 extra for an "XXL Extra Legroom Seat". When I got on the plane, the bulkhead on the seat I was in was so close that we couldn't even stretch our legs out. Other bulkhead rows had up to 6 feet in front of them but there had been no indication when I booked that the row I chose didn't have even as much legroom as a regular seat. It was ridiculous to charge extra for this row!

### "a good experience overall"
San Francisco to Reykjavik. I don't understand why people get upset with WOW air, it's a budget airline what do you expect? I had a good experience overall. When my brother and I checked in we had window seats and we were changed last minute to the middle aisle because the seats were supposedly broken but turns out their was a couple sitting there in our original seats, ramp agent could of been more honest with us. She did remdeemed herself by giving us both seats between my brother and I to ourselves giving us more space and she also put is in the front section of the plane with more leg room I was able to lay across 3 seats and take a nap. Overall, the inflight service was great the flight attendants are dedicated to their job. It's been a while since I enjoyed a flight, and never came across a flight were all crew members are polite and happy to assist passengers. WOW does charge for everything but if you take the time to go online everything is disclosed. They allow food purchased from the airport onboard. if you opt for their inflight food, they are vegetarian friendly and label nutrition facts on their meals which surprisingly are better quality than other Airlines I've flown. I will be returning to Iceland in the near future and I will fly with WOW again, the planes captain made this flight very smooth, hardly any turbulence during the flight both directions. On the way to Iceland he even made an announcement that the Northern lights were visible. Great experience.

### "poor customer service"
Dublin to Keflavik. Shocked at the lack of check-in facilities for this airline. App did not function properly and there were no kiosks for printing tickets so I had to queue at the desk for over an hour just to get my boarding pass. Staff are obviously not up to speed with visa procedures for entry to countries which held up the check-in process even more. Overall my impression of the staff was that they are badly trained. The flights are extremely uncomfortable but this was to be expected considering the low price. Despite the low prices, I would not fly with WOW air again due to poor customer service and lack of facilities.

### "we were really impressed"
Our trip from Toronto to Copenhagen required connections in Keflavik. Well, we had a great flight, both directions, even with the connections. The only issue was having to de-ice the wings on the Toronto-Keflavik segment, which of course was not the airline's fault. We were really impressed with how well the boarding process went, and the professionalism of the Wow air staff. Note the snacks / beverages are not free on-board, and there is no entertainment, but we were prepared for that and it wasn't a problem. For the price we paid, it was definitely a great experience.

### "cheap way of scoring some extra money"
Awful check in. They measure all bags before checking in. I brought my bag, which is small (meaning 42 cm and under in length, for instance). As there are some wheels on the bag which sticks out maybe 1,5 cm, the bag was chargable for 85 CAD as large cabin bagage. Nearly all small cabin luggage are with wheels nowadays, so its a cheap way of scoring some extra money from the customer. I think this is a very low standard and waiting now for boarding, I really regret booking this airline. If you can, STAY AWAY from this airline: - you will be charged (big time) for any luggage. If in doubt, the customer will not have the last word. - when charged for extra luggage, they do not accept local debit cards (in this case in Canada). They dont even try to make this process smooth, when you just got screwed over with add on fees. - no food on plane, if you have a sandwich, they charge you asap. -Keflavik (Iceland) airport is very small and inconvenient. There are very few options for food or general shopping, the options that exist are more expensive than elsewhere. No in-flight entertainment at all. Planes are all newly painted. Its like lipstick on an old car, beware. I can only wish for this airline, that they will share the same fate as Icelandic banks - the sooner, the better.

### "Absolutely disgusting service"
Edinburgh to Toronto via Keflavik. Every member of Wow Air staff I encountered from start to finish was rude and unhelpful, even before my issues begun. Wow air left my bag in Iceland (where I connected from Edinburgh) then casually told me they'd deliver it to Toronto later in the week- by which point I'd be in Whistler. No apology offered, no compensation and customer service team didn't care at all that I was without warm clothes for 6 days in -10 degree weather. After days of phone calls and emails being passed from pillar to post I was advised they would send my case to Vancouver via WestJet then deliver it to me in Whistler. Next day I was told actually they won't and I'd need to travel to Vancouver airport and pay to pick it up. After this they ignored all of my emails and I still haven't had a response. Absolutely disgusting service.

### "it was a catastrophe"
❎ Unverified |  Los Angeles to Paris via Keflavik. Me and my sister booked a trip to Europe in September 2016 for March 7th through the 13th of 2017. I would call once a month to make sure the flight was still on time and nothing had changed. And every month everything was ok and still the same. The reason I would check so often is because I read the reviews and they said that WOW air flights were being cancelled without proper notice. Since they would assure me every time I called , that everything was ok, I proceeded to book my tours and hotel room in December. I booked a hotel stay and 5 tours around paris France. The time approached quickly for our departure and the day before our flight we received a message that our flight had been cancelled. We were suppose to board on the 7th march at 10:03am and WOW air sent us a cancellation message March 6th at 11pm. They gave us 2 choices. We could receive a full refund but it would take 5 to 7 business days or we could get on the next flight that was available and that was for march 11th. I was devastated. That would mean we would miss all the tours and would only have two days in the hotel we paid 6days for. There was no other accommodation on their end. So I had to book through another airline and spend money on two extra tickets in order to get to the room On time. And also make it for the tours. I will never book with WOW air again. They were unprofessional, with minimal customer service and cost me so much extra money with care about the perdicament they put me and my sister in. It was obvious that they did not care about us. I ended up getting my money back at the end of my trip so wow airlines ruined my whole trip it was a catastrophe. I hope that they shut them down. Please read the reviews. They are all real and true.

### "a nasty customer culture"
We traveled early morning having to get up at 2.30pm. I am 6ft 5' and it was an expensive trip to Iceland, so was beyond budget paying for extra legroom seats. When I saw 2 extra leg room seats together not being used, normally if you ask nicely to sit in them there is never a problem - except for Wow Air. I was curtly told that if I wanted to make use of the seats I would have to pay the emergency leg room supplement. When I pointed out the seats were empty anyway and so not costing them anything or depriving them of additional income, the air hostess replied 'It wouldn't be fair to the passengers who had already paid extra in the other seats. I said it was hardly fair having me cramped and squashed in my seat when there was the simple humane thing of letting me sit one row in front in the empty extra leg room chairs. I also pointed out that people paying for extra leg room were paying for the guarantee, the certainty of having these seats, and not paying to deny others. After my legs were knocked 3 time by the trolley doing its rounds and waking me up 3 times one of the air hostesses revealed some humanity, and invited me to sit on one of the empty extra leg room seats for the remainder of the flight. The episode clearly reveals a truth about Wow Air: it puts exploitation of every commercial opportunity before customer service. A nasty customer culture.

### "Worst airline I've ever flown"
Frankfurt to Los Angeles via Keflavik. Worst airline I've ever flown. The offered flights are not cheaper than those of other airlines as WOW air makes you pay for food, luggage, etc. extra. Both flights I were delayed. We had to wait in the waiting area forever just to be driven to the plane where we had to wait again in the cold. Only half of the already little food options was actually available. The only vegetarian option they had was a cup of quinoa that turned out as a major fail. However, the airline was nice enough to spare my from this on my return flight as it got cancelled just hours before due to technical issues. But don't even try to reach the hotline. If you want to do yourself a favor fly with a grown up airline that knows what it's doing.

### "Just avoid WOW air"
Baltimore-Washington to Bristol via Keflavik. WOW air isn't really cheap. When you add in the "extras" - paying for a seat choice (mandatory), luggage, it only saved my family about 10% compared to regular airlines with a direct flight. Food in the plane and Keflavik airport is awful and ridiculously expensive. We arrived in Iceland to find our connecting flight had been cancelled, and we had a 9 hour wait in the airport. With 2 exhausted small kids at 4am local time, we had to find ourselves a hotel for the 9 hours. The customer service desk said WOW air could not put us up in a hotel, but would refund us if we submitted a claim. We submitted the claim, but 3 months later haven't heard anything back. After reading a few reviews, it seems WOW air just ignores online claims. When we finally got on our connecting flight, we found it was a charter aircraft because Wow's own plane had broken down. It was even worse than the Wow planes we flew on - less legroom, really tatty and old, and 2 of the toilets were out of use. Just terrible. Do yourself a favor, and book with a regular airline, for trans-Atlantic at least. After you spend on choosing a Wow seat, luggage, plane/airport food, you don't end up saving anything and have all the inconvenience of traveling with a budget airline. The airport in Iceland was the worst for facilities and prices I've used. Just avoid WOW air.

### "was a very bad experience"
Gatwick to Reykjavik. Yesterday travelling with WOW air with a backpack of 30 litres which usually fit as hand luggage, this time the lady on the desk made me pay 74GBP for my luggage, being rude to me and saying that if I ask again, why I have been charged, I won't travel. She send me to put my backpack on the sizer, which I did. Then it stuck with one of the straps, I just went put it in again because obviously this is not a hard case and it doesn't fit in the same way in the sizer, but she told me that should fit without pushing, obviously I wasn't pushing, but she didn't want to listen and said that I had to pay for my backpack. I'm very dissapointed with this company, and this is the first time that happen to me. I don't think I will fly with this company again, it was a very bad experience.

### "worst flight I was ever on"
The cabin was so hot, it felt like 82°F. I asked if there was a way to cool down the cabin, they FA said no and they didn't know why it was hot in the cabin. They were charging almost $5 for a small water without refills. I refused to buy one and slowly sipped my water from Amsterdam airport. Coming back was the same  from Amsterdam to Los Angeles via Keflavik. This was the second trans Atlantic vacation I have ever made and the worst flight I was ever on. Cheap but I would never fly with them again.

### "inconvenience so drastically"
I was scheduled to be on WOW Air flight from Montreal to Reykjavik on Feb 26th. I took the train in from Ottawa, and arrived pretty early in Montreal. I received an update at 3pm, indicating that my departure was delayed and the gate had changed. Annoying, but better than what ended up happening. Close to my new departure time (8:20pm) I make my way to the gate desk, because they say that there is an announcement for those with connections to Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Initially thought it was going to be info on my new connection - it was a message telling me that due to poor weather my flight to Amsterdam was a no go. The weather wasn't affecting the Montreal to Reykjavik part, but the Reykjavik to Amsterdam part. Furthermore, apparently there were no hotels available in Reykjavik, so I was not getting on the flight. After close to 1.5 hours on hold, I get a customer service rep. I can either cancel booking or reschedule. Next available flight is 1 March, making a week long vacation that much shorter and probably not worth the amount of air travel. So I cancel. But because I cancel and not reschedule.. they airline isn't obligated to put me in a hotel. They cancel on me, and I'm on the hook? After some discussion, they were able to make an exception for me and I got a hotel room. And I stress exception.. they repeated it a lot. If they cancel on me with little to no notice, why would it be on me?! They also attempted to blame me for not going to the ticket counter upon arrival to the airport. They said starting around 4pm, they were letting guests know that their flights were cancelled. So it's my fault I arrived there early!? Why weren't announcements made? Why wasn't a text sent to me, like the flight delay was? I even messaged on twitter, clearly indicating I was on the Amsterdam flight. I received a response but nothing indicating a complete cancellation. Somewhat annoyed and unable to sleep. I decided to check out the Reykjavik departure website. Guess what? My flight to Amsterdam not only wasn't cancelled,  it took off. Also, there is a flight from Reykjavik to Amsterdam in the morning of 28 Feb. Could be full, but why wasn't there effort made for me to make that? I understand flights get cancelled, I'm not the first person it's happened too. But the behaviour of the airline is unfair at best, and sketchy in my opinion. Why was my flight really cancelled? Was it overbooked and one way of dealing with it is just cancelling certain connections? Why wasn't I allowed to go to Reykjavik and explore other options there? Why didn't they inform me of the changes as soon as they were known? Why is there no responsibility for the airline to take care of those they inconvenience so drastically? Why didn't they try to help me get a flight with another organization? Where is the accountability? Yes, they refunded my flight (hopefully, actually hasn't taken affect yet), but I am out several hundred dollars on non-refundable items I purchased.

### "Thank you for everything"
Keflavik to Newark. I was confronted with weather conditions in UK. My flight was delayed and I missed my connection to Montreal. WOW air booked me on another flight to my final destination the next day. They also booked me a hotel near the Keflavik airport. I appreciated the way they treated us. You shouldn't afraid to book a flight with them. Thank you for everything.

### "uncomfortable and unpleasant"
Newark to Reykjavik return. That was a "Wow" experience but not in a good way! If you travel with your family or friends, you will be separated in completely different parts of the plane unless you pay extra for every seat selection, in my case I was travelling with yang children it was very stressful we all got seats in three different sections of the airplane. For every checked in luggage is a charge $68 per bag at check in or $51 online, you pay for everything while flying, they don't even give you a cup of water for free, payment with credit card only and not all cards are working. The airplane is very small, no leg space at all, no TVs, no monitors. They kept lights on for almost a whole entire flight trying to sell duty free items, very uncomfortable and unpleasant flight.

### "biggest nightmare of my life"
Reykjavik to Newark. This airline was the biggest nightmare of my life. We were traveling home from Iceland and on the way to the airport when our flight was cancelled. The customer service was nonexistent at best. We waited in line for hours to be told we had to call a telephone number that was busy for hours. We were appalled they couldn't do anything for us at the desk. We found out that they'd never dealt with a cancelled flight before and clearly had no protocol. They were unhelpful, did not try to reschedule on any other flights, and basically only gave the option to take a flight a few days later. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no assistance or reassurance. We were forced to take another airline for four times the cost, and were only offered an apology and one way refund. This airline is clearly no frills - you have to pay extra for everything and it really shows that you're not on a quality airline. I would not recommend!

### "worthless airline .. an awful experience"
Keflavik to Newark. My flight got cancelled and WOW air did everything possible to avoid helping me rebook. You should know that the only way to rebook a cancelled flight is through a toll free number. However, when you call the number it seems that the customer service center takes the phone off the hook. I called 30+ times and continued to get the busy signal. When I asked the attendant at the ticket counter, she just kept repeating the "no, call the phone number. Me: can I rebook on another flight? Agent "no, call the phone number. Me: can I fly to another airport? Agent: "no, call the phone number. Me: why did I wait in this huge line if you can't do anything? Agent: "no, call the phone number. And now get out he way so I can tell the person in line behind you the same thing. Worthless airline. Worst part of all, I will never visit Iceland again all because of WOW air. They make Iceland an awful experience.

### "was very pleasantly surprised"
Gatwick to Los Angeles via Keflavik. Check in at LGW was fast, friendly and no strict enforcement of hand baggage. Flight on time and 75% full so plenty of space. Transit smooth at KEF. Boarded on time for LAX and a nice if quite boring flight. But Captain alerted everyone of the spectacular Greenland views which was special. Arrived ahead of time. Return was even better as Captain announced the Northern Lights which was truly awesome and window seated pax shared time for a view. Food could be better but ham and cheese baggette tasty and Islandic Gull beer good value if you buy the two set. Staff pleasant at all times. Given I paid only £313 for the return, I was very pleasantly surprised. Will travel WOW again if the price dictates so. Baggage checks on size were being enforced at LAX on return although some flexibility given. LAX check in staff were fantastic and wished everyone a pleasant trip home.

### "wouldn't recommend WOW Air"
Newark to Reykjavik. I wouldn't recommend WOW Air after our experience. This is not my primary reason, but the rates are initially low, but they charge for everything. Even carry on sizes are smaller than what is typically accepted as standard, so if you don't do your home work on what's they're acceptable size is you could end up spending an extra $70 to check it. Pack all of your own snacks, and buy all your beverages at the gate, because you will get nothing complimentary during the flight. We missed out flight coming home, and they were less than helpful to get us get home again. When we realized what had happen, they didn't have a ticketing station there or any personnel to help us figure out how we were going to get home. They wouldn't even let us use a phone to call WOW Air customer service, expecially seeing we were visitors from another country, and our phones didn't work there. Not only did that, but they make us both buy new one way tickets home home, and charged us over what we initially paid for the round trip ticket. I've flown quite a lot in my life, and accidentally missed a flight or two, and no airline has ever made me or anyone I know do this. I even asked if we could be charged a convenience fee or something, but we were forced to buy an all new ticket. They're business model is aim low on pricing then squeeze everything else to make up for it, customer service doesn't seem to be of value to this company.

### "don't book with WOW air"
London Gatwick to Newark via Keflavik. Word to the wise, don't book with WOW air. Flight was delayed resulting in a cancelled connection despite the fact that we arrived in time to make it, and assurances the plane would wait for us. No input from us as customers, no information regarding our options, no willingness to accommodate us beyond their original plan to reroute us and send us home the following day, and no sympathy or compassion from the customer service team who seemed primarily concerned with getting rid of angry customers in the quickest way possible. Apparently this happens a lot, as their are laws in the EU to provide compensation for delays of more than three hours, but WOW air, according to their website, takes 8-10 weeks to process a claim and 4 weeks to even respond to one. Do yourself a favor, book with another company. The only bright side is this happened at the end of our vacation. I feel bad for the travelers losing time at the start of their holiday because this company doesn't care about their happiness.

### "for the price I would take again"
Los Angeles to Gatwick via Keflavik. I read many of these reviews prior to getting on board WOW air, and was a little stressed about what I might be getting into. I told myself that I'd write my own review after. The key is that you know what you are getting into prior to buying. This is a low cost airline if you follow the system. My trip stayed cheap, because I was able to just take a single carry on: one 32 L backpack which was approved as my free personal item for the cabin. They tag the bag as "cabin approved"; once you have that ticket, don't remove it! Keep it for the rest of the journey (and for the return) and travel worry-free. I found that the agents were pretty lenient with the bag policy. I had a meal and drink on the plane for both journeys. This ran me $30 USD total. The food was good, not amazing. There is no in-seat entertainment. Buy a book. Listen to music on your phone. Download some movies and take 'em on your iPad. There is a seat fee, I did not pay, and they gave me a window seat for all parts of the journey. The Airbus A330s we flew were new and leg room was excellent. The seats were firm, but I found them comfortable enough to sleep/doze. All flights left and landed on time. If you are worried about delayed flights, then I recommend some good travel insurance. But in this case, everything went very well. The staff was friendly and courteous. Overall, for the price of $400 USD to London return, I would take again, and recommend for anyone looking for a bargain.

### "do not fly with WOW air"
Please, set your expectations very low. My flight to SFO via KEF was delayed 1 day + another day, 2 days total. I refused to arrive with 48 hours delay in SFO after waiting 8 hours in Gatwick, but I had even issues in leaving the airport, as WOW air personnel was insisting with me to take a hotel, sleep in Gatwick, then take a flight to Reykjavik, sleep again in Reykjavik, and arrive 2 days later. Now, 24 hours later (and already in San Francisco having flown here with British Airways), the customer support doesn't answer my calls and e-mails asking for a full refund. Please do not fly with WOW air.

### "set your expectations low"
Reykjavik to Los Angeles. The only "wow" about this airline is how it seems to avoid just about everything that might be enjoyable about flying. It's supposedly a budget airline and you'll definitely be treated to a budget experience. For US readers you might want to be aware that Spirit Airlines (yes, that loved airline of quality) is represented in the corporate board of Wow Air. It will prepare you well for what to expect. So maybe the "wow" is meant to represent "wow" that actually wasn't as horrible as I expected. Like others have mentioned there are frequent delays. Of several hours. I can confirm that. Actually the staff is lovely and the best part about this airline. They even gave us free coffee and tea since we had a severe delay. In terms of price vs. value this is not really a rock bottom budget airline. Unless you travel with no luggage and tiny hand luggage. For most, it's no more than average and I'd pick a competitor over wow any day. The plane interior isn't awful, but there won't be any free food, the stuff they sell is expensive and I'm giving them an average rating on the quality of what's on offer. There's no wifi and definitely it's bring your own entertainment. On the plus side there's an electrical plug in the A330 so hopefully whoever you are seated next to, won't hog it the whole flight. And the seat can still lean back and legroom is not bad. When embarking in Iceland you will have to go up steps to the plane and in LAX they park as far away from the actual terminal as possible. So another climb out and into a bus. It's fine as long as you are healthy and frisky. So set your expectations low and you'll be able to feel the wow.

### "be ready for flight delays"
Paris to Toronto via Reykjavik. Okay the price was right, the planes are new and flight attendants were gracious. But be ready for flight delays - up to 6 hours in our worst case. The lost baggage customer service at WOW is totally ineffective! Our bags were lost for 13 days. The friendly-enough baggage customer service people basically just said what we wanted to hear but no real idea where the bags actually were - we were being lied to. 13 days of multiple phone calls waiting from 40 min to 2 hours to get through to customer service. First the bags were found still in Toronto, then Iceland, then Paris then being still held up in Toronto Customs? There is no reason or desire for Customs to hold outbound bags as confirmed by a phone call to Customs. Throughout the whole time we were told our bags would be delivered to our home, so after an additional 3 days of our bags at the Paris airport the bags were delivered only as far as the Brussels airport when we were told to go pick them up - a €30 train ride away. Upon pick-up it was a last straw that one of the main handles was completely ripped off the bag - grossly mishandled to be in this condition in WOW air's care. Putting in a claim they very quickly came back with a response and a lecture about it being only minor damage and wouldn't affect the usage of the bag? What? You mean the main handle you use to put it in the trunk of your car, up/down stairs at airports, onto trains etc. The fact that it was unsafe to use because of the shards was totally lost on them. It wasn't the retractable handle, or a wheel, or a heavy bag that they used as justification to deny the claim. They completely ignored the fact that I had a real out-of-pocket expense for the train ticket. Continued correspondence with them is just completely ignored except for an immediate auto response that the email was 'noted'. Even the auto responses are irregular; they simply ignore. We're out a suitcase and train ticket money. With WOW you're on your own if they lose and damage your bag.

### "follow the rules, you will be fine"
Baltimore Washington to Keflavik return. If you follow the baggage rules, you will be fine. Yes, you have to pay for everything (including water $3 a bottle) but the airline tells you up front. I paid for a large carry one each way ($80 rt) and had no issues. Both flights were seamless with minimal delays (10 minutes each way). And the seats were satisfactory. I paid $525 for two round trip tickets to Iceland including baggage. You won't find anything less expensive. The pilots and cabin crews were great, and I had no issues with the gate agents either. It's a low cost carrier that will get you from A to B with no frills. With that being said, understand that all of their flights go through KEF. It would be smart to check statistics on your incoming and connections flight if Iceland isn't your final destination.

### "a really good experience"
Paris to Reykjavik. Had a really good experience with WOW Air, this was our first time flying with this airline. The seats were spacious and had a lot of legroom. The only downside was that my boyfriend and I could not sit together, but the check-in lady did her best for us and we didn't sit too far, it was fine. All the food and drink on board costs but the flight was short enough that it wasn't an issue and we didn't go hungry. Slightly confusing as they had us boarding through two different gates, but overall it was an enjoyable flight!

### "an abysmal experience"
Baltimore to Paris via Keflavik. Where to begin? This was an abysmal experience. At first glance, WOW air seems ideal because of the low prices, but don't be fooled. They charge you for everything possible, and eventually you wish you had just flown the more expensive airline without all these fees, that just add up to be the same cost as any other airline. The baggage fees are ridiculous, and one kilo overweight costs USD20 in addition to the lofty fee you're already paying to check a bag. This was a transatlantic flight, so I was less than excited to see the zero leg room and the lack of televisions anywhere on this 6 hour flight. The man across the aisle from me had his knees in the aisle because the leg space was so obscenely small. Despite the flight being so long, there were no free snacks provided. Even a glass of water was beyond expensive. I had a connecting flight in Iceland, and because the first flight was delayed, they lost my bag in the transition. I got to Paris and filled out a lost baggage form and was told it would be mailed to me in 24-48 hours. I did not receive my bag for 6 days. That is an absurd amount of time to be in another country with only a toothbrush to your name. I expected a refund for paying such a high baggage price with the expectation of the bag arriving when I did. I requested a refund and got a meaningless email saying they were only responsible to reimburse me only for "essentials" that I had to buy since I didn't have my bag. Completely obnoxious, so they're getting this review in response. Only positive part of the whole experience was that all the flight attendants were very nice. Never flying WOW air again. Not worth the deceptively cheap price.

### "fares are great provided you follow the rules"
Edinburgh to Toronto via Keflavik. Was hesitant to fly WOW air after I booked a one-way, low-cost fare. I paid for the checked-in bag, around $90 CAD since I needed more luggage. Check-in was easy, and I (unlike many reviewers) ensured that I was under the 20kg max. I weighed in at 19.4kg. I didn't prebook a seat but staff easily accommodated my request for aisle seats on both sectors. In terms of carry-on, I had under the 10kg however, I think it depends on the ground staff in terms of what they allow and under what conditions. The Edinburgh staff were extremely easy-going and one passenger even had a guitar and case (which he didn't pay for) and the staff at the gate warned him next time but allowed him since it wasn't full. Both flights were on-time, staff onboard were nice without being overly gracious, aircraft was clean, and the transit was uneventful and landed in Toronto on time. Fares are great on this airline, provided you follow the rules and prepare in advance. Weigh your bags before, bring lots of snacks (Keflavik is expensive and few options) and a book or iPad (No IFE), and get insurance (just in case the flight is delayed). Overall, I would recommend them and fly again.

### "awesome until they have a delay or issue"
Reykjavik to San Francisco. WOW air is awesome until they have a delay, or flight issue, which apparently happens often. We flew with them a few times previously. Everything was all well and good, until our flight back to the US from Reykjavik. Not only was the flight several hours late, which caused many of us to miss our connecting flights, but WOW did nothing to assist those of us stuck at the airport. No vouchers, no offers for hotel, nothing. The staff had attitudes when we went to talk to them. They hung up the phone on people. They also messed up our luggage. I know that these things can happen. However, every single other airline I have flown with that had a large delay, has assisted with making a situation that we didn't cause, an easier one. It was a nightmare: we were stuck in San Francisco for 2 days, and ended up flying back home on Southwest (all on our own dime). The customer service reps kept saying that the managers were gone for the day and they couldn't give us flight vouchers because they needed approval. They also refused to give us their names. What airline do you know has management that does not come to the office for 2 days straight, especially one of those days being a business day? We noticed that we kept getting the same customer service representative when we called. When we asked was she the same person, she lied and then gave us the same no managers around speech. So we called corporate, who were actually nice and helpful. They suggested we file a claim. We did that back in June, do you think we have been reimbursed for anything since then? I have also read other reviews, and I see a lot of other people saying the same thing.

### WOW air customer review
Montreal to Berlin via Keflavik. I've flown Wow Air twice now. My first trip in Oct to Iceland overall was quite good. The check-in agent in Montreal was not friendly but overall, my husband and I were satisfied with the service. As I am getting older, I'm finding overnight flights harder to deal with even when purchasing a seat with extra leg room. The arms do not lift up in the first row seating. Keflavik airport is open and busy 24/7 and you can buy duty free on arrival or in transit - a nice surprise. No issues on our return flight. We were impressed by Wow Air model of having lots of flight choices/prices to and from N America to Europe. Agree with other passengers to be aware that while initial fare is low, everything costs extra and food/beverages are expensive on the flight - so highly recommend to buy/bring your own food and drinks, even from the airport is cheaper. Because of our acceptable experience on our first flight, we chose Wow Air for our flight from Montreal to Berlin for Xmas. We got the same unfriendly check-in staff, even though I had contacted Wow Air to change my carry on bag to checked in and had receipt in hand, the manager had to assist where the check-in staff person wasn't inclined to believe I had prepaid and wanted to charge a lot more. Be aware that its definitely better to prepay for luggage than incur significantly extra charges at check-in or at the gate if the staff deem your bag too big or too many bags than allowance. Our flight out of Montreal was delayed. We were impressed we got texts about the delays. Unfortunately, our connecting flight in Keflavik was also delayed and further delayed - for other delayed flights to ensure those passengers got onto connecting flights. Wow Air could have and should have given people a free drink or snack to make up for it. Small gestures go a long way. We landed in Berlin 4 hours late and our car rental company considered us a "no show" and cancelled our reservation. Already suggested to Wow Air and Enterprise Rent-A-Car that Wow Air be added to Enterprise Rent-A-Car website pull down menu so that the Enterprise knows your flight is delayed. We were pretty exhausted and not in the best of spirits after 25 hours of travel. On our way home, Berlin SXF airport is not the easiest to navigate or find Wow Air (Terminal A) and our flight was delayed - without any explanation. People appreciate knowing "why" - even if there is nothing that can be done. We had to hustle in Keflavik to make our connecting flight to Montreal - which meant we couldn't buy food or drink at the airport as intended. Also learned buy enough food and drink for both flights! Since we were starving and thirsty, we decided to cave in and pay approx. $50 for sandwich, slice of pizza, coffee, soda pop, water, small Pringles. When we arrived in Montreal, we waited between ~45 mins at the carousel until we realized that our luggage hadn't made it. Only then, did we know that all the people from Berlin's flight had not gotten their bags. We spent another 2+ hours waiting in line to get the right form, then go to customs with the form, go back to the same line to drop off form. Luggage arrived in Iqaluit three days later. Making a claim for incurred expenses due to delayed bags but had to figure out how myself - seems Wow doesn't provide info or facilitate reimbursement or provide a stated allowance.

### "Worst flight experience"
Los Angeles to Keflavik. Worst flight experience ever. Took over 1.5 hours to get checked in and was told that the flight is closed but I might be able to get on. No help with expediting through security. There were appx 40-50 other passengers in the same situation. Made it to the gate which was a shuttle by bus to the plane. Sat on the bus another 20 minutes before it took off. Flight was delayed anyways and on arrival there was a lot of passsengers that didn't get their luggage. Furthermore, we were told that they don't scan the luggage and therefore have no idea where it is but might show up on the next flight which is 2 days later but not guaranteed. Have all my meds for heart problems in check in which is my fault, should have never done it but the staff was terrible to work with regarding the situation. I am in Iceland in January with no sweaters, jacket or other cold weather clothing and more importantly my medication. Never ever again on WOW.

### "question standards of the airline"
Bristol to Boston return via Reykjavik. I booked with WOW air expecting a very basic service which was originally proven with a £50 charge for a main bag each way, although overall this was still cheaper than competitors. The real issues began when I got to Bristol airport at 9:00 for my 10:45 flight, being told around 10:00 that there was a delay and that more information would be provided at 11:00. When 11:00 came we were told that the flight would be delayed until 23:00 that evening. Not being best pleased, I contacted their customer service in India to rearrange another flight as I needed to be in Boston that evening, although I was told I would need to speak to the claims department who conveniently didn't have a phone number and only operated by email. As I was only being given prewritten answers by the phone operator I asked to speak to a supervisor which never answered (in total I was on hold for 3.5 hours throughout the day). On a later phone call I was told the delay was for weather reasons which obviously wasn't true, only being told when I boarded the flight after delays to 23:55, 00:20 (and not taking off until 01:45 because a printer wasn't working), that there was a family emergency for a member of the crew and someone else had to be flown in from Iceland, but due to regulations on shift times, all staff members had to take a long break. Upon arrival in Iceland at around 5:00, I was forced to wait for another 40 minutes before any representatives from wow air turned up to tell us to get on a coach before we were shipped off to a hostel, at which point we were told by the hostel staff that we had to be out the rooms by 11, and a bus should be coming later that day but they knew just as much as we did because wow air hadn't told them anything either. After 4 hours of sleep I was up at 11, to be told the bus would leave at 12 and my flight to Boston would be at 3pm. Eventually the bus didn't turn up until 2 and my flight was delayed until 6, so I didn't arrive in Boston for a full 30 hours after I should've been there, as a result missing a family event that I was supposed to be for that day. I strongly considered cancelling the return flight in and flying with a different airline in order to avoid ever having to deal with WOW air again although eventually decided that surely it couldn't get any worse. In fairness I wasn't delayed 30 hours this time, only 2 hours on each flight, but when that seems like a positive result one really must question the standards of the airline. Any advice to people considering travelling with WOW air would be 1) don't, and 2) if you really have to, leave yourself a few days either side and be prepared to be treated like an animal in transit for the duration of your journey, however many days that is. Obviously I've had a very bad experience which most probably won't, but all four of my flights with wow air have been delayed which says it all really. One last thing, if you decide to travel with them and have to claim compensation, claims aren't processed for 'between 8-10 weeks'.

### "beware, buy cheap pay twice"
Edinburgh to Toronto via Keflavik, return to Paris CDG via Keflavik. The sector from Keflavik to Paris CDG was the last out of 4 sectors flown this past holiday season and all 4 sectors were delayed anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. My observation is there is lack of organization on the ground which delays the flights, and winter weather in Iceland not ideal for any flight with less than 3 hour connection. We sat on the runway in hold to get to a gate for 2 hours until the wind settled down. We were forced to use steps in a blizzard to get off the plane to a waiting bus. I saw many people almost fall due to strong winds. On the return sector YYZ-KEF, they announced that any traveller without a purple or yellow tag on their hand luggage should line up beside the departure gate. Half the gate hold room lined up and WOW staff proceeded to put bags into a sizer and collect money for those that were too big. This slowed down boarding for everyone else. The plane eventually left over an hour behind schedule. Due to favorable winds, we were to land in KEF at 0500 am with time to make our connection to CDG at 0600. We made it, but our bags did not. There were over 50 passengers from YYZ and YUL on the same connecting flight. We all stood like dummies in Paris waiting for our bags at the belt. After the last bag came off - no one from WOW air was there to guide us to a the service desk. eventually we found the ground handler and proceeded to line up to file a lost bag report. If they knew our bags had not made the flight, why could they not have had someone waiting in CDG to announce this to all the travellers affected? We were connecting to Singapore the next day at 11am. Unfortunately, the bags would not come in until 1030 am the next day and not in time to collect and transfer to our next flight. We ended up having to pay for an extra night in Paris and change our Singapore flight by 24 hours. Very inconvenient all around. Plus had to buy basic essentials and meals. WOW has low fares. Beware, buy cheap pay twice. Any savings are depleted when delays occur. I will not use WOW again.

### "airline is utter garbage"
Amsterdam to Toronto return via Keflavik. As most people here that have left reviews on this site, my conclusion is just spend the extra money on a company that actually knows what it's doing. Every single flight during my last trip (4 flights total) were delayed for at least 1.5h each. The first one for more than 4 hours. After a quick look at Toronto airport's historic data for flights offered by WOW Air (between Toronto and Keflavik) I found that not a single flight had left on time during the last 2/3 weeks. It's actually funny to hear the captain repeat the exact same thing during every flight: "I hope the delay did not cause any big inconvenience. I'm pretty sure it's an integral part of the script. To top it all off, I paid for an XXL seat on my way back and none were available when I finally boarded the plane. This airline is utter garbage. The only redeeming quality is that the staff inside the aircrafts are very helpful and polite.

### "don't know where is our luggage"
Paris to Montreal via Keflavik. Our experience with WOW air began with the confusing information about how much we could bring with us on the plane, due to the contradictory pages of the website. It continued at our arrival at the registering desk. Even if we were only three hours in advance for our flight, employees didn't even gave access to the queue lanes, so all the passengers that were waiting for the opening of the desk just stacked in the middle of the way in the airport. When boarding, the plane, there was only one incredibly slow employee receiving guests, so we all had to block the airport''s passage for more than an hour. In the plane, there was still garbage of previous passengers. The captain speaked english so bad and we were so not informed that nobody that didn't speak Icelandic had any clue about what was going on from this point. On board employees were the least helpful that I've seen during my trips. Food was incredibly costly on board. That was especially frustrating due to the three hours of hardly explained delay that we had to spend on board. After our landing in Rekjavik, we had to wait in queue another time, but this time outdoor, for a non sufficient bus to take us to the airport. The airport's organisation was just terrible. While three employees were doing nothing at the customs for people travellings to US, we waited for more than half an hour for people travelling to UK and Canada. Then we had to rush for our connecting flight, and after an awkward forced passage through the airport's shop, we would get to our gate only after 10 minutes due to the still unbelievable queues of stacked people waiting everywhere in the middle of the place. We got to the gate of our connecting flight while the passengers of our flight were called to board immediately, but just to wait another half of an hour without any explanation in a stationary bus. During our bus trip to the plane, I saw poor people (yes, another time), waiting outdoor in stationnary queues in front of the stairs leading to their plane. The icing on the cake was that, finally arrived home, we realised that Wow lost the luggage of all the people travelling on my connection from Paris to Montreal. Airport was not able to contact WOW air so we're the next day and we still don't know where is our luggage and when we will get it.

### "Won't fly them again"
Boston to Frankfurt return via Keflavik with WOW air. Like so many others, I was attracted by the low sticker price the airline is offering for tickets: $440 roundtrip to Frankfurt from Boston, before the holidays, seemed incredible. I did do some research ahead of time, reading up on the restrictions and reviews and thought that I had a fairly good understanding about what I was getting into. I only had carry on, correct (small size and weight), bought food ahead of time, etc. Even with this knowledge, and low expectations, the experience was pretty bad. 4 hours delay getting out of Boston. The good news was that the connecting planes tend to wait, so at least I wasn't stranded in Iceland. But because I had to get to Munich via train the overall trip took around 20 hrs or so. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes this airline so abysmal, since on paper it just sounds like any other US airline: no food, no service, delays, little communication, fee for checked luggage, etc. But everything seemed multiplied, perhaps of longer flights than domestic US flight. If you're in a position where you could take another airline (ie. it's not about whether or not you will make the trip) choose another carrier. I could see a very small subset of travelers benefitting from WOW : super flexible, forced to take it because otherwise you couldn't go, and being the type of person who doesn't get upset about much. Honestly, I thought I'd fall into that category, but don't. Won't fly them again.

### "hated this travel experience"
Paris to Boston via Keflavik. Worst airline ever. Seriously, just go with the more expensive flight. This round trip was awful every step of the way. Delays every possible place you can have them with inconsistent updates. Would board the plane after hours of delay and then would sit in the plane for hours more without moving - no notice given. Delays getting off, delays with baggage. An insane amount of stress. Not to mention, carry-on bags that are included are tiny sizes only, not regular carry-on sizes - so tack on another $160 if you're traveling a while. I hated this travel experience.

### "think twice before flying with them"
Flew Keflavik to London Gatwick with WOW air. One and only good thing is the spacious leg room. You have to buy everything including water. The food onboard is simple and not bad, but overpriced. Waited for over 1 hour at check-in. The flight is also delayed by 2 hours. Think twice before flying with them.

### "first and last time flying them"
San Francisco to Gatwick London via Keflavik. Do yourself a favor and avoid WOW air. I chose Wow based on cost, but didn't realize what an absolute hassle it would be to fly with them. They are chronically delayed. The company is unorganized and mismanaged in my opinion. The flight attendants are friendly but seem unprofessional compared to other airlines, and if you need customer service, forget about it. If you don't care about being significantly late to your destination or being physically uncomfortable during your flight (seats don't recline and are really thin and hard, air temp is cold) then the few dollars saved might be worth it. Otherwise I'd recommend pretty much any other airline over WOW air. I know that this will be my first and last time flying with them and I deeply regret ever buying that ticket. If I could give them zero stars I would, but one was the minimum allowed.

### "last time with this terrible airline"
First and last time with this terrible airline. Three hours delay from Amsterdam to Reykjavik and almost 5 hours from Reykjavik to Amsterdam. Staff couldn't care less when I inquired about my connection flight, which of course I missed. I reminded the them that I have passenger rights and they said they don't care, they're a low cost airline. You have to pay for carry on baggage and don't even have a guarantee that it's going to be in the cabin.

### "the worst flight experience"
Amsterdam to Newark via Keflavik with WOW air is the worst flight experience in my life. The flight was delayed for more than three hours, plus my luggage was lost! After three days the luggage is still not found, and the personal investigation can start only after six days. So I have to meet Christmas without any clothes and other stuff. The food on board is outrageously expensive, you pay 3 dollars even for water. All the money you save with this "low-cost" you lose for purchasing any kind of service and phone calls to try to get your luggage back.

### "what a horrible mistake"
This is my first time using WOW air, and boy what a horrible mistake! Never to be repeated. I booked a Washington DC to Paris, with an hour-long layover in Rejkavik. The flight was booked as a regular flight to Paris with a layover, as one would expect. Then comes the baggage fees. they charged fees for each "leg" of the trip, for a total of 4 separate charges of $183. They claim for baggage they have to treat the flight as a Dc to Rejkavik and then Rejkavik to Paris, and same thing on the way back. When I called them, I could not get a straight answer from any of the 3 different agents I spoke with! Ticket is non-refundable, and it's a take or leave it. Baggage allowance are a one-bag of 44 lbs per passenger. My first and last time ever using WOW air.

### "forced to pay the extra $100"
Baltimore to Copenhagen return via Keflavik. At first I had a positive impression of this airline. The staff at BWI were cheerful and quite helpful. They checked my carry-on luggage and had no problem with it, as it was well within allowance in weight and size. The outbound flights were relatively smooth and uneventful. The problems came when I returned from my extended weekend trip, from Copenhagen. They decided at the gate that I was exceeding my allowances in size. They said that both my small carry on item and my personal item both had to go under the seat in front of me, that I could not use the overhead space for my small carry on, and that I had to pay $100 to upgrade to the "large carry on" or they would not allow me to fly. They also said that the small carry-on and the personal item both had to fit within the small carry-on allowance (42x32x25cm). However, their website is quite clear that the allowance for the small carry-on and the personal item (42x20x20cm) are exclusive. Also, the website states that the personal item must fit under the seat in front of you. No mention that the "small carry-on" must also fit under the seat also, which would be quite difficult to do. I pulled up the website and tried to show the staff this, but they refused. So I was forced to pay the extra $100. I hoped that this would all be sorted out via their customer service when I returned to the US, and even provided photographic evidence of the size of my baggage. But their response was that they  trust their employees at the airport to follow the carry-on policy and they refused to give me a refund. Thanks to this extra $100 fee, their flight became more expensive than other airlines that offer meals, larger baggage allowances, and other amenities. If you do decide to fly this airline, buyer beware.

### "there was plenty of leg room"
I flew from London Gatwick via Keflavik to Newark for a family birthday in New York. My daughters gave me the trip so they booked the cheapest ticket that they could find. After reading all the horror stories about WOW air I was nervous but there was no reason to be. All four flights left and departed on time, and the cabin crew were outstanding on all four. The Captain even announced over the tannoy for passengers to look out of the windows to see the Northern Lights. Even though I didn't pay for one, I had a window seat on three of the four legs. The crew had Christmas jumpers on for the Keflavik/Newark leg and all passengers were given lovely ginger biscuits and candy canes. I am a tall lady and there was plenty of leg room. My children had paid for one suitcase for me to go into the hold and my carry on luggage was the right size and weight so I didn't have to pay for this. I had carefully read the terms and conditions on their website so I knew what to expect regarding paying for refreshments. I can't comment on the food as I only had a hot chocolate and a coffee to drink. I will definitely travel with WOW Air again. I recommend reading their luggage policies carefully though. Kudos to WOW Air and their wonderful Cockpit and cabin crew.

### "rude and disorganized"
Gatwick to San Francisco via Keflavik. The flight was delayed, the staff was rude and disorganized throughout the boarding process and to top it off they made me pay $99 for my carry on. Their allowance for baggage, including transatlantic flights to the US is extremely small. Basically you can take a small backpack or a laptop bag. That's it. I've flown all over the world with that bag with countless airlines. The charge is exorbitant and I felt totally taken advantage of in the way it was handled by the crew. Never again

### "I will never fly them again"
The only positive thing I have to say about my experience with WOW air was that I liked the color pink they chose to paint their planes. That is literally it. The employees clearly are bottom of the barrel and don't get paid enough because they are rude and hardly speak English, except for the one flight attendant that was kind enough to give me some hot water since we had to stand outside in below freezing weather in Iceland for 20 minutes. The power outlets did not work in our seats. I ended up having to pay $400 for my luggage, one way and even though I was promised a refund of some of it by a customer service agent, was later told that it was my fault as I had paid for the bags twice and the airline does not issue refunds. Needless to say I will never fly them again.

### "have no customer service"
All four of my WOW flights (to and from Boston - London via Keflavik) were delayed. Not the major problem. Confirmed seat (toward the front of the plane) at time of ticket purchase ignored and new seat issued (toward the back of plane) at check-in. I was told, "It was changed. Move on. No explanation. Not the major problem. Luggage lost. Given case number and a WOW Air information sheet regarding lost luggage at Gatwick Airport. Sheet explained compensation would be paid at the rate of $25 US per day after 24 hours, not to exceed 4 days. Luggage finally located and delivered to Gatwick, 3 days after arrival. I submitted a request for the posted compensation for the lost luggage as well as the items I had to purchase to attend a function on June 11. At this point it has been well over 4 months since the request was submitted. WOW Air has said it should take 6-8 weeks to review and settle the request. They have apologized for the delay in resolving this issue and thanked me for my patience. I have written them many emails regarding this, submitted all documents requested by WOW Air 3 times (and acknowledged by them as they then ask for the same documents to be submitted again.) I have now received more than 10 case numbers for the same request. Checking the status of and of the claim numbers shows the claim as submitted with no other information. Checking any of the claims after 3 or 4 times, results in "Access Denied" and then I was given another claim number. For a relatively new airline, they have no customer service and ignore their own written policy.

### "anything else you must pay"
London Gatwick to Keflavik. Horrible staff and service. The advantage in ticket price is gone once you pay for bags and it is better to fly with normal airline. They have 2 bag sizes, basically for free is only a small hand bag. For anything else you must pay, the normal cabin size bag that is accepted by any other airline is considered as a large bag, and I had to pay GBP74 at the gate, which is excessive amount for people that take cheap airline to fly.

### "gives exactly what it says it will"
As I sat in the international section of Logan Airport in Boston, I promised myself to add a Wow Air review. The Wow Air gate personnel called for passengers to certify their carry-ons before the flight. Since I carried only a 33-liter lightweight backpack, they quickly slapped their purple You May Pass tag on its handle. I kept that tag on the bag for all four flight segments with Wow, and was never asked about it again. Perhaps because they examined the bags earlier, there was no baggage-related delay or backlog at boarding. We were shuffled onto a descending escalator to a small room but not allowed to board for a few minutes. With no one in charge in that small room, we passengers had to spread out to allow the unending flow to get off the escalator. It could have become a problem, and although it didn't, I'll dock Wow one rating point for that. On board, was as advertised. Food and drinks, even water, cost money. (I especially enjoyed the ~$9 hot ham and cheese sandwich.) Legroom was better than on Southwest. There was no entertainment, but there were two power plugs in every three-seat row, so forewarned passengers such as me could watch as much video as we brought with us. All four segments departed and arrived about on time. The Frankfurt to Keflavik plane did not have power plugs, though it did have six channels of music in the armrests. Service was friendly, and as I mentioned, there were no problems. I'm happy to recommend Wow Air as a cheap option for Europe to America flights, but not so much from America to Europe. Wow's US flights all depart in the early evening for arrival in Iceland in the wee hours, with hurried connections to Europe arriving in the morning. With an early evening departure and a slightly overwarm cabin, I found it hard to convince my body to sleep during the five-hour Atlantic flight. Pulling an all-nighter like that didn't help my jet lag. I'd much rather take an early morning flight to get to Europe around bedtime or a late-night flight with a better chance of napping. If you don't get caught in one of the horror stories listed by other travelers here, Wow Air gives you exactly what it says it will : An amazing price if you're willing to travel light and bring your own entertainment. Only you can decide whether that's worth it for you.

### "brilliant, efficient experience"
Brilliant and efficient experience with WOW air. I used passbook on my iPhone for my boarding pass and paid for a large carry on bag (hand luggage is free). I went straight through to security, to get to the departure lounge took me about 4 minutes at both Gatwick and Keflavik. Both planes boarded and departed on time, landing in Keflavik was the smoothest I've ever experienced! Loads of leg room compared to other airlines I've flown with. I didn't pay extra to choose my seat as I was travelling alone, yet somehow still managed to get a window seat which was great! I was worried as my plane tickets cost £80 all together, including my luggage fees. I thought by paying so little I would be 'getting what I paid for' but I was wrong: I got more than what I paid for; nothing to complain about! Will definitely be flying with WOW air again.

### "not satisfied whatsoever"
Los Angeles LAX to Paris CDG with WOW air. This airline is cheap when your purchase tickets compared to other flights, however, after all the fees the price can be insane. You have to pay for check in luggage both ways. We had to pay for seats to ensure we sat together. Pure nonsense. Don't bother to ask for a cup of water because that is not even free. Meals are separate. It was a 9 hour flight and I had to purchase food. Stay away from this airline. On top of all the fees there is no entertainment at all. Not satisfied whatsoever.

### "decent amount of legroom"
I flew from Baltimore Washington to Keflavik. WOW air offers cheap tickets if you are willing to skimp on the extras. Yes, they charge you for food, drinks (including water), a normal sized carry on, and checked bags. You can bring a free carry on but it has to be able to fit under the seat in front of you and they will check when you check in to make sure. This airline manages to keep prices low by not charging you for the extra frills. If you want them you can purchase them but it's at your discretion. I usually take an empty water bottle with and fill it up after I get through security to save on drinks. I also bring a sandwich bought at a convenience store. WOW air does not have entertainment on board which they do tell you on their website. You can pay to rent a tablet but it's easier to just bring your own. I brought my own e-reader and it worked out great! The airline attendants were very sweet and my seat was better than expected. The plane interior is very trendy looking and seats give you a decent amount of legroom. To be honest I think I had better leg room on my flights with WOW air than with American Air or United. One of my flights even had power outlets under the seats. Be aware there is no wifi on their flights so download movies prior. Overall great flight! Just be aware of what the regulations are. They have all of their information on the website.

### "quick and straightforward"
London Gatwick to Keflavik round trip. I checked in with a hold bag at the desk at Gatwick and used a self check-in machine at Keflavik and in both cases, it was quick and straightforward. Wow air’s policy on cabin baggage is that if your bag is small enough to fit under the seat in front of you, it is free but bigger bags that need to go into the overhead bins cost a fee, and bags are labelled by ground staff accordingly. This policy seemed to work because boarding was quick and efficient and even though both flights were full, there was none of the delay and hassle experienced with other low cost airlines when passengers cannot find space for their carry-on baggage. Both flights were on young A321 airplanes which had pleasantly understated interiors. I am six feet tall and had plenty of knee space and the seats were fitted with a useful USB power supply. Beverages were typical low-cost airline fare and a cup of tea/coffee cost 350 Kr. The cabin crew were pleasant and friendly. Both flights flew to schedule.

### "the lack of response"
Started with boarding of second leg from Keflavik to Dublin, noticing a substitute plane from National Air (Dubai). Not what was the usual WOW aircraft. It did not takeoff with claims of engine problems needing to be checked. After many approximate 2 hour delays, and no WOW reps at their service desk to answer questions, and no email notifications, all passengers were transported to a nearby cafeteria and given a meal, and then checked in to a hostel style hotel (converted army barracks) with a few passengers including myself being told that the hotel was full. All hotels in the area had no vacancies. The flight was finally able to depart in the very early morning, some 18 hours later. I was forced to book another airline to Belfast and a bus to Dublin to reach my destination a day and a half late, losing a paid booking for a night in Dublin and getting very little sleep in Iceland night. I have submitted a claim to their website but after 10 weeks have had no response beyond the automated claim system. Using the same system I complained about the lack of response. Still no reply. I only am requesting flight, bus and hotel reimbursement.

### "very aggressively priced"
Berlin to Baltimore via Keflavik. Tickets are very aggressively priced compared to competitors. Everything in flight has a fee. Booking your seats. Prices start from 7.99 and range up to 50.99. Normally the flights are not full so if you're travelling with family or with others make sure you reach the airport a little early so you can choose your seats and get them together. Seats do recline but only a little. Legroom is pretty decent. They allow you one free carry on. Its a small bag (42x32x25cms) that can weigh up to 10Kgs. This means you can just carry a small (very small) backpack. Any normal cabin bag is bigger than the dimension. This way you will have to pay for the large cabin bag (56x45x25cms) that lets you carry 12kgs for $50.99. Make sure you dont have any extra purse or camera bags, they sometimes would count that as a carry-on. They are strict when it comes to this as this is the way they make their money. There is no IFE screen in flight. You can purchase a tablet for $12 thats loaded with movies and songs. You have a USB charger under each seat. No food is free inside the flight. Not even water. Price for a bottle of water was $2.7 and a turkey sandwich was $10. The layovers if your traveling to Europe from US is generally very short. Little over an hour. That's just enough to exit the plane and run to your next flight. I did not get a chance to pick any food in Iceland during the transit and had to eat in flight. Overall the flight was clean, ground staff and cabin crew were amazing. All the flights I took were on time or late by a few minutes. If you plan it right and your trip is short then you will save flying WOW air.

### "we were very disappointed"
Keflavik to Baltimore Washington. My family and I were very dissatisfied with WOW air. Flight was overbooked, left very late, herded us in like cattle, very disorganized, and no direction was given. The crew was not friendly or helpful. This was our first time flying with WOW and will definitely be the last. The money you feel you are saving with the tickets is made up with the high fare for baggage and they charge you for everything - even water on the flight. No entertainment was provided and the seats did not recline. We were very disappointed!

### "didn't save enough to suffer this flight again"
London Gatwick to San francisco via Keflavik with WOW air. Staff were great and friendly but there was zero inflight entertainment apart from a tablet with some mediocre films and games on for $12 each. We didn't bother with this as we took some entertainment with us. There was no free food or drink (we got some from the airport shops, which was still expensive in SFO but was better quality than what WOW air serve). I asked for water and was made to pay for bottled water which was expensive. They charge $4 dollars for a tiny pot of instant noodles and that is about it for food options. Seats are small and cramped not far off a Ryanair flight for the flight from London to Keflavik. Keflavik to SFO there was better leg room but still uncomfortable for 9 hours. Keflavik airport is horrendously expensive for food and there isn't much choice in paying their prices if you want to eat. My advice, stock up on food and drink for the whole flight at Gatwick. We paid $60 dollars in SFO for two people to eat a sandwich and  crisps each, and 2 drinks. Not far off the same price in Keflavik. Good choice of food but expensive. The carry on baggage is smaller than any other airline and they are very strict with this, it is smaller than a normal size carry on suitecase, enough for a small backpack or handbag. Some people did have suitecases as hand luggage but they were very small. Make sure you look up the dimensions as it is £13 per kg if your bag is overweight and £75 at the desk to check in your bag and they will police this. Both inbound and outbound flight times were changed prior to travelling and flight was slightly delayed on the way back. Short lay over times in Keflavik which was great and the flights were on time apart from a 20 minute delay from SFO-KEF. Not too sure if I saved that much money in the long run, as I had to travel over 100 miles from my home to London Gatwick and stay in a hotel the night before my inbound flight, then pay airport / airline prices for food and drink. Probably didn't save enough to suffer this flight again. Although the transfers and layovers were better than I have ever experienced with any other airline.

### "not a low cost airline"
3 people flying from to Toronto to London Gatwick via Keflavik, 5hrs 45 mins to Keflavik, then to London Gatwick a flight of just over 3 hrs. It was my 40th Birthday trip away and was completly ruined by WOWair. In Toronto we were charged for 2 carry on bags because they were larger than the permitted size (smaller than other airlines). Then we get on the plane and find no entertainment unless you pay 25CAD for an Ipad to watch movies/ play games, food is awful and expensive. When I asked for a glass of water I was brought a bottle and charged 4CAD, so no free water. I spent more money then I would have with Air Transat or Westjet, WOW is not a low cost airline! The amount of people who had to pay extra for having larger carry on bags when queing at the check in desk, they are ripping people off.

### "very impressed with WOW"
Gatwick to Montreal via Keflavik. Considering how little I paid for this flight, I was very satisfied. There is no entertainment on board, no free seat selection, and a fee for large carry-on or checked baggage, but this was all made clear before booking. My return flight from LGW to YUL was incredibly cheap, even booked last-minute. Check-in online was standard, and like other budget airlines, there is no free seat selection even at check-in. My primary complaint was with the boarding method/time. From LGW to KEF, boarding took a very long time (much longer than they had allowed time for) because every person has their carry-on checked and tagged, and many people have to pay fees based on the size of their bags. This made the boarding process very long, and as a result, the flight was 55 minutes late getting off the ground. From KEF to YUL, boarding was also approximately 15 minutes late (even with a half-full aircraft), and then we sat at the gate for another 30 minutes due to a paperwork issue. However, all these complaints aside, I arrived in YUL only 11 minutes behind schedule, which I thought was great. As for on-board service, the crew seemed friendly, and unlike other budget airlines, they were not pushy at all. A few passes with the refreshment trolly, and a single pass with the duty-free. Very tasteful in my opinion unlike other budget carriers that bombard you for a full flight making it impossible to sleep or keep to yourself. So, I have to say, overall I was very impressed with WOW and will most certainly fly with them again. For the difference in flight cost compared to other carriers, I could have actually purchased myself a brand new tablet for entertainment along with my flights and it still would have come out cheaper than the other airlines. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a cheap flight and you aren't travelling with large amounts of luggage.

### "would recommend WOW air"
I was extremely satisfied with WOW Airlines and recommend them. We got an exceptional deal on tickets from LAX to CDG. I was initially hesitant to fly with them based on online reviews. I read about frequent delays and lack of customer service. Speaking solely from my experience, they were punctual and the customer service was exceptional. I suspect the bulk of complaints arise from the fact that they have luggage size restrictions and they do not provide meals and in-flight entertainment as part of the ticket price. However, you're flying to Europe for 1/5 the price of many airlines! To cope with these limitations, I suggest to bring your own entertainment, load up on food at the airports, pack lightly (invest in a good backpack) and make sure you have a buffer in your schedule since most WOW flights have layovers in Iceland (which is an incredible place). My wife and I have always wanted to explore Europe. WOW provided a deal attractive enough to make it a reality. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we would recommend WOW air to anyone wanting to make the trip.

### "spend night in redone army barracks"
London to Baltimore via Keflavik. London flight delayed and missed connection in Keflavik. Our connecting flight left 30 minutes before we landed, stranding about 40 people. Could they not have waited? Forced to spend the night in a redone army barracks with shared restrooms with no toiletries. Horrible food provided at a pizza place (buffet provided, if you wanted to order from the menu it was at your cost) that we had to walk 4 blocks to in freezing weather. Breakfast though was nice but it was at a actual Bed and Breakfast within eye sight of our barracks (why were we not placed there for the night?). Worst customer service ever. Booked through Boston to my final destination in Baltimore arriving at such a late time I had to book a hotel to the cost of $146 as I had a 5 hour drive to my home. Also changed our airlines to Spirit (which is also awful) and they charged me a additional $55 for my small carry on that I had already paid for on WOW. Rep in Boston had no clue about our situation. I have filled a claim and now wait to see if they will reply and make this right. I bet you will see many more reviews from folks I was stranded with. Very unhappy at this point with this airline.

### "a terrible experience"
Dublin to Keflavik with WOW air. Very misleading from the start. They charge 38 euro each way for each bag when the carry on luggage is bigger than a small backpack. How can anyone travel that light? Such a waste of money. They also pick and choose who they charge as there were people ahead of me let through with the same size baggage. A terrible experience from a frequent flyer.

### "smooth and cheap flight"
Keflavik to Amsterdam. Had a smooth and cheap flight with WOW. On my way from Amsterdam to Keflavik there was an hour delay because they send in a too small plane, which meant that 90 people were left behind and had their flight 4 hours later. However, the flight from KEF to AMS was perfect. A lot of legroom in a new A330, friendly crew (people could sit at the exit which was not occupied) and it was on time. Of course, there is no in flight entertainment and you have to pay (quite some money) for your food and beverages, but I was aware of this beforehand. For this price, it was a very good trip. Advice: Check in online or at the airport using the machines, this will help you to get in your hand luggage. I had a large hand luggage and backpack and had no trouble with boarding.

### "WOW air is a shambolic company"
Boston to Bristol via Keflavik. WOW is a horrendous airline and a disgrace to Iceland and the airline industry. I arrived at Boston airport on 19/6/16 and was told at the WOW check-in desk that my flight to Keflavik would be delayed. I was given 100% assurance that my connecting flight to Bristol would not be affected. This was not true, my connecting flight was affected and I missed it. I'm pretty sure they knew this but lied to us all so that they wouldn't be liable for reimbursements. Not a good start! We got stranded at KEF of course, and were given no information and no flight options other than being told to go to a hotel and wait. WOW does not employ anyone directly on the ground at KEF (their home airport) which means there's literally nobody to talk to there. I found this completely bizarre for an airline but it makes sense as they try to avoid assisting their passengers at all costs. While stranded in Iceland we received zero information about anything. My many emails, tweets and phone calls to WOW were ignored and nobody from the airline got in touch with us until a note mysteriously appeared in the Soviet-style 'hotel' saying that we would be bused back to KEF early the next morning. When we arrived at the check-in desk the next day nobody knew who we were and nobody had a record of our bookings! I originally paid to fly to Bristol but would have taken any flight to the UK at that point. However, WOW staff refused to book me on their flight to London Gatwick (or any other flight). Because WOW refused to get me on a flight to the UK, I was forced to pay for an Icelandair flight. However and bizarrely, 30mins before the WOW flight to Gatwick departed, the staff suddenly agreed to put me on the flight and I eventually flew to Gatwick. I have no idea why it required 2hrs of persuasion and for me to book another flight before this happened - it should have happened as soon as I arrived at the airport. The experience was crazy and stressful. I arrived in Gatwick and I was required to buy a train ticket to take me to my final destination (Bristol). WOW air is a shambolic company that does not care one bit about its customers. If you want to get to your destination on time, with your luggage, and without feeling ripped off and disgusted at this quick-buck company, I strongly suggest flying with someone else.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Baltimore to Keflavik with WOW air. The only thing WOW about this airline is, WOW how shockingly bad it is. In fact one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown with. First of all WOW advertises extremely cheap flights to Reykjavik, and from the offset I was wary at such cheap deals. They were over half the price of Icelandair. I paid for extras whilst booking my ticket online including seat reservations and for a ‘large’ carry on bag. Yes you have to pay for any carry on luggage. The total cost was still below that of Icelandair. When we got to the airport I was shocked to find the airline weighs carry on luggage. And the limit is so low, you’d basically only be traveling with a few pairs of jeans and shirts to fit in the weight allowance. Our WOW Air check in representative suggested we have to pay over $130 to check the bags in the hold, or alternatively we could pay him a cash fee of $80 to take the bags onboard. He couldn’t issue a receipt for this ‘cash fee’ but we opted for it as it was the cheaper option, and it meant we didn’t have to wait for our luggage the other side. He assured me I could call up WOW Air to receive a refund for my original ‘checked bag’ fee. I called up immediately after passing security, initially I was hung up on twice, and the third time was informed I could absolutely not receive a refund and they did not believe my story of the representative asking for cash because I didn’t receive a receipt to prove it. Because I was so angry at these extra fees, I failed to realize myself an my friend were sat in completely different parts of the plane despite having paid and booked for specific seats on my original booking. The flight itself was uneventful although the plane was extremely old and absolutely no entertainment even for a flight over 5 hours. Upon landing at Keflavik airport I tweeted WOWAir at my dismay and they promptly responded asking for my booking reference number and they would look into it. I messaged them listing the issues I had only to receive a message in return insinuating that I was lying about the check in representative asking for cash. And they also gave a lame excuse as to why myself and my friend weren’t sat next to each other, because apparently I had amended my booking and therefore forfeited the seats I’d paid for and chosen specifically. May I add this was all on a Twitter message - they didn’t even have the courtesy to call or send me an official email. Absolutely unprofessional, shocking service from start to finish. I really wish I had stuck to my intuition and flown with Icelandair instead. It ended up working out to the same price. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "horrible customer service"
WOW air have the worst customer service. We had a flight from Amsterdam to Boston with a connexion in Keflavik and that first flight was delayed for more than 4 hours, so naturally we missed the next flight to Boston. What did they do? Put us in a hostel, sharing a bathroom with a stranger, in the middle of nowhere. There was absolutely no one to talk to when we got in the airport, their customer service just doesn't exist. They put us in a flight that was 2 days later letting no room for conversation or having any flexibility to try and attend better our needs. They just won't listen to you. Because of them, my husband and I also missed our flight that would take us to our final destination, Detroit, with no refunds. This company will not last for much time with this horrible customer service.

### "won't be using again"
London to Boston via Keflavik. I was billed twice for checking in one suitcase at Logan Airport and the I problems I encountered seeking a refund led me to tell the airline to keep the money. I supplied their customer service team with a receipt number, flight number, everything they should have needed to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion but they just didn't seem bothered. I certainly won't be using this company again.

### "mixed experience"
Flew WOW air from Reykjavik to Amsterdam. Mixed experience: while the seats are OK even for tall people (at least 2A in my case), there is no screen or in flight entertainment, and boarding took ages because everyone who had a oversized hand luggage had to pay a fee (and there was only one person handling everything).

### "they left 300 suitcases behind"
Delayed flight was one thing, but the fact that they left 300 suitcases behind in Iceland was something else altogether. When we arrived in LA, no one knew where the luggage was and no one could find out. It was chaos. The following day, there was still no news and the staff that I spoke to were less than helpful and possessed a small degree of initiative for trying to chase things up. It was very stressful. The one good thing about this airline is the legroom. Everything else is fairly shambolic and the cost of food and drink on the plane is exorbitant. Also, if you're vegetarian, there's virtually nothing to eat. I took my own food, but really, next time I'm going to pay more and go with a reputable airline.

### "needless to say, never again"
Keflavik to Los Angeles. Two hour delay in Iceland was pretty much expected through reviews but I thought I could save some money and time with WOW with the non-stop flight. 9.5hour flight later we landed and went to luggage retrieval. All passengers waited for about an hour when a rep came out to tell us that they can't find our luggage and that we have to go to Lost Baggage dept and fill out a claim. Our luggage was either put on another plane or it never left Iceland. I personally had my bag delivered to my house 4 days later by a gentleman who could not speak English and used his personal beat up minivan. Needless to say, never again.

### "WOW fits my expectation of an airline"
People are complaining about WOW airlines because they don't know that its business model is very different. Once you understand that everything has a cost, and the cost is very expensive, then you can fly cheaply as I did. Note that a bottle of water costs 3 euros. I saw a lady buying two bottles of something that is free most everywhere in the world. The only thing that is free is one small carry on that weighs less than 10kg (22 lbs). Such a deal. It went up from 5 kg the first time I flew WOW. Obviously, with all the restrictions, you have to plan ahead. For me, WOW fits my expectation of an airline, that is, inexpensive RT tickets. WOW is notoriously late, so if you book your own connections, plan on a wide connection timing. Otherwise, you will have to rebook your connections at full fare. That will definitely increase your blood pressure. For a solo traveler who is on a budget, this airline is perfect.

### "communication method was ridiculous"
Flights are constantly delayed or canceled. I was on a flight from Paris to BWI with a change of planes at their main hub in Iceland. What a disaster that turned into. We were bused to the old NATO base and put up in a WOW hostel with limited access to anything. We were told we would be put on our same flight the next day. This never happened. The flight was actually to Boston instead of BWI. We were we then where switched to a different airlines after a 3 hour layover. We finally got to BWI around 11 pm instead of the 5.30 pm arrival time. I missed the train and was forced to take a taxi to DC which cost almost 100 bucks. While stuck in Iceland we had no contact from a wow representative. Their communication method was ridiculous. Posting notes on the wall in the lobby of their hostel. Mine was not the only flight cancelled that same day. At least 2 more coming from Different cities in Europe were cancelled as well.

### "not cheaper than other airlines"
Los Angeles LAX to Paris CDG via Keflavik with WOW air. Worst airline I have ever flown with and will never use it again. Flight was not cheaper than other airlines carriers but no food, no drinks (have to pay for everyting), no service. Requested and paid for certain seats which I did not get. I can just hope that WOW air is refunding me my money that I spend to reserve these seats.

### "you don't save any money"
Los Angeles to Paris via Keflavik with WOW air. I was offered this new airline and when I saw price I was surprised at the cost so I took it - wrong decision. You don't save any money. My ticket was $450 and at the end of my trip I had paid over $700. I fly American or Air France and it would have cost me the same without worrying about luggage size and weight. I didn't realize you had to pay for luggage and food. You don't get anything - not even a cup of water, I paid who knows how much for water - it's ridiculous. If you want entertainment they have this for a fee using tablets. The staff were nice but they don't walk around too much. If you can take clothes in backpack and fly a few hours, have your own entertainment and bring your own snacks well good luck. I am staying away from this airline for good.

### "5 hr delay for connecting flight"
San Francisco to Edinburgh return via Reykjavik. No inflight food or entertainment, though food is for sale at a ridiculous price. The luggage fees are crazy too. A 5 hour delay for the connecting flight from Reykjavik to Edinburgh. The plane for return flight was not clean, trash on floor. A 2 hour delay again from Reykjavik to San Francisco. And another hour just sitting on the tarmac. Terrible.

### "not sure you save any sort of money"
Reykjavik to Montreal. I am not sure if you save any sort of money by flying with WOW Air. They advertise flights from Montreal to Iceland for 189$, but when you add the extra costs for buying a seat on the plane (10$) and paying for a checked luggage (70$), you end up at the same price of Icelandair. Times this total by 2 (for your return flight) and you have a ticket that is closer to 550$. Note that there is absolutely no entertainement onboard. They don't even serve water (you must buy water bottles for 3$). Overall, my flights were slightly delayed. I am not totally disapointed but for equal price, I would definitely choose another airline.

### "felt like we had been kidnapped"
Baltimore Washington to Paris via Keflavik. We felt like we had been kidnapped after they intentionally departed us from BWI, lying to us, knowing they were canceling their flights out of Iceland (KEF), June 9/10 2016, until further notice. We were totally abandoned without any form of customer service in Iceland at the airport. After hours of confusion, we went to the IcelandAir service desk, who had service people there to talk to, booked a flight to Paris, which was our destination. It cost us an additional $1,145, passing through Oslo, arriving 13 hours after our original time, but we did get there thanks to other airlines. Upon return to the USA, I tried submitting a claim with Wow Air, but they only have an email address which provides some initial lip service but then quickly plays dead when they never follow up on anything and then stop even sending their form-letter responses back.

### "Worst experience ever"
Edinburgh to Baltimore Washington via Keflavik. Worst experience ever. We travel to Europe 2 to 3 times a year. For the first time we decided to try WOW Air because of the price. You get what you paid for. Delayed for 7 hours total without an explanation. After boarding we were sitting on the plane prior take off for about 3 hours. We missed the connection flight back to USA and got stuck in Iceland for one day. Rude ground personnel and not helpful.

### "customer service is unhelpful"
San Francisco to Keflavik. My original total cost was $880, and it quickly became $1,900, which defeats the purpose of why I chose this airline. After already paying 200$ for seats and luggage, they switched my flight and the seats and luggage didn't carry over or get refunded. I have to double pay an additional 200$. Customer service is intentionally unhelpful, and ignores e-mails. When you call them, they charge $26 for the phone call. They refuse to help at all. They pretend to help on Twitter, but never offer explanations, answers, or refunds. Often times their help is counter productive, like deleting the seats from your selection. They also charged me a change the date fee of $86 twice for literally no reason, and they won't answer any questions about it. Anytime they do respond to an e-mail they pretend as though I never asked about it, even after 30 e-mails and a phone call over the course of a week. Their customer service team needs to be replaced.

### "the customer pay for their problems"
Booked a ticket that I had to reschedule for later this year. I paid penalties of course, which i can understand. Now the company sends me an email to tell me that a part of my flights had to be cancelled. I had a round trip Los Angeles to Lyon via Keflavik. They cancelled both Lyon sectors. Their emails mentioned that I can get refunded just the cancelled flights. What am I gonna do with the rest of the tickets? My vacation plan is not to stay in KEF! So I'm calling customer support, and they tell me they can proceed to refund my tickets in full - but not the $172 penalties! Not happy! I did not pay penalties for a flight that does not exist! Conclusion: do not book with WOW, bad customer service and company does not take ownership of their internal problems. They make the customer pay for their problems.

### "excellent value for money"
Bristol to Baltimore via Keflavik. Considering we flew economy, the leg room was great and seats very comfortable. The cabin crew were brilliant and very friendly. This was a low cost airline, but the service was excellent. The flight leaving Bristol was on time, and the departure from Iceland was also on time - we actually arrived at Baltimore earlier than scheduled. We would chose WoW again as it was excellent value for money.

### "this is by far the worst company"
I was scheduled to fly WOW Air out of Paris CDG  airport to Keflavik Airport. From there I was scheduled to fly to my final destination of Boston Logan Airport. I arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport at 10:30am and was notified upon check-in that my second flight from Keflavik (WW125) to Logan was overbooked and that WOW Air would try to get me booked on another flight. Myself and 14 other passengers were displaced from our flight and told to wait near the check-in desk for further information. We waited until noon when we were told there would be an update, but we were given no more information at that time. In fact, we ended up spending 11 total hours waiting to learn what would become of us, with very limited response from WOW customer service. We attempted to call, Skype, Tweet, and Facebook message customer service because we were getting no answers from the employees at the airport. Unfortunately, the majority of our efforts were completely ignored and we were essentially left in the dark for the entire 11 hours of waiting at CDG. We were finally notified at 9:30pm that new flights and a hotel had been arranged for us. The catch with the new flight plan? It was almost twice the length of the original flight and we had to be back at the airport at 6am the next day. By the time I got to the hotel, checked in, and got ready for bed, I only had a few hours available for sleep before I had to wake up to get ready for my early new flight. Thanks to this egregious overbooking, a simple trip back home turned into a 44-hour ordeal that left me utterly exhausted. I have traveled by air countless times and have never had an experience even remotely close to this. On top of all of that, the WOW claims process is an utter nightmare to deal with. I am owed a decent sum thanks to EU regulations regarding overbooked/cancelled flights, but it's been 5 months since I filed my claim and I still haven't seen a cent. I write in often, but they always tell me my claim will be paid out in the next few days. This seems to be their operating system with customer service - just ignore you and put you off until you finally relent. This is by far the worst company I've ever had to deal with.

### "would not recommend to anyone"
We travelled from Boston To Dublin via Reykjavik in August 2016. We were a bit sceptical about flying with them because we had never heard of them before and the reviews were not good. We pondered for a day or too and decided to book it through Expedia. The night before travelling we booked in online, we saw a notice about booking in bags but thought it was a bit silly to book in bags when we were not even sure about how much they would weigh. We arrived at the airport and reported to the desk for boarding passes. The attendant asked us to put our bags on the weigh machine and then stated that it would cost 152 USD for the two bags. We asked why that much and she said it was because we didn't book and pay for them the day before. I asked if I could go and book them in online and come back to her. She said no, it should have been done before, it's too late now. We paid the money and noticed a women in the next check in to ours, crying because she had to pay for her bag and she had no money and no credit cards. The attendants stated that these were the rules. After boarding we were informed that food and drinks would be sold in any currency we wanted or a credit card - nothing is complimentary. There was no entertainment, music or wifi. We are home now and sent a complaint to WOW air, but not even a sorry - just letting us know that these are the rules that we agreed to. Will never fly with them again and certainly would not recommend them to anyone.

### "flight turned out to be terrific"
We'd heard a lot about WOW Airlines and all the lost baggage, poor customer service, and huge flight delays. We had trouble, for example, with our initial online flight reservation getting confirmed. But, when it came the day to travel from San Francisco one-way to Reykjavík on WOW Air, our having kept our fingers crossed paid off. Our flight check-in was very smooth, our departure gate was no mystery (even if it was, you can't miss the plane, for goodness sake!). Boarding was efficient with plenty of room to settle in for the 7.5 hour flight. The seats weren't very comfortable, and that did put a crimp in the plans to sleep our way over so we would be ready-to-go when we arrived 5 am the next morning. But with all the anxiety running up to the flight, the flight turned out to be terrific and we would use this airline again.

### "not offered any assistance"
Wow Air was a real disappointment. I flew from Copenhagen to Reykjavik one way without issues, however the return journey was a terrible experience. My flight was scheduled to depart at 7am, however at 9pm the night before I received an email to inform me that the flight has been delayed till 2.50pm due to "unforeseen circumstances". I was left in a frantic search for another flight as I had a connecting flight and would have missed it due to this new timing, and luckily found a (very expensive) seat on Icelandair at a similar timing. At the airport I saw several other travelers stranded and not offered any assistance. Some were not as lucky as they didn't check their emails the night before and were not aware of the change. It has been 5 months since the missed journey, and I am still waiting to hear from WOW air about the unused flight - fly at your own risk.

### "definitely fly them again"
Keflavik to Frankfurt, the ground crew were really helpful. The aircraft was new and legroom was outstanding, better than many non-low cost airlines. I was assigned seat 3A for free. The cabin baggage policy strictly limits passenegers to one bag, but I found the policy rather relaxed, in that they did not check the weight of my bag. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Food you have to buy on board  and the prices were rather steep. The entertainment was not enough for me personally, as Iceland is rather remote and almost all flights have a 3 hrs+ duration. In addition, I found the seats to be rather uncomfortable after 2hrs. The price was the Wow factor as I booked the flight on the same day of flying. Considering the price, I would definitely fly them again and recommend the airline.

### "didn't feel it was a good value"
The ticket was relatively cheap, 350 euros from Paris to Boston via Keflavik, so we decided to give WOW air a try despite its bad reviews. However, we don't plan on taking the airline again because we still didn't feel it was a good value for our money. Here are some points that we found particularly frustrating: There were very few agents to check in at the CDG airport in Paris, which meant we waited in a long line (perhaps this is why we did get away with taking our regular sized carry-on luggage for which one would normally be required to pay a fee on WOW air) - Our transit at KEF was relatively short, which meant we had no time to buy food or fill our water bottles in the airport. This was when we really did not appreciate having to pay for water on board and felt that it was a bit abusive on the airline's part, especially for a 5+ hour flight. We ordered the pizza for 8 euros, which was tasteless and quite considering the price. Many of the food options were sold out or unavailable. Our flight to Boston left about 30-45 minutes late due to the airline needing to locate someone's luggage, which meant unloading and reloading nearly all the luggage . After deplaning in Boston and getting through the immigration line, once we arrived at the luggage carousel we still had to wait more than 20 minutes for the luggage from our plane to arrive.

### "service from the stone age"
Flew Baltimore to Berlin via Reykjavik. I booked WOW air because of their supposed affordability - but that is really a sham. By the time a traveler adds all the hidden fees: bags, cabin luggage, even the hardest seat without the option to recline costs - the difference is actually not that big. Still, I figured I would try it. The seats are hard as boards and don't recline, not even water is provided free of charge. The worst thing is if you need customer service, you are left without support - I contacted them on multiple issues and each time I was asked to email the supervisor. She either never replied or she replied five days after my flight. I would rather pay 100 (USD) more for the assurance that I can get assistance. WOW air cannot be compared to other established budget lines, like easyJet. It is service from the stone age.

### "fly with another airline"
Bristol to Keflavik. Flight was delayed, I know this happens but when I tried to call WOW air to explain that this meant I would miss a connecting flight and a bus to a remote area they simply could not have cared less. This resulted in me paying a lot of extra cost for a brand new connecting flight and a hostel room. Their level of customer service when speaking to me was terrible. The cost of the flight begins cheap then soon goes up as you have to pay extra for hold luggage. If at all possible fly with another airline whenever possible!

### "wasn't worth the slightly cheaper flight"
Keflavik to San Francisco with WOW Air. Flight delayed 4 hours. Bag pickup delayed to 1.5 hours after landing. Don't fly this airline if you want anything to be on time! There were constant delays in several parts of the trip, overall we lost a lot of time and it wasn't worth the slightly cheaper flight. Also no free water on the 9 hour flight.

### "they failed to communicate with me"
Firstly the positive - nothing against the planes they used which were clean and comfortable, the pilots who were friendly and informative or the charming and helpful young man at Keflavik who helped to sort out one of the "mess-up" Wow had made. Now, I booked and paid for two specific seats 14 months before the flight - out and back. The day before each flight, when I went to check-in online, Wow had changed them and on both occasions had sat my wife and I far apart from each other. They failed to deliver my case to Iceland, with all the contents I required for my walking holiday, especially in the constantly changing weather found in Iceland - boots, waterproofs, warm clothing, everything. Despite repeated attempts by me via emails and phone, by hotels we stayed at, and by our travel agent in Iceland, they failed to communicate with me at all about such things as whether I could buy some replacements etc. It took them 10 days to get the bag to me and only then because a friend started to use Twitter to "name and shame" them.

### "steer very clear of this airline"
San Francisco to London via Reykjavik. The airline has managed to lose 4 out of my 5 checked in suitcases. No one at WOW will tell me whether they even left San Fransisco! It has now been three full days. I am truly disappointed that I am expected to wait until the airline officially declare my bags as lost before I can even contemplate a case for claiming for lost goods. The turnaround time for customer services to respond to enquiries can be up to 72 hours? I would steer very clear of this airline. Never again.

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
Worst airline I have ever flown with. Myself and my husband took a return flight from San Francisco to Alicante via Keflavik. After a long layover, the flight was delayed with no information about the new time. During the more than 9 hours flight from Keflavik to San Francisco, the cabin was so cold everybody was trying to cover themselves with whatever they had on hand. The little girls behind our row, were literally shaking. Of course, you had to pay for the blankets or any hot drink to warm up. On top of this, our luggage never arrived and after two days, no information about it has yet been provided to us. The name of this company is, without a doubt, very ironic.

### "have never experienced such poor service"
What a disorganised, disjointed airline this is. On the way out, I dutifully checked in online only to find a lengthy check in queue at Gatwick. I was informed that Wow air did not offer a bag drop facility at Gatwick and so I would need to line up to check in again. Why offer the facility online if it doesn't work? My return flight must have been the same as the passengers below. No mention of delays when leaving the plane at Reykjavik, no mention of a London flight at all on the boards and nobody at the service desk. We had to resort to getting a disembarking air steward to call somebody down to the service desk. The lady who turned up did not actually work for Wow and bluntly told us of the delay, as well as stating that no vouchers for refreshments would be given as delay was sub 3 hours. So basically, if your delay in less than 3 hours then tough, you get nothing, nada, zilch. The fact that I'd booked a flight with 1.5 hour stopover and actually ended up waiting 4.5 hours meant nothing, despite the fact I wouldn't have booked a flight with such a lengthy stop. By the time we actually took off, delays had reached over 3 hours, yet they still saw fit to charge for inflight refreshments, despite having given their customers nothing in the airport. The airline is no frills, so the lack of food, drink and entertainment was no shock to me and I planned accordingly. The lack of service, information and delays were however news to me. I've flown a range of carriers and have never experienced such poor service.

### "worst airline I've flown on"
Dublin to San Francisco via Keflavik. The worst airline I've flown on. First, they provide zero food or entertainment. Not even a free bag of peanuts or a soda, although they do provide snacks for a price. Never seen that before on a transatlantic flight. There is no TV, no wifi, and the seats don't recline. Second, both flights coming and going were delayed. The first was delayed two hours, the return flight four hours. Rediculous. The first and last time I fly this airline.

### "no WOW representative"
Flew from Toronto to Gatwick via Iceland. Arrived at Reykjavik for stop over of supposedly 1.5 hours and discovered through hearsay that connecting flight delayed by 2 hours 45 minutes, nothing said when leaving plane, no announcement on display board and no WOW representative to inform us. Very rude airport employee gave no apology or plausible explanation - I definitely won't be flying with WOW again.

### "they nickel and dime you"
Los Angeles to Copenhagen via Keflavik. Customer service was unacceptable. I was told that no overhead bags were allowed and only a carry on. That prompted me to spend 407.00 more dollars in checked baggage - for the bags I was quoted a higher amount than was on my printed contract. Five minutes and then he agreed the prices on my contract. The customer service agent explained that prices had increased. I explained the prices on my contract were the ones I would agree to pay. We went back and forth for about five minutes and then he agreed to accept the prices on the written contract. When I arrived at the airport I saw passengers rolling and carrying bags the size of the two I checked unnecessarily. There is no refund for baggage charges. Our flight from LAX was delayed for almost and hour and a half for cleaning. However, the fold out tray for the seat next to mine was dirty. There was no WiFi, no movie, and water was not complimentary on a one stop flight. They nickel and dime you until it would have been more cost effective to fly SAS or another legitimate carrier.

### "worst airline I have encountered"
Dublin to Toronto via Reykjavik. Worst airline I have ever encountered and I fly very frequently. The queue for luggage check in was ridiculous and disorganised. My flight was delayed by approximately 2 hours, which led to a panicked dash through Keflavik airport to catch my connecting flight which at least waited for us. When I arrived at Toronto, there was no sign of my luggage along with about 20 others whose bags had been left in Iceland. I queued up again and filled in the relevant forms. I spent approximately €70 on calls to the airline lost luggage number and courier which frequently rang out. When they did answer,many were rude and unhelpful. My luggage was supposed to arrive 2 days later but never did and was en route to the wrong address when I eventualy got through again and had already flown to the USA by then. An entire week later, I finally recieved my bags after spending €150 on necessities and borrowing from friends etc. Extremely inefficient and infuriating airline to deal with. The measly $25 per day of lost luggage up to four days seems to be impossible to get hold of and no compensation was offered, not even a toiletries bag. Absolutely disgraceful customer service. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. Had I paid more to fly direct to Toronto it would have cost significantly less. I also will be paying postage for sending parcels back to Canada as I had gifts for friends I was staying with that I never got to give to them. Beyond appalled with this mockery of an airline.

### "Wow, this airline really sucks"
WOW Air slogan is 'We promise to give you that "wow" feeling. Well I did, it's "Wow, this airline really sucks! My daughter flew out of BWI to Amsterdam to visit friends. The flight left Maryland 2 hours late. She missed her connecting flight to Amsterdam and lost a day of her holiday. I tried to get her on a later flight home to give her more time in Germany. The airline web site was not responsive or easy to use. I tried customer service , after waiting on hold almost 30 minutes, a person answered but I was soon cut off! Near as I can tell, switching return flights costs almost $600, outrageous compared to what I've experienced on other airlines.

### "you get less than what you pay for"
Amsterdam to Los Angeles via Reykjavik with WOW air. I will never fly with them again. Hours of delays without any explanation or apology. I've called the customer service line numerous times which is available 24/7 according to their website but never actually spoke to someone, just waited and waited. Because I could not reach customer service I had to book a new flight instead of reschedule the old one, so I ended up paying a lot of money. If you don't mind delays, having no clue when you'll arrive, having no customer service then this might be the perfect airline since it's cheap. Otherwise please pay some extra money for a decent airline. I know you can't expect much for the price you pay but with WOW air you get even less than what you pay for.

### "no personnel at the airport"
So many problems with this airline, it was almost comical except that it was my vacation at stake. We were scheduled to fly WOW air on June 21st 2016, flight WW174 from Los Angeles to Reykjavik scheduled to take off at 12.40pm and then flight WW442, Reykjavik to Amsterdam, scheduled to arrive in Amsterdam at 11.15am. We checked in online the night before, the Wow website said the flight was on time, when we woke up the website said the flight was on time, when we arrived at LAX several hours early the flight was still showing as on time both on their website and at the airport - we had not received any email or sms reporting any delay. We could not find a check in point, so we went to look for a WOW desk and there wasn't one. This was around 10am so we asked the information desk and found out the flight was delayed about 12 hours. There were no personnel at the airport for us to communicate with, and our several attempts to call the customer service telephone number were in vain, as we would wait 20 minutes on hold only to be hung up on repeatedly. We therefore had to buy another flight through a different airline to ensure we arrived on time to our destination, to ensure all of our future flights, tours and hotels would not be missed. This was a monstrous inconvenience as we had not budgeted for an entire new flight. If we would have stayed and taken that flight, which we found out through Facebook later (because no one from WOW had responded to our multiple attempts to contact them via email, Facebook messenger, phone) had not arrived in Amsterdam until Thursday morning, a full day later, we would have completely missed our flight to Italy by nearly four hours. We did not receive any emails from them until Thursday, two days after our flight was supposed to leave, despite our numerous attempts through multiple means to contact them.

### "a good travel experience"
Amsterdam to Reykjavik. The first flight had a 6 hour delay, and this without any coupons for food etc on Schiphol. Onboard it was said it did not have enough food for everyone. However this budget airline offered full service on board, so drinks and food as long as available. The seats had enough leg room, plane clean and tidy. Apart from the delay it was a good travel experience.

### "never met anything as bad"
Flight was OK though delayed (this is apparently traditional for WOW). The serious problem occurred when my luggage was lost thus exposing me to the full glory of what WOW calls customer service. I have never met anything as bad. From waiting 36 minutes to contact the customer service line (and then being hung up on), to no customer service desks at KEF, to three separate channels of communication that do not appear to interest, to my inability to talk to a human being, the list goes on and on. Their greatest achievement to date has been to ask me to prove a negative. A bit on the lines of being ask to prove that I haven't seen an elephant today. Easy to say but impossible to prove. I assume that's deliberate.

### "never fly with them again"
Amsterdam to Baltimore via Keflavik. So many problems with this trip. First of all, both legs of the flight were delayed. At Keflavik airport I asked a representative of WoW if there would be an in-flight meal. She couldn't tell me (there wasn't). I noticed my boarding pass had no gate on it, so I asked a WOW rep which gate I should go to, and they told me the wrong gate. I nearly missed the flight; the only reason I made it was that they paged me over the intercom. Although I arrived at my destination, my luggage didn't. The next day I called, trying to find their policy on stipends (they are required by law to pay for some basic items if the luggage is delayed), and I was given the phone shuffle, for hours. I called BWI, and the WOW rep at BWI told me to call WOW's main number, and after being on hold for 30+ minutes, they'd tell me to call BWI back. This happened for the better part of an afternoon. Nobody could help me. My luggage did come after a few days, but I feel like they ripped me off. I will never fly with them again.

### "a miserable, long trip"
Frankfurt to Toronto via Reykjavik with WOW air. My experience was not great to say the least. My flight from Frankfurt was delayed by about an hour and unfortunately, I only had a 1 hour layover in Reykjavik. On board there was no entertainment, food and drinks - even water had to be paid for. Upon landing in Reykjavik we were still about an hour late, I was sure that I had missed my flight. The stewardess wished "all passengers with a final destination in the US or Canada" good luck making their flights. I rushed off the plane in the hopes of still catching the next flight, turns out that wasn't a problem at all as my second flight was over an hour late as well. After another miserable, long trip without entertainment, food, or drinks I finally landed in Toronto. Never again.

### "flight was delayed 20 hours"
Took a flight with WOW air in February 2016 from London Gatwick to Keflavik. Flight was delayed 20 hours. We were initially boarded before being advised of a small delay to add pressure into a tyre. Two hours later we were deboarded and advised that the tyre would need to be changed and they were looking for a replacement. Five hours waiting in the airport later, we were called to the main airport desk and told to collect luggage and follow a member of the Gatwick staff. There were no WOW air crew members or help desk attendants to provide any information. We were put in a room at the airport hotel and fed a really sad meal. I tried calling WOW air, and received an automated line saying they were only available during business hours on work days. Our flight was on a Saturday. No one at the airport or the hotel knew when we would be rescheduled, and I was unable to sleep that night. I heard a soft sound in our hotel room, and found that a piece of paper with new flight departure information was slipped under our door for a flight leaving at 5.40 am. No one called, no one knocked - I think half the plane missed the update. Next morning our flight was delayed a further 3 hours. We made it to Iceland in time to hire a car, drive the golden circle ourselves, and then fly back to London the next day. Complete waste of time.

### "flight was delayed 3.5 hours"
The WOW air flight was delayed 3.5 hours from Iceland to San Francisco. Did not tell us in advance. We were also delayed coming from Iceland to Frankfurt but luckily made it to Frankfurt on time. They lost about 30+ people's luggage while coming back from Iceland to SFO and now we are waiting on our luggage. I do not recommend taking this airline if you don't want to lose your luggage and have your flights delayed. We spent 24 hours in an airport just for our luggage to not be there.

### "wouldn't recommend this airline"
Baltimore to Paris via Keflavik. This trip was terrible. The flight was 4 hours late leaving Baltimore so we got to Iceland after any connections. The WOW desk gave me a ticket for Gatwick, London but no info on Paris. Gatwick was closed so we diverted to Stansted. Stayed on the plane almost 2 hours waiting for them to re-open and to re-fuel. If there ever was a connection (they said we would get that on arrival) we missed it plus there was no one at the WOW desk! It was about 9 PM. A lady from Aviator helped us with food coupons and finally told us that we had places at a hotel in London, cabs to get there - and that WOW would contact us in the morning either by e-mail or messages at the front desk. No messages came to any of us; hotel desk said nothing received. Calls to the WOW help desk were met mostly with waiting, waiting, waiting. Finally one passenger got through and was told, basically, to get his own way to Paris. So we did! Had to pay out of pocket! They also lost our luggage. It arrived the afternoon before I had to leave. They had a nice plane; attendants friendly; I had enough room. Meal purchased was not worth the money. But the Infrastructure to help stranded passengers was non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this airline to my enemy!

### "can't believe how bad this trip is"
Extremely poorly run airline with every shortcut taken to avoid airline expenditure. 100% of four flight legs delayed 1.5 to 3 hours to/from Europe/USA. Layover in Iceland consists of hundreds of other Wow passengers in tiny terminal waiting for their delayed flights. Staff unfriendly and not helpful. Severe baggage limit, outlandish prices onboard to buy even water on transatlantic 9 hr flight, no blanket or pillow while cabin kept very cold; seats with minimal cushion; no entertainment system. Absolutely no positive WOW moment on this trip, only "Wow, I can't believe how bad this trip is".

### WOW air customer review
San Francisco to Keflavik with WOW air, The experience was an absolute nightmare. Our flight was delayed by 27 hours. At first the customer support line didn't even ring - it just hung up on you. Later in the day, after alternate flights had left already, the customer service line allowed you to wait for an hour to talk to someone, who of course could do nothing to help you. Since they only have one aircraft to serve the route, our delayed flight the next day was outsourced to some sort of charter operation, so we were eventually loaded onto an unmarked A340 that had been in storage. This plane was completely gutted for storage (i.e. no paper towels) and was only loaded with one water bottle and a prepackaged food item (sandwich or pasta salad container) per person before the 7 hour flight. Needless to say the outdated entertainment system didn't work, but also the reading lights and even the attendant call buttons were inoperative. Upon arriving in Reykjavik, of course there was no gate for us so we were bussed to the terminal. No big deal - however then the entire plane load of people waited over 2 hours before the bags showed up. There was not a single person from Wow air at Reykjavik who had any idea what was going on - or cared for that matter. Their answer to any customer complaint is "we're a discount airline, so we can't help you". We did fly on an actual Wow plane on the return trip (delayed of course), and it was barebones, but comfortable. My wife and I were traveling to Iceland to celebrate my 50th birthday, and this is my lifetime worst interaction with a company where I paid money in exchange for a product or service. Their treatment of customers crosses the line from merely inconveniencing you, to the point where you really feel victimized.

### "eight hours at the airport"
My flight to KEF on Thursday 24 June 2016 was scheduled to leave at 12.40 pm. I arrived at the airport early (since it was an international flight) around 8.30 am, only to find out when I arrived that the flight was delayed until 2.30 pm. I didn't receive an email or notification regarding this delay. The service desk didn't even open until 10.30 am. When it approached 2.30 pm, we heard another announcement that the flight would be delayed even further due to "security" reasons. We didn't take off until a little after 4.00 pm. We arrived at KEF around 8.00 am. Naturally, I missed my connecting flight to CDG, but they couldn't put us on a flight to there until nearly 4.00 pm - eight hours at the airport on top of having us wait at LAX the day before for hours and all they gave me was a $24 voucher for food. I was supposed to arrive at CDG around 11.00 am on Friday, and we didn't arrive until close to 10.00 pm. Just when things couldn't get worse, they lost the luggage for myself and the majority of folks who flew with me from both LAX and KEF. By the time I submitted my lost baggage report, the metro was closed and I had to spend 50 euros for a taxi.

### "amount of leg room is good"
Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Keflavik. I booked this trip in April because of the price difference with other airline company's. Checking in was flawless and quick. Everyone on the plane was professional and US airlines could learn a lot from them. The amount of leg room is good and the planes were new. We bought our food at LAX airport and drinks to buy onboard are available. Not having any entertainment on board is inconvenient for an 8hr flight.

### "worst airline ever dealt with"
Worst airline ever dealt with and I do a lot of traveling. I used them from San Francisco to Iceland, than to Paris (supposed to be Ireland) and back. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and the day before our departure to Ireland (from Iceland) they said the flight was delayed by way of email. However, this was a mistake and the email was incorrect. As a result we missed our flight and they said they could fly us somewhere else because that flight was not leaving for another two days. They refused to put us up in a local hotel until our next flight and left us fending for ourselves. They were delayed on every flight. They lost our luggage at one point and four others who were there to do a seven day hike. I could on further with their mishaps but won't. The saving grace was the airport associates were helpful in this matter. However, they were limited as to what they could help us with. WOW does not have there own help desk at the airport even though they are an Iceland airline. Spend a little extra money and take another airline.

### "WOW air is just not worth it"
Traveled with WOW air from Los Angeles to Copenhagen via Reykjavik. This was my first time with the airline and I can surely say that it will also be my last. When I booked the tickets the price was about 20% below comparable pricing from the other major airlines, and even though I had never heard of WOW before I went ahead and booked the ticket. I didn't realize that WOW is a total budget airline in the spirit of Ryanair and other bare bones carriers but was soon to find it. When I checked in online I was surprised to find that I couldn't select a seat (you will have to pay a premium to do this during the ticket purchasing process) and I was assigned a seat on the very last row with barely any recline. I checked in online and printed out a boarding pass. When boarding the plane at LAX my boarding pass was refused and I was reassigned another seat after everybody else had boarded and after the ground staff had been on call with the WOW call center for more than 30 min. The flight ended up being about 2 hours delayed because they were waiting for "paperwork to be completed" so I barely made my connecting flight in Reykjavik while having to run through the gates. There is absolutely no service inside the plane, no entertainment system of any kind and no food or drink service unless you pay for it. You have but 2 buttons at your seat - one for reclining your seat and another for turning the reading light on and off. I finally arrived in Copenhagen and immediately decided to pay for seat reservations to avoid problems on my flight back to LAX, but the WOW air reservation system again failed to reserve the seats - even after charging my credit card. After being on hold for 30 minutes I finally reached a customer service agent who was able to get the seats correctly assigned to me. The basic tickets are cheap but you end up paying an additional $200 or so just for seats and luggage (WOW only allows 5kg/11pounds of free carry on) so my advice it to pay a bit more and go with a regular airline - WOW air is just not worth it.

### "delay was over 4 hours"
Flew Keflavik to Baltimore. I will say nothing more in favor of this airline than the fact that their stewardesses are friendly and the plane got me from point a to point b. My outbound flight was delayed 2.5 hours for no reason anyone could elaborate on, even though the plane and crew were present. On the return flight my delay was over 4 hours with again no obvious reason how they fell so behind in the first place. This discontent seemed to be echoed by everyone on the plane who had nothing going bad bad stories of delays and cancelations. Never again will I fly with WOW air, but opt for the more expensive option such as Delta/KLM/Lufthansa.

### "no one made any announcement"
Simple non-stop flight from Los Angeles to Keflavik - never took off. Flight delayed, from what I understand from my travel agent, not the airline, 23 hours. Arrived at LAX at 6.30 for a flight that was to leave at 12.40pm. Looked at the flight board with delays, etc. The flight, WOW 174 on scheduled for 12.40pm June 21 was delayed until 8.40pm. No emails or text or calls made by the airline to me or my agent. Called my agent to let her know as I was going to arrive too late for a $500 tour scheduled for 4 hours after arrival. This is when she got on the phone to find out what was going on as no one from WOW air was at Bradley Terminal to assist passengers at that time. My agent was on hold for one full hour with a lost connection at 60 minutes. Reconnected with WOW and on hold for yet another hour. Once she was connected, she found out not only was the flight delayed, but it was delayed until 11.10 or thereabouts with an explanation that the WOW takeoff runway somewhere in Great Britain was under an emergency that they had no control over. I got this information as I was standing on line to "check in" with other passengers who were unaware of the delay. People only found out about the delays as they approached to check in counter. Staff looked stressed but some were smiling and being very pleasant. However, no one from WOW made any announcement about the delay or offered any assistance to help passengers connect with other airlines so they could be on their way. Apparently, WOW has no relationship with other carriers to reduce the problem. I was given a refund promise through my agent who said WOW Customer service told me to ask for the refund at the check-in counter. That was denied. My agent spoke to the Business Agent by phone to let him know what WOW management had told her and he said he couldn't do that, but my agent persisted and they did the transaction right there and it should be processed in another few days. So I didn't get my vacation as planned. When I got home, there was delayed emails and the flight was delayed until 1.30 the following day.

### "experience a complete nightmare"
This was the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. Flight 24 hours delayed without any prior notice - the 300 passengers found out about the delay at SFO upon arrival. No WOW air personnel on the ground in SFO, no clarity about new boarding passes or compensation. Next days flight hit another 3 hour delay, adding up to 27 hours total. In Reykjavik air traffic control issued a strike, which added 3 hours of in-plane waiting. And upon arrival in Amsterdam it turned out none of the passengers checked bags were there. Overall experience a complete nightmare. Never again!

### "customer service desks were abandoned"
We were flying from BWI to Paris with a connecting flight in Iceland. We were told all connecting flights out of Iceland the following day was cancelled and was not given a reason why or told when the next flight out would be. The flight was delayed 2 hours. We arrived in Iceland, and All the WOW customer service desks were abandoned, and 800 was not answering calls. They had a man with a list of people to take to a hotel 2 hours away and he did not know when the next flight out would be. We were left with no choice but to book a flight with Icelandair that left at 4:15 that day and they only had business class, costing us $1600 for 2 tickets! I filed a claim with WOW, and was told 10-14 weeks to resolve and still no reason for cancellation which I need to submit to my travel insurance.

### "no free entertainment"
Paris to Los Angeles via Reykjavik with WOW air. The flight from Paris was 1,5 hr delayed, so my fiance barely made it on his connecting flight to Los Angeles. However, his checked-in luggage had been removed from the plane by then. On an international flight lasting 10 hours they do not offer food or even water, well, unless you pay for it. No free entertainment, either. My fiance was looking for his lost luggage for 6 days, and when it finally arrived, it was missing items.

### "worst airline I had experienced"
The worst airline I had experienced. I was supposed to travel on June 19th from Baltimore, with a connection via Keflavik to Paris. I was supposed to travel to Paris but after a twelve hour delay I finally I was abandoned in London. Also my luggage was lost and so far hasn't been found I was told by airline that there would be an agent to help me to book my trip from London to Paris nobody showed up. I had to take a train to travel to from London to Paris. It wasn't only me there bunch of other passengers with me different destinations in Europe who ended up being abandoned in London.

### "cancelled, lack of information"
They promised to make me feel a wow experience and they did - the worst experience that I have ever had with an airline! Flight cancelled, lack of information, not enough vouchers to have a real meal in the airport. They do not show the capacity to have an alternative when something fails. They had the whole afternoon to look for other combination flight, but no way. I am still in Iceland hopefully I will fly this afternoon, but who knows. The worst is that I  missed a day of my life and all the plans done for San Francisco.

### "one of the worst flight experience"
Keflavik to San Francisco with WOW Air. One of the worst flight experience I've had. Disorganized, fraught with cancellations, late departures and arrivals. If you need to be some place on time or a certain day, this is not the airline to take. I chose the airline because of a family emergency as it was a direct flight to Iceland. Never again.

### "flight was delayed both directions"
Flew WOW air from Keflavik to Boston. I usually do not write reviews but let me tell you this: 1) You get what you pay for, nothing, that's right - not even water is free. 2) Wow does not announce over the loudspeaker in the airport the status of your flight. When asked why this was, they lied about the announcement. Both directions the flight status was delayed and not announced. 3) Very cramped seating arrangements. 4) Do not fly WOW air if you have a connecting flight. Our flight was delayed both directions by several hours causing a missed connecting flight on another airline. Ended up costing more than a flight on Icelandair would have cost.

### "such terrible service"
I have never experienced such terrible service and such a bad airline. It started out with our outbound journey. It was delayed over 3 hours and we were sat in BWI for 6 hours. Which by the way is a terrible airport with no facilities. I was traveling with a 14 month old child and there was no where in the terminal to nurse her. As boarding I was told to leave my baby stroller at the gate area and not the aircraft which I questioned. I was told for a second time to leave it by the gate and it would be taken down to the aircraft. The stroller did not make it to my final destination and I had no stroller for my baby. I was told it was left in BWI and now lost! I still do not have it and it is an expensive $350 stroller. Next journey home. We left KEF about 20 mins late - not bad I was thinking. Then 30 minutes into our flight we had to turn around and come back to KEF due to a mechanical issue with the plane. We were deplaned and stuck in KEF for 4 hours. There was no communication from the ground staff during this delay and it was handled very poorly. The service desk was telling people individually about the situation, but no announcement was made to everyone in the gate/ terminal until the end when we were ready to board. Five minutes before boarding we were told to line up by the service desk and get a meal voucher for 1000 Icelandic Kroner. As soon as we lined up for the voucher the boarding announcement was made. There was only one person handing out the vouchers while others watched and it took forever. Once on the plane they started the food and beverage service. We were on row 11. When they got to me there was no food left! We were traveling with a 14 month old baby and there was no food for her on an almost 6 hour flight. She had not been able to eat all day with all the delays. KEF airport had no food for us to buy either with the fridge with the sandwiches totally emptied out and zero food available. Fortunately one flight attendant gave my daughter a small tray of fruit taken from her own crew meal. WOW needs to correct their SOP's - why does WOW have no regard for babies and young children? They should be offered food before anyone else. As people at the front eat just fine, while the rest of us had to wait until we got home. As there was no food left I was unable to use my 3,000 Kroner worth of vouchers for the three of us. We landed and guess what no stroller! For a second time. WOW had lost my first stroller so we were forced to buy a second when we were in the UK and now WOW lost the replacement also. So WOW managed to inconvenience me seriously on both flights. I obviously will not be traveling with this airline or using KEF as a transfer location ever again. It is no cheaper than other airlines when you factor in the high baggage and food costs. Just do yourself a favor and fly with another established airlines.

### "crew were professional, friendly"
My family flew WOW air from Toronto to Reykjavik (return) in May 2016. It was our first time flying with this airline. Online reviews we had read about were not positive, but we decided to try it when an excellent seat sale came up for May. Now we went in with 'low' expectations - we knew there would be no complimentary food, beverage, or entertainment. Well, we really enjoyed our experience (both segments) because of the following: 1) Our airplane was waiting for us at the gate when we arrived fairly early at Pearson Airport Toronto. 2) We boarded on schedule and in an orderly manner. 3) The flight crew were professional, friendly and spoke impeccable English. 4) The seating was not super spacious but was fine. 5) Our flight was smooth and we landed a little late but well within expectations. The return trip was the same experience: on-time, professional crew, smooth flight. Couple of additional comments: the food that was offered was pricey but that was expected and we brought our own food. The flight was over 5 hours both ways but we brought our own entertainment. The seating was 3 seats on either side of the aisle, which we were fine with. We flew direct, so did not have a connecting experience to share. Our two kids (9,12) were fine with the flights, which usually means we have a good time. We will definitely fly with WOW air again.

### "not flying with WOW air again"
London Gatwick to Montreal via Keflavik with WOW air. We were delayed and given zero information. The cabin crew knew nothing. Those of us with transfers spent the whole flight worrying. When we got to Keflavik we had to run through the terminal because they had posted 'last call' on our transfers. It was all very uncessesary and poor. I wiil not be flying with WOW air again.

### "same amount as a standard airline"
Baltimore to Paris via Keflavik. You might believe you are saving money by flying WOW air since they are a budget airline, but with all the extra fees, you'll end up spending the same amount as a standard airline. They charge $70 per checked bag for international flights, don't allow you to select seats in advance without paying, no food provided, no entertainment on the plane, and the seats are as smaller than a typical domestic flight. To top off the horrible price and seats, I experienced the worst landing on our way back to BWI. I fly once a month so I'm no stranger to turbulence but on landing we went sideways! The entire trip we had very bad turbulence.

### "never recommend this airline"
The flight from Boston was fine. Landed in Keflavik and changed planes. Fifteen minutes into the flight over the Atlantic the Captain told us we had to return to Keflavik. Small problem we were told. Appreciating the interest in our safety was fine it was after we returned and were given no information from WOW without having to track them down. We never did see a WOW representative. The young lady who was trying said her company just represents WOW and that she could not call WOW because they were in town and it was too hard to get ahold of them. Our flight was scheduled for 6:20 at 9:30 we were told they rescheduled us for a 3:30 take off. They had total disregard for those who would miss their European connections as it was not their problem. I missed a play which I had paid for and it was not their problem. Planes break I get that but the lack of customer care was astounding. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. It’s cheap but I guess you get what you pay for! Think twice before you book your flight.

### "definitely fly with them again"
It used to be that the cheapest flights round trip to Iceland would run you 1800$ RT, with WOW Air we were able to get return flights from Boston for 230$ return - I like the snarkiness bit of flare that can be seen throughout their airline, plenty of power outlets. If you're used to carrying a lot of baggage, it may be the same price to go with another airline like IcelandAir, etc. We paid 98$ for two checked bags for each leg. - We were only able to get the cheap deal on the tickets by going to Wow's website and couldn't get a reasonable price having a connecting ticket from Chicago. In so, we had to buy separate RT tickets from Chicago to Boston incurring the risk that if there was enough of a flight delay we would eat the cost (I booked our flights into and out of Boston with almost a day of leeway, resulting in a lot of down time at the Boston Airport - it is not the greatest airport to have down time). Our tickets with United ran us 180 (or 160? ), we would received two free checked bags with United since we're part of their loyalty program, so we chose to go with them for their second set of tickets despite their prices being slightly higher than the competition. - No inflight entertainment/wifi - utilize those power outlets! We had no issues with our flights to and from Boston to Reykjavik. I noticed upon booking our tickets that they only allow 1 carry on bag and that has to weigh 5 kg (11lbs) or less. Not your standard carry on bag and a "personal item (laptop bag, purse, etc. ), but you are allowed only 1 carry on bag. This is all listed on their website. You also have to pay for any checked bags. It is cheaper to pay for any additional bags (to be allowed to have a larger carry on, a checked bag, etc.) in advance (at least 24 hours) than at the counter. There were three of us (my husband, brother, and me) so we opted to pay for two checked bags between us, and we all just carried a simple bag between the three of us as our carry ons. When we were in line to check in on our flight from Boston to Reykjavik, we noticed that a huge issue most people had was not realizing they couldn't bring their standard carry-ons and checked bags without any additional fees (they would say, "We always have done this with no issue!"). We only paid 99$ for our trip to Keflavik and 129$ for our flight back to Boston (we had bought return tickets with United to connect us from Chicago to Boston), so I think it's perfectly reasonable to pay extra for all of that other stuff. I can understand the negative reviews regarding flight changes and delays - but that can happen with any airline. Wow Air is a small company with comparatively smaller staff (our flight attendants were on all of the brochures!) with cheap prices. I will most definitely fly with them again.

### "less expensive for same dates"
I had a good experience with WOW air from Baltimore Washington to Berlin Schönefeld return via Keflavik. All flights were on time. A321 is narrow body but seats are more comfortable than many US airlines economy seats. WOW air has no complimentary in-flight service or amenities, and no on board airline entertainment or WiFi. One carry-on bag limit (5 kg/11 lb) is strictly enforced. Prepay for checked luggage and seat assignment. My WOW air fare was $500 less expensive than full service airlines for the same dates.

### "abruptness and rudeness"
Keflavik to Boston with WOW Air. The only good thing about this airline was the fact we got off. Budget cannot be used in a lower context with WOW air. The worst part was that the staff are rude, abrasive and don't appear to respect the customer. This translates to abruptness and rudeness for the customer and in my case, haggling over bolt on fees they could try and charge me at check in (clearly the myriad of hidden costs on their website isn't enough)! With the hidden fees, this airline isn't all that cheaper and doesn't compensate for the rudeness encountered, I would have preferred to pay a little more for better service!

### "the worst airline ever"
Baltimore Washington to Keflavik. I have travelled the world in all classes and at sixty years old can safely say this is the worst airline ever. Budget doesn't even cover the poor service, unreliable flights, cramped quarters, and limited food options. Understaffed from desk to cabin. I will never fly WOW again. There is too much competition in price, destinations, and options to suffer this again.

### "very unreliable airline"
WOW air flight to Keflavik was delayed by an hour and the return flight was delayed by 6 hours. I can understand delays happen, but I have no idea why they didn't attempt to make contact with passengers if there is a significant delay. The flight was a 6.45am flight, meaning we were at the airport at 4.45am, the flight was delayed till 12.10pm then again to 12.40pm - am yet to find out if it will delayed yet again! No explanation was provided, instead were told to step aside and wait for an announcement while they request some vouchers for the inconvenience. For the 6+ hour delay, each passenger was offered a 1000 (krona) coupon to be used in the airport or onboard, this wasn't even enough for a coffee and muffin. Other passengers and myself were less than thrilled with this, will never fly with this company again. Poor service and very unreliable airline. Stay clear, its not worth your time!

### "get exactly what you pay"
The price was right, $300 round trip Boston to Copenhagen via Iceland but quite often you get exactly what you pay for. They keep cancelling or changing your flights without first contacting you to discuss option. You just get an e-mail telling you another date of departure. Also very rude reservation agents. I was trying to book a flight back to Boston, after they rescheduled on me 3 times. They were not very helpful and did not want to resolve the problem and hung up the phone on me. This is not the first time that this airline is hanging up the phone on customers. I have heard that this is happening quite often. If you have to be in a certain palce at a certain time this is not the airline you should be looking at. This airline is only good if you have alot of time on your hands and you are not in a hurry to get home. Extremely disappointed in their customer service. You have to pay for your suitcases and carry on. No food on board, but you can purchase. You have to bring your own blanket. They do not supply anything. It is just the bare bones. You just have to make sure you have extra days in case they cancel on you.

### "had no problem whatsoever"
I was hesitant about flying with WOW air, never flown a low-cost carrier before but was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. Really nice plane from Baltimore to Iceland. I didn't upgrade seats but had enough room and power outlets. I found the flight staff really friendly and helpful. I weighed all my luggage before arriving at the airport and had no problem whatsoever. Any problems were the fault of the airports (I'm looking at you Terminal 3 at CDG), 8/10 for price and overall experience.

### "live and learn"
Major blizzard on the east coast. Every other airline that flies here waived penalty fees for changes. Not WOW air. They got their aircraft in and out and were not the least bit concerned that no one could get to BWI to catch the flight. So, either pay the $86 fee or abandon the ticket. Clearly their goal is to make as much money as possible in the short run, no matter how much it costs them in the long run. Should have read the reviews here before booking. But, live and learn.

### "horrified by WOW air"
My review is a repeat of countless frustrated flyers with WOW air. I wish I had read them before I bought my tickets! Departed Baltimore over seven hours late. Passengers were given no explanation by ground staff. After our aircraft arrived, those with connections were told we would have to stay in Reykjavik for the night. During the flight from BWI there was nothing offered to eat or drink, passengers understood it was food for purchase, the attendants claimed there was nothing aboard the plane. Upon landing in Iceland a few lucky passengers near the front of the plane were given a bottle of water. Ground staff were unspeakably rude and careless. I requested a seat on one of several flights leaving for London within a few hours - and was denied. I requested a refund for the London section of my flight to put toward a seat with another carrier leaving in a few hours - and was denied. The hotel was a disgrace, finally arrived in London the next day exhausted, unsettled and horrified by WOW air and their treatment of their passengers. I frequently fly and am no stranger to budget flying, and this was awful. I read some of the other reviews that warn you to stay away from this airline. If you are lucky enough to be reading this before booking your flight, then great.

### "service is what you expect"
I flew WOW air from Amsterdam to Reykjavik and back. The cabin crew and airport staff were friendly and both flights were on time. The plane we flew in on the way back seemed new. The tickets were cheap and the service is what you expect from a budget airline : you pay for luggage and all food and drinks on board.

### "expect them to be reasonable"
Baltimore Washington to Keflavik. I accidentally purchased an overhead bag instead of a checked bag. Called them and asked to pay the extra amount for the checked bag and was told that it was nonrefundable and that I would have to purchase a second costly bag. Was told "those are the rules" as though nobody could do anything about it. I asked for a supervisor and was given an email - she hasn't even had the decency to respond after 5 days! One can accept their nickle and diming but I would expect them to be reasonable and at the very least to be courteous and responsive! Completely unacceptable!

### "worst customer service"
London Gatwick to Boston via Reykavik with WOW air, and the absolute worst customer service I have experienced. Flights were never on time and hidden fees were obscene - $5 for a cup of water on a transatlantic flight? Fly Icelandair or Norwegian air instead. Similar pricing and they value their customers and their money.

### "the worst customer service"
My flight was cancelled 2 hours before departure. I was heading to a family funeral and had to pay $1000 for another flight on a different airline to get there on time. I am still waiting 4 months later for my refund with no luck yet. Probably the worst customer service I have ever come across. I'm so frustrated and angry and disappointed.

### "never choose again"
Will never choose WOW air again. My flight from London Gatwick to Iceland Keflavik was more than 24 hrs delayed and because of that I missed a day tour which was not refundable. And the bagging regulation was really really strict. Saw some people were not charged the bagging policy. Although the price was comparatively cheap, it might cause a lot of troubles which will not be worthy when you calculate at the end. So I do not recommend .

### "customer service was non-existent"
Flew Reykjavik to Berlin with WOW air. No on-line check-in, only 2 agents on duty. One hour prior to departure, still 100 people on line. Surly agents arguing, very noisy and confrontational. My turn finally, my carry-on bag was OK but told I could not take my purse. Would not let me put my purse into my bag. Made me pay $70 again to check bag and to keep my purse. Tried for a refund but customer service was non-existent. Not low cost, big $$ grab, they even charge for water on board.

### "get what you pay for"
Expect delays. You truly get what you pay for with WOW air. Terrible delays each way from BWI to KEF, on the way to Iceland the plane had to stop on a military base in Newfoundland and refuel for three hours. Staff did not keep us updated nor did they at least offer some water. On way back, the plane sat on tarmac for an hour before leaving and upon arriving at BWI experienced another malfunction and couldn't let us off the plane. Cabin crew left us standing in the aisles for nearly an hour. With this type of service, I imagine WOW will not be in business for long.

### "not be flying this airline again"
Boston to London Gatwick via Reykjavik. My WOW air ticket to London through Iceland was reasonably priced and I was excited about the airline, thinking I got a good deal. I had a small backpack and a carry-on size suitcase with me. I have never had problems taking these two items on the plane with me as carry ons before. When I got to check in in Boston, they told me it would $50 to take the bag with me, or $80 to check it. I paid $50. I didn't have any trouble getting from Iceland to London, or back from London to Iceland. I had paid for my carry-on online, which cost me $45 for the way back. On my flight from Iceland to Boston, they stopped me as I was boarding the plane and said I could only have one carry-on bag. This is ridiculous, I had already flown this airline 3 time and paid close to $100 with these bags. After arguing for a while, I was charged another $45 to check the bag. All in all I paid close to $150 for carry-on luggage. And not to mention they charged for all food and drink, including water on the plane. These were international flights. Don't be fooled by their 'cheap' pricing. I will not be flying this airline again anytime soon.

### "wonderful flight each way"
Boston to Keflavik return with WOW air, and paid $247 return including taxes. We carried 11lbs or under and managed quite well for a week in Iceland. Seats were comfortable, staff lovely. So we paid for no extra frills and had a wonderful flight each way. Cannot wait to fly WOW to Dublin next time.

### "never fly again with WOW air"
Deep disappointment with the service I received on October 18 2015 from a flight Paris to Baltimore with WOW air. I checked-in in Paris where I was told I could carry my small carry on and back-pack for the flight. I had already paid the extra-kg required (ie. 12 kg) online when I booked the flight. Since my carry on was 10 kg, a very helpful  lady in Paris told me I was perfectly fine for the flight, meaning carrying these two pieces of luggage. To my surprise, when boarding in Reykjavik towards Baltimore two WOW air staff told me I could only take one piece with me in a very aggressive and impolite manner. I tried explaining the situation and the misinformation that apparently I’d received in Paris. I asked if I could pay just for the difference of checking-in one luggage and paying for extra kg for carry-on. I was very rudely informed that this wasn’t possible. I ended up trying to fit everything in my small carry on, which I managed to do expect for the empty back-pack. WOW air staff didn’t let me take this empty back pack, and yet again in the most rude and offensive way I had seen before I was told I needed to pay. So, I ended up leaving behind a book and precious back pack. The behavior of staff was obnoxious, they were threatening with closing the flights. Two things I gathered from this unpleasant experience: Rules are not applied equally across airports/staff and passengers: all WOW air ground staff should be well informed about the airline rules. I am still not sure which is the right rule, however it is not fair for the passenger who is receiving misleading information. I was trying to collaborate and understand the rules without being ripped off. Moreover, I witnessed certain passengers boarding with two pieces without being stopped by the ground staff. I find this a discriminatory treatment. During all my years flying around the world (including lowcost companies) I had never been treated with such disrespect and unprofessionalism. The staff in Reyjkavik didn’t want to tell me their names, otherwise I would have stated their full names here. This was my second experience flying with WOW air, the first time was in June 2015 to Reyjkavik. I had an okay experience that time, reason why I decided to fly again. I am now certain I will never fly again with WOW air.

### "will not save you money"
You will not save money with WOW air. They charged $134 each way for one checked bag (you have to pay for each leg). Also, we paid for a checked bag, then realized we would have to go through customs in Paris if we did, so we asked to have it adjusted to a carry on (which they charge through the nose for). They were unwilling, saying we had to just lose our money. Do not fall for their bargain fares. It will not save you money. You are charged an extra fee for seats. Every single seat on the aircraft has an extra charge!

### "seats reasonably comfortable"
Our flight from London Gatwick to BWI via Keflavik was basically ontime. The airline is basic - you pay for everything; including water. Bring food and water. Our connection at Kevlavik was too short to buy anything. But that's what you sign up for ahead of time; it's why the prices are low. Seats were reasonably comfortable, inflight staff fine. No WIFI, which they should remedy. WOW doesn't have service folks in London, so all big issues must be by phone or online, unavailable on weekends. However we had a medical emergency just before boarding a previously scheduled WOW flight so didn't fly. A WOW air person helped at that time, and arranged for bags to be removed etc. 6 hrs later back at Gatwick, frustrated by info provided by Gatwick folks to retrieve bags, we were redirected to WOW. Lucky for us, the same person (who'd been at work since 4:30) happened to be there checking folks in. He remembered us and took the time to personally escort my husband through security/customs/baggage retrieval to get our bags. Excellent customer service appreciated by these by then exhausted travelers. WOW 3 days later, FYI, was still by far the least expensive ticket home.

### "they are a horrid little airline"
We flew 4 flights in a 10-day period on WOW Air. Overall, it was a severely disappointing experience with 3 of the 4 flights delayed by more than 2 hours. (The only explanation given each time was that the plane was delayed.) The flight out of Boston experienced a strange boarding experience, where half the plane was loaded, and then, inexplicably, they asked everyone to stop boarding and exit the plane. No staffers gave any explanation to the passengers, and all the passengers were stuck in a tiny holding area between the gate check-in desk and the jet bridge. After 20 minutes of waiting - still no explanation from any staffer. Only when we started boarding again and were on the plane did a flight attendant explain what happened. What horrible communication. That flight out of Boston was delayed 2 hours. The flight to London was on-time because it left in the morning. However, although told to arrive 2 hours before your flight, WOW Air only staffs its ticket counter with a single person early in the morning (4:45 am). At 5:10 am, 2 additional staffers came on to help out. That means WOW basically is okay with you waiting for nearly 30 minutes in line for no reason, since the one staffer obviously can't ticket an entire plane full of passengers. This was just poor service and communication - don't tell customers to arrive 2 hours early if you don't have staff until 90 minutes before the plane leaves. The flight back to Iceland from London was delayed 2 hours, again with no explanation. The flight back to Boston was delayed for 3 hours, with no explanation. The person at the ticket desk was rude and never apologized to us for the delay either. So 75 percent of our flights were late. And not just "a little" late - but 2 or 3 hours late (time spent in everyone's favorite place - the airport!). The flights were okay, except you are packed like sardines on the plane (very little leg room). Two of the four flights also experienced an odd landing. The first landing was fine, but then about halfway down the runway, the pilot slammed on the brakes and suddenly swerved right. No explanation was given by the pilot for this unusual behavior. The second flight (coming back into Boston) also experienced a similar unexpected, hard braking after landing. Again, with no explanation or apology by the pilot. Apparently some of the rules of WOW Air is to say as little as possible, offer no explanations, and don't apologize for their treatment of you. When I complained about one of these incidents to their twitter feed, they did apologize - but that's one of the few apologies I ever got from them. All in all, we flew WOW to give them a try (given their low airfares). They had 4 chances, and blew them all with us. We will never fly them again, nor recommend them, and warn all of our friends and colleagues to steer well clear of them. They are a horrid little airline.

### "all WOW flights were delayed"
Boston to Keflavik return. Don't believe WOW's slogan of Iceland’s most punctual airline. All WOW flights on September 30th from Keflavik to all destinations were delayed, most by at least 3 hours. It was the only airline that day which had delays. All others left on time. Because the airline send their email announcing their delay only 4 hours before the flight (even though they know when planes are leaving Europe or the US what the delay will be), we were already on the way to the airport (taking the bus). So now we will sit at the airport for 5 hours instead of having a few more hours in Reykjavik. Flying to Keflavik from Boston a week earlier, our flight was also delayed - this time by almost 4 hours - and when I asked in the plane for the reason of the delay, I was told that due to a medical emergency two days earlier, all subsequent flights have been delayed. I spent over 7 hours at Logan airport. Being presumably a cheap airline, although most tickets are not cheap, you do not get any food, any drink, no blanket, no in flight entertainment, the seats have no headrests.

### "WOW air lost our luggage"
We travelled WOW air back from Boston to London via Keflavik after attending a wedding. WOW air lost our luggage for which we had to actually pay to check in etc as WOW air do not allow any free checked in luggage. More than a month has passed and we are still waiting for an acknowledgement of this. We sent a letter by registered post and still no reply. We have travelled widely and have never lost our luggage. The flight was comfortable, and we knew we would not be served any free food so we were prepared - although a transatlantic flight should have at least a drink of water.

### "biggest problem was checking in"
My biggest problem was in checking in. I had a small suitcase (10 Kgs) and a backpack. I was told my pocketbook, which is an average size, was oversized and had to fit into my backpack. It was not oversized. I would never put my pocketbook in the overhead compartment (where I planned to put my backpack), so it was removed once in the plane - just a stupid rule that has no real value. They also made me put my laptop in my suitcase. I was underweight (suitcase and carryon) yet I was being asked to pay $18 because my carry on was over the max. Made a lot of noise and charge was dropped. On return, flight delayed one hour at a time from 3pm to about 6pm and then told flight was canceled. We were not told there would be accommodation, so we almost missed that option. We were finally offered a lovely hotel in old Reykjavik and a fabulous dinner at Restaurant Reykjavik. They more than made up for the extra overnight in Iceland. Then offered $11 voucher for breakfast - that was a joke.

### "pay the extra go Icelandair"
I hope people who haven't heard of WOW air get to read this. I looked into some reviews on this airline and they weren't all the great. I was looking for a cheap flight with enough leg room (6'5") that's it. Which they provide. A istent complaint in most reviews I read was that they are constantly delayed or cancel flights. I thought I could sneak through without incident, but I didn't. We were delayed about 2.5 hours before they cancelled the flight. They set us up in a hotel for the night, and gave us a good voucher for the next morning equal to less than $12. Anyone who has been to Iceland can realize how little that really is. There was very poor communication between the airline and people on the flight, and no real protocol for situations like this, which, as I have read, happens often. Pay the extra go Icelandair, or whoever else goes to Iceland.

### "clean, enough leg space, reclinable seats"
New aircraft, clean, enough leg space, reclinable seats. The staff was very friendly, service-oriented and professional. The outbound connection from KEF to SFX was no problem, since they use the same plane from BOS to SFX. The return connection from KEF to BOS at 15:35 could have been made, but was cancelled due to a technical problem on the plane supposed to serve that leg. The flight then was postponed to the next morning 6:30. Customers were compensated with a night in a 4 star hotel + dinner in Reykjavik. After the cancellation had been announced, everything was set within 30min. The morning flight then departed in time without further interruptions.

### "Cabin crew was friendly, easy-going"
Flew to Reykjavik from London return trip. Check-in went smoothly, they don't really pay attention to the weight and size of every piece of luggage like many low cost airlines do. The flight was smooth and the pilots give useful information about the flight. Cabin crew was friendly, easy-going and accomodating. They even told us on the microphone we might see northern lights from our plane! Only thing is we have to pay extra for any food or beverage, but well, that's a low cost airline.

### WOW air customer review
First time flying with WOW and no complaints. Practice due diligence. All information is on web site and fees obvious during purchasing process. Price of our flights with 1 checked bag, seat assignments, and travel insurance (purchased due to family situations) was still half of BA's price. Using a travel scale prevents additional fees. Walked directly from arrival gate to departure gate at KEF without going through passport control. Will definitely consider for future flights. WOW fills transatlantic void left by Icelandair departure from BWI.

### WOW air customer review
First time flying with WOW and it was great. If you want luxury, free meals and pampering, this flight is not for you. The tickets are cheap after that you have to pay for everything luggage, food, seats, but it really isn't bad,. If you are all about traveling light, saving money and getting there book WOW. I would book with them again, you want to be able to save your money for your destination and not on the plane.

### WOW air customer review
Travelling with WOW air was a stressful experience. A few days before leaving Copenhagen, I discovered by coincidence that the checked luggage was not included in the price. Something WOW air didn't care to mention at any point when I first bought the ticket. I had to pay an additional 100 USD, which erased the savings compared to other airlines. Next stressful element came in Copenhagen Airport after check-in. Plane was delayed three hours, no explanation, and I would miss my connecting flight from Reykjavik to Boston. To be fair, they got me on a plane from Icelandair and I caught my next flight. But it took several phone calls to WOW air, an immense lack of information and a fantastic effort by the SAS staff in Copenhagen to make that happen. In flight services requires further additional payment (I didn't buy them), making WOW air significantly more expensive than the great airlines Virgin Atlantic, Delta Airlines and KLM. Leg space was a plus between Reykjavik and Boston, but on the return trip from Reykjavik to Copenhagen, my knees were constantly jammed against the seat in front of me. I am 1.83 meters, so I wouldn't consider myself a giant. Lastly, when checking in for the return trip in Boston, it wasn't possible to get my boarding pass from Reykjavik to Copenhagen. So after landing in Reykjavik I had to collect my luggage and check in again. Several phone calls and double checks of my passport indicated that I had fallen out of the system in some way - again, not much information. I actually called WOW air weeks before my trip to make sure I wouldn't have to do that, and they assured me I wouldn't. But I did have to, and it would have made me miss my flight to Copenhagen with a little shorter layover. I want to stress that the cabin crew on WOW air are not to be blamed, but in the future, I will pay extra to avoid travelling with WOW air.

### WOW air customer review
Not worth the potential savings. They get two stars solely because I had roomy seats for the longest two legs of the flight, and because people ignore one star reviews. All flights were delayed. Some passengers were emailed, I was not. The flight crew either gave no information about connecting flights or completely inaccurate information. Staff were nowhere to be found at Keflavik. Airline or airport staff. Gate agents closed the gate at Gatwick before WOW's posted closing time, causing issues for some passengers. Customer service is unresponsive. Gate agents in Keflavik are sullen to the point that's it's funny. Keflavik was a nightmare. Five flights full of people all crammed into a tiny holding area, shoulder to shoulder. No airline or airport employees to be found. Poorly labeled gates in areas that are under construction. Aggressive, angry passengers lashing out at each other. Everything that could be bad about boarding practices happened here. Contrast that to the orderly, calm boarding at both BWI and Gatwick and it is clear the home base of this airline has a problem. Very specific, probably won't happen to you complaints - another passenger's bag fell on my head, but according to Wow this is somehow my fault, for sitting quietly in my assigned seat and magically willing a bag to fall on me, not the fault of their free-for-all boarding practices. The condescending and infuriating email response I got after a week and two messages was just icing on the cake of a completely miserable experience.

### WOW air customer review
A true nightmare. Check in at 8pm - flight delayed to 3:45am for technical reasons. No WOW Air representative anywhere. At 1:30am we had to take a taxi to an hotel 30km away. Nobody told us that the flight was scheduled for next morning at 11am discovered by chance on a written poster (someone should tell WOW that email has been invented) Back to the airport (40€ taxi). Total chaos, the flight was never announced on the displays. We got the boarding pass but the date was day before so great difficukties at security. Eventually arrived to the gate, it was changed at least 6 times with no human around. At 11:30am we got on board. Good news? No - we are still here at 12:30 with an inside temperature of 40 degrees. Not sure if and when we will go. Again with total absence from the company and the airport staff.

### WOW air customer review
My partner's flight was five hours late. Two weeks later, although the flight status right before leaving for the airport was green light, and the weather at both ends was fine, my Gatwick-Keflavik WOW flight was 2.5 hours late. I was connecting to an Icelandair flight to Boston, and was very skeptical when the WOW flight attendants told several people not to worry, that Icelandair would hold the plane. Of course they did not hold the plane, and I had to re-book for the next day's Icelandair flight. Change fee was $400, fare difference $60, but I also had to spend the night in the airport hotel plus eat a dismal dinner there. Total damage was about $700. WOW refused to compensate me since, while it was their fault that I missed the Icelandair flight, it was a different airline. Icelandair understandably refused to compensate me. I will not fly WOW again. My theory is that discount airlines have low seniority regarding landing gates.

### WOW air customer review
You get what you pay for with Wow Air. Booking is pretty easy online. I was surprised when asked to choose my seat and that charges were added to my bill based on where I sat. I chose to sit in the cheap seats $5-$10 on each leg. When I boarded I really didn't see a whole lot of difference between my seat and the more expensive ones up front though there may have been a couple of inches difference. The plane was clean and the staff friendly. I didn't mind that there was no entertainment. I brought a good book and read or napped the whole way. I had chosen aisle seats but still felt claustrophobic when the passenger in front of me moved his seat back. It's tight! I had read that food was extra and expensive (they even charge for water) so I picked up something at Logan airport on the flight over to Denmark. The problem on the return to Boston was that I had barely 40 minutes between flights once I got off the plane in Reykjavik. I couldn't spend much time making selections or using the lady's room (fortunately only a short line). And it was a 15-20 minute walk to my gate in Iceland. Speaking of Iceland, the only flight from Boston to Copenhagen is overnight and also stops in Iceland at 4am. This layover, unlike the return, is 3 hours long and the entire airport is closed and practically deserted. Even my gate wasn't open. If any airline is going to drop off people in the middle of the night the airport should have something open-or better, cots set up so we can sleep. It's a long time at an awful hour to be sitting and waiting. Being able to have breakfast would be nice. My only big complaint on this trip was that Wow Air doesn't have a desk set up in Copenhagen airport until 2 hours before the flight. You cannot get a boarding pass online but must go to the gate. The line queues up fast and it's long as the flight is full. And here's the problem-having been in the EU for 2 weeks I wanted to get a tax refund. The system is already complicated and designed to discourage this. But since you need a boarding pass to get the customs stamp I had to wait for Wow Air to open a desk. Once you get your boarding pass you also give them your checked luggage. Customs want to see what you have bought, not just receipts, so be sure to have it all in your carry on luggage. People who get boarding passes ahead don't have this issue as they are still in possession of their checked luggage. Once you have the customs stamp you then have to find the correct bank/agency for the refund. There are several. All this takes time and waiting in line and then you still have to clear security. So I barely made my flight out of Copenhagen. It's stressful and shouldn't be. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight hoping to take care of all of this.

### WOW air customer review
Very attentive, courteous and smart staff. Flights were excellent, no delays and very comfortable. Couldn't fault and all at an unbelievable price. Would fly with Wowair again and recommend.

### WOW air customer review
The flight was delayed around 3 hours 40 minutes. There were no any compensation (e.g refreshing, meals or finance) for this delay. The service was OK and like other low costs airlines we had to buy everything like water and bagage. The seat was OK and could not recline as we were sat in the back row - 35E and 35 F.

### WOW air customer review
Traveled from Copenhagen to Boston. WOW Airlines offer a good route for a very reasonable rate. I appreciate what the airline is trying to accomplish by offering discount rates across the Atlantic. But let's get real. For flights over 4-5 hours comfort entertainment and basic human needs are required. The aircraft from Copenhagen to Reykjavik was pretty shabby but got us safely to our destination. The aircraft from Reykjavik to Boston was very new however the seating was uncomfortable (for a flight of that length) there was no entertainment and of course the food and refreshments were not free. Not even water. On both legs the inflight staff did not seem very happy just not very pleasant at all. Lastly the customer service is troubling. There is very little opportunity to contact any service representative unless you are in the same time zone as Reykjavik. This makes it very difficult to make changes (after the 3 hour window closes) or cancellations to your purchases. The airline has potential and I expect they will work out the kinks. Unfortunately until then customers will bare the brunt of their mistakes. Overall I guess you really do get what you pay for.

### WOW air customer review
13 March KEF-CDG flight WW404. 5 April CDG-KEF flight WW405. Great prices if you can get a special advance purchase offer. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. No frills airline - you get what you pay for. This is fine for flights of 3 hours or less. Also note most of their gates at airports are not actual gates but landing on the runway with transfer by bus. This can take extra hassle and time to board and exit the plane. If you need any deal of extra customer service expect nothing beyond standard email replies and frowns. Front desk agents not particularly happy to be there. As with all the low cost carriers this company tries to squeeze revenue from extra carry on and normal baggage fees. Sometimes it is just worth paying the extra 50 EUR to have a pleasant purchase to plane exit experience.

### WOW air customer review
Flight from Keflavik to LGW on 16th March 2015 was delayed by over 2.5 hours should have left at 15.35 did not leave until around 18.20pm. Even though the flight was so late leaving I missed my connecting flight to Dublin with Ryanair by minutes (which was the last flight that night) so my wife and I had to book in to hotel overnight incurring extra expenses on accommodation and car parking fees etc. I believe we would have made that flight if we were not held up at boarding desk for about 10-15 minutes and also the rear door of the plane was not operational which caused further delays the overall experience was stressful and would have to think long and hard about traveling with WOW AIR the next time even though I understand they are starting direct flights to Dublin next June.

### WOW air customer review
WOW Air is a ok low cost airline and with some improvements (online check in boarding) would be a good efficient airline like easy jet but with a better cabin. The flights where dirt cheap at £300 for 3 people with 1 bag and reserved seats. Flight WW206 16/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft:TF-WOW. Check in opened at 16.10 for the 19.40 flight. It was quick and there where 3 check in staff. The flight was nearly full today which shows they are doing well. We have reserved seats which we did get and they did acknowledge that when we booked we had the 12kg hand luggage allowance. Boarding opened at 18.40 for the 19.40 flight and we went immediately to the gate. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen causing delays. It was painful and needs to be improved lot be like the procedure at KEF. We pushed back at 20.00 (late) and we were off at 20.15. The flight was good with comfy seats with recline. The buy on board was cheap in comparison with Ryanair and the crew where professional but chatty (a good balance). We landed at 23.10 in a blizzard. KEF was unprepared and we had to wait for 2 0mins to attach the jetway. Baggage was also slow but this wasn't wow's fault. Good flight but poor ground services all in all. Flight WW201 20/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft TF-WOW. Check in opened at 04.45 for all the morning flights (06.50-07.00-07.15). (Ours was at 07.00). Check in was quick and there were 5 staff for 3 flights which was OK. Our flight was also again nearly full. KEF airport is a good airport in terms of departures. We went to the gate at 06.00 and the gate area opened at 06.20. Boarding began at 06.30 and they just let everyone one which was easier. This time the plane was bang on time for pushback at 07.00 and was up at 07.07. The flight was yet again good with a cheap buy on board and yet again a drinks round and a tea or coffee round which is good in comparison with easy jet. The plane landed at 09.40 (15mins early) and we were off at 09.50 baggage handling however needs to be faster. No entertainment was available. WOW air needs to add online check in and enhance the boarding experience at LGW before I can say it's a decent 3 star airline.

### WOW air customer review
WW206 LGW-KEF. From our first flight; I gather that Wow air is a semi decent low cost airline that requires improvement. Check in opened 3hours and 30 mins before and a new hand luggage allowance has been out in place meaning passengers where getting nervous if the there bags would be fine. Wow air fail to provide online check in making it less of an attractive option. On today's flight wow air where 20mins late arriving and boarding was chaotic. They boarded in rows but nobody listened. We took off 35 mins late and the inflight experience was the same as easyjet. We saw the northern lights which was a plus but doesn't affect the airline's performance. The flight landed 20mins late in a blizzard but the pilot did a good job and landed smoothly. The crew where chatty but professional. Once arriving in KEF the jetway failed to attach on several attempts and we waited for 30mins before we could get off. Even worse we had to wait for another 30mins for our luggage meaning we left KEF at 00.25 instead of 23.30 not good. WOW AIR need improvement to its ground services before I can recommend it. However our return expirence may be better if not in a blizzard. The inflight was average for low cost travel.

Flew from Reykjavik to Gatwick on A320 11/2/2015. First class service friendly polite crew very attentive to passengers and all crew were happy. Flew with Icelandair to Reykjavik much prefer Wow Air.

### WOW air customer review
On WOW web page they promises to do things with their WOW factor ("we're fun free and love smiling"). However when you get to the gate you see nothing of this WOW factor unless it also includes rude and threatening. When we flew they were systematically threatening passengers that they must pay an extra $80 because they had a side purse or a laptop unless they could make them disappear into other hand luggage. I have never seen as many annoyed and dissatisfied passengers enter a plane. What a pleasant way to start the trip! On our flight we were very close to the front and this meant we entered the plane last. Since check-in luggage is very expensive everyone is taking hand luggage. This meant that when we finally got on the plane there was no space to put our luggage so the staff took it and put it somewhere in the back. Then when the plane landed we had to wait for every single passenger to exit the plane before even attempting to find our bags.

### WOW air customer review
Staff looked classy! Flew KEF-LGW and they were excellent really took good care of passengers. Good space seats pilot information about every part of the journey movie! Prices was 3 times cheaper then Ryanair. One minus is poor menu all I could have was a ham and cheese sandwich.

### WOW air customer review
Flew KEF-LGW onboard a Bulgarian Air via A320. Their branding is excellent with funny quirky posters and comments throughout KEF airport and onboard however I found there to be very little substance behind this and I certainly wasn't 'wowed'. The crew although professional didn't seem interested in their job and the onboard cafe offering was poor and very limited. I was surprised that a film was shown during the flight however there were no headphones available and I doubt many people carry a pair of two-prong headphones with them. I also found the seats on the surprisingly newish aircraft to be rather old fashioned and uncomfortable for a 3+ hour flight. Overall not a bad airline however found Icelandair to be far superior for very little difference in price.

Flew to Reykjavik flight numbers: X9202 and X9205. Flew for the first time with WOW air on Monday Feb 3rd. Staff were excellent very funny doing the safety check and throughout the journey. Had booked extra seat room and that was great. Came back on Sunday 9th different staff but just as lovely. Will use again.

We flew from LGW Gatwick to KEF Reykjavik in Feb 2014 and were very impressed. Staff were friendly and reassuring professional and funny! Flight was bumpy due to high winds but no problem for the newish A320s. Food and drink fine. Flights left and arrived on time both ways. Usually fly Easyjet but wish WOW had more services worldwide - I'd go with them!

Flew to Reykjavik on WW202 on 19 Jan and was pleasantly surprised. Stewardesses looked like they did 40 years ago very smart and very professional and with a sense of humour. Return was WW205 on 23 Jan both landings were superb we are quick to complain but credit is due to all the staff involved on both flights. Would definitely fly with them again.

### WOW air customer review
Flew LGW-KEF return just before Christmas. Flights were on time. There was a good choice of food and drink on the plane along with some good deals - much cheaper than Iceland itself. The cabin crew were excellent - friendly and helpful. We flew back to LGW during a heavy storm and the flight landed safely despite heavy wind and rain. A lot of other flights were cancelled or diverted. Overall a very good experience. WOW do not feel like a low cost carrier although legroom could be a bit better.

Wow is one of the friendliest airlines I have ever flown with. Everything was straight forward from the check in to the flight itself. I have never experienced such friendly and up beat staff for the whole flight. It really doesn't feel like a low cost airline!

LGW-KEF 8-13 Oct. Quick check-in had pre-booked seats. Slow boarding due to large numbers of cabin baggage needing to be stored but flight departure on time. A320 cramped seating but typical of a low cost airline friendly and helpful staff and early arrival into KEF. Baggage off quickly. On return check-in slower pre-booked seats were not honoured staff very strict over hand baggage. Messy boarding and slightly late departure. Again onboard staff extremely friendly and helpful however little to no announcement from flight deck throughout. On time arrival into LGW and baggage off quickly. For the price was impressed however online check-in is needed.

I travelled from Reykjavik to Dublin recently and it proved to be one of the most pleasant enjoyable and entertaining flights I have taken. Our good fortune was to encounter a wonderful crew with a fantastic sense of humour in particular the air hostess who made all announcements. There was a spontaneous round of applause when she completed the safety announcements - I think it was the first time I ever actually listened to them - she was so funny and entertaining. She received her second round of applause when we landed - again a wonderful commentary on weather temperatures etc.It proves flights can be entertaining pleasant and enjoyable - and at no extra cost. I would definitely fly with Wow again.

SXF-KEF-SXF both flights on board of the same A320 in WOW livery (LZ-WOW). Aircraft was in a very good condition clean and comfy seats leg room quite good for a low cost carrier. Both flights on time smooth boarding quite fast check in. Flight attendants very nice and helpful. Funny safety demonstration included. Very nice experience overall I'd say it's a very good value for money. I would definitely fly with them again.

LGW-KEF-LGW over the August bank holiday weekend. I was rather sceptical when booking as I have never heard of the airline but was positively surprised by the experience considering the are marketing themselves as a LCC. I had to rebook my flight back and they obviously charged a (reasonable) rebooking fee plus fare difference but it was a easy simple process. Check-In at LGW was smooth and without any issues. My friend checked in about half an hour earlier but they kept a seat free next to him until I checked in which was great. Obviously being a LCC there's only buy on board stuff but crew was incredibly friendly funny and efficient. Oh and there's inflight entertainment showing a movie on the overhead screens. The A320 was leased from Air Bulgaria and still had their saftey card in the seat pocket but it was clean and quite comfortable with decent pitch and seat recline (contrary to other LCCs where it's more of a chicken farm experience). On the way back because there were 3 flights leaving roughly at the same time the queue was quite long but again check-in staff was efficient and friendly. Flight uneventful crew friendly and both flights on time arriving slightly early. I would definitively fly them again.

LGW-KEF-LGW this past week. Two totally different experiences. This one covers the outbound LGW-KEF will do separate one for KEF-LGW. Outbound LGW-KEF was on a nearly new Airbus A320 that was on loan from Air VIA but painted in WOW Air livery. Flight attendants were very friendly witty and generally fitting of the attitude that WOW Air wants. Check-in at Gatwick was a bit slow mainly because the four agents were weighing most hand luggage to ensure it was under the 10kg requirement. Onboard food seemed fine - had a ham and cheese baguette that was hot and tasty. Prices seemed reasonable. They had some good beer specials going and were more than happy to promote them! Overall experience was good - certainly better than anything I've experienced on RyanAir or EasyJet. The price was far better than Icelandair for my travel dates. Biggest disappointment is the lack of online check-in.

KEF-LGW return. Totally different experience than the (very enjoyable) outbound. My flight was on a very old (25+ years) MD-83 owned by SwiftAir a Spanish charter airline with some scheduled service I believe. In all my years of flying I don't think I've ever been on a plane in worse condition inside. Ripped carpet tons of places where serious scrapes and dents had been painted over shabby seats loose interior panels and just a general level of dirt and grime etc. It was a huge contrast to the nearly new A320 on my outbound and really does a disservice to WOW Air because it felt entirely bargain-basement. Crew was half-WOW Air and half-Spanish and the Spanish side was fine but rather brusque. No in-flight entertainment. Check-in was pretty slow - about 100 people in line maybe 8 agents. They moved quickly but still a fair bit of waiting. I'd recommend WOW Air as I'm sure that this plane won't be around long. I'd certainly think about avoiding them if more of these MD-80s are going to be part of their fleet on a regular basis.

Flew London Gatwick - Reykjavik return on 15/17 March. Both flights on time - smart clean planes - Avion Express livery. Crew smart and attentive. Image was welcoming with a humorous touch. Check-in good at both airports for a budget airline. Upgrade prices for extra legroom seats were good value. On board prices and selection reasonable. As part of a WOW package including tours it was well organised and good value for money. Would definitely fly WOW again.

Flew with this new entrant to the Icelandic market KEF-CPH. Despite the name the experience was very much an average low cost experience. No online check-in so long line in KEF for check-in. However check-in staff in KEF did a good job and with plenty of counters it was a relatively painless experience. Not direct ramp boarding. So you'll get to experience the 'fine' weather in Iceland first hand. Flight was operated by Air Via from Bulgaria. Excellent operation and plane in great condition. If Wow continues their co-operation with Air Via I have no hesitation in flying them again. Service on board exactly what I expected from a low cost. The usual assortment available for sale. Crew was a mix of Wow staff and Air Via staff but I was happy with both the attention we got and attitude of the crew. It's worth a try but ok might fit better than wow.

Second time on WOW LGW to KEF 21st December. Slight delay and long queues at check in (possibly caused by lots of passengers arriving very early for a later flight). Inflight experience excellent - comfortable seats great crew reasonable prices. I would have no hesitation in flying WOW again but will be watching their on time record closely.

7th December 2012 LGW-KEF. Iceland Express and Wow have merged now. Smooth check-in smooth flight very quiet engine noise planes and the staff seem polite and efficient. The planes are very new and spotlessly clean apart from some chewing gum in my inflight magazine. There is no flight entertainment but you do get a screen which tells you about your flight routing which was a nice change for a budget airline - actually I was impressed! Prices for food and drink are reasonable for an Icelandic franchise. I will definitely travel with them again!

London Stansted to Reykjavik earlier this summer. Very impressed by the crew and interior of the plane and the seats were very comfortable. The flights have now switched (at very short notice) to 1x per week from Gatwick. Overall a very new company but a good experience.
