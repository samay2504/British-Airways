### "It was a bad experience"
The counter staff and staff at gate is non coperative. No system of boarding. Politeness missing. The Staff told us to stand in que as shown by them and we were allowed to board at last. Why they put us in that que, they could not give any reply. No one to supervise. It was a bad experience. Flight VN 6033 dated 25th july2024

### "force me to buy another ticket"
Try to avoid this airline when you choose to holiday to Da Nang. They use undercover name under Vietnam Airlines but different operator. They can't help you check in just because of last name input. They ask me to go to customer services and then cannot help to input the last name. They force me to buy another ticket. Cost twice the price i booked originally and force to refund the last one i booked from Traveloka. This is absurd

### “Inside was a bit dated”
Not Verified | To start with, the paint was peeling on the exterior. Never a great sign. Looks like they had just slapped cheap paint over the old branding (changed names from Jetstar a bit back). Inside was a bit dated but not the worst. They have the same in-flight advertising nonsense as Vietnam Airlines. Short flight, no issues, so okay, it's fine.

### "never had such a bad experience"
As one of previous reviewers I realized, that instead of Vietnam Airlines my flight is operated by Pacific Airlines only at check in counter in airport. Yes, it was my fault and next time I will never choose flight operated by Pacific Airlines. First of all, their staff was not that polite with customers. They were not rude, but were not giving a heck to them. Then they show their unprofessionalism. I was flying with my wife. We had 2 bags and we didn't have scales to make sure both bags have equal weight. I asked staff not to send the 1st bag until we check weight of the 2nd one, because we are not sure if the 2nd one is below limit in 23 kg. But, as I said, staff was not giving a heck and of course she sent our 1st bag further. And 2nd bag was 25 kg. So, we had to stay for half an our waiting for staff to find and bring our bag back. When they bring my bag, I found out that they torn away one of handles. Handle was not just damaged but literally torn away one of mounts of handle. So, there is no way to mount it back, because there is a hole in bag with size about 2x5 cm. They said I can write complain at the airport when I arrive. When I arrived, I came to their room. They offered me 150.000 vnd (6$). My bag was just 1 year old and I bought it for 65$, so of course I refused. I wrote complain. After some time they answered me that "they have rule" to compensate for broken handle 6$ only. No matter if your bag is 10$ or 300$. So, they think that 6$ is enough to compensate damage. Which bag can you buy for 6$? Will you be able to fix bag for 6$? Of course no. It simply doesn't have area where to mount handle (they torn it away). I was trying to explain them that this compensation is absolutely not fair and they should either compensate real damage, either replace broken bag with similar new one. But they simply don't give a sh*t. As a result - they broke my bag, I had to throw it away and they didn't compensate more than 6$. Normally I never write negative feedbacks, but I've never had such a bad experience with any air company I used before (though I used quite a lot). Absolutely terrible and unprofessional service. I will neve ever use their service again and I strongly recommend you to avoid them, if you don't want to have uncompensated damage from their staff.

### "unpleasant experience"
Not Verified |  I bought a ticket on Vietnam Airlines to avoid flying a low cost airline without realizing they code share with Pacific Airlines. At the VN Airlines counter, Pacific Airlines staff checked us in (taking a very long time). When I realized that we had been placed at the back of the aircraft, I asked to be moved forward because turbulence makes me very nervous. Initially the person was helpful, then a more senior agent demanded I pay for an upgrade. Seriously unpleasant experience.

### "Avoid if possible"
Terrible service and quality. There was a storm in Hanoi so the initial delay was understandable. It was delayed from 16:10 to 23:20, then they said the time changed to 21:50. By the time we arrived to the airport they pushed to 22:20, 22:40, and 23:20 (the original delayed time). They said it was because the plane arrived late. No verbal announcement was made by the airline at the airport. They only told us via the screen and with a white board at the gate. By 23:20, they let us go the bus to go to the airplane, we got shuttled to and back to our gate due to some technical difficulties with the plane. Again no announcement, the passenger has to ask and shout to get an answer. The airline is the old Jetstar Pacific Crew, a low-cost airline, and they charge is the price of Vietnam Airline. Avoid if possible, and never going back.

### "Very bad experience"
We bought two tickets from Hanoi to Hoi an with Vietnam Airlines, but it was operated by Pacific Airlines. Once on board, they had us on the plane for 118 minutes, that is, about 2 hours. Very little information about the reason. Initially they talked about rain although not a single drop fell. After 45 minutes without more information, we had to talk to them so that they could update our status. In all this time, not a single drink, despite the fact that they are obliged if 2 hours pass. We have claimed but they wash their hands. They argue that the waiting time was due to "technical reasons" very different from what we had been told about meteorological reasons. They also argue that although time delay was close to 2h (for 2 minutes! ), these were not fulfilled and that is why they are not obliged to serve a drink. Very bad experience. Not advisable at all.

### "Seats very hard"
Not Verified | This is a low cost carrier code shared with Vietnam Airlines who own 98% of it. It used to be Jetstar. We paid for a full service flight with Vietnam but got this instead. Bit of a con. No inflight entertainment, no service except for pay to buy. Seats very hard. Glad it was only a 2 hour flight. Got us there at least. Full flight but uneventful.

### "on time and fairly uneventful"
Return leg of my round trip. Again, the great thing about this airline is the departure from Bangkok's main airport rather than the budget terminal across town. Check in was done smoothly and boarding is by passenger ramp instead of being bussed about the airfield so is very convenient and quick. Flight departed on time and was fairly uneventful. Flight arrived 10 minutes ahead of scheduled time. The only let down of the journey was de-planing at Ha Noi was by ground service ramp and bus to the terminal.

### "everyone was boarded quickly"
Outbound flight of a round trip ticket costing the equivalent of $180 only. There was some confusion as to the gate which was changed and even the crew arrived late but everyone was boarded quickly for a full passenger load and the flight departed on time. Being only a less than 2 hour flight there was no in-flight entertainment and the crew barely had time to complete their trolley service before we were ready to descend for landing. Trolley service was limited to pot noodles, snacks and tea / coffee so nothing exciting. Being a budget flight the great thing is that it arrives at Bangkok's main airport, not the budget airport the other side of town, and there are ramp serviced for deplaning.

### "Such a terrible experience"
Such a terrible experience. Worst customer service I can ever think of and DELAYED all the time. One of our package was over by few kilograms but we already bought extra packages for it and staff ask us to pay extra fee that cost almost the same as the ticket it self. Or else we got to pull out our stuff to put in our other package that we checked in. In the end they all are the weight that we bought in advance. Wasted our time and energy. I asked for an email for me to provide a review and it took them 15-20 min to just give me it.

### Pacific Airlines customer review
First, I bought the ticket via Vietnam Airlines only to end up being operated by Pacific Airlines. Ground staff at checking in were the rudest I've encountered to the point I had to complain to the manager nearby who apologized. Once through security, at the boarding gates it was absolute chaos. Gates constantly changed, all flights delayed from Pacific, what a nightmare. Once arrived in Da Nang I realized they had broken my luggage to which they said they could only offer 150000VND. That's all, unbelievable. Avoid at all costs

### "Very bad experience on this airline"
Very bad experience on this airline. First they masquerade as Vietnam Airways on the site so we booked the flight then we found out that it was Pacific which operates this flight. We come to the counter and we find very rude ground staff. Our flight was delayed initially by 10 mins which extended to an hour, no proper information was given, the reason was technical issues, which happened then resolved then happened, we were told to go back then told it was resolved. No apology not even water was offered. Please be careful with this airline, it's the worst! !

### "there is no in-flight entertainment"
At first I booked a ticket to a Vietnam Airlines flight 2 days before but I could not board the flight because I just had a surgery and the minimum time since the surgery was done did not meet the requirement for boarding a flight. Therefore, I changed the ticket to this flight. Pacific Airlines flight PIC6230, from Ho Chi Minh City to Qui Nhon. Boarded on September 1, 2022. Delayed for 20 minutes due to "late arrival". Perhaps it's common for Pacific Airlines because another flight on that day was also delayed for the same reason. Taxi time before takeoff: 22 minutes. The aircraft still arrived on time even if the delayed time and long taxi time was dismissed. In-flight entertainment: It was a disappointment because there is no in-flight entertainment at all. No magazine, only a menu for food and beverage. Food and beverage: There are still some choices for food and beverage as mentioned in the menu even on a short flight, although I have to pay cash to buy it. Seat comfort decent. I can change the angle of the chair so that I can relax and try not to hurt my shoulder because of the surgery. The landing at Phu Cat International Airport was hard, which was quite unexpectedly shocking. Overall, this was an unexpected flight because I couldn't board the Vietnam Airlines one 2 days prior, so I really cannot say whether I would recommend this airlines or not.

### "This company has to learn a lot about communication"
Not Verified |  Book through Vietnam Airlines. A few days before departure Pacific changed the original schedule of departure. At departure we had a delay (time of arrival) of 3 hrs and 59 minutes. Since this is within 4 hrs they can't do anything as a token for inconvenience or so. They say they provided drinks at the gate. We did not see them providing it, until the moment we were boarding. The whole 4 hours no information was given (except "delayed" on the screens. No one appeared at the desk until 5 min before boarding. This company has to learn a lot about communication and about moral behaviour (sticking to the rules is more important than keeping your customers satisfied). Flight itself was okay with friendly staff.

### "a terrible experience"
First time flying with Pacific Airlines (I booked through Vietnam Airlines). They damaged my luggage. The wheel was broken and they offered only 300k dong in compensation, which is about US $10. Pretty low knowing I have to buy a new suitcase. They even brought back the wheel that was broken and gave it to me saying I could easily fix it. Was a terrible experience and I will not fly with them again.

### "Worst airline in Vietnam"
Worst airline in Vietnam. They delayed the flight without any notice for 2.5 hours, which one can find only in the airport after check-in. More of that, they knew that didn't will be delayed, because they delayed all their flight that day, but still didn't notify passengers. No water, no food, nothing to apologize. Moreover, they started boarding when it should be the departure time.

### "ticket didn’t have the luggage tag"
When I checked in, I had my checked bag but the staff at the counter didn’t put the name tag on my ticket. I was busy to fill in the medical declaration form at that time, so I didn’t notice my ticket didn’t have the luggage tag on until I got into airplane. I informed a flight attendant that my ticket didn’t have the tag and she told me that I would receive the assistance when I landed. Once I landed, I got all my luggage. I follow the exit and one of their staff stopped me and asked me the tag. I told them that I didn’t get the tag on my ticket since I checked in. Instead of telling me to wait and double checked, he kept saying that I must lose my tag somewhere and I should have checked my bag. Even I kept explaining to him what happened, he ignored me and refused to let me out of the airport. I asked him what documents did he need me to present to proof that the bag I was carrying belonged to me. When I’m starting getting annoyed and telling him off by his attitude, his colleague came to support him and behave like I was making it become a big deal. You are being rude to your customers and ask your customers to understand your rude language?
