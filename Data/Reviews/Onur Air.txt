### "never book again with them"
Antalya to Beirut, the worst ever. The plane was supposed to depart 9.00 am there was a delay without informing us. Delay till 11.00 but there was a delay more than 11.00. Will never book again with them.

### "Flight was delayed 3 hours"
Beirut to Istanbul. Worst company ever. Flight was delayed 3 hours without prior notice and whenever asked why nobody responded. Some passengers lost their other connection flights because of this delay.

### "unbelievably terrible service"
I had a flight from the Berlin to Hurghada 24th January. I and my friend took the emergency exit row seats because the leg room was more generous and the whole row was free. The staff started immediately in a not polite form tell us that we have to turn off our phones even if they were already turned on the flight mode. When we asked for a glass of water they denied our request (the flight took longer than 4 and a half hours). Its unbelievably terrible service! will always try to avoid flying via this airline.

### "worst of the worst"
Istanbul to Düsseldorf. The worst of the worst, during the whole flight, none of the crew smiled. During the flight I went to sit in another seat, that had a little more for my legs. And right after I sat the attendant came to me saying I'm not allowed to sit over there even if it's empty. It costs 2 0euro. Not only me but another elderly man. That's not human.

### "The flight was uneventful"
I travelled on Onur Air from Makhachkala to Istanbul on 20th September. It was an early morning flight so I got to the airport the night before. International flights check in upstairs at Makhachkala airport. The airport departure screen only showed in Russian and a friend looked up the internet for my flight number which was displayed. After checking in we waited in one lounge and then were transported to another lounge by bus. This was a bigger lounge that could hold everyone in comfort. The flight was uneventful and got to Istanbul in the early hours of the morning. I will always check Onur Air if flying where they fly.

### "We never got a refund"
Istanbul to Izmir. We booked the flight online (8Q 162) - Onur Air cancelled the flight and did not offer an alternate flight. When we got to the airport we were told "there's nothing we can do". We never got a refund or anything. We had to buy a ticket on another airline to fly to Izmir

### "worst airline I've travelled"
Istanbul to Berlin. Onur Air is the worst airline I've travelled. While you're standing in the line for check-in in the Ataturk airport there are security guys of this airline who check passports of random people: they asked me about what I was doing in Turkey, what do I do in Germany, what is my profession, how long did I stay etc. After that they took a picture of my passport and my residence permit on their camera without any explanations - this is violation of data privacy. Regarding planes - they are old and look very cheap inside, legroom is so small you can barely fit your knees(and I am only 177cm high). Crew's English is so bad I didn't get anything they said during the flight. Summary: never again for any price, I'd better pay 50 eur more for Turkish Airlines or any other alternative but won't go through this humiliation again.

### "does not provide free water"
Antalya to Munich. This airline does not provide free water, they make you buy small bottles. This airline does not have special baby "beds" or shelves to provide safety for traveling babies. Moreover they did not provide the first row for families traveling with babies. The leg room is minimal and babies DO NOT get any special treatment. We had to stand in a queue for ages even though we were supposed to get to the airplane faster because we had a month year old with us. The attitude of the stewardesses is truly terrible. The announcements made in English are impossible to understand because of the pronunciation. To sum up: never again Onur Air.

### "Horrible confusing experience"
Flew Onur Air from Izmir to Istanbul. Horrible confusing experience. Flight scheduled for 20.45hrs departure. Waited at gate. Aircraft delayed. No reason given. Gate switched, announcements primarily in Turkish. 20.45hrs comes, still no aircraft and waiting passengers get restless. 22.00hrs no answers and gate staff inform passengers to go to Onur Air desk in ticketing hall. Passengers very angry, banging on desk, shouting all in Turkish and no credible explanation (in English) given. Onur Air agent breaks down in tears. Passengers demanding answers, no answers given. 22.30hrs aircraft arrives. Departs at 23.00hrs. On arrival in Istanbul, Metro stopped for the day, had to use Havabus to get downtown.

### "Truly terrible service"
Samara to Antalya. I rarely write reviews even if the service is bad but I had to review this airline for the sheer fact it seems they went out of their way to be terrible! Firstly we booked a flight to depart at 17:30 but without telling us they moved this flight to 02:55 the next day. When we arrived for the flight at the new time the flight was delayed until 05:30 again without any information. I called the airline to check on an update and they said they could see no problem. Truly terrible service, avoid at all costs.

### "do not book with this airline"
Kayseri to Istanbul. I had flights booked with Onur Air both in April and May 2017. Both times my husband and I arrived at the airport to find out our flight had been cancelled several weeks before and we were not informed. The airlines claims that they sent an email or SMS, they even verified that they did have our correct contact information, but we searched through every single email and SMS we had and there was absolutely nothing letting us know our flight had been cancelled. The first time it happened we were luckily able to get on another flight 1 hour later. This time, all flights to our destination are booked for the entire day. Meaning, we will have to wait until the next day for a flight (spending money on another night at a hotel and each having to take an unpaid day off of work). This is  unacceptable and I advise that you do not book with this airline. It's a disgrace.

### "a good deal for the price I paid"
I flew Istanbul-Berlin-Istanbul for a business trip with Onur Air. The airline was providing a free checked baggage allowance, so it was a good deal for the price I paid. The online check-in was confusing and I had the impression that it was paid service with this airline. In Ataturk (IST) airport there was an Onur Air common check-in counter which was very efficient and I did not wait more than 5 minutes to check in. However, on the way back in Berlin-Tegel, Onur Air had a terrible check-in line, where I waited for 1 hour. It was horrible and I assume that those who have cabin baggage really waste their time (they cannot check-in online to speed up the process). We flew a Pegasus Airlines plane for both flights, there was not enough leg space and there was catering available for a fee.

### "seat comfort is good"
Check in process on line was straighforward. Flight delayed leaving Istanbul by over 1 hour. Ground crew at the airport were quite unhelpful. After take-off a trolley seemed to roll out of its position in the galley and made a very loud crash as did a smaller metal box. This is the first time I have ever seen a cabin attendant get out of her seat whilst the aircraft was at such a steep angle. For most of the flight a trolley was placed in front of the entry to the galley so the front toilet was not accessible. Other than this it was an acceptable flight. Food is for purchase only. Quality was as to be expected for paid food on a short flight. The seat comfort is good as they are quite padded compared to other airlines.

### "impossible to lower tray"
Onur Air cabin crew and flight deck spoke poor English. Seating was bad, no legroom and I got stuck, seat 15B was 2 cm further forward than A and C (see picture) my girlfriends trousers got a rip because of broken plastic in armrest. The tray could only be lowered so it stood in an upright positions of 20-30 deg as it would hit my chest, even for my 3 yr old daughter it was impossible to lower tray. Cabin was old and not clean. It was a charter flight. Entertainment was Turkish commercials.

### "worst experience I have had flying"
This is about the worst experience I have had flying. Firstly they canceled the original flight after making us wait over 5 hours at the gate. They lied about the reason for the wait claiming bad weather in Istanbul was the cause, purely to avoid having to pay compensation for the delay. In reality their plane had technical problems. They then said to come back the next morning for a 4am check in, for a 6 am departure. We were waiting over an hour and a half before anyone showed up at the check in desk. This flight was also delayed for over 2 hours! After we got to Istanbul I found that my luggage and tool case had not been put on the flight and had absolutly no help from the airline. As of writing this review I am still waiting for response as to where my property is.

### "otherwise I would avoid"
Very small seats and drinks were not free. Boarding was very disorganized, and we sat well past the boarding time with no explanation. The price was decent but would take Turkish Airlines instead if the price was anywhere near Onur Air. Verdict: if Onur Air price is much better than Turkish Airlines and the flight is short, it might be worth it - but otherwise I would avoid.

### Onur Air customer review
I flew from Istanbul to Berlin in July 2015. The seat was very uncomfortable. Water was not free, they charge 3 Euros for a small bottle. The staff could hardly speak any English. On top of all that, both pieces of my luggage was delayed 4 days.

### Onur Air customer review
I was nervous after reading the reviews but everything was ok. Plane was new and we arrived on time. Cabin crew were nice but they don't speak much English. Given bread, juice and coffee for free. Great comfort for a good price.

### Onur Air customer review
Istanbul - Izmir. Flight arrived on time. Staff nice and professional. They were smiling nice friendly. Aircraft A320 was clean comfortable. Paying service great with enough choice. Will choose Onur Air again on next trip to Turkey.

### Onur Air customer review
Flew 3.11. DIY-IST with Onurair because of the convenient flight-time. Departure on time plane clean Airbus 321. Toilets clean but the legroom is awful I'm only 171 cm but my knees touched the sit in front of me. No IFE FA cool neutral no smile. There was a menu card prices affordable but nobody offered anything the trolley was moved from row ten directly to the back of the plane. If you want to go from A to B with no service no smiles use them but Turkish is much better.

### Onur Air customer review
Travelled to Ercan on 6th Oct. After reading the reviews I was very nervous about travelling with this airline but had no choice in the matter as it was a package holiday booked through Cyprus Paradise. The flight out was fine we left on time and arrived on time no problems there apart from the cramped legroom space but to be honest it wasn't any worse than EasyJet or Pegasus. The crew were a different matter a more surly indifferent bunch you could not wish to meet. One of the toilets was a problem and smelt absolutely awful especially for those sitting near to it. Nothing was done about it until we reached Antalya and the cabin crew changed over then some air fresher was finally sprayed about. The return trip left on time and all seemed to go well until leaving Antalya when the pilot informed us that we were now going to divert to another airport before going onto Stansted for "operational reasons". Fortunately it was not too long a wait on the ground and we arrived at Stansted just 2 hrs late. As a nervous flyer taking off and landing 3 times was a bit stressful but I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were a lot nicer and approachable. Would I travel with this airline again? No I think I would avoid it at all costs.

### Onur Air customer review
Travelled on the 12/10/14 from Dalaman - horrendous flight. Firstly it was delayed by over two hours and we were offered a soggy lettuce and cheese sandwich which was disgusting. Once on the plane the seats were tiny and leg room none existent. The temperature on board was in excess of 35 degrees and when I asked for it to be reduced I was told it was set automatically - about half an hour before we landed in did drop by a small amount. To little to late. Would never fly with them again.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman to Manchester on 6/9/14. On arrival at the airport we were made aware of a 5 hour delay from other passengers - at no time did check in staff mention anything and we only had it confirmed by the published departure time on our boarding passes. We finally left Dalaman at 23.30 7 hours late! Some refreshments given at 18.00 but again no information. When the flight eventually left there were no apologies from staff and the only explanation given by the Captain was "technical difficulties". Onur air offer poor inflight service expensive goods and rude abrupt staff. I complained via their website using the email address provided for Customer Relations and also the email contact form. I have received no acknowledgement or reply to either. My advice is not to fly with Onur Air but spend a little extra and get a decent airline with proper customer values.

### Onur Air customer review
Travelled to Northern Cyprus on 13th September 2014 on Onur Air. This is the worst airline I have travelled on and will never travel with them again. The airline was delayed 10 hours due to a spare part being needed which they could not get so another plane was flown in at 8pm. We should have left Manchester at 11.55 am and finally set off at 10pm. We arrived at our hotel at 6.30 am on the 14th September tired and annoyed. This was another day of our holiday lost really due to tiredness. The crew on board were very surly never smiled spoke only when they had to and in my opinion need retraining. If/When we travel to Northern Cyprus again it will not be with Onur Air and I advise anyone thinking of going to look at comments given by other people.

### Onur Air customer review
We flew from Gatwick to Dalaman Turkey on September 19th 2014. We had pre-booked our seats on the plane but found someone else in these seats and the staff were either unable to help or simply didn't want to. The staff on the trip to Dalaman were rude unhelpful and spoke almost no English. I tried to explain to one of the staff that there was no toilet roll left in the toilet but was waved away by the member of staff sitting at the front of the plane. The staff then had difficulty finding more toilet rolls for the rest of the flight. The cost of the drinks etc was extortionate and staff had almost no change to give to people who didn't have the exact amount of money to pay for their goods. On the return journey on Sept 26th the staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful they all also spoke very good English. On the return journey we were able to sit in the seats we had purchased.

### Onur Air customer review
Scheduled to depart Manchester at 11.55 hrs Saturday 13th September delayed for just short of 10 hours very little information dripped to the passengers other than a fault trying to source a spare part from another Manchester based airline then an aircraft being sent to us from Munich which was also delayed. The cabin crew on the journey to Antalya obviously knew of the problems because they sought sanctuary behind the curtain at the front of the cabin. When they ventured beyond the curtains it was in pairs did they believe they needed protection. The return journey was the second worst I have experienced. We left Erca about 15 minutes early on the 20th September. The majority of the seats would not lock in the upright position when the aircraft accelerated for takeoff we were all thrown back into the laps of the passengers behind us - surely there are safety measures being breached there. Upon arrival at Antalya where we were supposed to remain on the aircraft we were told to get off and headed into a corner of the departure area. We were told information would be provided in ten minutes I still await this information. Someone did say the aircraft needed a tyre change this does not require the evacuation of passengers and removal of baggage. I now understand it was to transport delayed passengers to their destination. Why was this service not offered to us at Manchester on our departure date an Onur Air aircraft arrived to take undelayed passengers to Dalaman airport.

### Onur Air customer review
Traveling to and from Northern Cyprus on Sept 6th until 20th from Manchester. Having travelled to many parts of the world this trip is the most horrific we have had. Onurair treatment of passengers the seating room cabin crew and food was the poorest we have ever come across. On the return flight we were forced to change planes to allow other tourists to fly to Holland. We were forced to use an Airbus 321 which should have been retired years ago or several rows of seats removed to improve passenger comfort this part of the whole trip was horrendous even for passengers of normal height under 6ft were doubled up. Never Again.

### Onur Air customer review
Would never use this airline again. Flight from Manchester to North Cyprus on 13th Sept. should have taken off at 11.55am finally got away at 9.55 pm. Passengers given £8 voucher after 4 hours to get refreshments in airport. Reason given for delay technical fault with aircraft. This seems to happen on a regular basis according to previous reviews! No refreshments offered on flight apart from one small orange juice each which airline staff tried to charge for but eventually gave to passengers after complaints. On return flight 20th Sept we actually took off 10 mins early (6.20 am) but when we landed in Antalya we were told to leave the aircraft and take all our belongings with us. We thought this very unusual as you normally have to remain on the plane. We were herded into the waiting area where we stood for 2 hours with no explanation as to what was happening. We eventually got to know that the aircraft had been used for passengers from another flight which had been delayed earlier. We were told this was an 'operational decision'.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman - Manchester. Onur Air return flight should have left at 16.30 Turkish time. Advised at check in that there was a delay. Had real trouble getting any answers re the delay from Ground Staff and just left to look at the Departures Board. Plane left at 23.30 so seven hour delay. We did get a burger meal for free at 18.00 and still no idea of when the plane was leaving. Eventually bordered the plane and the pilot said that it was a technical fault. Dalaman Airport is a very expensive airport to be stranded at and costs of drinks and food on plane ridiculous. Pity is that as it is not in the EU cannot claim for the delay.

### Onur Air customer review
The flights were fine although there were delays. The big rip off is the price of drinks and food onboard. £7 for two cans of soft drinks. £2.50 for a bottle of water.

### Onur Air customer review
Outward from Gatwick to Bodrum Turkey no problems coming back worst cabin crew I have ever encountered 2 hours into a flight that was delayed for an hour with no apology before drinks are offered no idea on exchange rates customers overcharged. Asked to speak to purser and all of a sudden no one understood what I was saying. The cabin crew need urgent customer service training a disgrace to the airline industry.

### Onur Air customer review
Travelled on the 1st August 2014 from Gatwick. From 1st arrival no one at the airport knew where we had to check in. Plane was running late by an hour with no staff available. Upon getting on the plane the seats are the smallest most uncomfortable I've ever sat on. The staff spoke no English and were very rude. The flight home from Bodrum was the same with a 1.5 hr delay. Would never fly with them again. I'm angry that a big company like Thomson even put us on them in the first place. Just to finish the food and drink with a can of coke at £4 is the most expensive I've seen.

### Onur Air customer review
Used the Stanstead to Ercan route and returned a week later. Although I can have no complaints whatsoever about the crew or the flights I have strong reservations about the very cramped seating on both journeys. I am just over 6 feet tall and found myself in considerable pain from having little or no leg room. Although it was not the airlines fault the return journey was made worse by taking over 105 minutes in line waiting to check in at Ercan whilst staff hand wrote the boarding passes and luggage labels. It left us with barely 10 minutes to shop before rushing onto the aircraft which then spent over an hour on the ground in Turkey. As it was an early morning flight over 200 disgruntled people finally left the cramped plane. I had a great holiday in a Northern Cyprus but would never want to repeat the experience of bad seating and rubbish checking in procedures. I will look elsewhere in future.

### Onur Air customer review
After reading the reviews I decided I would purchase extra leg room seats as we were only flying return flight with them which I did on the required 20 days before departure. At check in on the return flight from Dalaman there seemed to be some problems as each passenger checked in. When it came to us I showed the check in staff the invoice for our pre paid extra leg room seats only to be told that these seats had been given to other passengers with no explanation. It seemed after speaking to other passengers that their extra leg room seats had also been re-sold. We spent the four and half hour flight in very cramped seating and if it meant never going away again I will never fly with Onur Air again.

### Onur Air customer review
Return flight from of 4.5 hrs Dalaman to Manchester. Major disruption from a large family during the flight children screaming and fighting parents unable to control their young teenagers. It was plain to see that other passengers were getting very annoyed but all wondering what to do should they intervene and probably get into some form of altercation with the dysfunctional clan. The flight staff became aware of the problem but did absolutely nothing about it overlooking it even when I made a comment to them as they passed by serving drinks. It was a thoroughly unprofessional act by the Onur inflight crew ignoring this totally unacceptable behaviour and causing a very uncomfortable journey for those sitting nearby. What is Onur's policy on bad inflight behaviour? The staff certainly didn't know as I asked them on my way off the plane. I wonder what the cabin crew's response would have been if passengers had taken things into their own hands to sort out the disorder? After discussing this situation with friends and family it would seem that this sort of bad behaviour is now very common on board flights. Airline companies need to clarify what is acceptable onboard and dish out appropriate sanctions for those that are disruptive and disorderly.

### Onur Air customer review
We flew from Manchester we were late boarding and no explanation as to why. When we had boarded we were left on the plane for 45 minutes before taking off. The inflight staff were unhelpful and quite rude. When the food had been served they started selling cigarettes and other items without clearing away the food packages. Passengers were left taking the cartons to the staff areas themselves and staff were reluctant to take them. The staff were disorganized and kept pushing past passengers as their trolleys did not seem to be adequately stocked. For some of the time there was no water to wash your hands with after using the toilet facilities. When we landed in Turkey the staff changed and they were somewhat better. The return journey was less stressful but still had its problems. We boarded slightly late. The Pilot explained that we had to refuel and the staff were changing over. It became obvious that something was wrong and we were advised that a tyre needed changing and we had to disembark. We were ferried onto a coach dumped in the airport and then after thankfully a 45 minute wait we re boarded and continued our journey. Thankfully without any further disruption.

### Onur Air customer review
We flew from Stansted and got there early to book extra leg room. My husbands tall and requires this! For three months both Thomas cook and ourselves have been trying to book extra leg room with this airline! The telephone number published isn't answered and the system throws you out repeatedly just when you think you are nearly there and are about to pay for seats. Journey to Antalya was great as a result. Our return was a nightmare. Once again we got to the airport early. Paid for row one 4 seats at 20.00 per seat. Fine if that's what it takes to be comfy. We were happy. When boarding our seats were changed to row 2 but we had paid for row 1. They said sorry but these had been pre-booked. This service didn't exist. As a result we waited for our refund and my husband flew in the tightest space possible. His knees were into the chair in front are the pitches aimed at five footers. He was so uncomfortable. As a result we came home with a bitterness about the holiday and the airline.

### Onur Air customer review
My flights to and from N Cyprus via Antalya greatly exceeded my expectations formed from previous reviews. The Aircraft was clean and punctual the staff friendly and I even enjoyed the flight catering. all in all a good start to our holiday.

### Onur Air customer review
We flew from Manchester to Antakya stopping at Stansted to change some passengers and to refuel. We sat in the plane on the tarmac for ages not knowing what was going on. Eventually the captain came over the tannoy to say that there had been problems with refuelling because the company supplying the fuel would not accept the Captain's company credit card and there had been negotiations between Onur and Shell at high level before refuelling was authorised. Otherwise our flights with Onur Air followed the same pattern as others reported here. Cramped seating crummy cheese sandwiches disinterested staff and not enough to drink. Staff poured more unwanted coffee down the loo than had been offered to the passengers. The loo looked dreadfully stained and dirty as a result. Also one of the loos wasn't working. I don't want to fly with Onur Air again but I do want to go to Turkey again because it is such a wonderful and friendly country.

### Onur Air customer review
Exeter to Dalaman in May. Travelled several times with Onur Air you must remember what you are paying for the flight this is not BA each time I have flown I have found the staff courteous and polite. On one occasion I was unwell and was given extra legroom and was constantly checked. Some of the poor reviews here are petty with people expecting too much for the low price I'm very happy to be an Onur customer and highly recommend them to anyone who wants a no frills flight.

### Onur Air customer review
Outward flight to Antalya on 4th November was basic but fine with helpful friendly crew and sufficient though not extensive leg room so as not to make the flight uncomfortable. As this was a budget flight had no reason to have any higher expectations I also had no reason to believe the return flight 4945Y on the 11th November would be any different. How wrong I was had we known in advance I would have paid extra for seats near the exits with more legroom as when we boarded the return flight there appeared to have been more rows of seats squeezed in to the aircraft leaving insufficient legroom such that it was impossible to even slip your legs under the seat in front properly to stretch them out. I am of average height but had to sit twisted in my seat initially. I started to get an aching pain in my left side so had to stand for a large part of the journey. The staff seemed indifferent and eventually a lady kindly offered to let me sit next to her in an 'exit' seat for about the last 45 minutes of the journey. I am also a coeliac and on the outward flight the staff could not have been more helpful and provided me with more than ample replacement complementary food for the roll offered to the other passengers. Unfortunately when I advised the staff on the return flight I could not have the roll due to my condition she took it away but I was offered nothing further than a cup of water. This may well be due to language difficulties causing a misunderstanding though the staff did seem to speak excellent English but it only further soured the experience. The holiday itself could not have been better but it was spoiled by the return flight. I could not recommend this airline.

### Onur Air customer review
Flew last month from IST to AYT. The flight was delayed over 1 hour without any explanation we were stuck in the departure lounge waiting for the bus to the plane for a long time with no explanation. The plane was hot the seat were cramped the attendants were rude. Served a cheese sandwich. The ticket was more expensive than competitors on the same route.

### Onur Air customer review
Airline too cramped for a 6.5 hour trip from Northern Cyprus to Stansted. It must have been hell for tall people.

### Onur Air customer review
Doncaster to Dalaman. We went on a flight to Turkey on Onur Air and I have to say the flight was like a Ryanair plane but Turkish. The plane has the worst leg room your could imagine. My farther had to stand up for the whole flight as the leg room was uncomfortable to sit in. The attitude of the crew was very bad as they were rude and looked like they had a sour face at the passengers. Although on the way back to Doncaster the crew were not as bad and were polite. The captain never said anything to the passengers like saying thank you for flying or coming out at the end of the flight to say in person. In conclusion I would not recommend this flight to anybody especially tall people!

### Onur Air customer review
Flew with this airline September 2013 from Manchester to Northern Cyprus with a stop in Turkey. Very uncomfortable as hardly any leg room and narrow seats. This was a problem since total time on aircraft was 6.5 hours. Staff were unsmiling and offhand. Definitely wouldn't fly with them again.

Dalaman to Gatwick September 2013. Awful airline would never use this airline again cabin too warm attendants very unhelpful drinks very expensive! We hit turbulence coming into Gatwick would of been nice to have some reassurance from the pilots but we did not hear from them throughout the flight.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman to Doncaster in August 2013. Flight delayed 2 hours no reason given to passengers. Plane was an A320 and was looking rather tired inside the cabin it still had arm rest ash trays. Cramped seating with very little leg room Inflight service came around and I purchased a can of coke at 3.80 euros. I would avoid at all costs as the staff were rude and spoke very little English. Having said all the above the flight was trouble free and we landed safely in good time. Onur really do need to sort its customer service and their pricing of food and drink if it was reasonably priced people would buy it. Think before you book or buy a ticket with this airline.

### Onur Air customer review
Could not fault this airline. It was very good and left on time coming back from Dalaman but going out it was 40 mins late from Manchester. Return flight was very good took off and landed on time very smooth with the captain informing us about the route we would be taking and at what height all in English which was very good for a Turkish airline. The seats and cabin were very clean and tidy not even some British carriers can do that.

Flight from Dalaman to Gatwick on 14th August 2013. Very pleased with the service staff very helpful and friendly. We will definitely fly Onur Air again.

### Onur Air customer review
Dublin - Izmir / Izmir - Dublin. 3rd - 17th Aug. Turkish version of Ryanair! Very cramped seating. Hot stuffy plane. Extremely rude cabin crew. Accepted a currency from me for a cup of tea and came back 10 mins later telling me I lied about the currency - sterling issued by The Bank of Ireland apparently isn't accepted. I explained that I only had that money with me - spent the next 2 hours of dirty looks and muttering stuff. Seat covers coming off half the seats. Incoherent announcements on flight heavily accented and sound of speaker was too hard to understand what was being said. Seats tilt back so far that if you don't have your seat tilted back you have about 5 inches to yourself. Food and drink selection poor and price very expensive 4 euro for cup of tea and 3 euro for water. Never again!

### Onur Air customer review
Stansted to Ercan via Antalya. Flight take off and landing on time. Paid for extra legroom going at £15 each and it was a very comfy flight for a budget airline. Food and soft drinks given both ways was an added bonus (payable on most other budget airlines). The cabin crew were very good and I agree with the last review saying that it made a nice change not to be hassled into buying something all of the flight! On the inward journey we couldn't have extra legroom seats but the plane wasn't full at the back so we used the empty seats. All in all a good experience with Onur air and would use them again.

### Onur Air customer review
Manchester - Ercan via Dalaman. Left on time and arrived early. Food average and baggage allowance good. No checking for excess charges. Extra leg room on return was money well spent. What I liked about Onur Air was that they were not always trying to sell products. Overall I was impressed.

### Onur Air customer review
Manchester to Ercan via Dalaman - paid for extra legroom at MAN and these seats were good as they did have a lot of extra space. Flight left on time and check-in was good. However there was a problem with the Cabin Crew in that they did not speak very good English and their announcements were very difficult to understand. Given that most of the people on board were English their lack of their ability to speak our language was very bad. Meal we were supplied with was alright and we were given plenty of drinks. Stop-over in Dalaman was a bit tedious and no- one came near us when the Crew changed over - not offered any refreshments on the flight over. Return flight was OK but the reception at Ercan Airport was disgusting. We were waiting in a queue at 3.30 in the morning and the ground staff were just laughing at us all standing waiting to be "processed". On the whole the flights were OK and the service on board but their lack of speaking English was I feel disrespectful. However the flights were on time but long particularly having to wait for approx. 45 minutes in Dalaman before travelling onwards to Ercan.

A320 from Cork to Izmir on 14th July 2013 and returned on 28th. Aircraft was shockingly cramped. I regularly fly with Ryanair and have never experienced such restricted legroom as on this aircraft. Similarly the ability of the cabin crew to communicate with the passengers was limited by the indecipherable announcements over the PA in Turkish and heavily accented English. Flight itself was incident free and punctual and they used the airbridge in Cork airport which was a pleasant change from Ryanair. I would be very reluctant to book a package holiday with any company that uses this airline.

Travelled from Stansted Airport to Ercan via Antalya. Flight on an Airbus 320 on June 2nd 2013. The flights were on time seats ok but rather cramped. Staff were pleasant but the meals provided were poor although there were plenty of soft drinks and water provided as part of the service. It would be much better if they could fly direct to Ercan without the stop at Antalya. I would put them on par with easyjet.

### Onur Air customer review
We have just returned from Northern Cyprus and flew both ways with this airline. I have never flown in a plane with such a small amount of leg room if I was flying for about an hour it would have been ok but not for 6 hours. The food was disgusting a mouthful of soft drink was served with the meal and a tiny can of beer cost £4.20. I wont fly with them again.

### Onur Air customer review
Dublin to Izmir for a week. Never before experienced such discomfort on flights different aircraft type used outwards and return. Both flights were stifling complaints to cabin crew ignored. On the return flight the person making the safety announcements had deplorable English and the announcements were garbled. Other passengers on both flights were complaining about the cabin temperature and in both cases leg room and seat spacing was inadequate. Seems like this is a common complaint about this airline. They even charged outrageous sums for drinking water on board. Will avoid in the future.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman to Manchester on A320. The seats were cramped with very little legroom. The sandwiches which were offered at an astronomic price ran out half way though service so the remaining passengers had to make do with crisps and sweets at teatime. If you didn’t pay by euro the exchange rate was extortionate. Never again.

### Onur Air customer review
Dublin to Antalya return flights on-time 4 hr 15 over shocking legroom in seats! Quite expensive for onboard food in euros. Crew were fine. Return flight painfully slow boarding was given row 12 lots of leg room but no seat recline as exit. 4.40 mins return flight time. Crew were unbelievably rude dismissive and had a serious attitude. I won't fly them again.

### Onur Air customer review
Just flown back from Northern Cyprus both flights were very good especially the return flight. The cabin crew were great the plane very modern and comfortable. Inflight drinks and food were better than most other airlines.

### Onur Air customer review
Dublin - Bodrum - Dublin 9th June. Delayed 1hr but pilot made good time. A fairly new plane nice crew. All in all a pleasant journey going and coming. Just one gripe quite - expensive on board for food and drinks.

### Onur Air customer review
Stansted to Ercan stopping for 45 minutes in Dalaman. Airline staff seemed a bit frosty. No smiling at customers. I had read the reviews about the airline before we travelled - they were pretty accurate. After allowing us one drink they didn't seem like they wanted to give anyone another. When tea and coffee came round they had run out of milk. Staff on the return seemed more relaxed and more approachable.

### Onur Air customer review
My husband and I flew to Dalaman and on to Ercan Nicosia return. We were onboard for over 6 hrs with only one small meal and an even smaller drink provided. While we can understand a mean meal what we cannot understand is the meanness of the beverage provided. There were no offers of any kind of drink even at a charge. Cabin staff appeared to be more concerned with their own comfort and gossip rather then attending to the passengers' needs.

### Onur Air customer review
Travelled from Dalaman. The Cabin was clean and staff polite but the air con was never turned on fully so we all roasted even after many requests from not only us but other passengers. We purchased a can of coke and was charged £3.60 this is mad. All items of food or drink were priced at this level. We complained onboard if they could sort out Air Con and prices for refreshments we might consider using them again.

### Onur Air customer review
My friend and I travelled back from Dalaman and found poor customer service delivery. Staff were unsmiling and off-hand initially we put this down to the language barrier and cultural differences. I had fallen asleep on this evening/night flight and as sitting on the outer seats ensured I positioned myself away from the passageway so as not to be bumped by other passengers. I was woken up by one the stewardesses pushing her serving trolley and knocking into my shoulder. On her way back she did it again. However as I was awake this time I asked pointed it out that I had been barged into the stewardess just looked blankly at me in an intimidating manner. Then smiling sarcastically apologised. Later when asking to purchase milk for my 4 year old daughter I was told that they had no milk no apology no smile and no offer of an alternative. Overall the staff serving the back of the plane were surly and rude.

### Onur Air customer review
Flew back from Northern Cyprus. Overall the flight was very good apart from a very bumpy landing. Generally the flight was good with friendly staff average free food and soft drinks.

### Onur Air customer review
I have used Onur Airline on a few trips to Turkey. The plane was fairly new and the boarding was great the staff were very good friendly and helpful we were delayed for 1hr but the pilot made up the time. The passengers gave the pilot a very loud applause on both journeys but I think this is typical of us Scots. Just to inform you Onur Airline still hands out free pillows and blankets not like other airline companies where they want you to purchase them. I will certainly be using the airline again.

### Onur Air customer review
Manchester-Ercan via Bodrum. Outbound flight was on time aircraft was fit for purpose. A meal was served and soft drinks were free again ok. Asking for wine was a prolonged process. crew were changed at Bodrum and no service was offered. The return flight was on time but after a night stay at Ercan I expected a clean plane which was not the case. As the outbound flight ran out of milk this flight had no bread rolls yet clearly meant to. The cabin crew suggested the jam was for the chocolate cake! Surly crew no please or thank you. Very disappointed but no choice of other carrier.

### Onur Air customer review
Bordrum-Glasgow (OHY3616) crew were nice very helpful gave sweets to children. They were much nicer than some of the crew I've flown with before for being a budget airline. I think they are superb no delays and arrived 40 mins prior to expected time.

### Onur Air customer review
Stansted-Ercan via Dalaman Airbus A321. Flight was early on the way out on time on the way back. Cabin was basic and in reasonable repair. Leg room a little cramped (am 6ft did not pay for extra leg space). Free meal and (non-alcoholic) drink on Stansted-Dalaman leg. Crew service was fine if a little slow and slightly surly. Some interesting flying from the pilot! Overall experience was OK but would pay more to fly with a different airline in future.

### Onur Air customer review
Dublin to Izmir return under charter (Thomas Cook). Staff were friendly and professional. Food and drink were available at Ryanair like prices. Only problem was plane was delayed by 3 hours on the return flight.

### Onur Air customer review
Istanbul to Izmir in late May. Cabin crew friendly and professional. Drinks were free but not food. Return flight was delayed due to late arrival of plane. Overall good experience with hour-long flights.

### Onur Air customer review
Stansted to Ercan via Dalaman. Outbound flight ok apart from paying £50 for extra legroom seats only to find when we boarded we were in standard seats - trying to make surly staff understand not the easiest of tasks! Return flight 5 hour delay due to technical problems and again problems with seat allocation.

### Onur Air customer review
Doncaster to Dalaman return. Flights on time both ways legroom was adequate. Staff were fine. All in all much better than anticipated.

### Onur Air customer review
East Midlands to Dalaman return. The whole experience is budget with no inflight entertainment or food provided - take your own. The refreshment prices on board are very steep £3.50 for a can of pop take your own or be ripped off. I suppose you get what you pay for. The plane did look a bit tired with sticky tape over holes in the arm rests and the seats are crammed in economy style. A four hour flight was enough.

### Onur Air customer review
Bodrum - Manchester. Flight took off on time seatS pretty good. My wife was taken ill half an hour into the 4 hour flight. Crew reaction was superb an empty three seat row was organised and a call for medical help resulted in a doctor coming forward. Wife was made comfortable during the remainder of the flight with regular checks by doctor and crew. Made Manchester ok and wife now recovering. Well done Onur Air for your staff training and care.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman - Newcastle : flight was changed 4 times between 3rd August and 10th Sept. Finally 3 days into our holiday we were voicemailed on our mobile to be informed that our flight home had been cancelled leaving us to purchase a suitable alternative. This caused enormous expense and distress. When we got to Dalaman Airport for our flight home (with a different airline) we found that our original flight was in fact flying. I would not recommend this airline and would never use them again. They seem very disorganised and have no customer care.

### Onur Air customer review
Would avoid using this airline again. Bristol to Dalaman flight OK plenty of leg room with no extra charge however Dalaman to Bristol was a nightmare  flight was put forward to 3 o'clock instead of 5'clock and whilst checking in the board said Bristol and Newcastle so we had to ask what was going on. Without any notice we had to fly to Newcastle and then to Bristol which extended our flying time to 6 hours. I think this is appalling considering they didn't give us any free refreshments or an apology! You get what you pay for.

### Onur Air customer review
Aircraft were new staff were fine even gave sweets to the children) legroom the same as other airlines and drinks and food were comparable to UK budget carriers - cheaper than Ryanair. This may not be Emirates first class but it is a good service.

### Onur Air customer review
Shannon to Izmir return. Flight on time both ways. Flight was good excellent leg room. Got served food both ways prices a bit high though. The cabin crew were nice and friendly.

### Onur Air customer review
Birmingham to Dalaman. Asked for extra legroom seats and got extra legroom at no extra charge. We were given seats together in stated row - other people said you sit where you like this was not the case. Check in and boarding no problems. Took our own meal onto plane as they do not serve a meal but snacks trolley onboard - quite expensive but available if you want it. had coffee at £3 each. Plane comfortable and fairly new better than previous Thomas Cook flights we have flown. Cabin crew friendly pilot kept us updated no delays.

### Onur Air customer review
Teeside to Dalaman return. We took our own food both outbound and inbound purchasing liquid refreshments in the departure lounge. Legroom was fine on the outbound flight but was more restricted on the inbound flight but there was premium seating on the inbound flight so it may have been possible to upgrade. The cabin crew were friendly and seemed happy to attend to requests. I felt safe and secure. I agree that food and drink purchased onboard is highly priced but similar other airlines so take your own food.

### Onur Air customer review
I flew with Onur Air to Dalaman. We did have a late flight but on boarding the aircraft it looked fairly new and was comfortable. Cabin staff were ok there to do a job which they did well. At the end of the day this is a budget no frills airline and you get what you pay for - as far as safety was concerned I felt fine.

### Onur Air customer review
Glasgow-Dalaman return. Having not flown Onur for many years they have improved. Planes seemed new and legroom excellent - staff at Dalaman offered us extra leg-room seats without asking. Didn't buy any food or drinks on the plane as had been advised that it was expensive although no different to Ryanair or Easyjet. Slightly disappointing to have no communication from Captain but cabin crew relaying messages and coming through cabin collecting rubbish. Returning cabin crew less attentive and in general a bit more dour.

### Onur Air customer review
Flight on time both ways. Cabin crew are weird giggling through the safety procedure both ways. Bought two coffees - £6 and they give you a cup of hot water with a sachet of Nescafe - they had no idea why I found this incredulous. They do a lot of playing about with each other and giggling - really irritating.

### Onur Air customer review
This was the most uncomfortable plane I have ever flown on. The leg room was appalling and I am not very tall. Staff were rude and didn't seem very vigilant re seatbelts. There was no proper safety announcement. Refreshments were extortionate. Only plus points were that there were no huge delays and baggage came off very quickly but baggage is more down to the airport than the airline. Would try to avoid flying with them again if possible.

### Onur Air customer review
Leeds to Dalaman. 23.5 hr delay going out. No safety instructions when boarded plane - this could be because they knew we weren't really gong to depart. No word from pilot before during or after the flight. Plane dirty no pillow or blanket. Staff only around during inflight sales. Prices extortionate so didn't buy anything to eat or drink. 1 hr delay when coming back. Knew what to expect so had brought own food and drink. No apology or explanation for either delays.

### Onur Air customer review
Edinburgh to Dalaman return. A320 looked fairly new and was clean. Both journeys took off on time and landed early. Outbound crew pleasant captain updated on progress/weather conditions throughout the flight. During turbulence while the seatbelt signs were lit passengers getting up to go to the toilet etc and the crew ignoring this! Descent into Dalaman was very rushed plane seemed to drop very quickly resulting in a few worried faces among the passengers. Return journey crew not so friendly and the captain only spoke once to announce commencing the descent. Overall good value for money.

### Onur Air customer review
Leeds to Bodrum. We travelled with Onur Air to Bodrum and pleased with this airline. Both flights on time staff very friendly and helpful legroom was far better than previous Thomas Cook flights.

### Onur Air customer review
Newcastle to Dalaman return journey. On time both ways very good. Terribly uncomfortable seats metal poking through and loose wires hanging out of armrests. But what made us decide to never fly with this airline again is the rudeness of the staff on both journeys. Everything was just too much trouble where did these staff receive their training to attain such attitude!

### Onur Air customer review
Birmingham to Bodrum return. A320 seemed fairly new adequate leg room more than on recent flights with Thomas Cook or Thomson. Safety announcements in Turkish and English and were a bit rushed. Inflight service was quite basic but acceptable for a budget flight although staff could take a little more care checking seat belts are fastened. I think we were probably lucky in having one of the newer planes in the Onur Air fleet but would use them again. Good value for money.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman to Manchester good value for the money. Safety Information shown on screen was good. No entertainment but did not bother me as it was an early morning flight. They sold beverages and snacks on board a packet of Nescafe white instant coffee and hot water cost 3 Euros. 4Euros for a can of lager or soft drink. 3 Euros for a bottle of water. Cabin Crew seemed pleasant. The leg room was poor in Row 11 so could not get comfortable for sleeping. Airplane seemed in good condition and modern.

### Onur Air customer review
Newcastle to Bodrum. My complaints - that there was very little leg room the cabin crew who hid behind a curtain for most of the flight. Cabin crew much better on the return flight -I would recommend Onur Air they are a budget airline and you pay for what you get.

### Onur Air customer review
Liverpool to Dalaman. Cabin crew were pleasant and enough seat room. Plane was cleaner than previous flights with other budget airlines. No entertainment but going out was a night flight so just slept. Coming back piped music played throughout the flight. I would have no hesitation in recommending Onur Air.

### Onur Air customer review
Bristol-Dalaman return. BRS check in fine very fast got the seats we wanted. Comfortable seats enough legroom I'm 6'2" and could stretch my legs out. Snacks and drinks are a bit expensive but around the same as Easyjet and Ryanair. Attentive cabin crew several runs of the snack trolley. Arrived in Dalaman early. Return trip pretty much a copy of the outbound. Arrived back at BRS 30 mins early. Would use them again.

### Onur Air customer review
Luton-Bodrum. Flight on time fast check-in. It was a 3x3 configuration and asked for an aisle seat and told we'd have to sit adjacent both on the aisle (no different to other budget airlines). Glad we did that on this airline as there's no doubt in my mind that the seat pitch is one of the smallest for a budget airline. Width OK but neither of us is remotely tall yet the pocket on the seat in front was brushing my knees even when empty of the things I usually stuff in it! Seemed quite claustrophobic for those by the window and middle worse if the seat in front gets tipped back. Plane in good condition clean and everything that was supposed to work was working. Cabin staff a trifle remote - is smiling banned? Tin of Coke cost £2.70 and assume everything else was expensive too. Followed advice on this site and took our own drinks/snacks. Inbound comments a week later would be the same as those above asked for 2 aisle seats and got them but passengers behind us not so lucky. Stewardesses smiled a bit more this time. During turbulence they walked down the aisle halfheartedly checking seatbelts were done up but weren't bothered if they couldn't actually see. Both directions they seem to get the luggage off fast - assume quick 'turnaround' required. Safety briefings in English. All in all I'd use them again though not necessarily as my first 'budget' choice - need another couple of inches between me and the seat in front.

### Onur Air customer review
Newcastle-Dalaman. Asked for extra legroom at check-in and got it at no extra cost. Flight on time plane clean and staff quite polite. Drinks no more expensive than say Thomas Cook or Thomson Airways. Legroom in ordinary seats looked average announcements for safety ok but quite rushed and quiet. Dalaman-Newcastle return on time no issues with the flight other than an older MD-83 aircraft which was more cramped. Quite funny to see the cabin crew sleeping however during the flight - not sure about the safety aspect of that.

### Onur Air customer review
Manchester to Bodrum was great quick check in and fairly comfy plane seats although we were a little disappointed there was no entertainment - but that was our own fault for not checking! Never buy food on a plane anyway so that wasn't too much of a problem. Coming back we found the journey quite itchy and upon arrival at Manchester found ourselves covered in bites. These appear to be either bedbugs or fleas caught off the plane. We are now in the process of complaining.

### Onur Air customer review
Teeside to Bodrum return. This is the third time with Onur this year and about 8th time overall in the past 2 years. Flight had a slight delay of about 45 mins on the way out and was on time returning and I have not yet ever had a delay of more than 1 hour with most departures on time. The planes are fine legroom no better or worse than some others and the cabin crew tend to be a bit reserved. The drinks and snacks are always costly so no surprises there but the main thing is that the flights have been without problems.

### Onur Air customer review
Gatwick to Dalaman - a typical no frills airline. The worst part of the process is checking in - the queues at Gatwick were ridiculous. We arrived 2 hours before the flight and by the time we had checked in and got through the long security queues our flight was on the last call. The flight was okay and I felt safe enough with Onur although the plane did look pretty old and the legroom was probably the worst I have ever had. The staff were friendly enough but ours was a night flight (leaving at 10.25 pm) and they didn't ever turn the lights out so if you want any sleep on a flight don't fly Onur!

### Onur Air customer review
Have used Onur Air for the last 2 years. Flights on time aircraft fine and have had less legroom with other airlines. Take your own food and drinks as in flight snacks and drinks require a second mortgage.

### Onur Air customer review
Manchester to Bodrum return - you clearly get what you pay for. Only two check-in desks at Manchester for three flights. Such a throng of people you had no way of knowing if you were in the right queue. Flight on an A300-600R aircraft which was designed to have 8 seats in a row in a 2-4-2 configuration but Onur Air cram an extra seat into each row in a 3-3-3 configuration. This means all the seats are very narrow and seat pitch can't have been more than 29 inches. Both flights an hour late departing with no explanation. Impossible to sleep onboard (our returning flight left at 4am!). Worrying signs - brackets on the cabin wall where extinguishers and emergency torches should be but weren't there. Bathrooms disgusting. Staff rude. Safety demonstration only in Turkish!

### Onur Air customer review
Just got back to Edinburgh from Bodrum with Onur Air. The checkin and flight out was quick and painless although the pilot sounded half asleep when adressing the passengers - only ruined with the outrageous prices for drinks etc on the plane but like others have said you don't have to purchase them. The flight back was on time - the thing people have to remember is that you're booking a flight with a budget airline and you get what you pay for.

### Onur Air customer review
Gatwick to Bodrum. No problems drinks and food expensive a bit cramped. The A321 took off on time and arrived early. Give this airline a shot if money is tight.

### Onur Air customer review
Durham to Bodrum return excellent fights on new aircraft. Good service much better than easyjet etc staff very nice and helpful. Drinks expensive but we knew they would be and took our own onboard.

### Onur Air customer review
Onur was a satisfactory airline. The staff were pleasant if slightly reserved and the food. But a very comfortable flight. If I were to suggest an improvement it would be that Onur Air should have some inflight entertainment. We flew for 4 hours from Durham Tees Valley to Dalaman and it was fairly boring.

### Onur Air customer review
We had a terrible flight out with extremely cramped seats. The return from Antalya to Manchester was a bit better but crew were rude and unhelpful. When I politely asked if I could have a pillow for the night flight home I was told there were none. I asked why since it was a night flight and the stewardess just snapped back "Don't ask me". She tore the complaints form out of the flight magazine and told me to fill it in if I was unhappy. Wonder where that finished up as it was just to be handed to the cabin crew not even in an envelope! !

### Onur Air customer review
Gatwick to Bodrum Found the fact that our row of seats seemed to move considerably quite alarming! Very cramped and the staff not very friendly. Refreshments very expensive. Return flight chaotic boarding as we were allowed to board both ends of the plane. Turkish passengers obviously more favoured! But it was cheap!

### Onur Air customer review
EMA-Dalaman return.The flight out was on time - we were lucky enough to be allocated extra leg room seats. The announcements were not brilliant and the food onboard is very expensive - but you dont have to buy it. The return journey was on time and although we sat near the back of the plane the flight was comfortable.

### Onur Air customer review
IST-Izmir. Check-in was painless and a separate counter for those checking in without bags. Boarding a bit chaotic as the announcement was shouted out only in Turkish. Plane was an old MD-80; seats were old but otherwise the plane was clean and appeared well-maintained. Crews friendly and welcoming. All drinks/food must be paid for but it's not a big deal on a 1 hour flight. Legroom very good for economy class. I'd recommend them for domestic flights in Turkey.

### Onur Air customer review
Belfast to Dalaman. Good flight both ways no delays. Staff friendly flight from Dalaman to BFS had TV screens showing a map of where you were Bought food and drink on-board as Onur Air do not do in-flight meals a tin of coke cost €4.00 which in uk pounds was £3.50 - so if you dont want to pay big prices buy some food and drinks before you board your flight. Safety demo in English and Turkish nice plane.

### Onur Air customer review
BHX to Dalaman airport. Good flights both ways on time normal check in no delays. Staff were friendly flight from Dalaman to BHX had communal TV screens showing us a map of where we were quite interesting! Didn't buy any food or drink as pricey so bring some with you (4 hour flight) but that is what you get for cheap prices! Good safety etc. Saw some very distressing safety reviews of Onur Air before I left which were worrying but the safety levels turned out to be high and both flights were smooth. Would fly again.

### Onur Air customer review
Manchester to Bodrum return. Both journeys on time - homeward journey actually landed 30 minutes early. The plane was clean and not crowded - we had 3 seats for 2 going out and many coming home had the same perk. Loads of legroom and the seats reclined so well that I was able to sleep on both Journeys. OK food and drink are expensive but Turkish airports must be the only ones in the world that allow you to take liquids through. We took sandwiches from home and snacks from the resort. I did not find the attendants any different to those on other charter flights. bAll in all the flights were a vast improvement on Thomas Cook Turkish flights and I would have no hesitation in using Onur Air again.

### Onur Air customer review
Flight to Dalaman from Gatwick with my husband 6 year old and an 18 month old baby. We hadn't prebooked our seats but sat together on both trips and sat 3 rows from the front. We found the seating not cramped and our son liked sitting on the floor on the way back. The flight out was fine only 30 minutes delayed and crew were brilliant with our children. Food was a bit expensive but we took our own so that didn't bother us. The return flight was on time and crew were very friendly again. I did forget to mention the weight you are allowed. It is 20kg and they are very hot on this and were getting people to empty their cases or pay the fines and this was at Gatwick and Dalaman and the cost was £5.00 per kilo you were over.

### Onur Air customer review
Just been to Dalaman from East Midlands. The crew on the outbound flight were not very polite or friendly the seats on the plane were set very close together and drinks/food etc very expensive! I would recommend you buy water/food from the airport before boarding. The inbound flight from Dalaman was slightly better.

### Onur Air customer review
Dalaman to East Midlands. All seemed well on route to the airport with the tour operator saying that our flight was on time and leaving at 1930hrs - we check in go through passport control and get to the gate ready for boarding. Then staff tell us that we have to leave the gate as our flight is delayed one hour. We hear no more until 2045hrs when we are told that the flight will be at 2300hrs - the flight disappears completely from the screens with no update from anybody as to what is going on. We then get the flight back on the screens saying 2330 estimated time of flight then we are told that is the time the plane will get there next thing we know we are looking at a screen saying 0130hrs the next day. My seat allocated was 31B - imagine my surprise when I got onto the plane to find the rows only go up to 28?. We are told just to sit anywhere. We finally arrive East Midlands at 0530 go through immigration to luggage claim - only to find that Onur Air had not put any luggage for any passenger on the flight. We did get a semi frozen meal onboard as an apology - says it all really.

### Onur Air customer review
Gatwick to Bodrum return. The flights were on time both ways but that is the only positive thing I can say . We had row 10 going out - the seats don't recline so that when the passenger in front reclines their seat you are left with absolutely no room to move. Considering the rows are so close together anyway this made our flight the most uncomfortable we have taken. In addition the plastic cover on my arm rest had disappeared leaving me with a sharp metal frame to rest my arm on - how dangerous could that be if a child got that seat? On the return journey we were lucky enough to be able to recline our seats which made the journey marginally more bearable. Yes no frills yes no comfort and yes extortionate prices for food (if available) and drink (6 euros for a small can of beer - around £5.40! No Onur Air you would not be my airline of choice again.

### Onur Air customer review
I was delighted to discover at Newcastle airport a modern clean aircraft together with attentive staff. Flight excellent the safety instructions delivered in perfect English and easy to follow. Drinks/food at no greater cost than the average budget airline. On our outward journey we were offered extra legroom at no extra cost. The extra legroom on the return flight was already taken but since there were only 55 people onboard that hardly mattered as we were all able to occupy a row of three seats and have a few hours sleep on the early morning flight. Onur Air was an excellent flying experience and one which I would be happy to repeat.

### Onur Air customer review
Shannon to Izmir - flight was delayed by 30mins. There was no food on the flight - I would expect a 4 hour 20min flight would surely have more to offer than just KitKat. Staff were lovely and very sorry they couldn't provide the food we expected.

### Onur Air customer review
We left Gatwick for Antalya on 29th May one hour late boarding what looked like a very old aircraft indeed. About 2 hours into the flight the pilot announced he would be making an emergency landing at Vienna Airport due to a problem with an engine and that he would give more information once we had landed. The cabin crew looked as worried as many of the distressed passengers. After a very heavy landing we were eventually taken off the aircraft. We were then held in Vienna for 10 hours while an aircraft from another airline was found to take us to Antalya. When calling them regarding the return journey we were informed that they same aircraft would be used. Needless to say we decided to purchase another flight from another airline (Thomas Cook). A quick Google search will reveal a number of similar stories over the past 4 years (worse in some cases) and reports that the airline was banned from four European countries recently over safety concerns.

### Onur Air customer review
Dublin to Izmir Turkey 4 hour flight no food on board not even sandwiches. I asked for a can of coke and was told there was none. I asked a second flight attendant and was told the same. Ihad to ask 3 attendants before I got my coke - very annoying. We were assigned seats that didn't recline  the ones in front of us did so we had seats stuck in our faces for the entire flight. I flew back return today and same thing no food available to buy. I should include that the flights were not delayed by much. The staff were friendly but at the end of the day a 4 hour flight should have some sandwiches available. I heard some people got some sandwiches at the start of the flight but none left by the time the attendant got to our seats.

### Onur Air customer review
we travelled from East Midlands to Dalaman. You get 5kg extra luggage allowance with Onur Air free sweets and cake on the outward journey and the aircraft wasn't as shabby as Thomas Cook. Okay the cabin crew dont smile a great deal and the food and drink is so expensive onboard.

Gatwick to Dalaman return. I was pleased with both flights. There's not much legroom but no less than any other budget airline. There's no inflight meal/drinks service but I knew this in advance and took my own. At the end of the day you get what you pay for and I was perfectly happy with what I got.

Durham Tees Valley to Dalaman. Staff friendly modern fleet and are good on space. They offer no in-flight entertainment. The toilets were clean and overall are no different to jet2 or easyjet.

### Onur Air customer review
Birmingham to Dalaman on 24 Oct. Flight left on time and was comfortable enough. Took our own food as had been warned food on board was expensive. We were notified a week prior to our outbound flight that the return flight had changed and was much later. Didn't mind too much gave us an extra day in resort. However when reconfirming return flight travel agent said time had not changed but our transfer company told us flight was now over an hour later! After going to departure gate were informed of technical problem and flight delayed again! Flight left at 2.30am on 1st Nov. We were one of the last to check in and got 2 seats in row 2 (fine) and 3 seats in row 35 the worst on the plane! Right at the back and seats bolt upright no recline - these seats should be banned! Staff could use some customer service training not very helpful or friendly.

Return from Dalaman to Manchester incurred 6 hour delay as arriving aircraft suffered technical fault and taken out of service. Full marks to Onur Air for getting replacement so quickly and a larger A321 with more legroom. Have used Onur Air many times as they are cheap and reliable - normally. Happy to go without entertainment and canned music. Crew pleasant and helpful. Baggage allowance still 20Kg which is more than some rivals. Suggest they go back to cooked meal and free drinks and add cost to ticket as two trolley services plus duty free is a waste of their time and keeps us awake unnecessarily. Would use them as preferred carrier to Turkey.

Gatwick-Dalaman return. Good value airline staff pleasant leg room good and no delay apart from 15 minutes on return journey. Take your own food as airline food is expensive (so is Dalaman airport). Would use again.

Dalaman from Gatwick return. Only had a short 15 minute delay on return. Planes clean leg room okay and staff were fine. We were travelling with a 3 year old so was dreading long delays but had no problems. Took our own food and drink on both journeys (bought return flight stuff from resort as airport is expensive). Announcements on the planes were in English with a heavy Turkish accent so we couldn't understand them.

Having rearranged our flights because of XLAir had little preconceptions about ONUR Air except that it was a budget Turkish airline. We left on time were treated well and for the 4 hour flights to and from Bodrum were perfectly satisfied. Even the leg room seemed marginally better than most budget airlines. Food and drinks on board are extortionate so recommend taking your own. This does mean you will have to pay airside prices for any drinks you take so decide whether those are more than £2.50 for a standard can of fizz on the plane and make your choice! Or take fruit instead.

Party of 8 adults flying from East Midlands to Dalaman. Check-in at both ends was fast & efficient with our group seated together. Our outbound flight was delayed by 3.5 hours but given refreshment vouchers (although as this was a late evening it seemed even more tiring) and inbound flight about 35mins. We had been advised there was no entertainment and food is expensive so we had taken provisions of our own. The staff were attentive enough and we were informed of delay reasons. Planes were ok if a little tired and leg room seemed to vary. Onur Air is a budget airline with no frills and doesn't pretend otherwise - all in all you get what you pay for.

Birmingham to Bodrum. The seat was uncomfortable and my knees were touching the seat in front the whole time no matter how I sat. The plane was old food trays were damaged and would slope so anything put on them would end in your lap. Quite a few of the seats were stuck in the reclined position. The flight back from Bodrum was delayed by 2 hours - as many have said Bodrum airport is a rip off (£5 for a standard 330ml can). So take food and drink with you - Bodrum doesn't have the same controls over liquid and food like the UK. We did know there wasn't going to be entertainment and the tv's just repeated the same promotional tourist info every now and again which became annoying. The flights were cheap and you get what you pay for. I did however find it too uncomfortable for the 3.5-4 hour flights.
