### "Very pleased with the experience"
I really rate Rex airlines. On time both ways. Helpful staff. Free snack and comfy seats. All for $140 return. Very pleased with the experience & would choose to fly with Rex again

### "Thank you for refunding my ticket"
Not Verified |  Thank you to REX Airlines for refunding my ticket which was nearly 12 months old that was cancelled due to COVID closedown. I had not realised that this facility was available and when I approached REX they  informed me they would refund the money. Thanks so much.

### "handled everything beautifully"
My recent return flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast with REX Airlines was excellent. Everything from booking to disembarking on the return flight was easy. The staff were friendly and professional. Given that CV19 issues are currently dominating travel within Australia, I felt REX Airlines handled everything beautifully.

### "We were most impressed"
Not Verified |  This was a 4 day Southwest Gourmet Tour of Tasmania. The same aircraft stayed with us the entire time. It was a great size and seemed very efficient. All staff were very friendly and professional. We were most impressed.

### "one of the best flying experiences"
My family and I were amongst passengers on the first ever Gold Coast- Melbourne REX flight. We had one of the best flying experiences ever. Despite the technical issue, which was sorted out quickly, the crew remained polite and attentive. The passengers kept informed and updated, excellent service on board. Big heartfelt thanks to all flight attendants, Tup, Lucinda, Jordan, Tanya, Nicole and others. You have made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. Special thanks to the pilot, this was the softest take off, flight and landing ever. With endless compliments we highly recommend REX airlines to everyone.

### "a fresh choice for Australians"
I flew on the new jet service this weekend past and I was really pleased - no, delighted - with the experience. The check-in teams and boarding teams at both SYD and MEL treated me like a valued customer and couldn’t be nicer. The crew were welcoming and continued that valued experience through to disembarking, and the ramp team handled my bag and delivered it without worry to me. The in-flight magazine’s page about in-flight exercises was really difficult to read. And I didn’t know it was a cash-bar only, I wanted to buy a drink but I only had my credit card. Also, Manage booking has been down for a while now. Otherwise, a fresh choice for Australians that places the customer’s airport experience at the core of the experience.

### "very much appreciated this kind gesture"
Not Verified |  I attempted to book a ticket online to travel from Dubbo to Sydney late 2/9/2020, for a 3/9/2020 flight. It was indicated that there were no seats available for the 3/9/2020 flight, so I booked for 4/9/2020. My Sister was dying in the Martor Hospital in North Sydney, and her Family called me 3/9/2020 to say she was in a critical condition. I phoned Rex, and spoke to a lovely Customer Service person. This person could see that I had tried to book online 2/9/2020, and said even though she was not supposed to, that she would change my flight from 4/9/2020 to 3/9/2020. Thanks to this wonderful person, I was able to be with my Sister before she passed on 4/9/2020. If I had taken the 4/4/2020 flight, my Sister would have passed before I got to say goodbye. I very much appreciated this kind gesture.

### "Consistently delayed"
Townsville to Cairns. Unreliable. Consistently delayed and then cancelled at the last minute with no warning. Worst airline in Australia by a long way. If you're booking with REX to save $50 or get a flight a couple of hours earlier/later don't risk it, just book with the real airlines.

### "commend flight attendant Georgia"
Not Verified |  I flew with Rex on 4 flights recently between Lismore, Sydney and Wagga, and return. All flights were on time, comfortable, and the service was very good. I particularly wanted to commend flight attendant Georgia on the Wagga - Sydney flight. She exuded a genuinely warm personality in every aspect of her work, from the friendly smile and pleasant voice to the competent service.

### "We were very impressed overall"
Amazing customer service - review delayed due to ill health. In May I was flown by Royal Flying Doctor Service to Adelaide where I spent 6 days due to a sudden, acute illness and after which I flew with your airline to Broken Hill where we had left our caravan so we could return to our home in Sydney for further medical care. Among the passengers on the flight were an elderly, frail woman and a woman returning to her regional home after shoulder surgery - I was feeling pretty fragile myself. We were all at the front of the plane and my husband and I were really impressed with the flight attendant, Abby, for whom nothing seemed too much trouble and who was very mindful of the particular issues the elderly lady and the post-surgery lady, both travelling alone, faced. Abby had a delightful demeanour and the service she provided was both efficient and compassionate. We were very impressed overall.

### "worst customer service"
Merimbula to Melbourne. The reception guy was extremely  rude with no customer service at all. We are from Western Australia but our luggage, instead of Melbourne residers', was picked out to be not coming back with us from Merimbula to Melbourne, due to weather condition. I missed out the announcement because I was outside of the waiting room. The guy at the reception at Merimbula did not have any empathy, or patience to explain the situation but rush and threaten me if I don't do as he said quickly he will let the pilot know to depart without me. The most frustrating day and the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life.

### "delighted with customer service"
I was flying today from Albany to Perth and was particularly delighted with the customer service from Kiara. I am flying almost every week with different companies and I haven’t had a better flight attendant. It is very challenging to make people comfortable on a small plane like Saab SF340, but her attitude makes it very different experience. She is smiling and very friendly, very understanding in difficult situation.

### "the least reliable airline"
Perth to Albany. Rex is the least reliable airline I have ever flown. Around 50% of the flights I take are late and often by 4-6 hours. The worst thing is the late and casual way they inform you about your delay. You are typically 30mins from boarding and receive a text that the plane will leave in x hours and no excuse is given. I think they are half way through the contract on this route and I hope they lose the franchise. If you actually get on the plane, it is ok but cramped and tired. But you really can’t rely on Rex at all.

### "worst regional airline"
Perth to Albany. This is the worst regional airline I have ever had to fly. They are always late with very poor communication. Fortunately for them, there is no competition in the routes they fly. Otherwise they would not have a business. They should be ashamed of the poor service they provide.

### "kindness has humbled me greatly"
Not Verified |  Just want to say a big ‘thank you’ to Julie in customer service! We had an unexpected death in the family & I had to change my teenage sons flights to get him home early. Julie was so kind & made sure the flight crew were aware that he may be a little emotional. She even went as far as to ring me an hour before his flight to reassure me that they were going to keep an eye out for him. Thank you. Your kindness has humbled me greatly.

### "highly recommend REX"
I have flown with Reginal Express or 'REX' as known locally several times previously. Last Thursday 14th February 2019 I boarded a flight back home to Adelaide from Mount Gambier where I had been on a business trip. I was greeted by Carly who was our flight attendant for the flight. I was pleasantly surprised by her level of service and professionalism. I can say every other time I had flown REX the service was good, although on this day it was outstanding. She made everybody on board feel welcome, she provided snacks and drinks to all passengers and walked the aisle regularly to enquire if any of the passengers required anything, I'd like to personally congratulate her on her level of service, well done! I would highly recommend REX to anyone flying regionally within Australia.

### "a very enjoyable experience"
Monkey Mia to Perth. The flight attendant Kiara was such a delight. She was so welcoming and made every effort to make the flight as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Her personality was a delight. I was lucky enough to have her on my return trip to Perth. So much nicer than the Virgin staff (Melbourne to Perth) who could barely crack a smile. Thank you for a very enjoyable experience.

### "always delayed, overly expensive"
Sydney to Griffith. Always delayed. Overly expensive. Overall experience is beyond poor. 70% of the time I experience delays. The only reason I fly with REX is because no other airline goes to my rural destination. I understand delays are sometimes unavoidable, however, that should be the exception, not the norm!

### "customer service is poor"
I have been flying to work with Rex airlines every week since December between Burnie and Melbourne. Unfortunately it is the only airline operating in this route so I have to put up with their poor service. 80 percent of the flights have been delayed. The customer service is poor so that you can`t even get a proper explanation why your flight is delayed. In one instance, my checked baggage got damaged while traveling from Melbourne to Burnie. My damage claim got rejected on the basis that the damage is reasonable. I just feel bad that I am a regular Rex airlines customer.

### "relaxed approach to service and punctuality
Perth to Albany. Rex has a relaxed approach to service and information and punctuality. On board is very convivial - nice genuine service for the short flight, and with the pilots saying hello before you step up on board. But everything else can be weirdly substandard for 2018. Out of the last 8 flights on this sector, half have been delayed or cancelled. The fun starts with the latter. Little information or support is provided when things go wrong. You will receive no direction in writing what to do so listen carefully to the gate announcement if the plane is cancelled. Recovery flight at 7am. Be at gate around six". That’s it. If you gave a hearing or sensory impairment, you are a bit doomed. There is an option to purchase a $5 insurance for delays at every ticket purchase. Probably a good deal given the frequency of delays. But little information on Website what to do if a delay. Also if the west coast, the call centre closed. So good luck! In summary, drive Albany to Perth if you can. If you can’t always purchase the insurance and make contingencies on travelling for business as it is not reliable. But if you get onboard and away on time, it is not an unpleasant experience!

### "the most outstanding cabin service"
Hats off to Rex for once again delivering the most exceptional service on their 7.20pm service from Melbourne to Albury on Friday 27th April 2018. From check in to boarding, from a laugh with the first officer at the foot of the stairs at how cold it was on the tarmac at Tullamarine, to the most outstanding cabin service. A particular staff member looking after us in the cabin always goes that extra mile to ensure not only mine, but everyone's comfort on board.

### "by far the best customer service"
Early morning Flight with Regional Express from Sydney to Moruya on 16 March 2018. The flight departed on time and was very comfortable. A huge thanks to the sole flight attendant on board. Not only was she cheerful and professional, her attentiveness to all passengers was by far the best customer service I have experienced in such a long time. 10/10!

### "Absolutely fantastic service"
Flew Mount Isa to Cairns. Absolutely fantastic service! Travelling with an infant at the age of 6wks on my own was a little daunting but Regional Express made the trip so comfortable and reassuring for myself and my baby. Would fly with them over a larger airline anytime. Thank You Rex!

### "reassured and comforted them"
My husband, 2 young boys, aged 4 and 7, and I flew to Merimbula for a holiday and we were allocated 2 x 2 seats in consecutive rows. My boys chose to sit together and my husband and I sat directly behind them. As we ascended, both of them started to panic, one feeling sick, the other saying he couldn’t breath. There was quite a scene which all passengers were witness to. I’d leaned forward to reassure them, but was obviously constrained by my seatbelt whilst the seatbelt sign was on. Our flight attendant, when safe to do so, came directly to my children’s side, knelt down to their level, and reassured and comforted them. She was completely forthcoming and generous in her care. My boys were instantly calmed.

### "Genuine customer service"
Armidale to Sydney. A great country airline. Genuine customer service and hospitality. The whole experience was fantastic. The online booking was easy. The check in procedure was great. Onboard the solo flight attendant was exceptional. The catering was excellent. Comfort and safety outstanding.

### "offer my profound thanks"
I would like to offer my profound thanks to all Rex ground staff and our flight attendant for making my day of retirement so overwhelming. I have been travelling to Whyalla to work as a diagnostic sonographer for many years and I travelled back to Adelaide from Whyalla for the last time two weeks ago. The Sunday prior, on my arrival in Whyalla, Gavin met me at the airport and gave me the most exquisite gift of some miniature origami pieces he had made himself, a gift that moved me to tears. On the following Friday, on my departure for Adelaide, most of the Rex ground staff were there to farewell me with hugs and a very moving card. When I boarded the plane, Claudio indicated my seat which was festooned with a farewell sign and a bottle of wine! After giving his safety briefing, Claudio announced to the passengers that I was retiring and when he came with drink/snack service, I was presented with my own special cake! These wonderful people have looked after me for so many years and I consider myself so lucky to have known them.

### "delayed nearly 3 hours"
Regional Express flight from Albury to Sydney delayed nearly 3 hours. We were notified 45 mins before planned departure however not the reason. If this was a mechanical delay then it's reasonable to expect that if it is fixed early we can board early so we continued to the airport. However on arrival, we find it is a 'crew rest' delay so there is a fixed time delay which passengers should be notified about so that they don't have to wait in the airport while the crew sleeps.

### Regional Express customer review
Flew ADL-PLO recently. Staff member at the gate was very unprofessional always on his mobile and was very dismissive of my query. Showed little interest in providing any level of customer service something as simple as boarding the 36 passengers on the flight seemed to be an inconvenience for him. On board flight attendant on the other hand was outstanding and looked after everyone on board very well even booking me a taxi inflight. Inflight service pretty good tea/coffee with snack and a Mentos for landing. The plane itself was very old being a Saab 340 I expected this but the plane has not even been modernised and the cold water tap in the toilet had been decommissioned and replaced with hand sanitiser. All up Rex operate like an airline that knows it has a monopoly on many of it's routes given the conduct of their ground staff and condition of their planes.

### Regional Express customer review
I had the pleasure of flying this excellent little airline from Melbourne to Albury and return recently and have to report two excellent flights. The aircraft the Saab 340 was really comfortable and ideal for the 40 minute flight. I was really delighted to be greeted by the captain and solo flight attendant at the entrance of the aircraft and on both sectors. We were served tea coffee or water and offered a savoury or sweet snack. I was also really surprised about how comfortable and spacious the seating configuration was and I look forward to flying with the airline again. Well done Regional Express.

### Regional Express customer review
This has become the worst airline in Australia from one of the best. I used to live in Wagga Wagga and regularly used Rex and it was fine then. Now I only use it to fly from Moruya where we have a second home to Sydney and it is always a really unpleasant experience. The check-in and gate lounge staff are really rude at Sydney (every trip it is the same) and the flight attendants are unpleasant and seem untrained. At Moruya the ground staff always seem very unprofessional. Last time (late January 2015) we had to fly to Moruya via Merimbula and were told to leave our hand-luggage on board and so I left a magazine on board. When I returned it had disappeared. I went up to speak to the flight attendant anxious whether cleaners might have removed it and taken it into the terminal and we might take off without it. She ignored me for several minutes before finding it (she had removed it - although we had booked the same seats right through of course - and the plane wasn't full so she should even have remembered us!) and returning it without a word of apology. I am hanging out for the day when another airline services Moruya and I never have to fly Rex again. We could get to Moruya from our home airport of Melbourne via Merimbula and a drive from there but instead we choose to fly to Canberra with any other airline and drive from there as we hate flying Rex so much.

### Regional Express customer review
Flew Albury-Sydney return and what a great experience. Flight was delayed by about 5 mins departing Albury but assured we would land on time which we did. Service from single cabin crew was great with tea and coffee offered with a biscuit and a pack of snacks. Return was also great with pilot greeting us at the stairs and we took off pretty well on time. A bit bumpy out of Sydney which were warned about but cabin staff looked after us and landed in Albury about 5 mins ahead of schedule. Overall it was flying as it was meant to be.

### Regional Express customer review
SYD-LSY (Lismore)-SYD: this is a great little airline: good aircraft good service at check-in nice personnel service on-board and Lismore Airport and its terminal are a delight. I only wish REX serviced the main trunk routes in Australia as a 'boutique airline'. On-time performance and luggage arrives into the terminal before the passengers arrive.

### Regional Express customer review
Flew Sydney-Albury with my 18 month child great friendly service at check in gave my daughter her own seat at no extra charge since plane was not full. Pram was over weight but accepted still free of charge cabin crew were just as great gave personal demonstration of how to put a child's life vest on. Was asked to wait for everyone else to leave the plane first in Albury before us and the flight attendant assisted us off with our carry on right through to the terminal. Would definitely fly with Rex again.

### Regional Express customer review
Albury-Sydney return in 2 days. Great service on the ground and in the air. Albury is a small regional airport so no lining up to check in and all done with a polite smile. Boarding very organised and I had paid extra ($4.00) for an exit row seat. One flight attendant who did a great job explaining what that meant. Took off right on time and landed in Sydney a few minutes late due bad weather. In flight we were offered tea or coffee and a snack and also water. Return trip was also great with the same seat (6 A) and the service was excellent. Landed 20 mins ahead of schedule and bags delivered at about the same time it took to walk to the terminal. Overall a great airline which serves many areas of regional Australia.

### Regional Express customer review
Merimbula to Sydney. This was my first trip with this airline and overall the experience was a positive one. Check in at Merimbula was efficient and polite. Boarding was on time and the hostess for our trip was extremely charming  smiling and chatting to passengers throughout the flight. Once in Sydney we were quickly bussed to the terminal and there was a very short wait for bags. Also found their fares quite reasonable if you book far enough ahead.

### Regional Express customer review
When the flights work its a good service but 8 trips and 1 that is on time is not uncommon experience to orange residents. Constantly late constantly diverting to Bathurst constantly "caught by surprise" with busses and planes not working. Take my tip hire a car or catch the train/bus its quicker (6 out of 8 times I would have got there before the plane) and much cheaper.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney to Albury. The fare was cheaper than some rivals on the route. Everything worked like clockwork from check-in to arrival. Check-in easy and friendly. Bussed out to the plane in a timely and orderly manner. Cabin comfort was quite reasonable given the size of the aircraft (Saab 340). The flight attendant gave personal and friendly service throughout the flight offering seconds of tea/coffee. The flight crew gave periodic updates including the fact that we were arriving 15 minutes early - amazing for such a short flight. The flight attendant personally checking with every passenger during the flight to ascertain if anyone wanted them to book ahead for a taxi and the offering of sweets prior to landing were charming touches. I'd happily fly Rex again.

### Regional Express customer review
Great airline but sadly airfares costing too much nowadays. Yes regional services are more expensive but why fly when a 2 hour car journey is far cheaper. Staff at BWT generally are rude arrogant and do not provide a friendly service. Trying to connect to other airlines from REX is a nightmare because of the huge disparities in luggage allowance and even worse when you connect to an international flight.

### Regional Express customer review
Coober Pedy to Adelaide. Nice experience. Check in at a little Bungalow in the desert friendly ground staff. Unhealthy snacks like chips or something sweet but they also offered drinks. Seatback was not able to recline.

### Regional Express customer review
SYD-Wagga. On time and friendly. Offered complimentary tea/coffee/water and a sweet or savoury snack for 1hr 15 min flight. My only concern with Rex is that with the props going it is very difficult to hear the flight attendant over the PA. Otherwise good and hard-working airline.

### Regional Express customer review
SYD-Parkes return travelling alone so had A seat (config is A-aisle-BC) the SAAB 340 is a good little plane and smooth. Friendly and efficient attendant both sectors. Tea coffee water and biscuits or chip snack served on this short 45 min flight. Good landings booking check-in boarding all quick and simple and the bag was on the carousel in Sydney as soon as I got inside.

### Regional Express customer review
Adelaide to Broken Hill return. What a great regional airline REX is. Our flights left and arrived on time. Boarding was pleasant and effective. FAs were pleasant helpful and efficient. A light snack was served on both flights. Check in fast and pleasant. Well done.

### Regional Express customer review
Have had to travel to Albury a couple of times over the last 3mthsand decided to try Rex. Check in staff at Sydney very friendly and helpful. Can't say same for Albury staff. There is no country charm from these check in staff. Perhaps Rex need to give some Customer service to these outlying ports where no one does regular checks on them. Cabin crew nice although on a one hour flight with only one cup of tea and snack rubbish not collected until top of decent.

### Regional Express customer review
Adelaide to Port Lincoln return. Inflight service is the best service includes choice of coffee tea wine or champagne + light snack muffin or savory snacks.

### Regional Express customer review
Early morning flight form Sydney to Wagga with a return the next day. Both flights departed on time and the cabin crew member on both legs were friendly and genuine. On each flight a coffee/tea and biscuit served - bags were on carousel by the time I reached the terminal. The bus trip out to the plane from the terminal at Sydney adds a nice touch and gives one a different view of the airport. This is a fantastic little airline with a real charm about it and its service standards are truly something to be admired. Well worth flying with.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney - Lismore / Ballina - Sydney. Efficient and pleasant check in procedures in Sydney. Unlike Jetstar this airline does not view baggage overweight as a revenue stream. My first row seat was very noisy and I later learnt that it is the rear seats that enjoy a lower sound level due to the location of teh engines. The one hostess on board worked hard at serving our full flight of 34 pax with a cookie & coffee. Plenty of seating leg room on the Saab Turboprop but the toilet is really for emergencies only. Small and not designed for anyone higher than 5'5'' or wider than 34" waist. All in all a great little airline. Well run and worth flying with.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney-Ballina-Sydney. Was really impressed with both flights. The small cabin was not an issue on 80min flights. Seats comfortable and adequate room. Only recommendation is to not take too much carry-on baggage as there is limited storage space. Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack - either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either tea/coffee/water. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. I'd recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar. I payed less than half for the REX airfare than what the other two were offering and was twice as happy flying with them.

### Regional Express customer review
Melbourne to Albury and return. Great flights both ways. Very comfortable middle sized twin- turboprop Saab 340 seating 11 rows of 1+2 pax. Leather seats very comfortable and mounted quite high giving you lots of leg-stretching room. Wide too compared to Airbus A320. Pleasant FA's each time adequate snacks available. Only downside is that the taxes and fees more than double the cost of the fare so the choice between using this shorthaul route and hiring a car and just driving there is closer than it looks on first quote. Highly recommend Rex if you don't mind flying in smaller aircraft than 737s or A320s.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney-Narrandera-Sydney return 27 August-29 August on Regional Express Airlines also known as REX. Great flights with good clean quiet cabin (no loud overhead pop music thank heavens!) good service with coffee and snacks and very pleasant smiling attractive FAs. I like the Saab 340 and also now generally prefer REX to Qantaslink partly because of the use of pop music over the PA system on Qantaslink these days. Remarkably quick baggage collection at REX in Terminal 2 at Sydney Airport partly because I suppose one has to travel by tarmac bus from the aircraft parked at very remote stands from this terminal and that takes some time. However it is an interesting journey. A nice professional airline and look forward to flying with REX again.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney to Orange return. First experience with Rex. Compared to some of the larger domestic and international carriers Rex provided excellent service and warm friendly crew on both legs. Although only a 45 minute flight each way we were still provided with a snack and hot beverage. Baggage collection at Sydney was outstandingly quick. We'd fly them again. The checked baggage limit of 15 kg per person could provide a challenge for some people.

### Regional Express customer review
Have flown with Rex 3 times Sydney - Albury and have a few more sectors booked. Small Saab aircraft - but that means quick boarding and disembarking! Relatively comfortable and flight crew very fast and efficient. Always with a smile. Although you wouldn't want to be taller than 6'3" (I'm 6'3") to sit in their seats - unless you can secure the emergency exit row! A pleasure to fly with.

### Regional Express customer review
MEL BWT return; relatively easy check-in & boarding. On short (1 hour) flight tea/coffee & nibbles served by friendly FA. A minor problem was in the different configuration of the aircraft (all are Saab 340). On outward flight there were overhead lockers above the "2 seat" side of the aircraft but on the return when we had extra carry-on there was none. Fortunately the flight was only half full so we could store it under the next seat. They do a good job for a regional airline.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney-Griffith return. Comfortable trip although the Flight Attendant was very 'grumpy' going to Griffith. Refreshment was a glass of water and packet of savoury 'nibbles'. The return flight was equally comfortable although we were treated to an aerial tour of Sydney courtesy of ATC and the only airport in Australia that qualifies for Third World Status.

### Regional Express customer review
SYD-GTH-SYD-CMA-SYD over a few days. REX is a charming airline with excellent staff attitudes. Check-in in Sydney was very good. On arrival at your destination the First Officer hops off the aircraft to welcome you to your destination. Aircraft are Saab 340s. You might be lucky and get one with sheepskin covers on the seats. Good coffee or tea and a snack is served. Once again its the 'little' regional airlines that seem to be trying the hardest for their passengers.

### Regional Express customer review
Sydney to Albury  Staff at Check-in genuine warm and inviting. On time departure on small and very full plane no room for much baggage. Just over an hour flying time . One crew operation and I was looking forward to a bubbly friendly crew member however this Hostess was abrubt and rude. Most of the short flight she stood in the flightdeck with door wide open talking with the flight crew. A little girl sitting opposite me travelling alone ( 6yr old ) pressed the call light 3times to no avail of the hostess. This was my first experience with REX and maybe I should try again as most comments posted here are positive.

### Regional Express customer review
I fly each week with them and their service standards have to be amongst the best in the world. Last year they flew for the first time 1 million plus passengers to have no complaints on this site is a plus. Well done Rex.

### Regional Express customer review
REX Is now flying to Cooma/Snowy Mountains airport as of 10th June (starting at AUD$129 one way all inclusive I think it's on the web). A number of airlines have tried to make it successful but it hasn't worked but with REX already having a good reputation and more financial support I think it might work. My only worry though is that the Airport is at 960m above sea level and is right on the Gt Div Range and it's flat and between to other ranges it is a pretty bad wind tunnel and if it snows (which is quite often in winter maybe once every 3 weeks) will the flights be cancelled?

### Regional Express customer review
Flew REX from Sydney to Lismore January 2005. Friendly check in staff flight attendant was very friendly. Small D8 style aircraft but I felt safe. The landing made for some great views landing into Lismore.

### Regional Express customer review
In response to Alan Hume's post - Rex has just ditched it's Canberra-Sydney route. Bad news all round as Qantas is the only one flying to Sydney. I am predicting a sharp rise in CBR-SYD fares. Why should Qantas lower them? Who have they got to compete with? The flipside of the coin however is the leisure market and hopefully demand for low fares will ensure this remains the case.

### Regional Express customer review
Also recently flew REX from Sydney to Canberra. Very friendly check-in staff member gave me Seat 6A (Emergency Exit) and was very friendly helping me as it was my first REX flight. Plane was small but comfortable. Kath the flight attendant was constantly smiling and helping passengers. Were given some water and mentos for the 30minute flight. I will definitely fly REX again. But unfortunately now the Sydney to Canberra service has been axed and Qantas now has a monopoly. Shame that REX has dropped this route but according to their website there are a few reasons why it's been unsuccessful.

### Regional Express customer review
Recently flew Rex from Armidale to Sydney. The prices here just keep going down its fantastic (was 98 now 86 on special). Great cabin really friendly crew. A bikkie or packet of chips and a cuppa are quite sufficient though perhaps not so great if you're raher hungry but for a quick flight its just fine. Coming back from Canberra it was a really windy day and lots of flights were cancelled. Rex booked me at no cost onto both the CBR-SYD and SYD-ARM sectors. Perhaps my only gripe was trying to quickly speak to a rex person in Sydney checkin - the supervisor wasn't wearing anything that made her obvious and I actually thought she was just another passenger. But all smiles and repeat business here.

### Regional Express customer review
Yes I have to agree. I mean Rex has an excellent product but it should be focusing on regional routes. The simple fact is we are largely a "Qantasised" nation now and that's all there is to it. Alan Hume is right it's all about power and prestige and status (And sucking up to George W). What a self-centred bureaucracy this is turning into.

### Regional Express customer review
Rex has ditched its MEL-CBR run and has given notice that it will soon do likewise with the SYD-CBR service too if Govt business doesn't increase. The problem is unfortunately one of status and prestige. Exec Govt business fliers do not like "small" turboprop aircraft being bussed to the terminal from the aircraft having to declare to their colleagues in Qantas Club that they are flying Rex etc. etc. They like to be waited on hand and foot and have Business Class-size seats waiting for them at the end of a sealed corridor. It's a status/prestige thing that's all. If Rex could afford to operate midsize business jets on these premium services they would get more Govt business. Since this is not a viable option for them it must focus on regional services and forget the major trunk routes I fear to remain solvent.

### Regional Express customer review
I had pleasant flight on REX  I had both SYD-CBR and CBR-MEL.... well done for Rex. Even though the costs and fleets they are using nowadays can't beat virgin and qantas but the service are unbeatable..overall I think they deserve more supports from all of us

### Regional Express customer review
Flew SYD-Ballina return on 6 & 10 August & very pleased with on time departures & early arrivals. Sole crew very friendly & helpful & fares very affordable compared to Virgin & Qantas on same route. Even my late check-in at SYD 15 minutes before take-off handled very efficiently & helpfully-unlike Jetstar these days. Flts not full and request for extra leg room seat very helpfully handled. Their promised new low fare regime deserves to be supported by Aussie passengers.

I recently flew with REX from Adelaide to Melbourne and return and found them to be excellent. The staff were very friendly at checkin and on board - it was only 10 minutes longer than on other airlines (due to smaller aircraft) but the checkin was swift the baggage collection also efficient and all-in-all the same amount of time from checkin to baggage collection as with larger airlines (no huge queues at checkin or collection). Comfortable seating adequate snacks served on board. Wouldn't hesitate in flying with REX!

Yes the last couple of comments about REX are 100% correct. I fly with them up to 2 return trips a week from my regional NSW home so feel I am in a position to give an accurate and impartial view. The check in service at my regional airport and Sydney is outstanding the friendliness of the staff and the on time departures and arrivals(usually) is outstanding compared to the other players in the market.

In response to a comment made on December 31 yes absolutely. Rex in my opinion help to keep the spirit of Ansett alive and I would be overjoyed for them to reinstate their Canberra-Melbourne service. There isn't much competition on that route and it would be good to see all of Australia's remaining three airlines serving it.

### Regional Express customer review
Flew Rex from Sydney - Canberra last month and was pleasantly surprised by the level of service that is provided by Rex on such a short route(45min or so) Cabin hostess was extremely down to earth and friendly catering was quite good and we enjoyed breathtaking views on landing in Canberra. All in all I like Rex and think they should reinstate their Melbourne - Canberra service.
