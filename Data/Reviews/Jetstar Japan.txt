### "weighing everyones luggage"
I would not recommend. Flying out of Narita they were weighing everyones luggage. When I bought my flight I paid for extra weight to 14kg. Then at the airport I was over by 3kg and had to put the heavy items in my jacket until I got under the weight requirement. Not a fun thing to do. I probably won't fly with them again.

### “makes Ryanair look customer friendly”
This has been the worst airline experience in Asia. Jetstar Japan makes Ryanair look like a customer friendly airline. We booked one flight Asahikawa to Takamatsu via Narita and they didn’t check our luggage through so we had to pick it up in Narita and check in again for the second leg. We were charged twice for having a few kilos over the limit and paid 9000 JPY extra. The ground staff were rude and it was impossible to reason with them. Never flying Jetstar again.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |   This is the worst airline ever. The ground staff will make you pay even if your bag is 1 cm over height limit or whatever, so you will have to pay to get that bag into the check in instead. In a country like Japan where it has the best services in the world, why is Jetstar Japan’s Narita airport ground handlers so rude.

### "Worst airline I’ve flown"
Worst airline I’ve flown in 22 years. I started off finding out that the flight was delayed only an hour before the checking in time at the airport. At the checking in counter, there was a very long line and there were only 3 functioning desks when it said that there would be ten. Although there were one or two counters with ground crew seated at the desk counter. They allow people to pass through other people without regard for those who were in line way before. After getting past immigration, the information of the gate was different from the gate that was placed on the boarding pass, so confused passengers went back and forth to the gates. When most of the passengers confirmed why the marquee was publishing a different gate from the boarding pass, the ground crew said they will correct the error, which they didn’t. On the correct gate, it still showed the original time and not the delayed time. Of course, when the time for boarding arrived, they had to announce again that boarding will be slightly delayed again. The money that you save from getting this airline is not worth the aggravation that you will undergo!

### "particular on weight and size"
CTS airport is not equipped for boarding people quickly. They have one line with four people to check in bags which they are very particular on weight and size. The bottle neck this and their security makes creates a situation where you need to be there 2:30 early or you will be in line. While it is a cheap airline they should not leave  an hour late only because they can not check everyone’s bags quick enough.

### "You get what you pay for"
Website ok for booking. Check in and bag drop ok. Boarded late, seats were non reclining and legroom ok fi you are small, but at 5'10", really cramped. Flight left over 30 minutes late. You get what you pay for, and I didn't pay too much

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. They cancelled the flight 6 hours before my flight time. I had a connecting international flight the next morning. The agent at the airport asked me to book with another carrier and promised that the airline would reimburse. I did so. However, when I made the claim , the airline is now refusing to reimburse. Completely unethical. First they cancel last minute due to some issue they have. Then they refuse to offer me alternatives for the next 24 hours. The agent asks me to make my own arrangement and the claim a reimbursement. However, the airline now says "sorry" Terrible. Would suggest fly anything else but not Jetstar Japan

### "make you pay for a 1 kg excess baggage"
The worst economy airline. The ground crew has no consideration at all. They will make you pay for a 1 kg excess baggage. Don't get fooled by their cheap price tag.

### "did not allow to bring the baby stroller"
Not Verified |  We were travelling on a family of four with 1 yr old and 4 yr old kids. Airport are ok and easy accessible the only problem we had is upon checking in they did not allow to bring in the cabin the baby stroller Cybex brand which is cabin approve. Instead they checkin it in and we suffer to carry our infant. Good thing airport is providing the stroller. Salute to Centrair Airport. In addition to they are always late in accepting to checkin passenger maybe they are very strict in checkin baggage and hand carry make sure to bring what is allowed kg.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  It's one of the worst airlines I've ever encountered. The self-check-in machines malfunctioned. They said they were fixing the problem and made all passengers wait until it was resolved. However, it turned out they couldn't fix the issue and suddenly asked all passengers to line up for manual check-in. Unfortunately, we were among the passengers who arrived early, but their sudden change of plan caused us to end up at the back of the line. To make matters worse, they changed their gate later. If we hadn't noticed this sudden change, we might have missed our flight. Additionally, they announced that passengers with children could board first. This decision seemed quite ridiculous because the boarding order should depend on seat class, and since all passengers were in economy class, it should have been based on seat positions, starting from the back to the front. Allowing passengers with children to board first wouldn't have expedited the boarding process. Ultimately, their poor problem-solving skills resulted in a one-hour flight delay.

### "the worst airline I’ve ever flown on"
Not Verified |  By far the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. Garbage company that doesn't care about their customers and their managers don't do any work - just want to squeeze every last half penny out of you waiting to hear your deathbed queef - forcing you to 'UPGRADE PLEASE' aka you can't take your normal sized carry on luggage over 10 lbs you have to pay us an extra $40 or else you can go with another company. They literally said to me 'you should just refund your ticket and go with another company if you don't pay us more money 'at the gate' - never go Jetstar - never ever again. Shame on you and your customer service and representatives. Everyone needs to know how bad and money hungry your company is. I will be speaking with my credit card company and disputing all the charges you and your representatives forced on me. Wouldn’t fly with this airline and put up with your staff if I was paid to do so.

### "Hidden fees not clearly stated"
Hidden fees not clearly stated leaded to overcharging a special offer ticket. Staff unable to explain in English why charging extra fees supposed to be already paid with the ticket. Onboard, poor legroom for an average height man like me, poor quality of seats and interior, no food or water unless pre booked. Do yourself a favor and book with someone serious, (maybe) you'll spend more but you'll bless those money.

### "not fly Jetstar Japan again"
The communication from staff is the worst of any airline I've flown. We waited at the gate yesterday with the airline claiming the flight was on time until after the expected departure time. Finally 5 minutes after our expected departure time they announced the flight was entirely cancelled. JetStar Japan took no accountability and refused to help anyone rebook, explain what happens to the overweight bag costs they had already charged, or anything else you'd expect. Thankfully JAL got us rebooked, sadly connecting with Jetstar Japan again. Now day 2 trying to fly a 1 hour flight with Jetstar Japan, they're over 20m late and are still claiming they're on time. Will we fly today to make our connection with JAL to the US? No idea. Me and hundreds of others who found out after departure time yesterday that they had cancelled wait on tenderhooks .. cancellations and delays happen. The complete lack of timely communication or support is a disgrace. I'll not fly Jetstar Japan again, nor JAL if it requires connection via Jetstar Japan.

### "The worst flying experience"
The worst airline I have ever booked through, they charged us $100 extra even though we had transferable tickets. And we paid extra for a heavy bag and when we got to the check in counter the made us take stuff out of our bag to make it lighter. When we got the gate to leave there where no seats to sit in. The worst flying experience I have ever had.

### "left almost all passengers’ baggage"
They left almost all passengers’ baggage in Narita. We boarded the plane at 7:50pm (flight is at 7:35pm) We waited in the aircraft for another hour, everyone was asleep, saw the staff in front talking seems like there's a problem. Then the gates closed flied out at 8:50pm. When we arrived in Manila, there’s a baggage falling out on the baggage counter machine. After 20 bags fell, the staff shouted “There’s no more bags” in Tagalog. mind you there are foreigners here. They asked us to go to the baggage assistance counter. All this time Jetstar crew did not inform us while we were at the plane. It took us 3-4 hours in the line at the baggage counter and they cannot given us an answer. Now it’s been 3 days of calling, emailing and messaging Jetstar, they just say to wait for the case manager. They said there’s no compensation for this. It's been almost 4 days now, and still they do not answer and no info on when can we get the bags or is it still alive is it not lost? They just want your money! If you dont want to experience what most of us passengers did. DO NOT BOOK THIS AIRLINE! Mind you they have a Japanese staff which are supposed to be very nice, helpful and above beyond service. For the first time, these are the worst Japanese staff I've experienced. They are not friendly, rude and they do not care at all.

### "horrible experience"
Osaka to Tokyo. It was a horrible experience. We had our flight at 6.35 PM and the journey was only for 1hour 25 minutes from Osaka to Tokyo but the delay was around 3 hours and they don’t even apologetic for this whole mess! Because of this we almost miss our Last connecting trains. They gave such a lame excuse for this problem and didn’t offer any other options (except money return). At that time no seats are available on other flights so we had to wait for that flight only!

### "Every flight was perfect"
Tokyo to Fukuoka via Osaka. Four domestic flights on Jetstar Japan. NRT-KIX, KIX-FUK, FUK-KIX and KIX-NRT. Every flight was perfect from check in to boarding to inflight experience and baggage claim. One flight was better than the next. All crews professional on every level. Everything was organised, civilised, and punctual. I suspect this is more reflective of Japanese culture than Jetstar's competence, but give Jetstar credit when due. In Japan, poor customer service, disorganization, lack of punctuality are all non-existent and not acceptable. Jetstar Japan embodies this. Far and away the single best discount airline experience in memory. Significantly better than most 'full service' carriers. The rest of the industry could learn a few lessons from Jetstar Japan, as they are the gold standard in my opinion.

### "check the weight from the bag"
Kagoshima to Tokyo. Don’t use it if you are travelling around Japan. They sell them self as if they are a very cheap company but it is not. They check the weight from the bag you can take with you in the plane. From here everything ok as always is less than 7kg. They also ask you to add if you have any bag extra such as presents. My bag and my hand bag was 8kg and I had to pay ¥3100. The lady told me to put my purse in my pocket and as much things I can. I mean of course before enter to the plane I’ll put everything back in my hand bag! Definitely don’t use it if you are travelling around! 7

### "Almost missed my flight"
Chitose to Nagoya. My boarding ticket showed that the boarding time was at 14:00 at gate 201, so I was already at the gate at 13:30. I waited till 14:15, and still no call for boarding. I did not approach the crew because they looked busy waiting for other passengers for the flight bound for Narita. Until I heard that it was already the final call to board the flight bound for Nagoya. I was very confused as there were no prior announcements. If there was any announcement even in Japanese I’d understand. There was not any notice as well at gate 201. Shame on you Jetstar! Such poor service! Almost missed my flight. Will never fly Jetstar again!

### "it was a big mistake"
Not Verified |  My friends and I chose to fly from Shanghai to Tokyo with Jetstar and it was a big mistake. They cancelled our flight on the last minute because of bad weather conditions. After they cancelled our flight, they refused to refund our money insisting that we use their voucher to book another flight with their airline. Dont make the same mistake as we did and stay away from Jetstar. If there's another airline that can get you to your destination, go with them instead. Save yourselves from the hassle, the stress, the waste of money and all the bad experiences that comes with flying Jetstar.

### "bad customer experience"
Tokyo to Osaka. Very bad customer experience at check in. Expect everything to be weighted including all carry-on items. We are traveling with a toddler (who has here own ticket and seat, so carry-on item) couldn’t take our stroller to the gate but had to check it in. And they wanted us to sign a waiver for the stroller being ‘unsuitably packed’. We won’t be flying with jetstar japan again. Matt

### "Talk about money grabbing"
Tokyo to Manila with Jetstar Japan. Disgusted. I was charged 50$ because my hand-carry luggage was 1cm too wide. Literally. One. Centimeter. I have never had any issues of this sort with this particular carry-on luggage with any other airline before and I had travelled with it many times. Talk about money grabbing.

### "First and last experience"
Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong. First and last experience. Got to the airport three hrs in advance. No checked baggage only carry on. Done the online checkin prepared the boarding pass screencap but didn’t print it out. Got rejected at entering custom because they require a hard copy. 2hrs before take-off. Back to the single sole queue they have opened for my flight. Stood for 15 min long no forward movement of this queue with at least 30 people in the front. Tried local printing service but failed. Asked online checkin counter for printing just the pass, got rejected (how remarkable they have 2-3 counters with the check in counter included at that time). Requeued. 45min before take off, tried another single sole general counter they opened, got accused of not fulfilling my responsibility, seeing me queuing this general line as treating myself special thus reluctant to provide me with such priviledge that kind of attitude. She complied finally saying no next time, (this is also what I think in mind), ordering me to weigh my carry on and from her attitude she expected them to be over-weight so that I could be further accused. I understand rules are rules and customers are not king, but does it have to be this way? I did do my part, just not knowing they need hardcopy this time (last time I departed from T2 there is no need I got straight o the gate with my carry-on) Furthermore, who could have known this company with rude ground staff has only one sole check in counter operational for the whole flight without any automation aids. Not to mention all I need is the pass printed while the queue was full of customers with checked baggage. Epic failed in operational perspective.

### "canceled while we are waiting"
The Jetstar from Narita to Osaka canceled while we are waiting for boarding around 10pm. All they can do is try to book the next morning flight. They dont help for booking hotel or transportation. They don't even suggest what we should do. They tell us go to Haneda airport for next morning fly. We are from US, and are near 70 years old. We end up call taxi to cost over $300usd to go to Haneda airport. We got there past midnight, the airport is closed. We end up sit outside if the airport waiting for 5am. Our hotel at Osaka charged a night when we were sitting out side of Haneda airport. Our tour of Osaka schedule is broken. First and last with Jetstar.

### "denied boarding the flight"
Tokyo to Shanghai. I was denied boarding the flight. Despite showing the staff proof that I did not require a visa to travel to China, they did not allow me to board the flight. I am a Mauritius Citizen and under the laws a Mauritius citizen travelling to China for tourist purposes does not require a visa if the travel is less than 30 days.

### "don't understand why she wanted to be difficult"
Osaka to Manila with JetStar Japan. First, counter lady tells me I canceled our seat reservation. I objected and showed payment for the choice seats. After much insisting, she eventually relented and issued my seats. Next, she tells me my carry on luggage was too big. I argued that it was a standard size bag. She brings it to the steel frame to show it wouldn't fit. I followed and showed her that it could fit. She let us through with the warning it was up to the gate. When we got to the gate, she was there and she took out a tape measure and this time says the height didn't pass. After much arguing, I just agreed to have it checked in. Even if so many other passengers had same size bags that were allowed. Even the bag of the FA was same size. I don't understand why she wanted to be difficult.

### "Absolutely horrid experience"
Osaka to Narita. Absolutely horrid experience. I initially had a two hour layover in Narita. The night before our return flight home to the United States I got a notification that the flight was delayed by 50 minutes.No idea. We wait.. no airplane... delayed 30 mins more .. at this point I’m not sure if I’ll make my flight. Finally the crew moved us to another plane that had been parked since before I got to the gate. Four hour delay is unacceptable. The worst part was that no one would help anyone who was about to be stranded, all of the desks at the airport or essentially closed. Half of the aircraft ended up having to stay in a hotel as well. they have no customer service and no way of complaining other than a robot names jess.

### "pay for my small duffel bag"
Oita to Tokyo Narita. Should have read reviews here’s before booking this terrible airline. Paid for “upgraded” ticket which included 20kg checked baggage & seat selection. Day before flight, Jetstar website did not allow online Check-in. Link to upgrade my checked baggage (I wanted to add 5kg just in case) did not work. Arrived at Oita airport and tried to use check-in kiosk, denied again. When Check-in counter finally opened, the Jetstar agent insisted that I pay for my small duffel bag, which was 7kg. Apparently it was “excess” because I also had a normal-size knapsack. I thought it was excessively nit picky but it’s typical for super-cheap airline. The excess baggage fee was USD109. I understand the need to control cabin baggage when the flight is full but it wasn’t even close to being full (now I know why). Clearly, the fees are not going toward upgrading the shabby plane seats and no-frills cabin. And the long transit in Narita is at the bus-station-like budget-airline satellite terminal. Sent a complaint to Jetstar Japan via Twitter and no response. Lesson learned...pay extra for a real airline.

### "lack of customer service"
Not Verified |  Was ready for a quick and cheap flight from Osaka to Sapporo on a busy three day weekend. I arrived at the airport to find that my flight had been cancelled and was told that there was no other available flight that day. The staff at the desk, though polite, not only flatly refused to provide an adequate reason, they also failed to provide any other service apart from a full refund or at best a flight on the next day. Then, to add insult to injury, they recommended that I call their customer service desk in order to find out more, using a fee-incuring line no less. A stunning lack of customer service and professionality. I shan't fly with Jetstar Japan again.

### "check in was really intense"
Flying from Tokyo Nartia to Taipei. Arrived at the airport 2 hours in advanced, the check in was really intense. Only 2 staff member were working at this time, had to queue for one hour and thirty minutes before check in. Some JetStar staff arrived to help their colleagues but I was really nervous, with many other passengers, that I will miss that plane. But they succeeded to checkin everyone on time, they had no time to be friendly but nobody was asking for that at this time. So good on them for this even though it made me very nervous, they stayed very professional and pretty organized. An airport staff was checking the weight of every luggage on the line to speed everything up. The seats are not very comfortable and no inflight entertainment but I paid for it. The plane had just 20 minutes delay, which was acceptable for me.

### "no staff indicating the status"
Kansai to Tokyo Narita. Flight was already delayed two days before. I am sitting here at 6.30pm waiting for a flight that was supposed to be at 1.55pm. If Jetstar cannot sustain their credibility they should not be operating flights in Japan. There are no staff here indicating the status.

### "only 0.5cm too wide"
Osaka to Narita. My luggage was 36.5cm wide. Their policy is 36. They charged for checked luggage because of only 0.5cm too wide. I understand rules and policies. But this was only 0.5cm. I should not have been charged.

### "forced everyone to pay extra"
Kansai to Okinawa. If you're into having a horrible experience and ruin your whole day if not whole week then by all means go ahead and book yourself a flight with Jetstar. Staff may find the smallest mistake with you hand baggage or check in luggage just to charge you extra. I saw how they did the exact same thing to me to at least 20 other people. The hand baggage cabins on the plane were practically empty because they had forced everyone to pay extra and check in their hand baggage. The seats are uncomfortable, no free water. You get what you pay for.

### "they have no interest in helping"
Narita to Osaka. They change your flight and then it’s non refundable. Tried to talk to them and they have no intrest in helping. All they do is re-send the rules and regulations. Funny because when I was booking it said “flexible” and no charge for canceling or changing flight. When I called they said they’d issue me a voucher valid for 6 months. I told them I was leaving back home. They didn’t care! Worst airline ever. I have flown bad ones but this one takes the cake. Limited baggage. Limited help. No others langauge at counter. Slow

### "many charges and booking fees"
Not Verified |  Manila to Osaka. Do not book directly thru JetStar website. They have many charges and expensive booking fees as compared to Expedia. I called and chat with their representative after completion my first booking thru their website to ask if I can still cancel my booking since I found the same JetStar flight itineraries from Expedia for a much cheaper price inclusive of a carry on & one checked in baggage. They said my earlier bookings are plus bundle only and are non refundable nor cancellable and that they cannot match any third party pricing since my booking is already confirmed. I explained that my booking is 6 months away and I am sure there are still many seats available and I will still choose to book Jetstar same flights thru Expedia. I am frustrated to pay more than $100.00 for three passengers booking thru jetstar.com. Also, their booking fee is much more expensive at $30.00 as compared to Expedia for only $8.00 for all three passengers.

### "crew attentive and polite"
Tokyo Narita to Sapporo. I found Jetstar Japan to be a good option for Japan domestic travel. As a low-cost/budget airline there is a fee structure in place for most items beyond the initial fare paid, depending on the package purchased - baggage (checked and carry on), seat assignments, beverages and food, etc. There are also strict weight limits in place for baggage, again both checked and carry on, but in-line with other airlines of this type. (In the Japanese domestic market think Peach and Vanilla.) If you can accept the carrier is not full-service, like ANA and JAL, and is a budget option, right down to the terminal facilities at certain airports, then the trade-off in fare paid will be acceptable to you. On this trip I found a short line for baggage drop at Terminal 3 at Narita Airport, agents who spoke fluent English, which was appreciated, and proficiency in performing their duties. The walk from the check in area to the gate was long, probably 1,200 meters, so be prepared for that if you have mobility issues. This is a budget experience and Terminal 3 at Narita reflects this. Once you pass security there are virtually no airport amenities though there were free charging stations, which were appreciated. At the gate our flight was boarded quickly, professionally, and on-time. Staff announcements were in Japanese and English. One thing I noticed on another Jetstar Japan flight at the next gate, the staff gave a warning that, due to volcanic ash, their flight may divert to another airport. After over 2-million miles flown I've never seen that done before and felt it was a courteous gesture. Back to my flight, once on-board the aircraft was clean and the crew friendly. Again, all spoke English, including the pilots, beyond that required for air traffic control functions, and two of the four flight attendants spoke it fluently. We departed 4 minutes early. The only negative aspect of my flight comes on board and that was the seat. It was uncomfortable, the reason being it had almost no lower-back support whatsoever. Even the legroom was fine, but the seat comfort just wasn't there. This is an area where Peach has Jetstar Japan beat. Other aspects of the flight were fine - safety protocols were carried out diligently and the crew were attentive and polite. Once on the ground at Sapporo the taxi-in was short, with our flight arriving 1 minute past scheduled arrival, deplaning was fast, and baggage was delivered quickly, within 10 minutes of arrival. Overall I found Jetstar Japan to be a good option and I would travel with them again. There was good value, as compared to the full-service airlines or the train, and that was my main reason for flying them. If you can accept this is a budget experience, and the price reflects such, you will be happy. In regards to safety and in-flight crew attentiveness, there was little difference from a full service airline. If, however, you desire better airport amenities, more personalized service, better operational integrity; for example, the ability to recover after a cancellation or irregular operation, you may find a full service carrier more appealing, but at a price. In the end, it's a value proposition, and if saving money is your goal, Jetstar Japan is a fine way to go. If you're curious about the distinction between Jetstar Japan and Peach/Vanilla, soon to be merged into one carrier, Peach, I find each to be acceptable with both having a very similar product offering.

### "I made a mistake in my booking"
Today when I went to check in I realized I had made a mistake in my booking. I had booked the wrong date. I explained the situation to the ground staff and was instructed that there wouldn’t be a penalty and was given a phone number. However, the company provided no mercy and pointed to the small print which says there is no refund. Customer support didn’t care but just pointed to their policy. In addition, to change the date I will incur further penalties. This is the worst example of customer care I have experienced.

### "disregard for passenger comfort"
After a recent horror of an experience flying with Jetstar to Honolulu and back I'd dreaded a pre-booked trip from Sydney to Narita with a stop in Cairns on the forward and aft leg. They didn't disappoint in their complete disregard for passenger comfort. It took 90 minutes to check in at Narita on the return flight which left 10-15 minutes to get through customs & security leaving no time for a meal so we were forced to eat on board. Because I didn't have a credit card ready the food cart kept going. An hour later I approached them and ordered. The cabin staff told me it would take 20 minutes. About an hour later I again asked them where it was as they were only too happy to take my card. Eventually it came. During that time I observed about 5-6 cabin crew running around with first priority serving alcohol. I was seated on the aisle of an emergency row seat and I saw no no pre-flight compliance check about willingness and capacity of how to assist in the event of an emergency and what our roles would be should the crew member/s be incapacitated. It's my last flight with this lot. A pity as the fleet themselves are relatively new and crews on the flight decks are clearly competent. But the handling of checkins and treatment of passengers by cabin crews are a bridge too far. Good Bye.

### "can't drink your own alcoholic beverages"
Osaka to Manila. You can't drink your own alcoholic beverages in the plane. They said they made public announcements at the gate but I didn't hear any announcement because I arrived at the gate just before boarding. As soon as I sat down on my chair, I opened a can of beer and started drinking it. The flight attendant approached me and asked me to hand over the drink as if I broke the rule on purpose. I explained I was not informed of such rule, but she didn't care. She eventually took away my half left beer. The seats are very uncomfortable as they didn't have much cushion and were shaped not ergonomically. They didn't have any pocket in front to put personal items. I don't expect much from budget airlines like Jetstar.

### "won’t fly Jetstar again"
Will never fly Jetstar again. Attendant randomly selected my partner and I to weigh our carry ons. They were slightly more then 7kg, so we were charged some $$ and had to check the bags. No one else was asked to weigh their carry ons. Virtually everyone had bags of similar size and I’m sure many were more than 7kg. Wonderful way to put a bad taste in your customer's mouths. Once again, I won’t fly Jetstar again.

### "crew extremely inattentive"
One of the worst airlines I've ever used. Charged 50 USD for being 2 lbs over on combined weight (heck I could have put stuff in my pockets and that would have made it ok). Flight crew from Tokyo to Sydney were extremely inattentive, and never once offered food or beverage on an 8 hour flight.

### "ground support is horrible"
Osaka to Tokyo Narita. The ground support is horrible and the worst I have ever met. The flight got delayed and is causing my international flight (last one on the day) connection time reduced from 3 hours to less than one hour. Firstly they do not have other options although there is another flight that is not delayed and well arrive slightly earlier than this one (obviously this one does not have the inbound flight at the gate but they claim the delay is due to strong wind at Narita. Many other fights flying there are not delayed). Then they insisted on me to check my carry on sized luggage as it is too heavy. I argued about the additional wait time to get my luggage well almost guarantee me to miss my flight and hope to pay extra to get my carry on with me. They denied and denied again without any intention to further help.

### "Very bad experience"
New Chitose to Narita. Very bad airline ground staff. When dropping bags employees will ask random people to show their boarding passes. When you ask them a question they will become irritated and ask to weigh your hand baggage. The policy on laptops is not consistent and they will sometimes take into account laptops to the 7kg limit and sometimes not. They will tell you to check in another bag without weighing the hand luggage again to check that it is 7kg. When told that the same baggage (with photo proof) that another trip was made with the same baggage with no problems, they disregard and prevent boarding until a fee is paid for an extra baggage check in. Very inconsistent and opens the door to employees to cause trouble for passengers with impunity. Very bad experience. Will never recommend or fly again.

### "No more Jetstar Japan for me"
Kansai Osaka to Hong Kong. The flight was delayed for more than 6-hours and their ground staff are not helpful and responsive. They were trying their best to refuse all requests including reasonable request (e.g. to update the letter about the delay because their flight was further delay, many passengers need this letter to claim for compensation from the insurance company). The interior of the plane is old. I ordered a meal (curry chicken with rice) and the taste was not good. The only good thing for Jetstar Japan is the crew on the plane as they are polite, helpful with smile at all time. No more Jetstar Japan for me.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Tokyo Narita to Okinawa. This is the worst airline I have flown. The customer service is terrible. They don't answer any questions you have about fees. The seats are the most uncomfortable I've flown.

### "seat was very comfortable"
Manila to Nagoya with Jetstar Japan. Boarding was really quick compared to the other carriers I have flown on recently (e.g. Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines/Pal Express). The plane was a brand new Airbus A320. The seat was nice mainly because of the seat pocket being on top of the seat not in the leg area, which of course made a lot of legroom. The plane took off on schedule. No IFE screens, this is usual for a budget carrier so I provided my own IFE through my iPad. Soon after takeoff food and beverage service began my family and I ordered meals through their booking bundles on their website. Food offered was pork and beef over Japanese rice, the meal was really good. After that they gave arrival cards for Japan. The seat was very comfortable to sleep and I woke up 1 hour before landing to catch the beautiful sunrise over Japan - a nice compliment to a early morning flight. The plane landed on time and the deplaining was fast and a bus took us to the arrivals area. Immigration was very quick due to our flight being the first arrival of the day. Baggage claim was quick and we went to the airport train station to look for a train to the city.

### "have to fight their policies"
This flight was booked as the final leg of an international series from the US. However, they insisted on applying their domestic baggage rules rather than acknowledging that they were part of a larger booking and allowing the most permissive of the rules. Twenty four hours of travel, and rather than having a relaxing final leg you have to fight their policies and rearrange all of your belongings. Extremely bad form, avoid at all costs.

### "worst travel experience"
Tokyo to Okinawa with Jetstar Japan. Worst travel experience,  1 hour delay on the way in. More than 7 hours delay on the way back. No explanations, no excuses. Seats are uncomfortable and inflight service (extra fee) started 2 hours after take off in a 2h 40 flight. 7 hours delayed flight was handled by a single person for 200+ travellers. To offer less than 7$ of voucher, Jetstar manages to make Ryanair attractive.

### "disappointed traveller"
Manila to Nagoya. Jetstar Japan is one of the worst airlines I have been on. My niece, along with her children, all under 7 years old, traveling in our party of around twenty people, asked for a cup of water as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off. Both she and I were refused water saying, "you may purchase water if you'd like", which we did. This at a cost of around $2.50/bottle. On the return flight I was once again refused water. Understanding it is a discount airline, it is unacceptable to be refused a cup of water. Very disappointed traveler.

### "flight was cancelled on the spot"
Manila to Tokyo with Jetstar Japan. Our scheduled flight was cancelled on the spot due to a crew member getting sick. It was a poorly managed situation as all of us passengers have already checked-in and we were simply made to wait by Jetstar to be transported to a hotel without any assurance or given timeline of when the next flight will be. The notification of the cancelled flight was made way past the time of departure. We tried to coordinate through hotline, even speaking with an agent for more than an hour, and to no avail they didn't have any idea what plans have been set out for us who needed to be in Tokyo as we had prepaid arrangements and plans. This left us with no choice but to book to another airline for a hefty price as Jetstar cannot finalize a decision that morning. Tokyo to Manila both our baggage were left in the return flight because the plane was overloaded. We prepaid our check-in baggage of 20 kg each person months before and only checked in less than that (only 15kg) which makes me wonder why Jetstar didn't even foresee the load the plane had to carry. We were only informed that some baggage were left when we were waiting at the pick up area in Manila airport and both our names weren't even included in the list. Which we can't even confirm right then and there whether our baggage was still in Narita or not. We were simply left in line to wait to process our lost baggage claim late in the night. I think it's certainly unfair for you to treat us without any feeling of assurance and blatantly just expect us to be fine that our baggage was left. As I called in the morning to follow-up on the status of our luggage, I do not understand why their staff can't simply update us regarding the status of our report. Up to this moment, no Jetstar representative has called, text messaged, nor sent an email regarding this matter. I had to call numerous times before finding out that my luggage was on it's way via JAL flight tonight, but my sister's luggage which we checked in at the same time has no confirmed flight back yet.
