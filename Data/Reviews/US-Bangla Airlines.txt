### "don't care and will leave you stranded"
We arrived at the airport in plenty of time. When we arrived at the desk we were told our return flight had been cancelled. After about 45 minutes they found our flight tickets. However the first leg of the flight had been delayed and we were told that we wouldn't make the connection flight. The solution of this was to just tell us we were not going to be flying and we would need to make alternative way home. We were not offered any transfer to another flight, a hotel to fly the following day, not even a glass of water. This left us stranded in Kuala Lumpur and had to book another flight that cost us almost $2500. Long and short of the story do not book a flight with this company, they don't care and will leave you stranded. Don't bother trying to contact customer service as they appear to not have any.

### "Ticket price was too high"
Flight was delayed for more than 30 minutes without informing the passengers. A very small craft that doesn't tough the boarding bridge. The airline provided connecting bus to the fleet. Automated check in could be done though the machine was not working properly. Ground Staffs and cabin crews were good in proving services. Food was basic snack. Ticket price was too high.

### "recommend to avoid this airline"
End of an amazing tour but faced a bitter experience by US-Bangla Airlines. Since from my last trip in Thailand, I started using our own country's airlines to travel abroad but they're unprofessional and I would recommend to avoid this airline especially you're traveling outside. While getting the boarding pass, my luggage had some extra weights and KLIA airport representative was generous enough to give me discount. But when I was about to pay, they tell me, US Bangla don't allow cards for extra luggage pay. I complained to their executive available there but he was unresponsive. And I had to run for ATM again from the check-in counter. This is not only utter unprofessional but also harassment because the KL airport representative tried to solve the thing in easier way but it's our country's airline who doesn't care about the convenience of the guests but embarrass us in front of the foreigners.

### "Price was a bit high"
Dhaka to Bangkok. Good service though it made delay while departing. Very good food. Staff were good. Price was a bit high when I purchased. No entertainment screen on board.

### "my experience was satisfactory"
Cox's Bazar to Dhaka with US-Bangla Airlines. The check-in process was smooth. The plane arrived exactly on time. But had to refuel for 15mins. We were on a full family trip. The staff was friendly and helpful. The seats were a bit tight and narrow. Food was average. Landing was smooth. We got our baggage in time. I don't know about others, but my experience was satisfactory.

### "very rude, very unprofessional"
Sylhet to Dhaka. Absolutely awful probably the worst airline, very rude, very unprofessional, don’t know how they can be so rude towards customers. I was at Sylhet  at 11am and had a domestic flight at 2:05pm, we had to wait 5 hours. We ended up missing our international flight and they put us in a very nasty hotel.

### "unprofessionalism is really disgraceful"
Dhaka to Jessore. It was really a bad experience when the plane started to take off and after a while there was problem with the flight’s fan or whatever there were some technical issues and then they stopped on emergency basis and later on after a while they started with the same plane though they told us to shift in a new one. After going a little further the plane again stopped at their runway due to the same problem. Then they shifted us to a new plane. The matter here is their unprofessionalism which is really disgraceful. I really would never like to fly with them again.

### "friendly and smiley flight attendants"
Dhaka to Jessore. I find the name of this private airline in Bangladesh a bit funny. Other than that no complaints. Arrived at the domestic terminal in Dhaka 7 minutes before the scheduled morning departure due to being severely delayed due to road traffic. The check-in desk completed all formalities, rushed us through security, had a limo ready for us to escort me and my partner to the aircraft at the remote stand. The flight left after our boarding and exactly on time. I have never experienced this kind of dedication and professionalism with an airline. The flight to Jessore lasted 25 minutes onboard a clean and attractive Dash-8 Q400 and we were served a sandwich, cake and a water bottle by friendly and smiley flight attendants. The return flight to Dhaka a couple of days later was just as good but we made sure we arrived promptly for check-in this time. We were served a mini burger, cake and water bottle.
