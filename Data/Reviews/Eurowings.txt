### "refused to pay the compensation"
Eurowings canceled our flight in August 2024 at the last minute after we had already boarded. They forced us to disembark with no explanation, leaving my family, including three minors, stranded at the airport. No assistance, no hotel, not even water was offered. To make things worse, they refused to pay the compensation we were legally entitled to. Their customer service was unresponsive and showed zero concern for passengers. This was an appalling experience, and I strongly recommend avoiding Eurowings at all costs.

### “the worst flying experience”
This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. If you don’t check in online, you are unceremoniously fined €15 per person. But even if you do check in online, you are charged €2.50 per person. There’s simply no way to avoid it. If your suitcase is slightly over the weight limit or deviates just a bit in size, expect an additional charge of €50 to €100 per person. There is zero tolerance or flexibility. The attitude of the cabin crew is far from customer-friendly. The flight feels more like a flying market stall. It’s as if you’re in a busy bazaar, with constant attempts to sell you something. Eurowings is an airline I absolutely cannot recommend to anyone. The lack of service, numerous hidden costs, and unfriendly staff make the experience nothing short of disappointing.

### "90€ extra for 2 extra small extra luggages"
I tried to contact the service via email one day before the flight because I couldn't see any hints about the extra services i booked on the boarding pass. I got no answer not after 12 hours, not ever service doesn't seem to exist. so on the counter we had to pay 90€ extra for 2 extra small extra luggages. Seems that email service is not important for the flight company. i still got no answer after 5 days.

### "I am fully satisfied
To be honest, I am fully satisfied. Eurowings is not a low-cost airline, but I got a good deal flying for some 42 EUR one-way from Hamburg to Paris (small cabin bag included). With wheeled bag onboard and checked bag it would have come at a price of Air France or even higher, but AF doesn’t propose 42 Euro deals. Trouble free online check-in, on-time take off and early landing, swift boarding via stairs in Hamburg and swift disembarkation via finger in Paris, nice crew (however with somewhat limited command of English). Seat is standard Lufthansa eco. Cabin was clean. Didn’t make purchases, didn’t use toilet. Excellent Wi-Fi, paid internet access and paid entertainment system. Perfect product for short hop.

### "terrible customer service"
Not Verified | They lost my baggage for 2+ full days and did not arrive on the day they said they would without sending a cancellation. When I spoke to the man in the luggage department he assured me I would be reimbursed for necessities. I asked for a dollar amount and he did not know, just assured me they would cover the costs. I asked for numbers of an office who would be able to give me amount and was given 3 different numbers that didn't end with a person and then the office was closed and I had to go get the stuff. I bought a cheap pair of pants that I really needed, a toothbrush, and a phone charger. They are only refunding me for 50% of the phone charger. That doesn't even make sense! How am I supposed to use 50% of a phone charger?! This is a dishonest company with terrible customer service.

### "Unfortunately again unreliable"
Unfortunately again unreliable. Tracking the aircraft on FR24 it was obvious it accumulated delay after delay on the previous four flights. In my experience, Eurowings is unable or unwilling to manage such situations, e.g. by using spare aircraft so switch rotations. All of my last flights were the same. Pity! Eurowings isn’t cheap and unfortunately often the only the option, but planes and crews are usually fine.

### “Cabin crew were very helpful”
As AC has given up this route, we again flew with this Lufthansa subsidiary from YYC to FRA and on to Venice. Boarding went smoothly as AC staff now handle this aspect for Eurowings, which they didn't do last year. The plane left and arrived on time which allowed us to make our connection with Lufthansa. Cabin crew were very helpful and fluent in both English and German. The seating in business class in 2-2-2 and the seats were very comfortable. As we chose the evening flight we were able to sleep for a number of hours. The seats recline into a fully flat position. Comfortable blankets and pillows were provided. The food was excellent with a choice of three entrees. A fairly good selection of movies was available. All in all, a much better experience than the one we had last year. Lufthansa must be having success with this route as there are now two flights daily from YYC to FRA. I find it curious that AC gave up this route.

### "My luggage wasn’t delivered"
My luggage wasn’t delivered to the destination and the customer service of Eurowings did absolutely nothing to solve my issue. They didn’t provide enough information about any questions I asked. Instead, they copied and pasted the same message again and again. When I called them, they directed me to an irrelevant phone number, when I called them again, they hanged up on me after making me wait for 10 minutes. The online portal where I can see the updates on my luggages’s location was closed after a week without any understandable explanation. Their compensation was just for three days while for three weeks, I had to spend my holiday without most of my necessities. After all, it was Split airport, not Eurowings who addressed my issue. I will never consider using Eurowings for my future travel.

### "Baggage was missing"
Not Verified |   Baggage was missing after arriving in Stockhom Arlanda from Dublin via Dusseldorf Airport. No contact number to phone with regard missing luggage and when you phone the main contact number for the airlines and ask any questions they just hang up. The only information given of the status of the baggage is an app that tells you they have no idea where or even what country the bag is in. How is this possible? First and last time.

### "Not cheap; but reliable"
Zurich to Dresden via their hub in Dusseldorf. Both flights on A320s. Checked in in ZRH without any hassle or feeling entering a low-cost carrier. Gate bridging in airports convenient and saved time. Flights were both precise on timing and arrival. Luggage inscribed, transferred, and delivered within 5 Minutes on final destination. Transit in Dusseldorf smooth. Payable catering service onboard rendered several interesting options from printed menu leaflets. The airline was better than most reviews indicate. I must render them credit, at least 6 (7?) out of 10. If I had access to their lounges in ZRH and DUS, the trip would have been perfected. Not cheap; but reliable, no faults, and could fly them again.

### "check with whom you are flying"
Eurowings is generically no joy to fly with. It’s a low cost airline with horrendous high prices. It belongs to Lufthansa, so one may enjoy some miles on the frequent flyer account and at the airport the benefit of a lounge when you book a higher fare. But onboard, regardless of frequent flyer status or fare, it’s all the same (if you fly economy). They offer sometimes also „business class“, where the only difference is you can choose from the buy-in-board menu part of the items for free. Whatever, things can get much worse if you fly with their wet-lease partner Avion Express Malta cramped seats! Unbearable little seat pitch, uninspired cabin crew, dirty cabin. This all for and on behalf of Eurowings. So next time, check with whom you are flying, when booking Eurowings.

### "Not on time"
Not on time, no service, and if they are delayed heavily you need to go to court to get the compensation you are eligible for. I try to avoid but in various routes they have a monopoly.

### "Still no bag"
Not Verified |   Imagine a bag being abandoned for 6 days and being told I can fly back and get it. Day one bag left at MAN airport. Day two bag arrives in Dusseldorf connection airport. Day three and four and five and six still in Dusseldorf. We have located your bag" message in their website for 5 days. Still no bag. Customer service says: you could fly to Dusseldorf and collect it. Plus other patronising advice. Bag contains everything essential for 4 weeks work at sea. I have had bags delayed before but other airlines handle it faster.

### "had to pay 15€ for check-in"
Travelled from Beirut to Berlin and had to pay 15€ for check-in just because it can only be done online! What kind of policy is that? Unbelievable! Never again!

### “size of the food is simply microscopic”
Eurowings international flight on the route Frankfurt - Tampa. This is what passengers were given in a 10-hour flight. Beer, alcoholic beverages, even Chinese headphones for money. The size of the food is simply microscopic. At the second meal, snacks were distributed, but there was not enough tea and coffee for everyone. I have never met such a shameful voyage. I do not recommend using the services of this airline.

### "fee of 150 Euros for our three bags"
Not Verified |   I bought 4 tickets (myself, my wife and our 2 kids) and 3 large cabin bags for this trip. While on the way to Berlin everything went smooth with a perfect service, I unfortunately have to say that the trip back home has been extremely unpleasant. When we arrive at the gate in Berlin, we have been told by the personnel at the gate that our bags where not registered in the system and that we had to pay a fee of 150 Euros for our three bags. We have tried to explain that we regularly bought the service for all bags, but the answer was that the problem was probably due to the fact that we bought the tickets through a third-party company and that the mistake must have been from their side. Then, I showed the booking details on the Eurowings app, where it was clearly shown that the bags were included and that our carry fully respected size and weight. Please note that this was the company’s app, not a third-party app (see also screenshot below). They did not even look at the screen and we just got the answer that they had no time for this; we just had to pay or they would have not board us! I personally find this episode extremely unfortunate and disrespectful, not only for the fact that we had to pay for a service that had already been bought, but especially for the way how me and my family have been treated. While I can understand that this kind of job is not always easy (and even that people might have a bad day), it is unacceptable that airport’s and company’s personnel are allowed to have such an attitude with customers

### "premium fare for zero service"
Very early morning flight with this no frills airline of the Lufthansa Group. A wonderful reminder that no frills doesn’t necessarily mean low cost. Horrendous flight bought with a premium fare for zero service, little seat pitch and terribly uninspiring buy on board selection (which other real low cost airlines can do much better). Unfortunately, if you live on Germany and you fly from other airports than Frankfurt or Munich, it is impossible to avoid this. Flight attendants were friendly though.

### "unpleasant and rude gate agent"
Cologne gate agent: Absolutely the most unpleasant and rude gate agent we have ever experienced in our family’s years of travel and mine as a pilot. Clearly attempted to make others feel uncomfortable with very little, if any regard for customer support.

### "bought a new ticket with Austrian"
I had a booking from Vienna to Berlin via Stuttgart. The flight out of Vienna got a 2-hour delay, making it miss my connecting flight. I called Eurowings Customer Service and they rerouted me via Dusseldorf. Once I received that ticket I noticed that the new arrival in Berlin would make me miss my onward journey, and the check-in for that flight was closed when I received the new ticket and no information about my luggage which was checked in on my original flight via Stuttgart. So I called back to the hotline. The answer from their staff was that I now have to buy a new ticket. I got angry and the handler hung up on me. I tried to call again and was hung up. I went to the gate for Dusseldorf, and that flight was closed, gone. I now bought a new ticket with Austrian. But my luggage is lost.

### "avoid this airline in the future"
Two adults and a kid three years old were travelling. We got many mails from Eurowings and also got a reminder about internet check in. They have given us two seats in one row and a middle seat in another row. We thought we should wait with check in until we came to the airport. That costs us money. We had a stroller with us, that was free only for kids up to two years, costs us almost the same amount again. When we left there were plenty of empty seats. I do not like the way Eurowings do their business, and i will avoid this airline in the future. The flight went smoothly, half an hour delay due to deicing

### "Do not book with Eurowings"
Do not book with Eurowings. They are scammers. The whole business model is to pretend to offer a free flight change, but it's only the same day, and despite the norm practiced by nearly all airlines in Europe, they offer no cancellations.

### "flight attendants were extremely rude"
Not Verified |  We just were on a Eurowings flight from Hamburg to Zurich. It was delayed departing and then when we arrived, my husband and I were the last off the plane because we were trying to take everything plus our sleeping toddler off the plane. It had been super hard to carry him and all our stuff coming onto the plane so we decided to unfold our Yoyo stroller (which fits down the aisle) to help debark. The flight attendants were extremely rude. They were in a hurry because they said they were late for the next flight, so I understand that. However, what was completely unacceptable is when we said we were sorry and we are hurrying but please try to be a little understanding, it's hard with a toddler, the response was "well maybe you shouldn't have children then". In addition, when my husband was trying to get bags from the top down and the steward was trying to push through, he said excuse me, I need to get my bags, the steward threatened to call the police on us. Absolutely unbelievable.

### "cramped seating is ridiculous"
About 5cm too little leg room. Incredibly cramped. Check in etc was smooth, and I have no baggage so cannot comment on this. But the cramped seating is ridiculous.

### "stopped upon boarding because I have 3 bags"
I was stopped upon boarding because I have 3 bags. Which was 1 hand carry, 1 small sling bag which only fits my cellphone, passport, and my wallet, and the last bag was a LV GM on the go. She said I still have to pay extra 50 euro because of my 3rd bag. Several other passengers that went on board has bigger 3 bags than I had but was not stopped. And also given the fact that we already paid extra for another check in bag which we didn’t even utilized. So we presented the papers the we already paid extra for extra luggage that we didn’t even use. Instead of acknowledging her mistake. The only response I got was “ I will let this go only this once.” The flight was already late and their personnel was still trying to rip off some money from me to pay for unnecessary extra 50Euro for my 3rd tiny bag!

### "charged 100 euro to check the same bags2
Not Verified |  We researched baggage fees before confirming our flight and checking in. Doing the math, it was better to check our large bag with a smaller bag nested inside and to carry on our two smaller bags. Paid on line. Off to the airport we went. Long queue. Likely because of issues like we encountered but we don't know. Great staff in Reykjavik. Sir, you didn't check in on line, we need 15 euro each. Us "Yes, we did check in. Here's proof. GSiR: "Supervisor please. (Seems that yet, once again, there was an issue with this. Supervisor called and got a code). We boarded without issue. Arrived Dusseldorf for 5hour layover. Hung out at gate for at least 3 of those hours, bags in plain view. Boarding process sucked and we were the last of four people to board the plane. Staff said, "go see colleagues. Colleagues shook us down and charged 100 euro to check the same bags we had just flown with and had prepaid for with our non-existent pre-check. No negotiation. Just "Pay or don't fly. Paid so we could go. Customer service complaint filled out. Three weeks later ... form email. Responded to that form email with the rest of the story. Received second form email. Called, said "give us some time. Called again, "back office is working on it. Can take 90 days. It has now been 126 days from original complaint. Not a peep. The people on the phone are amazing, it's just the company they work for has no interest in taking care of customers.

### "take no responsibility for my baggage"
I flew from Malaga to Heathrow via Dusseldorf and the flights were OK. The problem came afterward. My luggage never arrived. After around 2 weeks I was reunited with one of my suitcases. The other one never arrived however I was contacted by another passenger who had been given my lost baggage in mistake for her lost baggage. The airline acknowledged to her they had made a mistake and arranged collection. In spite of repeated emails to the airline from me (it is the only way to contact them ) and advice to them of the whereabouts of my baggage I have had no acknowledgement whatsoever from them regarding their efforts to reunite me with my baggage. The claim form on their website does not work. I am left appalled by their lack of follow up service and given the impression that they take no responsibility for my baggage and that they hope I will just go away.

### "a second class option"
Very shortly, Air Canada is going to abandon the Calgary-Frankfurt route and leave it the the Lufthansa subsidiary Eurowings, which is going to offer daily service as opposed to the seasonal service in the past. Why AC is doing this is beyond me as from all accounts the aircraft on this route were always fully occupied. In any event, what we are left with is really a second class option and one can only hope that Lufthansa decides to fly this route with its mainline. Let's start with the positives. The flight left and arrived on time. The flight attendants were attentive and the food was acceptable. The IFE offered a good variety of movies, mostly American but also some German films. The seating configuration is either 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. I would suggest that one try to get the single seat at the window which offers plenty of room. The seats can be positioned to be entirely flat. A blanket and pillow were available. The departure time is less than ideal, around 13:00 which means a very early arrival in FRA, which is of some benefit in terms of connecting flights. There appeared to be a number of passengers who were going to connect on, presumably within the Lufthansa network which is extensive. Now for the negatives. The plane this airline is using is old and tired. The crew ran out of hot water and couldn't serve tea or coffee and I was in the business section. Similarly, water stopped running in the head. How is it possible that an aircraft runs out of water! Boarding was chaotic. A lot of economy passengers were let on the plane before the business class customers. It appears that they have an inexperienced staff handling this.

### "airline is a joke"
The worst airline I've ever flew. This was the 3rd and last time flying with this airline, every single time they messed up. 1st time, they left my bag behind and it took them 4 days to deliver it and I was on vacation so I had to buy new clothes, got compensated for like a 100€. 2nd time it was delayed. 3rd time delayed again, they made us get off the plane and wait, then re-board, and they had the audacity to ask money for water after waiting 3 hours. This airline is a joke!

### "All in all: good"
Booked a few month in advance and paid 160 euro for two and a suitcase which was okay. We used the very convenient city check in at Wien Mitte Station, which allows you to drop off your suitcase in the morning and -like us- catch your flight in the evening. Only for Lufthansa Group airlines. Officially you have to travel on the rather expensive City Airport Train (CAT) to use the city check in, but know one checked this, so I guess you can catch the slower but much cheaper S7 to the airport too. Flight departed 50 mins late but arrived only 25 mins late in Düsseldorf. Efficient, uneventful flight with the usually limited leg space. Okay for the short flight though. Still the irritating habit of parking on the apron in Düsseldorf in stead of at the aerobridge which takes more time to deplane. All in all: good.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
This is the worst airline and the worst customer service I have ever met! I had a flight from Stockholm to Faro and purchased 23 kg of luggage online. When I arrived at the airport, the staff at the check-in desk said he couldn't see my paid baggage in the system, I showed him the paid baggage on my ticket, but he didn't care and forced me to pay 438 SEK for the baggage again. I've been asking the company for a refund for 2 months, but it's useless, they don't seem to see my payment in the system again. Although I have sent all proofs, the receipt, ticket. I have called them many times, sent many emails, but judging by the reviews, it is common practice for this company to not refund customers and appropriate it for themselves. I don't recommend this airline.

### "3+ months later - still no refund"
Not Verified |  Do not fly Eurowings! Changed our flight without notice to a different day. We cancelled the flight as no flights were offered by Eurowings on the day we needed to leave Santorini, and were “offered a full refund”. 3+ months later - still no refund. Countless phone calls and emails and still nothing - they continue to push to blame onto anything and everything. I will be leaving this review until the $1k+ is refunded (if ever).

### "stoic, robotic crew members"
Not Verified |  “They wouldn't give my 83-year-old mother water to take her medication! My 83 year old mother has been travelling to Greece every year for the past 35 years. This year, her travel agent booked her with a different airline Eurowings. She was received with indifference and stoic, robotic crew members. When she asked for some water to take her medication, they approached her with bottles costing three euro. It is unacceptable for any airline to not offer the basic essential beverage, water, which should be for free. Shame on them. I will never ever take this airline or recommend it to anyone.

### "delay of more than an hour"
A delay of more than an hour inside the plane waiting for takeoff. The reason for the delay is only communicated in German and English to the rest, no matter what. Un retraso de más de una hora dentro del propio avión esperando al despegue. Vergonzoso! El motivo del retraso solo lo comunican en alemán e inglés al resto ni caso

### "I will never book again with Eurowings"
Eurowings is the worst airline company. They asked me to pay for the check in as I didn’t do it online and I refused, and then went out off the line did the check in online. They lost our luggage and we have not heard back from them as no one is responding. It is uncertain if we will get our belongings back. I will never book again with Eurowings.

### "were asked to pay for the hand luggage"
Not Verified |  We traveled from Rhodes and stopped at Dusseldorf and when we arrived we were asked to pay for the hand luggage. They didn’t mention anything about this charge when we booked it. This is unacceptable as they did not say anything when we were boarding at Rhodes airport.

### "I had to wait so much"
My return flight was an hour late and when we were boarding I was at the boarding they told me I didn’t have the right to do boarding first with my 23 months old baby. He was sleeping in my arms and I have two bags on me and when I asked them to be board they told me they don’t have the policy to get people with infants first. I stayed for at least 20 minutes in group 2 as shown in my ticket, before I could get on the aeroplane. I was crying from being exhausted and tired when I get into the plane. A passenger offered to help me with one of my bags. This was the first time in all my flights with all different airlines that I had to wait so much.

### "fly a cheaper, more reliable airline"
Another legendary Eurowings experience - a daughter company of an airline called Lufthansa. Horrible Terminal 2 in Lisbon. While Ryanair, Wizz, Vueling, have proper organized structured check in, Eurowings changed the check in lanes 2 times which ended up in no organisation for the check in resulting in waiting for 1.5 hours for check in. All people just checked in without queuing, like anarchy. Absolutely unprofessional and even Eurowings would say they are not responsible, but Eurowings and Lufthansa make the contracts, define the SOP and review the quality. So ask yourself Eurowings why it works for the other budget airlines. Flight to Hamburg was delayed at the end, also due to go through but would have also been delayed 30min without it. The flight and service was good, that's it. The staff was friendly onboard. Eurowings has a way to go. I am saying this for 8 years now and giving up hope. It just has no relevance being a Lufthansa Senator for Eurowings so you can also fly any other, cheaper, more reliable airline.

### "Completely frustrating"
My flight from CGN to ATH was canceled half an hour before the flight for an unknown reason. The people on the front desk had a completely unprofessional manner. The rerouting options were ridiculously late. No refund after 20 days. You cannot find any information from the phone service and the online refund forms are not working at all. It is almost a scam. Completely frustrating. Avoid it as much as possible.

### "They have not done anything to compensate me"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible, do not fly with them. They lost my baggage flying from Porto to Berlin. I submitted a ticket online at 3pm and it is now 10pm and they have not even contacted me about my bag. They have not done anything to compensate me for lack of clothing and toiletries. I tried calling their “customer service” number and their employee was extremely unprofessional and hung up on me. Save yourself the aggravation and never fly with them. They lost most of the planes luggage as well.

### "don’t have phone for lost baggage"
Not Verified | They lost my baggage 5 days ago yet there’s no respond. They ruined my whole trip. I’m extending my hotel everyday and night hoping they call me and tell me they’re going to bring my baggage. No wonder their flight is empty. Please please please DO NOT BOOK ANY FLIGHT WITH THEM. They don’t even have phone for lost baggage. That’s unbelievable

### "my luggage got lost / misplaced"
I flew from Lyon to Dublin via Dusseldorf. The flight from Lyon was 40 minutes late. The flight from Dusseldorf to Dublin was 1 hour late. Not only did i miss my bus to final destination, my luggage got lost / misplaced. It's two days now and there's nothing tangible about where my luggage is. I am getting anxious, and I need my essentials from my luggage. I wish I read the reviews before booking this airline.

### "worst flying experience I've ever had"
Not Verified |  Lost my baggage and they did not retrieve it for a week. Also marked the "lost baggage report" as resolved before I had even arranged for a pick-up location and time. Contacted customer service about the issue, only to be told they could not help me with verifying the status of the report. The worst flying experience I've ever had.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Avoid this airline! Online checking was a fail. Their own system could not recognize the booking code they sent me in email. Paid 75euros extra in the airport to be able to check-in. I sent a complaint but no reply until today! (1 week). The gate was changed twice, 30 mins prior to the connecting flight and 1 hour delayed flight in Hamburg. Lost baggage and it came after 2 days. Worst flight experience ever. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "Disorganized, misinformed, and sloppy"
Disorganized, misinformed, and sloppy: Eurowings messed up at every step. They did not get our frequent flier details from United (booking airline) or Lot (connecting airline). That led them to stick us in basic economy which led them to demand we check bags on the legs connecting to Eurowings. We could not even get boarding passes. When we went to get boarding passes in Hamburg, we made them add our flyer numbers. That led them to put us in premium economy -- but our bags had already been checked in. They insisted -- multiple times, including with a check by a manager -- that they had our bags and that the bags would be on the flight from Hamburg to Reykjavik. The flight was delayed almost 90 minutes. In the air, they offered food and beverages with zero clarification that it was for sale. (We then had to pay for the food. Many others were also surprised.) When we got to Reykjavik, our checked bags did not arrive. We completed a claim there, which creates a report at the mybag.aero website. We then sent bag descriptions, a list of contents, and screenshots for the AirTags in each checked bag showing their location (still in Hamburg). Eurowings never replied to any of our messages. I called Eurowings customer service (international to Germany), was transferred, and then waited two hours before having to hang up. We lost an entire day between buying replacement clothes and trying to contact Eurowings. Eurowings found the bags 7 days later but has yet to get our bags to us (10 days later). I am trying to fill out a claim form on the mybag.aero site. After completing one page, it now hangs whenever I try to continue filling out the form. Worse, it looks like they may only reimburse us for 30 EUR x 3 days. You cannot even get a pair of jeans in Reykjavik for 90 EUR -- much less 1 pair of jeans, underwear, t-shirts, a base layer or jacket, and socks for two adults and a toddler. And it's freaking ICELAND -- so you need to be ready for weather between 5C and 15C and possibly rain. I would not fly Eurowings unless you are sure you can carry on everything, that they have your status, and that you trust nothing they say.

### "I also felt neglected and dismissed"
This review is regarding my lost baggage and trying to track down the development in finding it via the customer service. I recently had an utterly frustrating customer service phone call that left me deeply disappointed and concerned. The agent's lack of accountability and irresponsibility in handling my issue was simply unacceptable. During the call, the agent provided me with a phone number to address my concern, but nobody answered the call. It was an endless loop of frustration as I was passed from one number to another, without any resolution in sight. Moreover, on another attempt, the agent asked me for a reference number to track my issue. However, when I provided this reference number to the designated department, they claimed that they couldn't find any file associated with it. This baffling lack of coordination and communication between the customer service team and other departments only added to my mounting concerns. As a customer, I expect efficient and effective support when I encounter an issue, but unfortunately, this experience fell far short of those expectations. Not only was my problem left unresolved, but I also felt neglected and dismissed during the entire process.

### "still did not receive my lost luggage"
I arrived 23 July without my luggage. It is already a week later and I still did not receive my lost luggage. No answers from the company. No response - only seen that the luggage was booked in at Zurich airport and booked through to Windhoek. Value and non-replaceable items of sentimental value were in my luggage. How do you replace items you bought on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday for your family? My chargers, clothes, etc. is not easy to replace. Never in my life again. It cost me a fortune to pay for the ticket from my hard-earn money. Disgusting to say the least.

### "Do not go with this company"
Not Verified |  Do not go with this company. Last minute delays, both there and home. When we get home and I pick up my checked-in luggage, the bag is broken (big hole in it and a lot of other minor damage). The contents of the bag are total chaos. Traveled probably 20 times with this bag and nothing has ever happened to it. No airline representative on site to contact regarding this. Instead, you have to fill in 2 incredibly time-consuming forms. Zero service. Total nonchalance. Extremely disappointed. Åk inte med detta bolag. I sista stund förseningar ( både dit och hemresa). När vi kommer hem och jag hämtar ut mitt inchekade bagage så är väskan sönder, ( stort hål i den samt en massa andra mindre skador). Innehållet i väskan är totalt kaos. Rest säkert 20 gånger med denna väska och det har aldrig hänt någonting med den.Ingen representant för flygbolaget på plats som man kan kontakta angående detta. Man får istället fylla i 2 st OTROLIGT tidskrävande formulär. Noll service. Total nonchalans. Oerhört besviken.

### "I will not fly Eurowings again"
Not Verified |  The only good thing about this flight on Eurowings, is that the flight is direct from Frankfurt to Orlando. For the rest, I have nothing good to say (old aircraft, old seats, inexperienced staff, poor food & service). I cannot even enjoy the frequent flyer mileage program (I am losing 10000 miles). I will not fly Eurowings again.

### "didn't get any news about my luggage"
Eurowings lost my luggage on the 2 of July. Now it is almost week and i didn't get any news about my luggage. All my holidays I spent without my medicine, clothes, swimming suits and clothes for my child. Now I have to go to the next destination and there is no possibilities to get my luggage there. Communication with Eurowings is very poor. I found that a lot of people have the same problems with this Airline. I am really very unsatisfied with this experience and please be aware before your trip with Eurowings.

### "Thank you for your professionalism and care!"
Not Verified |  I would like to express my deepest gratitude to a highly proficient flight attendants of Eurowings. I had a panic attack during the flight because 5 years ago I had had an awful plane accident. A flight attendant Pablo and a beautiful Norwegian stewardess literally helped me not to pass out. Thank you for your professionalism and care!

### "Staff are extremely friendly and efficient"
I booked a fight on Lufthansa Group’s low cost airline Eurowings as I wanted to see if there is a large difference to the main carrier of the group. The ticket price was substantially lower than for the same route (BER-CTA) which flew a week earlier. Staff are extremely friendly and efficient. The boarding process was orderly and efficient. I booked a seat with more legroom for a few Euros and was surprised how much of a difference this made. There was small bottle of water handed out for free. Food was not available for free but for a (rather high) price. BTW: Lounge access on Eurowings flights is only available for passengers with Lufthansa’s own status. MM Gold membership given out by partner airlines will not be accepted. Miles will also only be credited into LH Miles and More accounts.

### "simple and economical extras model"
This airline gets a lot of bad rep online and for us this was not justified. Same route on EasyJet was double the price for similar options a lot more crowded and they left people behind. I really like Eurowings simple and economical extras model as they all come in one package which is not thet expensive compared to other airlines. The staff was really polite and everything was smooth. We took in total 3 flights with them. All on time. All easy on boarding and relatively comfortable. Beat budget airline i have used by far. Especially since covid when every airline has gone crazy expensive and most flights are deliberately overbooked and everyone is struggling with delays. No such problems with Eurowings. No people left behind. No cabin luggage forced into the hold. No delays. No lost luggage. Extra legroom is very reasonably priced and offers reasonable legroom. I am 187cm and was comfortable enough.

### "friendly flight attendants"
Uneventful on-time flight, very comfortable and friendly flight attendants. Everything worked like a clock work. Enjoyed the short flight and will likely fly with them again.

### "first and last time"
Not Verified | The worst company for flights! I do not recommend it, especially if the person is traveling with a small child. They forgot our bags on Hamburg and people with families who wait for nothing. Most of the people in the airport were very rude! The first and last time I am flinging with this "company

### "Customer service is non-existent"
Not Verified | This airline is ruining my trip to Europe. On leg one, London to Berlin, we missed our connection in Cologne as we had to go through passport control and security, which took more than an hour. The airline informed us it was our fault, We were forced to pay for a hotel for the night, as well as the hotel room we could not use at our destination. Unfortunately, we had already booked Eurowings for a flight from Berlin to Rome. This time they lost the luggage, and filing a claim took an hour and a half They had no idea where the luggage was or when it would arrive. Customer service is non-existent.

### "We will never fly Eurowings again"
Not Verified |  Eurowings is a horrible, incompetent and callously uncaring airline. We flew them from Athens to Lisbon via Dusseldorf. They misdirected our (and lots of other passengers) luggage in Dusseldorf. This was inexcusable. They had plenty of time for the baggage transfer. The flight to Lisbon was actually delayed. When our luggage failed to arrive in Lisbon we were sent to an third party baggage tracking company that could not have cared less about out situation. Eurowings would not be bothered. They ruined our visit to Lisbon by not getting our luggage to us. Communication and support was non-existent. Our luggage finally showed up minutes before our flight home. We will never fly Eurowings again.

### "Nightmare airline"
Not Verified |  Nightmare airline, avoid at all costs. Our 1.5 hour trip turned into a 17 hour hellstorm. First, none of the check-in machines even acknowledged we had a trip with them. I wouldn't waste your time with those. We were notified our second connecting flight was cancelled while our first plane was taxiing, thus having no recourse. No reason was stated, but judging from the amount of people who were also in line for the hotel, it was clearly underbooked. When we got off the first plane, no gate attendants were there, and the ticketing desks were completely empty. When we asked the information desk, they said they had all gone home for the evening. The notification gave no further details, and despite the website saying otherwise, we were NOT automatically rebooked for a new flight. We were effectively stranded. We called support. She couldn't find our trip for a while, and kept asking us our names over and over again. Once finally found, she put us on hold for five minutes and then hung up. It wasn't a disconnect, because it thanked us for our call. We called again. The second agent refused to speak to my partner in German despite having an accent and the airline being based in Dusseldorf. Luckily, I can, and explained to her our situation. We were booked on a new flight in the morning via Frankfurt, so thus another two flights before we were home. We were informed there were no accommodations provided and that we had to book our own hotel. Further, when I asked for a discount on our ticket, they said we're not entitled to one. We get a hotel for the night and get up to go to our flights. After waiting 30 minutes in the queue for three agents to help what must have been 200 people (the queue nearly going out the airport doors), we get to the booth and find out that the rescheduled flights weren't even with Eurowings but with their parent company Lufthansa, and that they couldn't even check us in. We were directed to a Lufthansa desk that told us they couldn't do compensation, and gave us only our first boarding pass. We had to get our actual boarding passes at the gate for some reason. During our security check, both my partner and I were "selected" for a manual screening. We get to the gate, and after waiting 30 minutes for our first flight's gate desk queue, which was delayed, we find out that we're on standby - for both flights. We had seat reservations on the original booking, and paid more than a "cheap airline" in Europe usually costs to boot. Given that the flight was with Lufthansa and not Eurowings, they were able to find us seats, albeit them being on opposite ends of the plane. Our second flight was also on standby and we were originally told we had to wait, but I think the other gate agent saw us taking a breath to simultaneously demand that we speak to a supervisor, took the tickets out of the other's hand, and found us seats together for our final leg. She was also very nice to boot, something the Eurowings employees were anything but. We now have to fight with the company's terrible website and customer support to be compensated for our overnight stay. Stay away.

### "I won’t complain"
Short hop on this airline belonging to the Lufthansa Group. Basically not really worse than flying with many European Airlines who claim to be “Premium” letting you anyway pay for food, drinks, seats, luggage etc, so I won’t complain. Eurowings is a low cost airline. Crew was joyful and cabin presented well, even if the seat pitch at the back of the plane isn’t great. Pay for food is reasonably priced and the crew handled the process efficiently. Love Eurowings boarding concept: two groups. Priority with those having booked a fare including a larger cabin luggage and normal boarding for those with standard hand luggage.

### "worst customer services ever"
Worst company ever. Never fly with them. They did overbooking on the flight and didn’t allow me to take the flight as I was not a business class member. Because of them I could not fly on that day and could not start my business meetings on time in Prague. I was rebooked on a flight the next day 26 May which is not a direct one. A real waste of time, waste of money, a lot of stress, and the worst customer services ever with no prior information about all this. They let us wait until after the flight had boarded without appropriate information. 1 hour after the supposed flight departure I was rebooked on the next day flight. Disastrous

### "they lied in our face"
Not Verified |  My wife with our 15 months old son had a confirmed tickets. At the check in counter she was informed that "2 seats were broken" therefore she only could get stand by tickets. They could have be honest telling the plan was overbooked but no, they lied in our face. A mother with 15 months old child had to wait at the gate to see if should could get a flight. She did not get an option that she could fly another day, no she had to wait. She was able to get on the plane, all of the sudden there was not broken seats. When she wanted to claim her bags, she was not able to as the bags were not delivered to Porto. There was no apology. Until now we do not know were the bags are nor anyone at Eurowings is willing to assist.

### "Absolutely the worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I had just arrived at the airport for my flight when my original flight changed. This wasn’t even a delay! Suddenly, I was now flying a completely different route, on a completely different airline, on a different day. So, to start off this poor experience they failed to inform their customers in a timely manner about these big changes. Next my new flight was booked for 5:30am the following morning. Eventually I was assisted at the Eurowings Discover desk and managed to get booked into a hotel about 10 minutes away from the hotel. The next morning, I had to make sure I was at the airport in time for my flight, meaning I had to wake up at 3am (bear in mind I only got to the hotel room at around 9 pm the night before). Leaving this early meant I missed my complimentary breakfast and I had to pay for my own transport back to the airport as the hotel’s shuttle service was not yet operational. After successfully flying with the new airline, Delta, I arrived at my first destination. After arriving at my connecting destination, I had an 11–hour layover where I had to try keep myself occupied (thanks to the Eurowings Discovers fantastic new flight itinerary they chose for me – sarcasm!). Once arriving at my final destination, I voiced my poor experience to Eurowings Discovers customer care. 1 month later I received a really promising response from them in which they apologized for their poor service delivery as well as offering me compensation to the amount of which they thought was sufficient. I must say I was very happy with the compensation offer they had proposed, and I accepted their apology. They asked me to send through my banking details so that they could transfer the money into my account. After responding to their email, I sent through the required information, only to get one last slap in the face from this joke of an airline. I receive an email saying, “We are sorry for previous email we must respectfully inform you that current European regulations are not applicable to the routing travelled.” This after initially receiving a contradictory email which said quite the opposite - “In accordance with applicable EU regulations, we would like to offer you compensation in the amount of…” I am not sure where to take this further because the responses I have received from their customer relations department have lacked proper explanations and are extremely contradictory. One thing for sure though, if this if how they are going to deal with this situation, I can confidently say that I will never recommend, nor will I ever fly with then again in my life.

### "rudeness in communication"
This is most probably the worst airline I have ever traveled with. Unbelievable, I would not even fly with them again if they gave me 1.000,- euro with it. The only reason for me to leave a review is that I hope that I can at least convince one other traveler never to book with Eurowings. A summary of what happened: - we travel with our 2 kids (11 and 12) and our seats are completely spread across the plane. When checking in via the app you can change your seat to sit next to each other. They make you pay for this, so no seat upgrade, just to sit next to your eleven year old son. So we paid, no choice. But, when entering the plane they changed the seat of me and my wife. So they made us pay for something that should have just been a standard and then they take it away without apologizing and of course no refund. And of course our kids had to travel alone. The seats itself are way too small. I don’t mind seats with Ryanair or Transavia, but this is a completely different league. I am 1.89 Meters and it was impossible to get my knees in between my seat and the seat in front of me. For the return trip which leaves in 2 days, I just found out that we are again seated far away from each other, this time it is even impossible to pay for seats next to each other. So I called the service line. After waiting for over 15 minutes I was “helped” by lady who told me that see could not seat us together because other passengers already paid extra to sit together and she cannot change seats of passengers who have paid extra. When I told her that this is exactly what happens to us on the departing flight she just hang up. Not only for an airline but just in general I think that the lack of service and the rudeness in communication makes this the worst company I ever came across.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. The flight from Frankfurt to Cancun, which was Eurowings - a subgroup of Lufthansa, was horrible. Firstly, the flight was delayed more than an hour. Secondly they gave us 1 meal over the whole 12 hours. 1 meal. Then a cookie just before the end. I was not even given a choice of meal. I was just given pasta with a pathetic amount of tomato sauce. They also made the cabin freezing. Me and the girl sat next to me were shivering. They don't give you blankets in economy, they charge you 8 euros for a blanket and obviously you have to buy it. The staff were so unhelpful and so rude. I asked to sit near to the exit during landing so that I could run off quickly and hopefully make the connection and no staff would help me. No one cared. They just said whatever I can't help. The whole vibe of the staff was uncaring, rude and abrupt. The movie selection was also abysmal.

### "isn’t really a business class"
Checked in on Eurowings‘ App but had to go at check in desk as I had some questions regarding lounge, priority lane etc. The person at the business class counter was not aware of anything, basically denied me lounge access (eventually indicating me the wrong lounge) and priority lane. At the end I could enjoy the priority lane and had no problems getting into the -right- lounge, by simply asking people working at the airport. Onboard incredibly nice flight attendant in the front of the cabin. She really made a difference. Business class with Eurowings isn’t really a business class, except lounge access and priority lanes/boarding (depending on the airport of departure): while flying, the perk is basically the seat next to yours is not occupied and you can choose from the onboard sales menu and get the items for free. Still, all is in a paper cup and packed, so don’t expect a nice presentation on china of what you eat, you just haven’t to pay for it (as long you paid your business class fare).

### "premium price to fly low cost"
Booked on Eurowings and flown on a brand new Airbus 220 of Air Baltic. An excellent seat pitch in a crisp and pleasantly illuminated cabin. But the aircraft and crew were carrying out the flight on behalf of Eurowings and the fact remains I paid Eurowings a premium price to fly low cost. Not complaining flying no frills (and so this flight was), but definitely it is unacceptable paying high fares for nothing. Unfortunately often Eurowings (owned by Lufthansa) is the only option flying in or into Düsseldorf, if one needs to fly directly without stopovers within Europe and therefore one has in most cases no alternatives.

### "Never flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Starting at the check-in desk they asked me for a VISA for a flight between EU member states and not required for my type of passport. Then they told me to go to ticket desk due to an "unknown issue". Ticket desk told me everything was okay and go back to check-in desk. There they told me I had not done my online check-in and had to pay 15 euros for each passenger. I showed them the digital boarding pass, proof of online check-in. They said that it had been undone and that therefore I had to check in with them and pay the 15 euros per passenger. I had to do it otherwise I would loose my flight. They were doing this to each and everyone trying to drop their luggage with them. Never flying with them again.

### "No one on the phone can help"
10 months since Eurowings left me and my kids stranded in Spain and I’m still waiting for a 2000 euro refund!! This was the worst travel experience I have ever had. Our flight home was canceled without any information or help from Eurowings. I couldn’t get home until the day after and paid altogether 2000 euros for hotel, taxis, meals and a new flight. I sent Eurowings all the receipts and information needed as soon as I got back home in June 2022 (!). I still haven’t heard a word from them. I have sent numerous emails, filled out their forms and called. No one on the phone can help and those that can are conveniently not able to reach. Please, do not EVER fly with Eurowings! Don’t let the ticket price fool you.

### "Worst staff attitude"
The Eurowings Erbil, Iraq staff were clearly not trained and overwhelmed, incapable of managing in a reliable fashion, and collect payment for luggage. I literally showed them the email which confirms my payment for an extra bag but they still charged me extra 40 Euros without giving me a clear clarification & explanation. They even did not say sorry or thank you. I hope the management team will train their staff on how to improve their customer service skills in future. Worst staff attitude I have experienced in my life.

### "customer service is appalling"
There was a delayed departure from Edinburgh airport to Cologne of 2h and 30 min which obviously led to lose my connecting flight to Thessaloniki. I sent an email to ask the compensation of the tickets since the arrival to my final destination was 12h after the original one, since I lost the connection flight and this led to stay in Cologne airport without receiving any refreshments from the airline, no accommodation to sleep, absolutely nothing. When I arrived to Thessaloniki, I sent an email to the company asking for compensation and they replied to my email 8 months later and they said that am not eligible for compensation of the tickets because the delay it was due to unforeseen circumstances which was outside of their control. I will advice anyone who is going to consider Eurowings for their flight to think twice not to mention three times, since the customer service is appalling (reply after 8 months from the initial claim is an absolute joke) and not accepting to refund for the significant delay when you are eligible for it, is an absolutely disgrace.

### "Don’t recommend at all"
I paid to get extra luggage in cabin, they didn’t let me to bring it although it was in their parameters. I paid for fast lane, but there’s no fast lane. Hope they don’t ask me to change from the sit with extra leg space I also paid, like they are doing to other passengers. Don’t recommend at all.

### "I was given a middle seat"
I had specifically requested for an aisle seat. They guaranteed me during checkin that I am having an aisle seat but I was given a middle seat. The food served to me was bland. You need to pay for earphones to use the screens. Please do not waste your money on this airline. There are much better airlines out there.

### "The worst boarding experience"
Not Verified |  The worst boarding experience ever. The personnel was unpleasant and totally mismanaged passport control and extra luggage payment. No information was distributed so most passengers had to queue several times, for boarding, passport control, and luggage payment. The staff was clearly not trained and overwhelmed, incapable of managing in a reliable fashion, collect payment for luggage. This led to a delay in the departures. No hello, no thank you, no sorry - worst staff attitude I have experienced.

### "no reply anymore"
My flight on September 2nd 2022 from Klagenfurt to Cologne was canceled after long waiting at the airport. The reason was technical issue. I spent the night in a hotel and caught a flight the next day. After coming back home I raised the request for compensation on September 9th 2022. After a few days I just got generic reply that they have a lot of requests and mine will be received as soon as possible. Since then I have been writing them many times, but no reply anymore. Just another observation about the extraordinary airline company Eurowings. We also had an emergency on the return flight from Cologne to Klagenfurt on September 5th 2022. There was technical issue with the airplane again. Just before take-off we needed to evacuate the airplane. After waiting at the terminal they found another airplane. There was just 2,5 hours delay.

### "An absolute disgrace"
An absolute disgrace. Filthy aircraft. Pillows covered in hair and makeup from previous passengers. Tray tables filthy. Windows filthy. Food was dreadful. Smash instead actually potatoes. Very small amounts. Bread was stale. In-flight entertainment is years old. Pay for headphones. Cabin crew were not fully trained, exits were blocked. Passengers not secured during landing or taxi. Pay to rent a blanket! I am 5ft 4 inches and I couldn't cross my legs because the space between rows is so small. Absolutely never again.

### "Hassle free experience"
Hassle free experience with Eurowings. London to Hamburg and back. I paid for 'basic' but I had a bag that was slightly larger. I had no problems with taking it onboard. This is a complete no frill airline so there was no food, water, WIFI anything like that.

### "Below standard professionalism"
Horrible experience. Below standard professionalism of cabin crew starting by the cabin manager. Cramped seats. Although having the company paying 100 USD to prebook a first row seat when on the plane realized that was actually on the second row with very limited leg room. Unhealthy to travel in these conditions for over 10 hours. Service very poor. If your target is "low cost" good for you because you will not get anything for your money except potential health issues. Even if you are a Star Alliance Gold member and purchased your ticket with Lufthansa, No lounge access, no priority boarding, no miles accrued. My experience  in a sentence "Too bad to be true"!

### "I will look for other airline carriers"
I am writing this letter to complain about the bad experience I received while travelling via one of Eurowings flights from Cancun to Frankfurt – Flight, number 4Y11. First, the meals were not fresh and were not tasty at all. A lot of the passengers expressed their disgust from them, which by the way went unnoticed by the flight attendants. Speaking of the flight attendants, they were not as friendly as one would expect, and they were extremely slow in fulfilling our requests. It took no less than 30 minutes for me to get a cup of water despite the fact that the attendant passed by my seat at least 10 times. Secondly, I paid a huge amount for my flight tickets, yet it had additional/extra chargers on literally everything; covers, headphones which is super bad, mine didn’t even work properly, our meals & beverages and mid-flight snacks. On top of everything we had no internet access. I urge them to launch a fully comprehensive review of the quality of services offered in their flights taking into considerations the points mentioned above. I am confident that they are not thrilled with receiving complaint letters from your passengers so do something about it. Until then, I regret to inform that I will look for other airline carriers in my next flights when available.

### "The worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  The worst flight experience. Because our flight from Berlin to Cologne was delayed 1 hour, our luggage got misplaced and has gone missing for our entire 4-day stay in London. We have been without 3 pieces of luggage during our stay here with no correspondence from Eurowings at all. There are no good phone numbers to confirm anything. do not fly with eurowings at all costs.

### "canceled my flight at the last minute"
Not Verified |  They canceled my flight at the last minute, leaving me at 10 PM in the connecting city with no instruction or solution to go home. I managed to find (and pay) for a 9 hours train to Berlin. 6 months later, they did not reply to email, didn’t receive a refund, and when you called them, the agent was completely useless, advising you to wait (6 months doesn’t seem enough for her?) or send emails (10 already), because she has no direct connection or number for the refund department - if it exists. Unbearable customer service if we can call it that way, total scam.

### "not consistent with any policy"
Please don’t fly Eurowings. They are not consistent with any policy at all, and lie to their customers. It was promised to take our bags on the plane for 50€ extra, but once in the plane we had to load it in cargo. They promised us it would be ok, as otherwise we would miss our train and we would need to stay an extra night in Dusseldorf. They did not keep their promise. Thanks for nothing.

### "puts profits before customer service"
Not Verified | This is an indifferent airline with a flawed business model that prioritizes and puts profits before customer service and satisfaction. Case in point: Delay outbound from Frankfurt and inbound to Frankfurt by 3 hours. The traveler can secure a specific seat for a fee, BUT gets a different seat assignment at check-in. Is that legal? I guess if you collect money up-front prior to rendering services you can pull these stunts. Meals provided are barely edible (bring your own sandwich for long-haul flights). The cabin staff is friendly. The seats are not designed for today´s traveler, unless you are 150cm a weigh 50kg. In-flight selection is VERY limited and same on return long-haul flights. There is room for improvement, but no incentive to do so. If you run into problems, the government is not far away from providing a bailout funds.

### "They forced all people to stand in a small area"
Flight on time for a short 1 hour flight okay. Only drawback. They forced all people to stand in a small area and wait for an hour. I refused to do so because this spot was fully overcrowded. Finally they let me. Nobody understood this. The other thing is that you now have to buy hand luggage like on Ryanair.

### "premium economy was quite comfy"
Eurowings Discover flight was very Smooth. Delay of 30 Min but due weather. Seat in premium economy was quite comfy. Meal service was very good. Hot meal, two choices pasta or meat. Shrimp noodle salad and mousse au chocolate and hot buns. Pre lading meal was hot Mac and cheese. Flight attendants were very nice and went with the drinks trolley very often through cabin. Only the aircraft was in a poor condition. 18 years old and toilets fixed with tape etc. Only drawback we were booked on a flight with one connection and were send to two connection Paris-Panama-Bogota due to Lufthansa cancelled the flights. Refused to book us on other airline.

### "bounced back and forth to different support"
Stockholm to Palma. Avoid this joke of an airline at all costs. They go on strike way to often. When they do, you are bounced back and forth to different support lines where you have to spend hours to get through. If you have the patience there is no help whatsoever.

### "Totally unreliable airline"
Flight back to Oslo was cancelled 2 hours before departure with offer to rebook 5 days later. Have traveled with Eurowings on the same route a few years back and then the flight was cancelled as well. Totally unreliable airline.

### "For the price it was ok"
For the price it was ok. The cabin crews are friendly, they answered questions about buying snacks in a friendly manner. The chairs were rather uncomfortable for longer distances, since they were a bit tight on the short-haul flight to Palma de Mallorca. The food tasted great and bridged the flight time very well, unfortunately very expensive. 2x coffee and 2x rolls with chicken came 15 EUR. As a low-budget airline, we naturally didn't have any inflight entertainment such as a tablet or customer kits. If you're looking to save money, you can fly with Eurowings, but only for short-haul flights.

### "Eurowings didn't offer any alternative flights"
I was in Stockholm waiting for my flight back to Birmingham in June. It was cancelled at 5am, 1 hour before my flight. I was sat in the airport, alone and with no help. Eurowings didn't offer any alternative flights, assistance for hotels or food. I had to make my way back into the centre to try and find somewhere to stay, which was massively expensive due to hostels no longer being available. The only flight I could afford direct back to the UK was 2 days later, and three times the cost of my origin flights. To this day, Eurowings still haven't refunded me the full cost of my flights. I've solo travelled a lot, but this experience shook me up, as I was left with no help in a foreign country.

### "It is just frustrating"
Every flight with Eurowings ends to more disappointing experience than the previous one. Delays are not a surprise anymore but a fact. If you ever book a Eurowings flight, don’t schedule anything else for the same day. You would have at least 40-50 minutes of delay. At the moment. I am entering my 150. minute of my delay. It is just frustrating.

### "they keep travellers payments"
Do not waste your time and your money with Eurowings. They cancel their flights and they keep travellers payments. So you do not only lose Eurowings tickets but connecting flights as well. Eventually you pay more to travel with more reliable airlines. Eurowings is not a cheap option, it is a sure way to lose money.

### "impossible to reach somebody competent"
Not Verified |  Absolutely ridiculous treatment of client Eurowings lost a bag of my daughter. It is impossible to reach somebody competent on any phone number, they are providing non existing email addresses - this is a complete irresponsible attitude. I am ashamed that such a company is German owned. Their behavior towards clients is not acceptable. After five days no trace of the bag and this is happening within Europe!

### "no refunds for these losses"
The flight was delayed for 3 hours, we lost our connecting flight, and were left without help or compensation. Customers service just ignores any questions. Strongly not recommended for anybody - this company disrespects their duties and their passengers. I have booked two tickets for me and my girlfriend on flight EW9578 from Dusseldorf (DUS) to Palma-de-Mallorca (PMI) on 27.07.2022. That flight was delayed for 3 hours, and because of that, we missed our connecting flight. In such a situation, we were left without any help from Eurowings at PMI airport, without further tickets and any place to live. We were forced to purchase new tickets, for another flight for 210 euros, and lose 7 extra hours. The trip was totally ruined by Eurowings company. The flight was delayed not for a few minutes, but 3 hours, which made us lose time and money, and there were no refunds for these losses! Customer service just ignores any polite emails with questions about the possible solution for this situation, so they ignore their clients and their responsibilities. If you choosing between any other company and Eurowings - choose the other company.

### "at the gate I had to pay 50 euros"
Very dishonest company. The information they sent said that a hand luggage was allowed but at the gate I had to pay 50 euros. The staff was very aggressive and unpleasant.

### "worst company we have ever used"
Not Verified |  This is the worst company we have ever used so far. There was a delay of more than 2,5 hours immediately in Tampa, then we lost the plane in Frankfurt that was going to Zagreb. No one wanted to help us in Frankfurt, it took us 2,5 hours to find right shelter to get a new plane tickets and then we have to wait almost 6 hours until the second flight and all this not our fault. There was not enough food on the plane especially drinks. You always had to ask and it took a long time to be served. They charged if someone wanted a blanket because it was cold. I will make sure that I never fly with this company again.

### "receive an email saying it is cancelled"
My flight from Sweden to Rhodos with my partner was fine, the seats were at the exit and the cabin crew were informative and nice and also nice about me wanting to sit with my partner - we bought our tickets separately. On the way back was the problem. So I had a different return ticket to Sweden then my partner, I went with Norwegian and him with Eurowings. We get an cryptic information email the day before departure and the same day as the flight we receive an email saying it is cancelled. Instead of calling and letting us know and giving us option on how we would like to proceed the hunt for getting him back with me to Sweden becomes a nightmare! We call the customer service and they tell us that they can provide him with a flight 3 days later which is not an option, my partner had a ticket to go back to Australia from Sweden the following day so that was not an option and not either to get a refund! Imagine getting your money back and having to pay twice as much. We told them it's not good enough and they gave us a number to call to proceed with other alternatives but  they didn't pick up so we go straight to the airport to speak with them on site. We get to the airport and the staff member that we talk to  is a bit clueless and tells us the same thing and we say it's not good enough and we are just waiting to see what they can do for us, in the meantime a woman with her child and mother are in the same situation but because they are 3 people - grandmother, mother and child they get prioritized for the Lufthansa flight to Sweden - which I get but they got the last flight seats which is very unfortunate for my partner! The lady that was helping us is telling us that she is waiting for EuroWings to call back for confirmation if my partner can get a ticket to go with me on my flight and the time is ticking and then they say that it is booked out! I get frustrated and ask them what is going on and I don't want to leave my partner behind and not knowing what is going to happen to them and at the end they tell us to book our own ticket and get reimbursed.

### "experienced the worst customer service"
I experienced the worst customer service when handling a delayed/lost bag. Not only did they block receiving calls about lost baggage, they also give out false information on the location of bags. I’ve been waiting for more than 5 weeks and today finally picked up my suitcase in Hamburg. I did not get notified via email and when showing up at the airport counter today, I was told my bag was sent to Düsseldorf because I did not pick it up in Hamburg after 5 days. I had to go into one of the Terminals and pick out my bag among 500 others.

### "told me in an aggressive way to keep my mask on"
We, a family of four, travelled from Gran Canaria to Düsseldorf on the 24th of August. During the 4,5-hour flight we had to wear our face masks but with my one year old son this proved to be quite challenging. He sometimes removed my mask to see my face in a playful way. However, this was highly frowned upon by two of the stewardesses during the flight. They were really rude and told me in an aggressive way to keep my mask on. During descent my son experienced some ear pain and we lost the extra belt needed for infants during this commotion. The stewardesses were annoyed instead of being helpful and were reluctant to find the belt. It translated into a very unpleasant attitude on their part trying to make it seem as if we hid the belt on purpose (as if). When the plane landed they made no attempt to help me reaching for a suitcase in the overhead compartment while I held my son. After sending the contact form and calling customer service I still have not received any answer.

### "Absolutely shocking"
A colleague and I flew with EuroWings on Flight EW9331 from Birmingham to Dusseldorf on 17th June 2022. After we had been on the aircraft for about 30 minutes, we were told we would be leaving for our destination without our luggage. We were travelling for a week of business in Dusseldorf. Inside the cases was not only our clothes, but personal effects, laptop chargers, business cards and everything you could imagine when travelling to a business exhibition. Once we arrived at Dusseldorf, we could not do anything about our luggage at the time as it was nearly midnight and the only people on duty were cleaning staff. The aircrew – and this was a Baltic Airlines flight – simply told us to see customer service, and this we had asked details of as we got off the flight. They did not pass a single piece of information to any passenger unless they asked. On Saturday 18th June we returned to Dusseldorf airport and sought out the help of the EuroWings customer services team. We were then told to go to building P3 (lost and found) and search for our cases, which were clearly not there. We returned to customer services, gave all our details (email, mobile telephone numbers, the hotel name and address we were stopping at and kept a record of the reference we were given. We were told that the luggage would be transported to Dusseldorf on the next available flight from Birmingham – and not just the next available Eurowings flight, which we knew would be in the evening of 19th June. We had colleagues booked onto this flight as well. Despite having our contact details we received no email, text message or telephone call throughout the weekend. We then had to go shopping for alternative clothes and basic essentials such as toiletries. My colleague and I tried calling several times on Saturday and Sunday from 6am onwards (once we had purchased a phone charger), but the telephone number for Eurowings customer services in Dusseldorf constantly rang without being answered. We both tried calling for about an hour before giving up. Our colleagues were asking about the luggage before they boarded their flight on 19th June but staff at Birmingham were unaware that there had been an issue on the Friday night flight. My colleague and I then returned at 6.45am on Monday 20th June to the customer services at EuroWings in Dusseldorf airport. My colleague stayed at customer services while I went to search for our luggage, again in building P3. When I got to building P3 I was told our luggage was still logged on the computer system as being in Birmingham, UK. We were finally shown to the luggage belts airside where our luggage was waiting, along with a lot more abandoned luggage. I have contacted Eurowings customers service three times via the online contact form and have heard nothing back at all. The online check for whether we are entitled to compensation or not cannot be done as this flight was operated by Baltic Airlines, and I am told we have to wait to be contacted by Eurowings. Absolutely shocking, not only in the service from the company themselves, but to not receive a reply from contacting them three times since my return to the UK is appalling. Will never, personally or business wise, use this airline again. Shame I cannot give a 0 on the overall rating.

### "not considered hand luggage"
I find the Eurowings hand luggage policy to be a scam. When boarding, the colleagues are already waiting with a note that says "50€" in bold, because hand luggage trolleys are not considered hand luggage and can only be taken with you at an additional cost. This happened to me and the person after me and before me that we didn't understand during the booking process that we have to pay extra for a trolly. Yes, one can say that one has communicated it. But if so many people don't notice, it's bad communication. At a time when customer focus is becoming more and more important, this 50 euro penalty fee has had a very negative impact on my experience. Ich empfinde die Handgepäck Policy von Eurowings als Scam. Beim Boarding warten die Kollegen bereits mit einem Zettel auf dem fett "50€" steht, da Handgepäck-Trollys nicht als Handgepäck gelten und nur gegen einen Aufpreis mitgenommen werden dürfen. Das ist bei mir und der Person nach mir und vor mir passiert, dass wir beim Buchungsvorgang nicht verstanden haben, dass wir einen Trolly extra bezahlen müssen. Ja, man kann sagen, dass man es kommuniziert hat. Wenn es aber so vielen Personen nicht auffällt, handelt es sich um eine schlechte Kommunikation. In einer Zeit, in der Kundenfokus immer wichtiger wird, hat diese 50 Euro Strafgebühr meine Erfahrung sehr negativ beeinflusst.

### "never experienced such an awful flight"
I've travelled to Europe for 20 years and have never experienced such an awful flight before. Eurowings Discover is the worst airline. My original flight was cancelled due to Lufthansa protests and we were booked 7 days later with a Eurowings discover flight to For Myers. I was traveling with my 1 year old baby girl and my 7 year old son. As soon as we got to our seats, we noticed everyone's TV's had power but our did not. We asked the flight attendant to please turn on our screens and she just replied that they are out of order and the flight is fully booked so they can't do anything. I replied that this is unacceptable. We're traveling with children on a 10 and a half hour flight, why was I sold these seats if the screens don't operate? She just said, I'm sorry I will ask my cabin manager if we can do something. The flight attendant never returned with a solution. I then pulled a 2nd attendant and asked to speak to the cabin manager. Another hour goes by and still nothing! I got very upset. It seemed like nobody cared that they took our money and everyone had working screens but us. I got up and went to the attendant zone. I waited 20 minutes to speak to someone. A guy came out and said, that he apologized but there is nothing he can do except to send a message to the airline that will send partial reimbursement for the inconvenience. We had the most boring flight. The food that was served to us was disgusting. We were given a sandwich with  carrots and soggy cheese on a cold bread. I asked if I can purchase food of any sort other than what they gave us, and all they had to offer us for a purchase was a chocolate stick, a snickers bar or peanuts. The drinks they served were tiny 3 inch plastic cups filled half way with water or soda. The seat had no bassinet attachment for the baby and I had to hold her in my hands for 10 and a half hours. Previous airlines I've traveled to Europe with had a bassinet attachment and the baby sleeps in that. All in all, absolutely the worst food, worst experience flying. Empty promises that they will send a partial credit. As we walked out they waved bye and we never  received an apology email or a credit.

### "I would travel again with Eurowings"
Not Verified |  I would travel again with Eurowings. Friendly staff, even left my granddaughter go into the cockpit for her birthday. Left on time, landed on time, no delays and luggage was quick coming through - well done.

### "Just stay away"
10 hours flight, AC so high it feels freezing and they don't give you small blanket. Just small pillow. Monitors without headphones. Coffee without sugar. Delayed 5 hours because there was no staff to clean the plane. And now waiting for a gate for 20 minutes after landing. Just stay away.

### "The worst flying experience"
Worst airline ever flown I had booked a flight from Marseilles to Vienna with a stop at Düsseldorf. The first flight was almost an hour late, so I missed my connection. At Düsseldorf, I was given a new ticket for the flight to Vienna and told to report my check-in luggage missing. Now, four days later, I have still not heard anything from my luggage, despite having reported it immediately. There is zero customer service. Nobody will help you to locate your missing luggage. The worst flying experience I have ever had.

### "Shambolic company"
Not Verified |  Shambolic company. Left us stranded in Stuttgart for 2 days following cancellation. No support staff. Now 2 months after sending expenses claims finally respond to my emails to say they can’t find my expenses claims. This is 2 months after constantly chasing for a refund and no responses. Disgusting way to treat your customers and they hide behind emails, no real customer service and unwilling to pay back expenses that they caused due to cancellation of a flight that we were boarding as they cancelled! No offer to help with hotel / food, they just didn’t care

### "I will never fly with Eurowings again"
Flight postponed two times, then cancelled. No chance to get alternative flights that late. Automatic rebooking is a joke. Ryanair is operating normally. I will never fly with Eurowings again. By the way I am still waiting on my reimbursement for another cancelled Eurowings flight from two weeks ago

### "worst airline I've ever flown on"
Easily the worst airline I've ever flown on. The flight was moved several times, but each time it was moved it was within the two-hour window, so we were not allowed a refund or reschedule, but by the time the changes were done, we were set to arrive three hours late. Right when boarding was set to begin, they delayed it by 30 minutes. Then we were bussed out to the plane, where we sat for two hours because the air conditioning wasn't working. In 90 degree heat with the door open, we were never offered food or water. We were constantly told the issue would be fixed soon, and it was not. After the flight, I put in a complaint because we arrived 5.5 hours after our initial flight plan, and they never responded. Put in another complaint, still no response. If you're considering flying Eurowings, I'd recommend just taking a train wherever you're going. It'll be cheaper, less frustrating, and you'll get better service.

### "Cabin crew really annoying"
Eurowings flight operated by Avion Express Malta. No business class available. No extra legroom. Seats not cleaned. Cabin crew really annoying and doesn't care. And they stuff others handbags on top of yours without being gentle. Just slam and press it in and close the lid.

### "charged us each 50 EUR for our small carry ons"
The flight from Venice to Stuttgart was delayed because of a general italian strike, Eurowings postponed the flight for a couple of hours and we missed our connecting flight to Hamburg. We arrived to Stuttgart, the ticket booking desk helped us with the rebooking to the flight we wanted to catch the next day and we were told to go to the hotel and then charge back the costs to the airline. Up to here, all good. The airline did everything as they should. The problem started in Stuttgart airport at the Eurowings boarding gate for our flight to Hamburg. We booked Basic and payed additionally to drop each our luggage. We only had a small carry on (we travelled light) and we checked if we can dropped what we payed for at the boarding gate and the answer was yes! Especially happy due to the problems that are currently happening with the luggage. We done so in Venice, so why wouldn't this be allowed in Stuttgart? The lady working at the Eurowings boarding gate in Stuttgart, decided differently and charged us each 50 EUR for our small carry ons, so we can drop them next to the plane. We thought it was because the plane was busy or full. No, the plan was half empty and there was a lot of space for more carry-on luggages. I haven't experienced a more dishonest and literally dedicated to customer unsatification employees as these lady at these gate for a very long time. I would not recommend to use Eurowings when flying via Stuttgart and if possible to use Dusseldorf as connecting airport.

### "not bad for a low fare carrier"
We had booked a Smart fare and were pleased with the extra legroom and effective priority boarding (though the seat was a little hard for a 3 hrs plus flight). The plane operated 45 mins late. The queues for check-in and to get into the departure lounge were long and slow, partly due to Eurowings justified attempts to weed out oversize cabin luggage. The smooth process of boarding and stowing cabin baggage made up for the earlier queues. Strangely, after one pass through the cabin to sell refreshments the cabin crew disappeared for the rest of the 3 hrs plus flight. At Hamburg the plane was met by buses, but the disembarkation process was smooth. Overall Eurowings was not bad for a low fare carrier -- comparable with Jetstar and a cut above Ryan Air.

### "Horrible, service and atrocious prices"
We paid 897 Euros for three tickets ONE WAY from Berlin to Catania Sicily. At the checkin desk, the Eurowings representative checked our two suitcases in and saw our hand luggage and approved them. Two minutes before boarding, we were taken aside by impolite and unfriendly attendants who told us that since we were in Group 2 (i.e we did not pay enough), trolleys (one of our approved hand luggage pieces) cannot board and needs to be checked in or paid for with 50 Euros! On the flight, less than professional flight attendants. We changed flights in Stuttgart and landed in Catania exhausted from a night of flying. In Catania one of the checked in suitcases did not arrive! Two days later the suitcase has still not arrived. Horrible, service and atrocious prices.

### "Terrible Customer Service"
Terrible Customer Service, no one to talk to, no one answers any e-mail, No one takes any responsibility. Suitcase did not arrive at destination, already waiting a week for any update or need on the where about off the baggage. Completely ruined my trip to Germany. 30€ for each of the first 3 days? Many emails have been send to Eurowings customer service and several Managers without any response.

### "Horrible, horrible airline"
Horrible, horrible airline. My flight was delayed twice, and the airline was not helpful at all. Leaving customers stuck at a city, despite offering a refund, is still very irresponsible. I've had a very fixed schedule, and due to EW's fault, I have suffered a great deal with my work and personal life. I do not recommend flying with this airline unless you really have no other choice.

### "Cannot recommend the at all"
The worst of the worst airlines: the flight had a delay of 2 hours and 50 minutes. No help from the ground staff was given in terms of telling the passengers what to do or offering some water or a meal. No reaction at all. During the flight the crew stayed at the galley “because of the turbulence we offer no meal service”. There were no turbulence. The crew must have been tired so they didn’t want to do any unnecessary additional work. Please try to avoid the when you can. Cannot recommend the at all.

### "The worst service and air company"
Direct flight 19/06/2022 from Rome to Hamburg was canceled 7 hours before departure. No hotel, no food, no transfer offer / voucher of information from Eurowings. Call center don’t answer. No Eurowings staff at the FCO airport. You have to find out everything by yourself. Had to find a hotel for my own money. But what if you don’t have money for hotel? Or food? Got only email with alternative flight 20/06/2022 evening from FCO to FRA and from FRA to HAJ which is not my final destination at all. From Hannover HAJ I have to somehow get to Hamburg HAM 21/06/2022 at night by my own. No transfer offer or any information. And two missed work days. The worst service and air company I know. And compensation I can claim online is only 250eur? One hotel night and dinner in Rome costs more.

### "nearly missed the plane"
Not Verified |  Again 1.5 hours on a normal inner German flight. Delay was brought to attention 15 min prior to expected departure. Lounge and screens did not notify about boarding ca. 10 passengers including me nearly missed the plane. When you think it can’t get worse you can rely EW finds a way!

### "my luggage was literally 3 cm more"
I traveled with my small dog, and before the flight, I read all rules from animal travelers and tried to find information about bags for my dog. Nothing was mentioned. I arrived with a plastic box which is required in trains, and staff said it`s not appropriate then I left the box and suggest to put my dog in another soft bag, that they wanted, but they said to me that only way I could fly it`s to buy their soft bag for 60 EU. I bought it, and they charged for another 40 EU when my luggage was literally 3 cm more.

### "flight was either canceled or postponed"
Not Verified |  In the last 2 years, almost every time I booked a flight with Eurowings, the flight was either canceled or postponed (and new times were completely useless). It is not worth booking a flight with this airline. Refunds were not always made! You are very unreliable. In den letzten 2 Jahren, fast immer wenn ich einen Flug mit Eurowings gebucht habe, der Flug wurde entweder abgesagt oder verschoben (und neue Zeiten waren komplett sinnlos). Es loht sich gar nicht einen Flug mit dieser Fluggeselschaft zu buchen. Gelderstattung wurde nicht immer gemacht! Sie sind sehr unzuverlässig.

### "refusing to offer any compensation"
Our flight was cancelled 9h before the departure. At the time of the cancelation no explanations were given nor an alternative flight offered. We were left helpless and the company is still failing to provide clear explanations regarding the reasons for the cancellation and refusing to offer any compensation. The service provided is poor and unacceptable.

### "they refuse to rebook or refund"
Worst customer experience and service ever. No answers on the phone for hours. The customer service personnel are rude and refuse to help even if it’s there own fault. The systems always end up being down and then you have to call but they refuse to rebook or refund.

### "back to regular pre-pandemic delays"
Berlin to Salzburg. Eurowings are back to the regular pre-pandemic delays of at least an hour. As a frequent flyer depending on being able to travel via plane inside the EU almost every week, that's a big minus. Instead of apologizing to their customers, they aggressively start using the waiting time to check luggage and charge €50 if you don't have booked Group 1. That's hard to watch and shows the wrong leadership and customer service in the Eurowings/Lufthansa group. EasyJet is offering more connections now, and they have been constantly on time and much more transparent in the booking process. Therefore luckily, I don't need them anymore for all connections.

### "Long lines, no self-kiosk help"
Not Verified |  Most disorganized ever encountered at Eurowings, Heathrow. Long lines, no self-kiosk help. Called London for wheelchair at Hamburg and Paris, assured on phone. Not at Hamburg, not at Paris, long walk airport distances.

### "Second flight this week the nightmare continues"
It is me again. Second flight this week the nightmare continues. Nearly 2 Hours of delay flown by a partner airline Avion Express far from inspiring confidence. Eurowings is week by week achieving bigger negative surprises. The monopoly in GER for Lufthansa and Eurowings turns to be devastating for customers. Can only advise against the airline.

### "airline is just badly managed"
I am a Senator since many years. This airline is just badly managed and does not respect customers any single day. This holds true for delays and cancellations which happen randomly, for service rendered online and offline. You can not rely on dates, timings, etc.. Only the board crews are trying to make up for this disaster. For inner German flights there is nobody else yo can fly with which may explain the attitude.

### "I have never come in contact with such a bad company to fly with"
Not Verified |  I have never come in contact with such a bad company to fly with. They refuse to check you in on your own blaming Covid (even though no other company or countries need to do this, also using masks because of some stupid German rules). They rebooked my flight back home from 19.00 to 10.45 without asking me which is a huge difference in time to fly back home. Impossible to get a hold of when trying to rebook. Everything is in German. I don’t know what French complex this company has but having everything in German is very delusional. I do not recommend and will never fly with the company again. They have been bad at absolutely everything since I first booked my tickets. If I could give a zero I would.

### "choose any other company"
Not Verified |  Outrageous. They cancelled the flight two hours before departure. Then rebooked to the next morning. Skipping informing on compensation, providing accommodation for the night, refusing booking ticket to another flight service on the same day. The two worker at the Eurowings stand stated that "We are not Eurowings employees, we are hired agency" They refused to help in anything, because "they are responsible only for rebooking", "It is between you and Eurowings, contact them". I made the mistake not fully trusting the reviews written here, please dont do that and choose any other company.

### "does not take any responsibility"
Windhoek to Manchester via Frankfurt. Provided service is very poor. For blankets, you have to pay. There are no meal options. My friend is vegan and finished up hungry on 10h flight as there is no vegetarian option. They also have delayed departure by 24h. Have applied for compensation that belongs to me and no response after 1 month already. This airline does not take any responsibility.

### "Both flights were delayed"
Don't book flights with this company unless you are willing to wait a lot and especially if you have connecting flights. Went for a weekend to Stuttgart. Flew from Amsterdam to Stuttgart on Friday and back from Stuttgart to Amsterdam on Monday. Both flights were delayed last notice for 1h and 30'. This is a huge delay for a flight of around 1h 15

### "uses other ways to increase the price"
This is a company that wants to appear cheap but in reality it is very expensive, because it uses other ways to increase the price of the ticket. I paid for a small hand luggage of dimensions 40x25x15, 45 Euro. The Eurowings page where I bought the ticket did not say I had to pay for this 3.5kg hand luggage. At the airport where I went to travel and pay, otherwise I had to travel without my hand luggage and without caring if I had money.

### "expected to have priority boarding"
I’m a frequent flyer with Diamond status at SAS. I was flying with Eurowings and expected to have priority boarding, but it was showing group 5 on my boarding pass. I approached a representative of Eurowings and asked why I was placed in group 5. She says the system assign your group so please have a seat. I was totally surprised to receive that ignorance from a service person working for them. Sounds like all negative reviews are true.

### "no answer about the compensation"
Our baggages were delayed and until now [14/4/2022] I have no answer about the compensation that Eurowings ought to us. I have tried several times to contact the company but I get no clear answer. Then I've tried to call the call center and the woman that answered the phone didn't speak English. Even more outrageous is the fact that the company gives the ammount of 30 euros per day and 90 maximum. We were in Paris for business reasons and Eurowings wants us to attend any business or social events wearing clothes [and shoes and bags and cosmetic products and sanitary products] that cost 60 euros, ue to the fact that our baggages came after 2 days.

### "The worst airline I have ever experienced"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever experienced. Our flight was delayed by two and half hours which can happen however the service or should I say lack of service was incredible. The flight was freezing, you had to pay 10 euro for a blanket. My wife is coeliac so can’t eat gluten, they offered her an orange for the grand total of an 11 hour flight. They were so rude and unaccommodating. When asked for a coffee they said it would take ten minutes then never came back. When asked again they got so hostile we were then told no coffee was available! I can honestly say this was the worst flight experience ever and the staff were actually a disgrace.

### "the worst experience I've ever had"
Literally the worst experience I've ever had. At the gate, I was made to pay more than the fare for my carry on. Not only did they tell me it was fine when I was checking in, but the confirmation emails I'd received stated my fare included a carry on. The flight was literally almost empty and they made another passenger cry over it. Afterwards, I sent multiple emails and responded to their survey with absolutely no response. I don't have $60 to randomly throw around whenever an airline decides to steal from me.

### "Horrible, horrible, horrible"
Horrible experience. I checked in online, but couldn't get a boarding pass on my phone because they first needed to check my covid pass. I came to the airport, waited in an already checked in line for half an hour only to be told that I needed to wait in the non checked in line, because I didn't have a boarding pass?! Then I tried to print my boarding pass on their machine and it worked? But the machine showed an error when I entered the miles and more number, so I couldn't collect miles. The next catastrophe was when I was called to the gate and was said that I booked a flight with a small bag and had to pay 45€. I asked to be shown where it says that I only had a small bag. but the person was rude and wouldn't show it to me. Horrible, horrible, horrible.

### "misleading check-in experience"
Really disappointing, unprofessional, and misleading check-in experience. I'm a long time traveler, FTL member of Miles and More for may years, and have to date never had such an awful check-in. It's shameful to think that Eurowings is owned by Lufthansa. To start with, the online check-in simply doesn't work. There are several ways to do this all of which keep throwing errors. We had two separate bookings and for both we weren't able to complete the online check-in due to errors. To make matters worse at the airport check-in we found out that the rules for luggage don't respect the measurements and weights advertised online. Be careful, the online specifications for luggage are meant to be misleading! Instead of what is advertised Eurowings check-in staff use a special book, with pictures, which we were presented with, to justify some type of luggage categories which include properties such as wheels or handles, and which ultimately is meant to make us pay additionally. Take care! These luggage descriptions are not available online and are not respecting what is sent as information when you make your booking. For us this meant that even though my luggage respected the dimensions for small hand luggage 40x30x25, because it was on wheels it counts as a different category. So we were told to pay for additional luggage. To add insult to injury, for the additional piece of luggage, we were told that if we want the "normal" price of €25 instead of €44, we must do this through the app, which I'm sure you guessed by now, threw out an error on the last step when payment details were submitted. The conclusion I'm forced to draw is that Eurowings uses a combined strategy of faulty digital service with deliberate misleading information so that it can make extra money of its clients.

### "In general a good airline"
In general a good airline and I often use them. What upset me is the fact, that if I reserve a seat during booking and pay for it, the fee for the seat reservation may be higher during check-in and I have to pay an uplift fee for it. And an additional input to increase the corporate identity could be to provide the cabin crew unique masks. Today, everybody wears their individual mask.

### "advertise as needing masks to be worn"
Very disappointing flight in these times, and could not believe the attitude, at no time did I cause a problem, but pointed out to two different cabin stewards on 3 occasions that the row in front had removed their masks as soon as they sat for boarding the staff confirmed to me when I checked that on Eurowings they advertise as needing masks to be worn. I again pointed out on disembarking to both the chief steward and the captain that this had happened on a flight supervised by them, to which the only response I hear was it was not there fault! This does not forgive no attempt to reason with the passengers or to remind them again, the stated policy of the airline should at least allow cabin crew to not continually walk by and ignore it on each occasion. I will not be flying with a carrier where the airline does not have the backing of there flag to mandate the wearing of masks, and I believe this is something that passengers are not aware of.

### "Eurowings denied refund"
Had priority boarding and extra hand-luggage booked (that means: 2 pieces, 1 with 8 kg, a 2nd smaller bag with unspecified weight) - At airport I was told despite my booking for extra hand luggage I was only permitted one piece, restricted to 8 kg - I had 9,2 kg and was told I would need to remove 1,2 kg - I remarked that since I had booked extra I was Fine with the 1 item rule, but felt I should be permitted a bit more weight. That was rejected. (I had to put on extra clothes) - There was no priority boarding I contacted customer service, asking for a refund. Extra luggage service not provided - no additional weight permitted - no additional luggage in board permitted - no priority boarding provided. Eurowings denied refund arguing that rules can change. I maintained that it is ok to change rules, but in case of no service provision a refund or voucher is in order.

### "no social distancing and no extra line for priority"
I booked with my family business class for our holiday in August, to Stuttgart, Germany. On our way back, at the airport, we lined up in the priority line. There was one customer in front of us, nobody behind us. We were in our holiday clothes, not suit and tie. The check in clerk stood up and shouted in German (I speak German) on top of this voice "This line is only for priority customers, you should join the other line". 100 heads turned around looking at us, all from the economy line and we looked like criminals. I then said I was business class. His female colleague then asked him if she should see us (him clearly being the supervisor). He told her not to and they let us wait until almost all of the economy line cleared out (like to be punished). When I challenged him about how embarrassing this was rather than apologising he lectured me that he had to keep the line free for business class customers (again like I was not) at which time I shut up and didn't say anything anymore. Also, the lounge in Stuttgart was closed (open in London), there was no proper food or drink on the plane and boarding was a farce with no social distancing and no extra line for priority. Finally busses in Stuttgart packed all the passengers of the whole plane in 1 bus to save on cost not caring about Coronavirus and social distancing in the slightest and drove like they had to win a Grand Prix race. Therefore my advice: 1) If you can fly BA instead, better fly BA economy than Eurowings business and you will be treated much better 2) If you cant avoid flying with them don't book any upgrades, they treat you like cattle anyway. You wont get any decent food neither and the business class lounges are closed.

### "canceled without any reason"
Budapest to Stuttgart. They just schedule a flight, wait for customers to pay the ticket and my flight for 31 July canceled without any reason. I just booked the ticket a couple weeks before when the situation is same as now. So they schedule flights for ticket money.

### "no response to my inquiry"
I was informed of a last minute significant flight change (Date and Departure) 16 days prior to the new flight date. I attempted to speak to a customer service rep as soon as I could, but the line was either busy and magically disconnected while on hold, so submitted an online inquiry to let them know the flight is not to my convenience. Not to mention that all the notifications were made in German. Of course no response to my inquiry at all and I was excited when the line finally put me through today, but this representative told me that only option that I have is to change the flight before the departure, then he hang up on me when I was asking him a question. I even listened to the recorded conversation before writing this review to make sure there was nothing wrong on my end. I am sorry for what they have to go through with the current situation with COVID-19, but it would not justify this kind of poor customer service they provided. I do hope all of their business would change for the better if they survive.

### "I still don't have a refund"
Not Verified |  Paris to New York. Flight was cancelled and no refund, this before Covid-19. The customer service doesn't answer their phone or hung up when they dont want to speak with you. My flight date was changed two times which wasn't possible for me. I called Eurowings to say I needed a cancellation and refund because I could not make the new date. The guy I spoke to cancelled the flight and said I would receive a full refund within 10 days. 1 month later, I still don't have a refund. I have tried calling several times and either people say they can't help or they hang up (very professional) or they put me through to another number that doesn't pick up.

### "didn't allow me to board"
Edinburgh to Rome via Dusseldorf. They should be ashamed! On 20th March they didn't allow me to board by giving me futile explanations. I had to spend a night in Dusseldorf but they said that I was not allowed because I was not a resident of Germany. This was never been confirmed by an authority. I have been trying to contact them by phone or email for a month to get at least a refund, but they don't consider me at all.

### "They asked me to rebook my flight"
Hamburg to Prague booked for April 2020. Their customer services can only say " Mam, I can't cancel your flight", when I say that you're rude, I want to talk to your manager, she hangs up on me. They asked me to rebook my flight.

### "denied for being 4 minutes late"
Berlin to Dusseldorf. Today I arrived 36 min before departure time at check-in gates in Berlin. I was in an eerie empty checkin hall with dozens of staff having nothing to do. Nevertheless check-in was denied and guaranteed rebooking was denied for being 4 minutes late a the checkin counter. Cost for new ticket: 160 Euro. Instead of being polite to the few passengers left, there seems to be a policy In place to apply an extra portion of rigidity. Sine majority of staff have absolutely nothing to do there is simply no business justification for this attitude Eurowings - Never Again!

### "not as good as outbound leg"
This was my return leg to Nuremberg from Zurich via Hamburg. My experience was not nearly as good as the outbound leg. The flight from Hamburg to Nuremberg was delayed twice for a total of one hour and thirty minutes with absolutely no explanation. If a flight is delayed, you should (at the very least) let your passengers know why. I’m lucky that I didn’t have to make any further connections. After reading more reviews about this airline I also feel lucky that my bags were not lost or misplaced, so that’s a plus.

### "not a bad experience"
Nuremburg to Zurich via Hamburg. Overall not a bad experience. The lady at the check-in counter was courteous, as were the gate attendants. I had to pay for my checked bag but that’s to be expected with a low-cost airline. Boarding at Nuremburg was delayed 10 minutes but it was not an issue. My seat, 11A, had extra legroom which was very nice. The flight attendants were polite and courteous as well. Food and beverages were not complimentary and had to be purchased as well, but again that’s expected. The flights were smooth and my luggage made it to Zurich without any issues. The cabin WiFi ‘Wings Connect’ was not very good so I was better off using cellular data to browse. Overall, comforts are basic but I have no big complaints.

### "staff are a credit to the airline"
Not Verified |  Dusseldorf to Manchester. I had a nightmare of a week with flying due to Storm Dennis and delayed flights etc. I also had a nightmare trying to get my return flight with EuroWings and missed my flight (the only flight that was on time that week). I was very upset and stressed but I just wanted to say that your staff could not do enough to calm the situation, take control and give me the support and kindness to organise another flight. The staff are a credit to the airline and I would like to thank them all. On a separate note a very young lady at security check area was also kind and thoughtful. In a recent quote 'if you can be anything in the world, be kind' Your staff personified that. Thank you.

### "they charged 30 euros"
On my return flight from Dusseldorf to Athens, Eurowings charged me 30 euros for the same, exactly the same, luggage that I took for free on my outbound flight from Athens to Dusseldorf. Even though we were 2 passengers with 1 piece of luggage 55x40x25 they charged 30 euros.

### "Little value for money"
Stuttgart to Hannover with Eurowings. Low cost carrier without low costs. Little value for money, often they fly now with planes from Czech Airlines and their crew to push down costs. No service at all, very bad information if flight is delayed.

### "facing ongoing delays"
Berlin to Salzburg. It doesn’t get any better - being a frequent flyer, almost every week, facing ongoing delays, more and more cabin luggage restrictions, besides an extremely and overwhelmed ground crew. If you complain they give you a small info sheet and say in a sarcastic tone: "here you can complain- good luck with that" I can’t stand it any longer! Lufthansa becomes more and more board members and the service for the customer becomes worse and worse. The only positive thing I can say is that the flight crew is always very friendly and professional. I don’t know how easyJet is doing it (always on time so far, better service and price) - the Lufthansa Shareholders should consider a change in top management and a new start - otherwise RIP Eurowings/Lufthansa.

### "we were upgraded without charge"
Cheap option, even when booked shortly before travel. Both flights left on time. On the inbound flight we had to drop off our hand luggage since the plane was full, but in Dusseldorf it was on the belt before we arrived, so that was no trouble at all. To my suprise we were upgraded without charge to an extra legroom seat, which was nice. So it was the usual Eurowings-efficiency, that is: if there is not a strike. Just before our flight to Berlin there was a three day strike. Strikes occur on regular base, if not the cabin crew it might be ground crew or airport staff, so that might be a consideration not to book Eurowings.

### "Staff were welcoming and courteous"
London Heathrow to Sarajevo via Cologne with Eurowings. I was apprehensive about catching a connecting flight from Heathrow, but there were no problems. Check in was done with transfer tag and a smile at the start and the bags arrived fine both ways. All four flights were on time. Staff were welcoming and courteous throughout too. The seats on board were more comfortable than Ryanair, Wizz or Easyjet. The on board menu was acceptable although no hot food options are available, but on the positive side their cold drinks genuinely are served chilled too which is great. Price wise the flights were a bargain. Seat selection online can be chosen for free (from London at least) 72 hours before. Overall significantly better ‘low cost’ travelling than I’ve found elsewhere.

### "don't get all the hate"
Not Verified | Newark to Palma via Düsseldorf. I have flown Eurowings many times and I honestly don't get all the hate they get from others. It's a low-cost airline that gets you from A to B and charges you for almost everything as many other low costs do. It is not the cheapest option out there but it does give good flying hours. I've been delayed with them a few times but they always sent emails giving information even if the delay was 10minutes. On the flight from Newark to Düsseldorf, the flight was late out due to ATC capacity which is a normal issue. The service was standard, we had to pay for meals and drinks which we knew about since it is shown in your booking that they are not included. The seats were also pretty comfortable and the cabin crew were nice. On the short haul flight to Palma also the same. I have no complaints against them and I do think they are trying hard to be better but some passengers just like to rate them 1/10 because they didn't get a free drink or thet had to pay for seat reservation. Welcome to 2020 aviation guys.

### "absolutely cannot complain about Eurowings"
Dusseldorf to Munich. Priority boarding on this flight was quite a good choice, no problem with hand luggage. Very nice and helpful ground staff. I had the impression that the flight attendants were already a little tired, and not that motivated anymore at that time - but they did their job. No drinks/food included in my ticket (“basic tariff”). Flight was short and smooth, also landed a little ahead schedule which was great. I absolutely cannot complain about Eurowings, as in many other reviews here - I guess the problem sometimes is not the airline (any airline) but the passenger himself.

### "not worth flying Eurowings"
Hamburg to London. Avoid this budget airline at all cost! This is our second time we flew it and both times we ran into great problems with them. The first time the flight was delayed by 8 hours and the ground crew did not provide any information or help at all, causing great stress for all passengers and mishandling the situation in many ways. The second time they did not want to check our luggage through to our end destination claiming they had no agreement with the second airline, United, through which the ticket was booked. Tat information is false, they have an agreement and in the end, after 40 minutes of hard work and phone calls on our end, they were able to check it through. They made absolutely no effort on their end to solve the situation. Their ground staff is very poorly trained and has a really bad attitude. You get what you pay for after all and avoid loosing valuable time and comfort. You might think you are saving money, but after adding all additional costs for luggage fees, seat fees, drinks, food, headphones and the stress of uninformed, poorly trained personal as well as maintenance issues and delays, it is clearly not worth flying Eurowings.

### "they just want you to pay"
Munich to Catania. They took my luggage because I had a little bag and they told me it couldn’t fit under my sit so I have to pay for that. On board surprise the sit are big enough for 3 pieces of my little bag. So they just want you to pay. The ground crew was  rude.

### "A dreadful experience"
Munich to Bangkok. The flight started off on the wrong foot. I asked the attendant for a blanket. Her answer "that costs 6 Euro". I looked for the earphones for the entertainment system. Everyone was offered earphones for  3.50 Euro. After about 1.5 hours the meal arrived, I found it disgusting. A limit of 2 non alcoholic drinks for an 11 hour flight. The stewardesses were polite, but disappeared after the food for the next 7 hours. A dreadful experience. I booked this flight via Swiss, normally a good company. If I had read the very fine print I would have seen that it was not a Swiss flight at all.

### Eurowings customer review
Munich to Bangkok. Eurowings is a terrible airline, seats very old, earplugs not for free, no hot breakfast on board, customer service zero. I had to ask a few times to get water but never got it. I asked for a blanket for my 4 year old, answer was use your coat. Instead of a hot meal in the morning I got a cheese sandwich. I dont believe I went through all this disgusting experience.

### "lost my luggage"
Agadir to London via Dusseldorf. Worst airline. They ran out of food and lost my luggage and have not found it. The service staff was one of the worst I have ever experienced and the flight was =delayed.

### "couldn't prove the ETA approval"
I was supposed to fly from Dusseldorf to London with Eurowings and from there to Vancouver with Air Canada. Well the check -in people insisted I needed to show them the a proof of ETA to flight to Canada though they are only flying me to London so they wouldnt be able to do check my luggage to Canada. The official Canadian immigration page states that you dont need to show proof of it because it is in the system. I showed them that I have applied and paid for it, showed them I came from Canada not long ago, that the passport was actually issued/renewed there that I have been traveling to Canada constantly, that have family there but couldn't prove the ETA approval. So at the end just checked to London but the delay arguing at check in was such that couldn't catch the flight only by a minute. So couldn't flight that day to London, my son had to travel back to Dusseldorf then again on Sunday because had to change the trip to that day with a fee of CAD$500 plus traveling to Dusseldorf to only find the same situation the people at the counter this time were even more inflexible again when they dont even fly to Canada at the end just left on time for London once there no problem at all to board the flight or enter Canada. Thanks Eurowings neither me or my family will use your service anymore!

### "barely any space"
Koln to London. Not only is there barely any space on their flight, Once they cancel your flight, or delay it by 2-3 hours minimum You have to spend money on transport and food till the flight the next day. They should compensate you, but they say it happened to unforeseen circumstances. Their customer service doesn't care, nor do they have any real active agents just avoid this line.

### "the flight is cancelled"
Not Verified |  Berlin to Dusseldorf. My flight was supposed to be at 9:20 pm, in front of the gate at 9:00 pm the air hostess announced that the crew didn't come yet from hamburg and the flight is cancelled. Eurowings offered all passengers a hotel and an alternative flight next day (in a very non organized way). After returning to Berlin I sent a claim online for my compensation (250 euros) because of the 1 day delay, they replied with mails saying that the flight was cancelled due to extra ordinary circumstances ! I applied my claim online in an alternative dispute resolution website, and after almost 2 weeks eurowings paid me the compensation!

### "greatly reduced their service"
Munich to London via Düsseldorf. They have greatly reduced their service since they started. I have a Lufthansa status and bought the SMART tarif so I could access the lounge but now in Munich, Eurowings leaves from Terminal 1 and only provides a waiting area where the only thing free is the water. Although in other airports, you would get access to the LH lounge, they have decided to cut all services in Munich and try to make money on your back instead. On top of that, we got onto the plane and something is falling apart. All the stewardess did was take the piece and put it in the front pocket. Really bad service and poor quality!

### "Do not recommend"
London to Cologne. I booked with Eurowings for a Christmas present to go to the markets in December as they had times that suited us at our preferred airport in Stansted. We booked car parking and hotel and then the company change the flight to Heathrow this December. The change is ok but in their email they said to tell them of financial loss. I did and they refuse to refund the money for hotel and car park because of their airport change. Poor service. Do not recommend. If anything changes you're on your own.

### "completely untrustworthy"
Not Verified | Berlin to London. The airline is completely untrustworthy. Both legs of a round trip ticket from London to Berlin were changed and lengthened so that I couldn’t make connecting flights. No reason was given. My direct flights became 6-hour endurance tests without notice. How can you book a ticket if they can change departure times, connecting cities and arrival times without notice? Catastrophic. Needed to buy last minute emergency ticket just to make a connecting flight on another airline. All money lost.

### "meals had to be purchased"
Newark to Nuremberg via Dusseldorf. Never heard of an international flight that didn't serve a free meal. I saw nothing that meals had to be purchased in advance when we booked our flights. Water was all we were served free. Will never fly with them again.

### "My lawyer sent them a letter"
Vienna to Nürnberg. They cancelled the flight and of course I needed a new one. It took 45 minutes to reach them on the phone. When I finally had an agent on the phone, they refused to rebook me on any other airline except Eurowings, which meant that I´d have to wait until the evening to reach my destination. After I demanded  compensation of 250EUR they send me an e-mail, talking about extraordinary circumstances which was a lie. My lawyer sent them a letter and then they paid the compensation. Worst airline in Europe. Tickets overpriced for worse than non-existing service!

### "extremely low budget in behaviour"
Just 12 hours before takeoff Eurowings contacted me and sent a short message that they cancelled the flight from Duesseldorf to Bangkok on October 26th. No reason whatsoever was given. Maybe because Eurowings will stop future flights to Bangkok from Dusseldorf airport (My flight was the last one) they already decided to do earlier. Although they offered a refund which I had to choose I don't feel confident. Germanwings only offers to refund the ticket (paid by credit card). Trying to call them seemed impossible. Offers to rebook were all stopped by a red sign on their website. Of course they had no other flights because this one would be the last. People beware they are the worst airline ever. Do not fly with them unless you want to take the risk. Also they are not really low budget in price but extremely low budget in behaviour.

### "no service anymore"
Stuttgart to Berlin. There is no service anymore in the standard tariff not even water. And they talk about priority boarding, when everyone basically has priority. I avoid LH Group whenever I can on short- haul.

### "after 9 days I got my luggage"
Dusseldorf to Bologna. When we arrived in Bologna my luggage wasn't there. A PIR-rapport was filed and after 9 days I got my luggage in Italy. On August 4 I send a claim by email to Eurowings, but still no answer!! After almost 3 months I still have no compensation!

### "not compensating for the hotel"
My flight from Hamburg to Vienna had a delay, so the plane arrived too late for my connecting flight and  I missed it. They rebooked me but told me to book my own accomodation. Now they are not compensating for the hotel or the compensation according to EU-Regulation 261/2004. They telling it were the "extraordinary circumstances", which is a lie. The ticket was very expensive in their wannabe BIZclass which is ridiculous: there was no selection of sandwiches. I got offered some crackers and orange juice.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified | Milan to Dusseldorf. The airline was oversubscribed. Appalling service. Moreover, they took our luggage at check in but since it was overbooked, they gave it back to us, but this time with damamges all over our luggages. Lastly, their call centre number printed on their leaflet does not even work! Worst airline ever.

### "high risk of substandard service"
Flight cancelled with less than 1 hour’s notice from Munich to Düsseldorf where I had a connecting flight to Edinburgh. No reason for cancellation given. No assistance from Eurowings to get home, just left to get on with it. Eurowings charged over £600 for these short haul flights. Managed to get booked onto a late night easyJet flight home which cost a further £190 with a 10 hour wait. Despite the appalling service, inconvenience caused and significant cost incurred, this company continues to frustrate and inconvenience me. Trying to get compensation and refund on the cancelled flights is proving difficult. On the 3 occasions I’ve actually managed to get through on the phone, waiting up to a hour at a time, I’ve been met with a total lack of willingness to help, one customer service adviser was in fact rude and antagonistic. I’ve politely requested updates by email but I’m getting no response. I understand flights occasionally need to be cancelled and I accept that. What I can’t accept is the poor customer service thereafter. Eurowings had a chance here to make a bad situation better but instead they’ve chosen to make a bad situation even worse. I’ll pursue them until the matter has been resolved, if this means alternative dispute resolution or legal action then so be it. To be avoided, high risk of substandard service, frustration, inconvenience and financial loss...never again!

### "on hold for 1 hour each time"
Dusseldorf to Munich booked for November 2019. Have tried for three days to get someone on the phone and I've been on hold for 1 hour each time. Never reached anyone. I sent an email and never got an answer.

### "lack of urgency and communication"
Munich to Mykonos. This is regarding lost luggage but the review is about the customer service and lack of urgency and communication from EuroWings. We never received our luggage during our honeymoon and were assured the wrong would be made right. It has been more than 3 months and countless emails and calls to customer service, with no response, no apology, no compassion. I can’t see how I could ever trust this airline again. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and spent a good percentage of every single day either emailing or calling EuroWings and United Airlines searching for any information on our baggage, or searching for undergarments, toiletries, medication, or clothing in each of our destinations just to keep us going each day, all without any estimation of how long we'd be without our belongings. These activities spanned our entire 16 day vacation and now we're home having to do more work in order to claim what we've lost and the money we've spent. (Claim has been sent separately by email. This is a review about the customer service quality we received.) Many times throughout our 16-day journey a various agent from EuroWings Baggage Competence center would ensure me we'd have our luggage soon "within one to two days perhaps", and still, this dragged on from the very beginning. You can imagine how lost and scared we might have felt, hopeful to see our bags within a day or two, only to be disappointed yet again that they were not even located for periods of time. It felt like no one was helping proactively. Every time I called, I'd have to relive and re-recite the details to the next agent. Many mistakes were made along the way, not necessarily by EW but by all parties involved. I hope we can all learn from this situation but my husband and I should never have been punished for others' mishaps. Our honeymoon should have been the happiest time of our lives but unfortunately we returned home emotional, tired, stressing over finances and feeling defeated. We lost so much time on our very special and expensive trip, and we'll never be able to get that time back. It's heartbreaking if I'm being honest. It just does not feel fair.

### "Impossible to change or cancel"
Not Verified |  London to Vienna. Flight delayed so I would have missed my connection. Impossible to change or cancel flight. I spent over one hour waiting on telephone before I hung up in disgust. No service desk at Heathrow and no one could help. This is shocking service.

### "our first flight was cancelled"
Munich to Manchester via Düsseldorf. Very basic flights to Munich on the outgoing leg. Extremely cramped seats. Drinks less than average and very expensive. Staff unfriendly. On the return we waited for 2 hours at the gate with repeated delays only to be told our first flight was cancelled. Surely they knew earlier? And we could have got an earlier replacement flight then? But no.

### "We will never use them again"
Horrible experience! Düsseldorf to Las Vegas Sept. 27th We will never fly with Eurowings again. I’m not sure if the worst part was the rudeness, laziness, incompetence, or lack of professionalism. It started with a circus of a boarding procedure. They allowed everyone to just pile in from multiple lines instead of boarding the groups in order. Once onboard and underway the attendants started giving out the dinner meals. They skipped us and when I asked why we didn’t get food they said our tickets didn’t come with a meal and that we would have to purchase food from their catalog instead. It was embarrassing as hell as everyone else around us was fed. There was never an option when purchasing our tickets to get a meal. Our tickets were not discount tickets either, and I would also like to add that this is close to a 12 hour flight. We ordered food from the catalog at their inflated prices. When we tried paid for it they were unhappy with the 50 Euro bill I had and wanted a smaller bill. About two hours after this we pressed the flight attendant button to get something to drink, because they had not been coming around. When the flight attendant came by we ordered, to which she responded in a voice louder than necessary, that we needed to get up, go to the back of the plane, and get it ourselves. Then she told us not to press the service button for anything other than an emergency. We actually would have rather got our stuff ourselves because of the laziness of the crew but we couldn’t because they were letting a bunch of drunk guys hang out in the back and in the areas with the bathrooms, which became a huge problem every time you had to go use the facilities. I could say more but I’ll leave it at this. We will never use them again.

### "worst experience"
Dusseldorf to Las Vegas. One of my worst experiences with an airline ever. I will never fly EuroWings again! I'm traveling several times per year as a business class passenger with multiple airlines mainly between the US and Europe. When boarding my flight in Dusseldorf as a business class passenger to Las Vegas I was directed in an incredibly harsh way to turn in my small handbag and to pay 35 Euros to get it checked in as normal baggage. The bag was ripped away from me so that I did not even have a chance to grab my medication, my notebook or sweatshirt which are all essential accessories during my regular flights. Because of the rude treatment other passengers looked at me probably thinking I was a criminal trying to illegally enter the plane. I was so much in shock about the embarrassment of the situation that I found myself almost paralyzed and unable to protest. Looking back I should have refused to comply with their senseless request and insisted to speak with a customer service manager. In 10 years of flying business or premium economy class that same small handbag has never been rejected as it easily fits into the above-seat compartments of any airplane in any position. To make the situation completely grotesque I found out that not even 20% of the available space in the cabin was actually occupied, some of the compartments completely empty! As a business class passenger paying the multiple amount for an airplane ticket I obviously expect some leniency regarding the size of my carry-on especially if it's acceptable to any other airline in the world. After my return, I complained about my treatment trough email with the customer service department of EuroWings and their response was even more shocking than my boarding experience. I'm happy to share this unbelievable communication thread with anybody who is interested to see it. It is just incomprehensible how this airline treats its clients and I am sure that EuroWings will follow soon into the steps of all these other low-cost carriers filing bankruptcy right now because of their complete lack of understanding of the minimum rules of customer service.

### "Very nice experience"
New York to Dusseldorf. Very nice experience in business class. They use old Lufthansa planes which are retrofitted and don't look old. The seat is the same as Lufthansa business seat but it is OK for a low budget airline. It is fully lie-flat and there is ample legroom There was no one seated next to me so it was very comfortable and I could use the seat next to me for storage. There was a nice amenity kit with some good items in it which I still use. Service was very efficient and with a smile. Food was also delicious, the portions were large and everything was very tasty. I would definitely use Eurowings for business class long-haul again.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Cancun via Dussuldorf. I can't believe such a bad service can actually exist and sells. I bought my flight VIE-CUN via DUS for 1176 incl. 2 main bags. Beside some of the tightest space on the long flight, I was shocked when the airline wanted me to pay for entertainment system for the worst selection of movies I have seen on board. It was cold in the plane, hence I asked for blanket. That is for 6 EUR! I was told. Very unfriendly staff, highest price, no food on board, insufficient space, extra fees for all features that should be included for such an enormous price. The worst airline ever, with a big margin! I will avoid travelling with Eurowings.

### "I am so disappointed"
Stuttgart to Hamburg with Eurowings. What a disaster! This company does not care at all about its passengers. They scrutinised every luggage that would exceed the maximum size allowed to get an extra 30€! No drink! Really expensive! I am so disappointed.

### "All in all nice flight"
Düsseldorf to Munich. All in all nice flight, but IFE costs and Crew seemed new and not so professional. No meals served but for 25€ oneway you cannot expect anything else. Seat was very nice.

### "Latecomers rewarded"
Not Verified |  Hamburg to Milan. Latecomers rewarded. I arrived early at the departing gate so as to carry my little trolley on board. Eurowings staff labelled about 30 trolleys starting for the first people arrived, to ship them as registered luggage. All the people, flying my same basic fare, at the end of the queue were able to carry their trolleys on board! Never experienced something like this on any low cost airline. Colleecting the luggage in Milan Malpensa was fairly quick, but nonetheless I wonder why passengers who show up early must be penalized.

### "would rather pay extra for a better airline"
Not Verified |  Eurowings lost our luggage twice! There and back. It took three days to get our luggage in Stuttgart. We had only one pair of clothes in our carry on. We also had to borrow a comb and pay extra for a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a razor at the hotel. Keep in mind most stores were closed on Sundays and most closed at 8pm during the week. We had to buy shampoo at the Aldis by our hotel and sleep naked. We also had to wash our clothes in the sink with shampoo. Then on our way home the check in was horrible. There was no signs on where to go and the employees were no help. We asked them where to go but they told us wrong. Eurowings airplanes must be old because when we were taking off the lights flickered and there was rattling. Their seats are pretty uncomfortable and there was no headrest. Then at the Berlin airport we had to walk to a different terminal and wait in line for about 45 minutes for passport check. Then when we arrived in the terminal it looked like a third world country. Like an air force base in Afghanistan. Then the boarding line for the flight to Toronto was chaos. Nobody knew where to go and you couldn’t hear the workers over the speaker. Then when we landed in Toronto at the baggage claim we waited for about 30 minutes trying to find our luggage. How can one airline lose our bags twice in one week? We then had to wait in the lost baggage line for 50 ish minutes because there was only two employees. We then got our luggage about three days after we got home. I wouldn’t ever fly Eurowings again. I would rather pay extra for a better airline than losing my luggage and not being able to enjoy my vacation.

### "a bottle of water of 3 eur."
London to Athens via Dusseldorf. Generally the staff was helpful, no significant delays (just 10-25 min, which is not bad). However, I asked for a glass of water and the stewardess told me that I should buy a bottle of water of 3 eur. I can imagine this is because the airline is a low-cost one. You can expect that even a machine wont work in this way. Another thing is that the comfort of the seat is not that spacious. Still having that into consideration that it is a low-cost airline.

### "made a deliberate decision to leave behind the luggage"
The airline made a deliberate decision to leave behind the luggage of all ten passengers who were transferring from an earlier Eurowings flight rather than run a bit late - this despite that they had no further flight that could bring in the left-behind luggage for nearly two days.

### "luggage delivered 4 days after"
Munich to Manchester via Dusseldorf. Even though we weren't warned to buy the priority in order to have the permission to take hand luggage with us, during our flight to go back to Manchester (and not for our flight to go to Munich) we were asked to check our luggage in. As we were stopping to Dusseldorf, we asked for the luggage to arrive straight to Manchester. Once we arrived at our final destination we found out that our luggage had never left Munich. The luggage was delivered 4 days after at the address we gave. Don't waste your money on this company.

### "I am now without my luggage"
New York to London via Dusseldorf. This has to be the absolute worst airline. They charged me $69 for a checked bag that other airlines have considered a carry-on sized bag. My flight to Dusseldorf was delayed by an hour due to inclement weather which was understandable as I didn't mind since I had a 4 hour layover in Dusseldorf. My issue with this airline is that they changed the gate number twice and did not update their digital boards in the airport to alert passengers that the gate had changed. I was only receiving updates via email which I was not getting due to poor internet service in the Dusseldorf airport. They called my name for the flight at the same time they closed the flight. I was originally at the initial gate assigned an hour before my flight and the digital board at the gate was never updated to say that the gate had changed due to this I missed my connecting flight to London since the gates were so far apart and had another passpoint checkpoint. They communicated to me that I would need to check the carousel for my checked luggage that was taken off the plane. I checked three times and there was no luggage. I spoke to a lost and found representative who told me that my luggage was still on the plane and headed to London and not to worry my luggage would be at Heathrow Airport upon my arrival. I got to Heathrow to find that my luggage was not in London and a representative said the contact at the lost and found in Germany only told me that so I wouldn't be a nuisance customer. Due to their non-communication of gate updates I am now without my luggage during a major holiday event for the last two days. Just a reminder to myself that discount does not always mean cheap. This has cost me more headache than anything and I would have spent more money to be on a top airline to now have my luggage so I can fully enjoy my vacation.

### "my bag got lost"
The flight to Budapest was relatively ok, only a 45 minutes delay and the flight itself was ok, minimum but ok. The flight back however, was horrible. We had a delay of multiple hours while we were in the airplane, and only received one glass of water. Still, delays happen and that is understandable. The problem was that my bag got lost during the delayed flight back to Düsseldorf. First they said it would be delivered between 2 to 3 working days, but I did not receive or heard anything after 4 working days. I called them and after 80 minutes of waiting on the phone, someone told me that they would look in to it. When I did not hear from them again, I tried calling them. However, I waited for more than 2 hours on the phone but did not hear anything. A recording told me it would take approximately 5 minutes. Now I cannot get in contact with them whats however, and I did not get my bag back. If you value your belongings and punctuality, never fly with Eurowings.

### "My bag was lost"
Ibiza to Cologne via Berlin. My bag was lost on a Eurowings flight on June 5th, 2019. I reported it missing immediately upon landing in Berlin. I have been emailing and calling the airline endlessly since this happened but have now given up almost all hope they will ever find it. It was a brand new Rimowa suitcase with important belongings inside. My question is what most likely happened to it? Did the bag get stolen by a bag handler, is it still floating around somewhere in Ibiza or Cologne (where we had a layover) because the bag tag got ripped off/damaged and can't make its way back to me in Berlin? Or is it mysteriously lost forever and if so how?

### "am still struggling to get compensation"
Vienna to Bodrum via Hamburg. Avoid Eurowings, unless the price is extremely attractive. They have lost my luggage and could not relocate it in 9 days! They totally brushed me off with unanswered e-mails etc. and even after finding my luggage, they insisted not to deliver it to my temporary address during my vacation in a foreign country (as if it was my fault to lost my luggage!) in which I ended up driving 300 kms to the airport and picking it up by myself. The funny part is that my vacation was for 10 days and I could not use even a single piece in my luggage. I am still struggling to get compensation for the expenses I had to make during this horrible 9 days, which I am not very optimistic about it. This was my worst vacation experience ever.

### "obstinate and arrogant"
At first, the boarding was delayed by one hour because there were technical problems, as we went in there the air conditioners everywhere turned on full. The staff did not even greet us and when we asked her if she could switch off some of the climates, as we get a headache from it she said it would be too hot otherwise she does not want to do it. Even in retrospect, she showed obstinate and arrogant behavior.. Zuerst verspätete sich das Boarding um eine Stunde da es technisxhe Probleme gab, als wir dan einstiegen liefen die klima anlagen überall voll aufgedreht. Die Stuardese begrüsste uns nicht einmal und als wir nachfragten ob sie die Klimas zum teil ausschalten kann, da wir Kopfweh davon bekommen meinte sie es wäre ihr sonst zu heiss das möchte sie nicht machen. Auch im nachhinnein zeigte sie total eigensinniges und arrogantes Verhalten.

### "terrible experience"
Stansted to Cologne. Terrible experience. Flight was supposed to depart at 7:50 and it kept delaying - eventually departing 3 hours later. Boarding was a chaos and cabin crew had a very bad attitude, not even bothering to move when they where blocking the corridor or a seating area during the boarding process and rolling their eyes if someone dared to ask them a question. I missed some important business meetings in Cologne in the morning. The capitain announced that the delay was due to an aircraft replacement as the initially planned aircraft had technical issues. No wonder if they fly over 20 year old Germanwings A320s!

### "Really bad experience"
Horrible airline. My 1st flight to Cancún from Duseldorf was delayed by 5h for a technical problem. The exact same thing happened on my flight from Dusseldorf to Stockholm. On top of that, when having free available seats to sleep on a 10h flight. The staff didn't allow me to lay there and rest because they reserved them for themselves to do the same: lay on non-booked sits and nap. Really bad experience.

### "bag has still not been delivered"
London to Leipzig via Dusseldorf. Awful experience! Late, lost luggage, almost missed my connection. The first flight was about 20 minutes late, so I arrived 20 minutes before my connecting flight (both were with Eurowings). I had to run across the airport and get through passport control (thankfully the German people are very considerate and let me run to the front) and just made it in time to catch my connection. Then when arriving at my destination my check in bag didn't arrive (no doubt my bag missed the connection as I almost did). It apparently arrived later that evening and would be delivered. It's been 48 and hours and my bag has still not been delivered! To add insult to injury, when giving my address the clerk helping me completely got my address completely wrong which I checked online once I received a tracking number. Luckily I checked and gave them the correct address. Worst airline ever - will never fly with them again! Avoid if you can - especially if you are connecting. PS They also made most passengers check in their hand luggage as there was "no space on-board". I had checked in before they started this process luckily.

### "My bag did not arrive"
Cologne to Palma. I was asked to check in my bag because the flight was full. My bag did not arrive with the flight, along with the bags of half the other passengers on the flight. Because I was waiting for my bag, I missed my connecting flight to Barcelona. I had to reach for my sisters graduation so I bought a new flight for 115 Euros. The wait till the new flight gave me time to lodge a complaint for my missing luggage. 4 days later I got a phone call to confirm my address for delivery of my bag in Barcelona. I requested them to drop off the bag a day later as I was out of Barcelona on a road trip, to which they agreed. That night I got a call from a hotel in Barcelona saying my bag had been delivered to them by mistake. I called Eurowings and asked them to correct the error. The next evening when I called the hotel my bag was still at the hotel, so I went and collected my bag from there. Not only did Eurowings forget to carry my checked in bag on the same flight I was on, it cost me a new flight, 5 days without my bag and personal belongings, and then lost my bag once again!

### "Savings are going too far"
Düsseldorf to Hamburg with Eurowings. New rules mean not even a coffee on a morning business commuter flight. Paid over 400 Euro for a Dynamic flex Smart Fare. Getting prio boarding now, but so do most other people on this flight. So it's pointless. Savings are going too far, especially considering the high fare. A cup of coffee in the morning does not cost a lot and is a great gesture.

### "customer service doesn't exist"
Stansted to Sarajevo via Cologne Bonn. There was less than 90 minutes between arriving in Cologne and flying out again to Sarajevo. When I arrived, I realised that my bag had stayed behind in Cologne. I was advised by the ground staff - this is a very common occurrence - to keep receipts for any toiletries etc that I would have to buy. I expected the bag to arrive the following day, but it was over two days before it eventually turned up. I contacted Eurowings on my return, and attached receipts for everything I'd had to buy. There was an automatic reply, but they never followed up. It has now been nine months, and I still haven't heard anything from anyone, despite escalating the case. If you aren't flying direct, I'd think very carefully about flying with Eurowings. It was a small plane to Sarajevo, and if it's full, there isn't any room for additional luggage. Their customer service doesn't exist.

### "flight has been cancelled"
I booked a direct flight from Berlin to Zadar and suddenly I receive an email from Eurowings saying that my flight has been cancelled and the only option I have is to leave at 6 am, change in Düsseldorf and then take a flight to Split. Split? I am going on holiday in Zadar, this is ridiculous. I called the customer service and I received only standard fake answers so no help at all. I had asked for days off at work and now I have no other option as to go to Split and then take a 3-hour train to Zadar.

### "the worst experience ever"
Very simply the worst experience ever! Flight was cancelled, we were promised to get a rental car reimbursed if we were to travel ourselves to destination Amsterdam. Claiming these costs didn't only take 30 days, turns out they also dont reimburse the costs for the car, which they decided in the email they sent us. Also, they reimbursed the ticket costs which they reimbursed to the credit card of the booking company instead of to the account - as i had requested and where they were easily able to send the flight compensation. Trying to call the company I was on hold for 20 minutes, then they hung up. I was waiting on the line again for 10 minutes only then to get rudely told that that's the only way to do it (as if this was a law, its just what Eurowings decided). About the flight experience: cabin staff was uninterested, food selection was poor, no entertainment, seat space was limited. Just an overall terrible experience! Never will I fly with Eurowings again.

### "avoided like the plague"
Rome to Vienna, I need an option to mark a negative rating. Eurowings needs to be avoided like the plague. They first tried to charge me for the same flight for two consecutive days, for 6/30 and 7/1. I had to cancel 2 credit cards because of those charges I did not agree to. Expedia refunded my 7/1 fare. Got to the airport on 6/30, incompetent lady says my check-in is blocked. Lady spent over an hour on the phone. I missed the flight. Had to rebook with another airline for next day. Get an airport hotel. Person who answers Twitter DMs gave evasive answers about why it happened. What an embarrassment for German businesses.

### "not get anything free to drink or eat"
Berlin to Rijeka. They were delaying trip every hour for half an hour so we started 2 hours later. The cabin crew don't know to say hello. And we did not get anything free to drink or eat.

### "demanded that I pay the penalty"
Zurich to Dusseldorf. Staff demanded that I pay a penalty of 70 euros for my hand luggage. I received an email from Eurowings before the flight, claiming that hand luggage is allowed at no extra cost: "Dear passenger, your Eurowings flight is heavily booked today. To help us depart on time, please hand in your hand luggage at the check-in counter! This service is free of charge for you. Staff did not even allow me to throw my items away. Instead, he demanded that I pay the penalty. I am extremely disappointed.

### "Worst flying experience"
Munich to Berlin. Worst flying experience ever. Very unfriendly staff Flight was 1 hour late. When we landed we had to wait 72 minutes to leave the plane

### "staffed by humourless robots"
Punta Cana to London via Dusseldorf. Fell short of my expectations by a delayed departure of 2 hrs. The plane was clean, boarding efficient, and crew formal, unsmiling and completely without the usual, and nowadays expected, airline crew report. Dinner/Supper was served at about 2200 hrs as take-off was delayed. Having previously booked my choice of meal I was surprised to be told that “No I was having ordinary chicken”. It was served so hot you couldn’t eat it and tasted like nothing! To go with the meal I asked for a Bloody Mary which not only tasted of nothing but smelt rotten. There were none of the usual additional flavourings added, so I had to suffer a foul smelling tomato flavour-less concoction for €s. I later complained to a member of the crew, when service had calmed down, to be told he couldn’t smell anything rotten and that if I wanted another one I’d have to pay! I pressed further, telling him that it was very rare for me to complain but I clearly considered the Tomato juice to be bad. He looked at the bottle and said it was in-date and therefore acceptable. So an efficient airline well run but staffed by humourless robots!

### "Worst flying experience"
Berlin to Milan via Stuttgart. Worst flying experience. They cancelled the second leg of the flight with no reason while flying the first leg. No efforts to fly us to final destination on same day. They arranged accommodation in Stuttgart and rebooked us for the next day.

### "no airplanes until the next day"
I booked a ticket from Valencia to Berlin with Dusseldorf as a connecting airport. The flight in Dusseldorf was cancelled and the company said due to weather conditions although all other airlines was operating in a normal way. Then they said there is no airplanes until the next day, we waited at the reception in order to know what to do, the employees was impolite and they act with us in a very bad way. They started giving people hotel rooms to sleep, and then after 1 hour they said the working hours was finished and they are going home keeping too many people don't do what to do, even they start screaming at us and when we replied to them they called the police.

### "I missed my connecting flight"
London to Venice via Cologne. I had a stopover in Cologne and since I have Gold status with United, I was able to use the Lufthansa lounge. So far so good. I missed my connecting flight because the flight boarding status was never updated on the airport-wide flight information display system. I learned that it is the responsibility of a gate agent to update this system. To compound this mistake, my checked bag was not removed from the flight. Again, this is a mistake from a gate agent. I had to find last minute accommodation and buy a new ticket to my final destination. I filed a request to receive compensation using their website and the response I received is: "Unfortunately, we cannot offer you any payment because it was not our fault. The passenger is responsible for finding out the exact departure point of his or her aircraft. Essentially, they are saying that one should not trust the information on the airport displays.

### "3 flights were delayed"
Itinerary was London to Berlin via Dusseldorf, and Berlin back to London via Cologne. Out of 4 flights with Eurowings, 3 flights were delayed, the worst of which was 53 minutes. OK, not exactly the end of the world, however when I asked for a cup of water onboard the worst delayed flight I was told a cup of water was going to cost me 3 euros! Absolutely unacceptable, especially if you are delayed, and not provided with water.

### "Service on board was good"
Düsseldorf to Bologna. The flight and service was overall a plesant journey. However the aircraft is a bit dated a not up to date. Service on board was good, staff was very friendly. The legroom was great, however the seats looked old and used. Price was quite high due to an event on this weekend.

### "I lost 3 very important hours"
Athens to Stuttgart with Eurowings. Delayed 2.55 minutes. Just 5 minutes before 3 hours because if the delay was 3 hours they had to pay me. So they did it on purpose. They knew it was going to be delayed and did everything they could to arrive 5 minutes before I could claim for refund. I lost 3 very important hours. I was going to Stuttgart for a bussines event.

### "decided to change our flights"
Miami to London via Dusseldorf. They have the worst customer service. We were refused on the flight we booked online and had a full confirmation of. Eurowings decided to change our flights 3 months before without me receiving any notification. When we were at Dusseldorf the  agent started to blame Lufthansa (website we originally booked from) and then offered us 15 euros for 2 of us to have lunch. They may change all your bookings and not communicate with you and not = give you anything back.

### "passengers had to translate"
Not Verified |  Boarding was on time and efficient. The staff was pretty welcoming. The thing which surprised me was that none of them spoke German and also just very basic and broken English. Some passengers had to translate for example the safety instructions to other, mostly elderly, passengers because the didn’t understood it. Also, when it came to the meal service, they seemed really overwhelmed with finding the passengers who bought a meal for that flight and serving it. The cabin was a bit dirty but it was not bad. Overall, the flight was normal with an on-time arrival in Palma.

### "it wholly exceeded my expectations"
I flew from Heathrow to Cancun via Dusseldorf. It wasn't fancy - I flew 'Smartclass' and this includes hold baggage and hot and cold meal on the Dusseldorf-Cancun stretch, and a cold snack on the London-Dusseldorf stretch. I'm not going to pretend it's luxury, but it wholly exceeded my expectations. The food was fairly standard, the flights were pretty much on time, and the airline staff were nice. I didn't pay the additional £10 for full access to the screen, but I used the map feature which was excellent. I did see quite a lot of people who were surprised they didn't get food or a beverage included in their fare. I felt this was quite clearly stated when I purchased my ticket - unless you were mindlessly clicking through, then you couldn't have missed it. It doesn't cost much to add on if it's something you're bothered about and, even with this addition, it was still the fasted and cheapest London-Cancun journey by quite a way. I would definitely use Eurowings again, particularly for short stretches around Europe. It's definitely not luxury flying, but it is cheap and efficient. If you don't want to pay extra for food, it's easy enough to pack your own lunch, and if you don't want to pay for the films, they have USB sockets to charge your phones/tablets if you want to watch a film. My main issue with the entire thing was the weird German rye bread (it was disgusting) but that's a pretty small gripe to be honest. Overall, the negatives don't outweigh the positive - I had a good four flights with Eurowings and I would use them again. It's a good airline - if you have enough common sense to read the website when you're booking.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Poor customer service. Stockholm to Cologne/Dusseldorf. Last flight in January, several airports were affected by a strike. My flights were canceled. Contacted the customer service for rebooking and wanted to get on a flight from Dusseldorf instead. But they told it was not possible, they could only give me a new flight the next day from Cologne as my flights were booked from the same airport. Calling them again, I persisted that I would need a flight back on the same day, and I knew there were seats left on a flight from Dusseldorf. After a while, they told me I was lucky and I was rebooked on that flight from Dusseldorf. Find it very poor, that this help was given me only at a second call. Just booked a flight for the family in May. Unfortunately, we made a mistake when booking. We wanted to postpone the flight for all the 5 of us for 1 day. And only 2 days after we booked everything online. Living in Sweden, we had to call the customer service in Germany. For 5 persons, we would have to pay 700 € just for the rebooking. That was a crazy price, so I asked them, if they could just cancel the old flight, so I would be able to book a new flight. But nope. Contacted the customer service via email and received the same answer. Not even trying to find a solution for us. Following their rules, they have a not mandatory grace period of 24 h. 2 days was not in the frame, not even if we actually were willing to book a new and even more expensive flight. Sent them another complaint, which has not been answered since 1 week. I really do expect more of a good customer service. Will definitely check other airlines before using Eurowings next time.

### "Would never recommend"
Not Verified |  Berlin to Brussels. My family and I had a connecting flight from Berlin to Stuttgart, Germany. Our original flight got delayed an hour so we had to be moved us to an earlier flight to make our connecting one. Once we got to Brussels we couldn’t find our bags, we went to customer service and Eurowings had left a note saying “you’re luggage is still in Berlin. Sorry for the trouble”. At this point we were very mad because our medicine and toiletries were in our luggage. The next day we had to buy new clothes. They said they would send it to our Airbnb in Paris for when we get there but our train didn’t get in until 9 so it was arranged that they would wait til 9:30. As my mom was on the phone with them saying that we weren’t gonna be there til 9:30 the guy yelled at her and said “You were supposed to be here at 9. Get here or I’m leaving!” After that they got disconnected, and when my mom tried to call back they wouldn’t answer her calls. So obviously we ran to the Airbnb to get here at around 9:15-9:20 to see that he had left. They haven’t given any info to when they will supposedly bring our luggage to us, but we’re furious because we aren’t being compensated even though we have to buy new things again tomorrow. Would never recommend Eurowings!

### "Cabin crew fine and friendly"
Birmingham to Düsseldorf. Smooth airline. Took off on time and landed on time. No real issues of note, I would recommend flying them on short haul with Eurowings. Cabin crew fine and friendly.

### "no meal or baggage included"
Ft Myers to Vienna via Dusseldorf. Eurowings have terrible customer service, the lady I was on the phone with was rude and hung up on me. I was flying from Fort Myers to Vienna there was no meal or baggage included, they said I have to purchase the meal, so I was surprised. I paid $852 for the ticket through Expedia and nothing was included but bottle of water, no baggage no meal. I searched the rules and pages they sent me but I did not notice there is no meal included, I saw about the baggage that I have to pay for it.

### "Eurowings screams cheap"
Munich to Mauritius. I am a Canadian who was traveling from Toronto (YYZ) to Mauritius. I had a connecting flight from Air Canada to Eurowings in Munich, Germany (MUC). My 8 hour flight with Air Canada (Toronto to Munich) consisted of drinks, wine, snacks and 1 meal. Also a pillow and blanket were provided and tv, games etc. On my 11 hour flight from Munich to Mauritius the flight consisted nothing but a half a piece of bread with cheese and one "juice box" with only water inside. Everything else you had to pay extra. 8 Euros for a drink! Not to mention no blanket or pillow, no tv options. Everything you were required to pay extra. How can you put someone on a flight for so long and give them no food or drink whatsoever? Everything about Eurowings screams cheap including their uniforms and their bad service. This tells me they do not care about the comfort of their customers. I definitely do not recommend choosing to fly with Eurowings.

### "worst experience ever"
Stuttgart to Sarajevo. I had a flight scheduled March 19th at 17:05. P.M. Came to the airport in order to check-in where staff told me that flight time has changed: departure is moved 2 hours in advance so I missed the flight. I haven't received any kind of information about this change: nor email nor SMS. Personnel at the airport told me that they cannot do anything about it, that I should call Eurowing's support. I called and that call was an unpleasant experience as well: I was trying to check if Eurowings can do anything about my problem, but the guy on the other side of a line keep jumping in the middle of my sentence repeating that I cannot prove that Eurowings didn't send an email and that they cannot do anything about my problem. I asked if there is any way that I pay the new ticket and fill some form in order to complain and receive some kind of cost "recovery" but the guy just continue to repeat that Eurowings can't do anything for me. I had about 50 flights in the last several years and this is the worst experience ever! I can't believe that company move the flight and don't inform the customer about it. This was my first experience with Eurowings and will definitely be the last!

### "short but pleasant flight"
Nürnberg to Berlin. A very short but pleasant flight. The check-in at Nuremberg airport was fast and pleasant. The boarding was well organized and efficient. The flight started on time and arrived in Berlin 20 minutes earlier than planned. A very friendly and helpful cabin crew. I had heard a lot of negative about Eurowings before this flight and was therefore somewhat skeptical. But all the concerns I had were unfounded. For the Eurowings is a low-cost airline has made a very good job on this flight.

### "Luggage Allowance is great"
Vienna to Rome. Booked Smart Class. Luggage Allowance is great. Snack served tasted horrible. Seats in a land bus is better. Cabin crew not friendly but not bad either. Gates not displayed in the airport screen until 5 minutes prior to closing.

### "Eurowings never again"
My mom had to travel from Düsseldorf to New York I booked her round trip, After the booking I found out that with this company the luggage is extra. I get it its ur policy so I called in Germany to add luggage to her flight, Not third party i went on the website of Eurowings to get their contacts, now you people don't have office number or assistants in the USA so i had to call all the way in Germany to get information and add something to my flight, on the official website it said 0.60 euro sent per call. I Called and they ask me for extra money for the service they are providing which is to help me add luggage to my flight, again not a third party company it was their official contact form their official website so they ask me for 20euro for that, I  told them no its okay will do it my self online. When the day of the flight came my mom was asked if she is want to order something from the menu she said yes and then they ask her to pay it now she didn't had cash so she gave them only card she had master card and they didn't accepted it because they work only with visa card. Based on my mother and mine experience I cant really say this about Eurowings never again.

### "The cabin crew were pleasant"
Vienna to Barcelona. Seated in 12F, an Emergency door seat over the wing. The flight left on time, and arrived 10 minutes early. The cabin crew were pleasant. The coffee was 2.50 €. When budget airlines work, they are fine. At least for short distance. I notice Eurowings get some poor reviews, I assume all reviews are valid, and how an airline performs in a difficult situation says a good deal. But based on my first flight with them, I will use them again.

### "do not help the customers"
Cologne to Zurich. Rude and unsupportive crew. Just smiles and say good morning, do not help the customers. I will never book Eurowings flight again. Unprofessional crew.

### "was unimpressed"
London to Puerto Plata via Cologne. Used this airline for the 1st time, and was unimpressed. This so called German efficiency is not the case. Emailed the following issues to Eurowings, Booked to have food on the flight and informed it had been done. On flight no food. I found the service not rude but sharp, (not warm and friendly). They messed up a transaction with my card (dual currency card) I gave them, as it was not set up for contactless, but they swiped it without my authority, which then cancelled the card. I then had to find cash to pay for movie. On the return flight not much better, used my Barclaycard and again they swiped it without asking my permission. Paid for the movie, then the screen did not work, the tried to get it working but failed. They offered me drinks or food and I took a snickers bar as I am not a drinker. They also offered to move me to another seat with my wife (so that I could watch the movie) but I said this was impractical as it was 30 minutes into the flight. They said I would be refunded my money but 1 hour into the flight I requested my receipt I was informed they do not give receipts? I have requested my refund on 3 occasions on on writing this review have still not been refunded. Not impressed with the food at all especially their pumpernickel I think we had which tasted like cardboard. Please note the response to my issues raised were a bulk standard almost automated response.

### "crew were brilliant"
Vienna to Stansted via Cologne. I read many reviews of Eurowings on this website which filled me with dread when I knew I was flying with them for the first time. Could this airline be as bad as Ryanair? My experience was anything but, they were punctual, crew were brilliant, bags on the belt when we got through to reclaim. I would use Eurowings again.

### "have flight cancelled"
Vienna to Birmingham. After a 13 hour flight from Phuket we arrived into Vienna to a 2.5 hour delay. The airline gave us 5 euros each for refreshments which we all know doesn't go very far at airports. Gate information appeared on the screen so we went through security to then have flight cancelled come on screen. We were told to collect our luggage and go to terminal 1. We did just that and it was a nightmare, no one really cared and we were pushed from one person to another. We were found a flight via Munich 12 hours after our original flight and by the time we land in Birmingham it will be 16 hours late. We were given 20 euros each for food and drinks. We travel to the far east about 6 times a year and to be quite honest it will be worth the extra GBP 300 a ticket to fly with Qatar or emirates. Use at your peril if you want to waste a whole day stuck in the airport ,never again.

### "10 hours at the airport"
Bangkok to Milan via Dusseldorf. My flight supposed to be at 7.55am and the night before they sent me an email and they told me that my flight was cancelled and it would be at 2.10pm. they told me also to be there at 4am in the morning for the check in. Me and the other people spent more than 10 hours at the airport! And than on the flight they didn't accept my debit card and neither my travel card and my cash Australian and American dollars. I couldn't eat for the whole flight. And the hostess didn't care. I will not fly with this company anymore.

### "have to fight for everything"
Brussels to Stuttgart. No complaints at all. Polite crew and flight on time. Exactly what I expect from such a short flight. That said, this was the only positive experience I had with EW. Unfortunately our baggage didn't make it to Stuttgart. I then announced my baggage as lost at the Eurowings counter. This person however didn't feel responsible for customer service at all. He took the details of the baggage and then told me to call a number for further arrangements with Eurowings. Back in the Hotel, I called Eurowings. I was told that my suitcase hadn't been found yet and they'd notify me of status changes. of course I didn't have any clothes at all, so shopping for clothes was necessary. Asked them if there's a reimbursement policy in place. The person I talked with tried to avoid this topic. It seems there's a policy in place that staff should intentionally misinform customers so that no payments need to be made. Only after several intense demands from my side, they let me know there's indeed a policy in place and reimbursement would be made. The next morning, I received a happy email and was told my baggage got found. I then called Eurowings again. Said they'd deliver it in the next 5-7 business days! What is wrong with them? Again, it is all about saving money. Only after almost threatening them to seek legal help, they suddenly found a way to deliver it even on the same day. Next, I provided Eurowings my expenses via the email address they asked me to send it to. No single response after 1 week. Only after calling them one week later, they again  realized they had my email in their inbox. It took them 2 months to finally confirm they'd reimburse my expenses. I was told they would wire it to my bank account (details had been provided in my initial email so no excuses possible). Again Eurowings was unheard of for the next 4 weeks with no payment received. 2 days ago, I emailed them again and told them I would advance with legal help to get this resolved. Not even 12 hours later, I received the wire, that tells you a lot about this airline. Do not expect they would try to help you at all. You have to fight for everything and it even requires "threatening" in order to eventually get your compensation. All about saving money and trying to exhaust their customers, customers are completely irrelevant.

### "denied entry onto the flight"
Awful service. We were denied entry onto the flight despite being at the gate 20 minutes before take off. Denied entry despite having time to get seated and listen to the safety announcements. We were forced to buy new tickets.

### "2 hours on the tarmac"
Barcelona to Cologne. The flight stopped in Toulouse as a passenger was feeling bad. The paramedics were waiting for us but the passenger left the plane walking. So the paramedics asked question about our stopping. They left after 15 minutes but we stayed 2 hours on the tarmac for no reason before taking off to complete the journey. No power in the plane to charge phones. We arrived in cologne at 1AM and the airport was closed.

### "poor customer services"
London to Berlin. Chaotic boarding. Flight delayed. They lost my suitcase. It arrived a week later. When I approached them about the reimbursement for the clothes I had to buy, they agreed to cover the underwear. If I wanted to be reimbursed for a pair of trousers and a jumper, they demanded that I send the garments to them. Shocking. No sorry for inconveniencing you , accept our apologies. None of that. A very nonchalant attitude to clients for some reason. Quite unusual nowadays. Won't fly with them again due to poor customer services and grumpy flight attendants. Recommend? Never. Unless you enjoy rough treatment.

### "the journey was a disaster"
Very disappointing. I had a 13 hour flight (Bangkok - Dusseldorf) on Smart fare but the journey was a disaster. Little leg room, no blanket or pillow provided, entertainment is extra 10 euros. The staff even go around and sell earphones for 3 euros. They are German and it felt like they were bothered when they had to speak English. Never again!

### "never use their service again"
Dusseldorf to Paris. Me and my son checked online, and the boarding time was 3:10 pm, we entered at 3:00pm, and they didn’t let us aboard and we lost our money. The supervisor was very rude and make us goes here and there. We will never use their service again. It is really unfortunate how they treat customers.

### "lost my checked luggage"
I will never be flying with Eurowings again. No complaining of the 2 hour delay. No complaining about the uncomfortable seats. These things are imminent when choosing a discount airline. What I will not stand for is their completely unprofessional customer service. During my lay-over, the airline lost my checked luggage (even though both flights were on the same aircraft with the same cabin crew / pilots). I was left without clothes in a foreign county for several days. It was necessary for me to purchase the essentials: pants, shirts, underwear, etc. I was under the impression that the company would reimburse me - no. One month after my complaint, they have completely stopped responding to my emails despite my offering every document they initially requested. I wouldn't have the sour taste in my mouth if they simply told me that my request was denied. It's like children are running the company.

### "Very poor customer service"
Cologne to Stansted. Delayed in excess of 4 hours. No information given by staff at the time. Just kept us all there waiting. Complained when i eventually arrived home. I've been trying to speak to someone to deal with my case and even escalated to CEO but no response. 6 months on and still nothing. Absolutely disgusting. Very poor customer service with a complete disregard for their customers. I will never be flying with them again and nor will i ever give a good recommendation

### "Customer relations is abysmal"
Nuremburg to Hamburg. I am a frequent flyer in Germany and have a Senator status on Lufthsansa. Eurowings is part of that group, but it means nothing. They treat any flyer the same: horrible! My flight was scheduled for 20:55 and was cancelled 5 hours prior to departure. No notice of rebooking or anything like that. I called their call center agent and was told I could take a train and would get my ticket reimbursed. It was a lie because it never happened. I paid a train ticket myself as well as a hotel (there were no other flights after 20:55 to Hamburg) and didn´t get a penny as a compensation. Customer relations is abysmal and nonexistent on Eurowings! Unfortunately there is no alternative airline on that route. I cannot recommend them at all.

### "most incompetent airline"
Not Verified | London to Cologne. Eurowings are by far the most incompetent airline I have ever used. Unfortunately, they are one of the only airlines that fly from London to Cologne where my partner lives. 9 times out of 10 there are delays or even cancellations. The most frustrating thing is that you discover the delays whilst at the airport. They are a disgrace and I encourage people to spend more money and fly with another airline.

### "to congratulate the crew"
Not Verified |  I flew on 27th December 2018 from Mauritius to Munich on flight EW225. My father needed oxygen and assistance during the flight, I wanted to congratulate the crew of that flight. Especially the head hostess has managed to handle the situation impeccably. Thank you all. My father died, but he did not stop telling me how he was impressed by the kindness of the flight attendants. I wish everyone to meet that efficient staff.

### "Very frustrating service"
Bangkok to Stockholm via Dusseldorf. Cancelled our flight less than 24 hours before the flight schedule and no help whatsoever. No grounds personnel in sight. Had to make expensive international calls to their customer service only to be hung up on! There was an option in their website to reschedule but there were no flights available the next day onwards! On their facebook, they assured that they would compensate the affected passengers but after reading reviews now, I doubt it. I was only in transit in Bangkok and had nowhere to go. I could either wait for them to respond to me or book another flight at my own expense, so I did the latter. Glad I didn't wait because now it's been 2 weeks since I sent my refund request (not even asking for compensation for the more expensive on-the-spot ticket) but there's been no reply not even an autoresponse saying it's been received! They don't want to give money back for a flight they did not deliver. Very frustrating service and the travel agent did not help either. This experience ruined my Christmas holiday.

### "operated by Czech Airlines"
Eurowings booking from Budapest to London via Stuttgart, both flights operated by Czech Airlines. Both flights took off and arrived on time, cabin crew were kind, and I specifically liked that we could see where we were on the screens during the flight (this is not a thing for other airlines with A320s and the like). The only concern I have is that the aircraft on both occasions looked old and quite worn, so my feeling of safety was not 100%, and the seats weren't the most comfortable.

### "yet to offer any compensation"
Munich to Seattle via Cologne. On September 24, 2018, my flight back from Cologne was initially delayed approximately 10 hours, thenafter flying for 5 hours, we were told that due to the delay, the US borders were closed and would not allow us to land. We then had to fly for 5 more hours back to Cologne. No passengers were offered drinks, snacks, or a meal. That then totals to a 20.5 hour delay. After arriving back to Cologne, staff told us that the next flight out of Germany to Seattle would be from Frankfurt, which is a two hour train ride from Cologne. By the time I arrived in Frankfurt, the other flight had already taken off. I, and about 15 other passengers from the original flight, had spoken to the help desk of Lufthansa, the owner company of Eurowings, and they told us they cannot any help and told us to go back to the Cologne airport to speak to Eurowings. Out of the 15 passengers, only two spoke German, so it was very difficult to communicate and understand what was even happening/going on. I did not have international phone service and two of my children were in other countries, and another was back in America. My family did not know where I was because Eurowings refused to release any information about the original EW168 flight on September 24th. We then gathered as a group, after over 35 hours of no food or sleep, and had to make the best decision for ourselves to get back home to America. We then consulted with a different airline and only 11 seats were available, therefore, 4 people were left stranded in Frankfurt. Eurowings originally offered no financial support, although stated by EU Regulation 261/2004, passengers are entitled to up to €600 in compensation when their flight lands at their destination more than three hours late. It was over 48 hours until I was able to land back in America and Eurowings has had my bank statements ever since, and have yet to offer any compensation. It has now been over three months since this situation, and I have not received any financial compensation for my time. Not to mention, their customer service is only available over email and cannot be contacted over the phone.

### "very good Customer Service"
Berlin to Düsseldorf. Top service, I was too late because of traffic problems in Berlin. The airline booked ne in the next flight about an hour later for. I never expected this, very good Customer Service.

### "My flight was changed"
London to Vienna via Dusseldorf. My flight was changed because our time is not flexible and limited we need to rebooked a different airport different times. I need to rebooked my airport parking even more expensive. Coming back flight delayed and luggage delayed for 1 day. We have small kids even more difficult and. Not really a good experience. Customer service really poor no local contact number you need to pay extra for international call rate which will take you another 45 to 60 minutes before they answer your call. Never fly again with this airline.

### "charging for absolutely everything"
Dusseldorf to New York. Flew with AA miles via London to DUS. As AA makes it very difficult to use miles to get back to the US, I booked a cheap one way ticket with Eurowings. Didn't expect much and that was confirmed. Also, expected some charges. Website is a joke. It is not possible to check in via that site, find a reservation number or change details of a flight (Upgrade, luggage etc), Despite that it says that one can change especially the luggage situation and class of flight later/any time. So, I got charged Euro 10 more for luggage than it would have been if the website was functioning. Not going to bother to write them as I am sure that they will 99.99% never respond. Flight details: Seat were adequate, service was ok, but I opted to only ask for water, which was free. Bought a sandwich before boarding, good move. Plane temperature was on the cold side, but no blankets, unless bought. Personnel was friendly. Check in took long, not enough people and terminals to take care of flights leaving at the same time (Miami and NY JFK) Because it's a budget airline one lands at terminal 7 at JFK. The lines at immigration are super long and the Immigration personnel was giving conflicting directions for Green Card holders. Cheating myself out of waiting for 2 hours in line by ignoring them. All in fall I would not fly with them again, as they have taken no frills to new heights, charging for absolutely everything and in my case Euro 70 for an 11 kg handbag. Would have thrown it out, but stuff in there for my girlfriend in there. There are better budget airlines offering more for the same money. I would like to give it "zero" , but that is not fair to the personnel. Not their fault that this business model sucks!

### "is the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This airline is the worst airline I have ever experienced. I have had the privilege of being well travelled therefore many airlines but I will never ever fly with Eurowings again. Their customer service is diabolical. I have been charged £25 for trying to get information out of them. They refused me and my 23 year old friend of mine, put next flight was cancelled and we had no idea why we were refused on to the flight. Later on (7 hours after roaming around the airport to find out what was going on) the lady had told us there had been ‘a technical fault’. Our original flight plan was from Stansted to Munich, to Chicago but was changed so we flew from Stansted to Cologne, to Munich to Chicago. We were refused on the flight in Cologne and I believe the reason was because we were young and were bumped from the flight. My friend and I were in bits as this was a big trip for us and it started out awfully. We missed a whole day in Chicago where our friend was waiting for us on her own and missed the hotel we had prepaid for etc. Our flight from Cologne to Munich was cancelled and they’re now only trying to compensate €250, it was awful. They’re awful and I never write reviews. I would steer clear of this airline, only heard awful things since our experience and just wish we knew before travelling.

### "seats were relatively comfortable"
Dusseldorf to Dresden. The flight was very punctual. Boarding procedures were completed in a very professional matter. The crew was very friendly and forward. The on-board meals were very basic. It is a simple choice between a cake or a sandwich. The sandwich tasted very fresh and was tasty. Eurowings also offers 10 mins free on-board WiFi. The "extra leg room" was worth it - the seats were relatively comfortable.

### "wasn't as bad as I thought"
New York JFK to Geneva via Dusseldorf. I had very low expectations ahead of time, so the airline wasn't as bad as I thought. Seats were a little uncomfortable and stiff, but otherwise not awful for what I thought would be a half cost flight. I had no service at all - you even have to pay extra for coffee unless you have bought it in advance. But again, fine, I had planned for nothing after reading reviews. And again, it was a cheap flight. I was nervous about the plane being late with a connecting flight in Dusseldorf and bought travel insurance to cover any trip interruption through CSA. Be advised the scope of what they cover is very limited. The plane was on time but I missed my flight because I got tied up in security and then couldn't find the gate in Dusseldorf - the Eurowings gates are underground and a bit hard to find. Anyway, my problem, right? But if you miss your connection they don't re-book you on the next flight, you have to buy a whole new ticket, and the second one for my 1.5 hour flight from Dusseldorf to Geneva cost more than the whole trip. Then you have to haggle with your travel insurance to get your money back. The CSA travel insurance plan was useless. CSA might not cover you for a late plane unless it's one of their reasons listed like a mechanical breakdown or weather conditions. Before getting this insurance you should check to see if it will cover you if Eurowings just gets booted down the take-off line at the airport and your plane is late. So my low-cost flight ended up costing me what I could have spent on a nonstop flight with all the perks. I would take this airline again if I don't have any bags, very light carry on, and a nonstop trip with some time on the other end. (They only allow 8 kgs or 17 lbs so if you have any equipment books, etc, you will be overweight, they will make you check it and charge you.)

### Eurowings customer review
Dusseldorf to London. Just before boarding I got message that the flight are delayed for departure by an hour because they didnt realise that Dusseldorf airport are shut until 6am. Entered the aircraft and asked for a blanket which are a very usual things to provide but you have to buy one if u need one. Asked for a headset to watch a movie and it requires €9 for any sort of entertainment. 14 hours in that measurable airlines with food to purchase where I paid normal airline fare. When we landed in Dusseldorf the captain announced that it cant park as another aircraft has blocked his spot and they cant find a pushback truck. Utterly disgusted and surely I wont choose this airline again in my life.

### "downright bad in service"
Not Verified |  Dusseldorf to New York. Eurowings is downright bad in service. Ground staff is not well trained. The website can not be checked in. No two persons with the same initials can be registered via the website: this is blocked, even though it concerns different dates of birth. Then you have to pay 150 at the counter to correct their own mistake. Scandalous. Complaints are not responded to. Eurowings strategy: send a response email that it takes 6 weeks to get a response. I filed a complaint in July 2018, remembered in September, still no response in November 2018. The total lack of any service and the decency to respond to complaints at all. Eurowings: once but never again. Eurowings is ronduit slecht in service. Grondpersoneel is niet goed opgeleid. Via de website kan er niet ingecheckt worden. Er kunnen geen twee personen met dezelfde voorletters worden aangemeld via de website: dit wordt geblokkeerd, ondanks dat het om verschillende geboortedata gaat. Vervolgens moet je 150,-- aan de balie betalen om hun eigen fout recht te zetten. Schandalig. Op klachten wordt niet gereageerd. Strategie van Eurowings: stuur een reactiemail dat het 6 weken gaat duren om reactie te krijgen. Ik heb in juli 2018 klacht ingestuurd, in september herinnerd, in november 2018 nog steeds geen enkele reactie. Het totaal ontbreken van enige service en het fatsoen om überhaupt op klachten te reageren. Eurowings: eens maar nooit meer.

### "no responsibility and ownership"
London to Berlin. We flew from Calgary via Montreal and London on Air Canada. Then our last segment to Berlin was a code share with Euro/Germanwings to Berlin. Our luggage arrives 4 hours later on a different flight and the baggage handling people could not even tell me when the luggage would be delivered to our hotel after 3 days. Eurowings uses WISAG as their luggage handling company and there was no responsibility and ownership taken by either the airline or luggage company. I eventually told them to ship my luggage back to Calgary but they still took extra 5 days to get it back to us. It has been more than two weeks since I submitted the claim for compensation and you think they responded at all? No, not a single email or call. Never with this airline again.

### "avoid this airline"
Vienna to Hamburg. Another delay and the boarding gate is not capable of announcing delays and by saying that boarding starts a few minutes later instead of 45 min later. A lot of flights are not operated by Eurowings but by charter airlines under Eurowings flight number. Old planes are commonly used. I always try everything to avoid this airline. From my personal point of view, this venture has destroyed the Lufthansa brand.

### "unable to land their aircraft in fog"
Stansted to Cologne-Bonn. Loads of planes landing and taking off at Stansted in heavy fog. But apparently due to German crew flight classification they are unable to land their aircraft in fog and so diverted to Heathrow. Ridiculous scenario when the sky and apron and filled with Ryanair flights actually going somewhere in the fog. For once, I really wish I’d booked Ryanair. Rude customer service staff at gate who were dismissive, lacked and information or interest in providing some to passengers. Poor service.

### "Flight was very enjoyable"
Vienna to Hamburg. I booked the Basic fare, so no drinks or extras on my 1,5h flight to Hamburg, and that was totally fine. Booking and online checking on their website was easy. Flight was on time and very enjoyable. There was even more legroom (standard seats, not the extra legroom seat) than some premium carriers have.

### "never ever use them again"
London to Kos via Hamburg. We had a carry on case each and one hold case. When we arrived at Kos our hold case didn't come and it had been lost. All of my partners clothes were in there as well as all of my shoes, toiletries and hair straighteners and iPad. He had a suit in his carry on luggage as he was best man at a wedding in Kos, so everything else was in the hold luggage. We had to buy all new clothes for him, toiletries and shoes for both of us. It cost us a lot of money. We were told the case would turn up the day after we arrived, it didn't, I kept calling the airport and they were saying it was on it's way then it wasn't. We ended up getting it back the night before we went home, my hair straighteners and iPad were missing, and the case was damaged. I emailed Eurowings when we we got home (13th August we arrived home) I still haven't had a reply other than a confirmation that they received my email just after I sent it, I sent a follow up email a couple of weeks ago and still haven't heard anything. Awful company, our holiday was ruined and they haven't even got the decency to give an apology or offer any form of compensation. I will never ever use them again and I will be sure to tell everyone to avoid them.

### "the worst flight I ever had"
Bangkok to Munich. It was the worst flight I ever had, low cost airlines would seem as a luxury way of travel compared to Eurowings. Their website is hard to use, for the cheapest ticket price you don't get a meal (on 11 hours flight) and it wasn't obvious during the booking process, There are no legroom at all, I feel okay with RyanAir or AirAsia flights, but Eurowings seats are smaller, couldn't sit there (11 hour flight). Flight was delayed for ~3 hours, that made me miss my connecting flight. It took 2 more hours at Munich airport to get my answer: because delay was under 5 hours and my connecting flight was with another airline, Eurowings are not responsible for anything, I can go sleep somewhere in corner at the airport now. Some may say that price was cheap, but it's not true, a year ago I had a flight with Air France for the same amount of money, so it's not an excuse.

### "Avoid at all costs"
London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel. Booked a Eurowings flight through Lufthansa for what I hoped would be a quick and easy night flight from London to Berlin arriving at 10pm. After an absolute disaster of a journey we ended up at our hotel in Berlin at 6am the next morning without our luggage and poorer for the experience. Boarded the flight approx 30 min late and then advised that as there was thunderstorm activity in the London area and we had missed our departure slot that we would be significantly delayed. We ended up departing London 5 hours late after sitting at the gate for the entire time. To the captains credit he did keep us well informed and did advise us that due to a curfew at Tegel that the flight would be diverted to Schoenfeld airport. He also said that there would be a bus arranged to transport us back to Tegel airport. All of this so far is understandable, I work in the aviation industry and understand there is no way around these sort of delays and diversions. Our night was about to take a turn for the worse though and this is where Eurowings showed its true colours. Upon arrival at Schonelfeld (approx 3am) those with checked on luggage were waiting at the carousel for over an hour, slowly getting more tired and frustrated before an airport employee showed up and said there were no bags on the aircraft. They had left the luggage in London, all of it. After giving details of the lost baggage centre to everyone we asked where we could find the bus to our original destination, there was no bus. And due to the hour of the day (about 5am by this stage) we were forced to take a 50 euro cab to our hotel. The service of the complaints department has further lowered my opinion of Eurowings (if that was possible). Our luggage was tracked down about 5 days later but had a number of items missing. As of today I am yet to receive any compensation for the delayed and lost luggage (3 months later). I finally heard from the booking department about 2.5 months after this fiasco, first off they claimed that my episode was caused by a strike?! A complete lie, that they later redacted. I asked for a refund but really only wanted my 50 euro taxi fare refunded. They only offered a 50 euro Eurowings voucher, that I will never be able to use as I live in Australia, and of course I will never fly Eurowings again. Avoid at all costs.

### "became more and more upset"
Las Vegas to Cologne. I don't think it's possible for an airline to be worse. There are too many things to say, so in short: flight was cancelled, waited in airport a long time with no answers, finally taken to hotel and were told the hotel would inform us of our new flight (uh, nope), waited for 2 hours for their customer service to answer the phone and were told they were getting a plane for 2 days later (missing 2 days of our Europe trip was unacceptable and they still didn't have concrete information for us), then told us we could book a flight then be reimbursed... but told it had to be cheap and that 90% get their reimbursement. Purchased a flight for the next morning (nothing is cheap that short notice) and now we're waiting for $1400 each and the e-mail response says it can take 6-8 weeks for a reply. That's just this flight. If we had made it to Cologne (we surpassed it altogether), our next Eurowings flight would have been delayed. When we did eventually get to Europe, there was an announcement of a delayed eurowings flight. Basically, you're pretty much guaranteed to have your flight delayed or canceled if you fly Eurowings. My flight from Europe back to the United States took off and landed later than scheduled and I missed my shuttle and paid for another one. I was charged for headphones and for use of the outdated screen in front of me. I had pre-purchased an in-flight meal, but was hungry right after eating it and spent more money on food. It was a 12 hour flight and closer to the end they brought around a little more food, but I didn't get it. I only remember seeing the one option for meal purchase. The seats were uncomfortable and with each new thing, I became more and more upset. I didn't say anything, but I was balling my eyes out during the flight. I have never experienced anything this horrendous.

### "Always delayed more the 30mins"
Not Verified | Vienna to Rome. I take this flight every week. Always delayed more the 30mins. Unacceptable. Ryanair will start doing this route from November. Go for it! Poor service but at least you arrive on time

### "avoiding Eurowings in future"
We flew from Koeln Bonn airport to Zurich and had to check one bag. As we already had our boarding passes (online check in was easy) we assumed it would be a quick drop off as it usually is not a big deal. Well, as we entered the airport we encountered an enormous crowd lined up. The line up was so long, that the people were lining up all the way to the exit doors. And to our surprise and shock we found out that this is the bag drop off line! Out of 6 desks, only 2 were operating. The line was barely moving. Then after an hour, hoping they would open more counters, they closed one! And another half an hour later the last counter lady took her bag and left. The crowd was close to a collective panic, as most people were late for their flights at this time. Some people, for whom the time pressure got to high, started storming other Eurowings counters (check-in or express) to drop their bags. The time for our flight was way past boarding time (we waited for 1.5 hours in the line up to drop a bag). I had no choice but pushing onto the express counter out of line to get into our flight, which was finally successful. Looking back, I can't believe Eurowings counter management policy. We already had to claim checked luggage with the ticket booking, I am sure everybody had. So they knew exactly how many bags had to be dropped off. The few staff members were highly stressed, constantly yelled at and probably close to a burn out. I will be avoiding Eurowings in the future.

### "never fly Eurowings again"
Not Verified |  Antalya to London via Cologne, the worst airline experience I have had. Firstly we checked in at Antalya Airport and they could only print off our boarding pass for one leg of the journey and we were told we would need to exit the airport and check in again in Cologne. This flight was delayed, we missed our connection and then queued for over 2 hours to speak with the ticketing desk. We were put on the next flight which was also delayed, meaning we didn't get back until 7 hours after our scheduled landing. I have tried to claim compensation with no response other than "this is the risk you take flying with a low cost airline". This was actually stated by one of their customer service representatives. I will never fly Eurowings again.

### "my worst experience ever"
Munich to Fort Myers. First flight cancelled. We end our vacation two days earlier cause no alternate flight later possible. Now they cancelled the alternate flight too. This is my worst experience ever with am airline. We have two little children 2 and 3 years old. Never fly Eurowings! If you buy cheap, you pay double!

### "Overall, no complaints"
I booked a rondtrip from Hamburg to Stockholm. My first flight was cancelled two months before departure and I was booked on another flght later that day via Düsseldorf with a 5 hour layover. As I had scheduled meetings in Stockholm, that flight did not work out for me. Luckily, Eurowings booked me on a direct flight a day earlier and even paid for a hotel in Stockholm for me. Customer Service can be a bit of a hassle, but after all I got what I needed. Both flights were on time, seats are comfortable for a low-cost-airline and the plane was quite new. Overall, no complaints and way better than Ryanair. Would fly Eurowings again.

### "flight has been cancelled"
Birmingham to Berlin via Dusseldorf. Flight to Dusseldorf was delayed by 2 hours. In Dusseldorf, they announce that flight has been cancelled. They can't book hotel, there is no flight to Berlin today and the flights tomorrow are fully booked. That's it! We had to get our train booking done to reach Berlin. When we mailed the customer desk, the auto reply said, we will get back to you by 6 weeks. For me the rating has to be in negative.

### "50% of flights with delay"
50% of flights with delay. Information on delay at last minute, and delay increase every hour. No reliable information, no personal at gate for information. Basically you just sit at the gate and prey that they will not be a new delay. Perfect company if you want to stay the whole day or even worst the whole night at the airport.

### "50% of my flights are late"
Since several years I fly Eurowings Vienna-Hamburg. Never has it been as bad as this summer. Of my last six flights HAM-VIE, five were late. Today again one hour. This Monday 20min, etc. Over 50% of my Eurowings flights are late. I think airlines should be punished for such practices.

### "never fly Eurowings again"
Not Verified |  Split to London via Dusseldorf. I went to pick up my boarding pass in Dusseldorf connecting from Croatia to London, when the person at the desk told me they had overbooked the flight so I wasn't assured my seat and had to ask at the gate whether I would get on the flight. At the gate after three tries I eventually got assigned a seat, this seat had also been assigned to someone else! So there were people milling about on the plane with no seats. Luckily I was one who got to keep the seat I was in. But I could have missed this flight, a flight I paid fully for weeks before, due to Eurowings' disgusting practices and negligence. This has never happened to me before, in 35 years of flying! I will never fly Eurowings again.

### "Really bad experience"
Really bad experience with Eurowings from Dusseldorf to Stuttgart. 2 flights on one day: both delayed, one by 80 min, the other one by 120 min. Seems they took over all the bad habits from Air Berlin when acquiring their fleet. Useless explanations for the delay.

### "good service onboard"
Hamburg to Keflavik. The flight was on time and good service onboard, they checked our boarding pass and served our rebooked meal even we sat on other seat (not same with our seat on boarding pass). Staff was friendly and helpful. I can recommend it, i will fly next time. The website is also easy to book .

### "cannot get access to lounge"
Naples to Stuttgart, late by half an hour. Service is bad, as a SEN I cannot get access to the contract lounge at Naples when flying basic economy.

### "Not a great experience"
Not Verified |  Köln to Seattle. Not a great experience. Cologne check in and passport control were chaotic, flight delayed by an hour without reason given. Small and crowded waiting area. Once on board aircraft feels old and worn out. Tape holding fixtures in bathroom, torn seat and missing plastic parts in Best class - costs extra for broken seat? Flight itself was ok, crew friendly but cabin felt too warm and something wasn’t quite right with the air con. Finally after delayed arrival the return flight was cancelled and this week the outbound is cancelled. A shame this is a Lufthansa group airline as the aircraft and service are not up to standards and the reliability is very poor. WiFi never worked. Won’t fly it again.

### "not recommend Eurowings"
Not Verified |  Flight leaving Olbia delayed by 3 hours. No explanation and guaranteed misssed connection to London. Rerouted through Munich with 6.5 hour layover and landing in Stansted (original destination was Heathrow). Late arrival at Stansted with a further wait on the tarmac of 20 minutes followed by another 1.5 hours in line for passport control. Stansted is a terrible airport. I would not recommend Eurowings unless you place no value on your time.

### "an absolute disgrace"
London to Cancun via Cologne. The worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying with. Our flight from Heathrow was delayed by an hour and 40 min, so we had only 20 minutes to catch our connecting flight in Cologne. I did wonder at this point, will our luggage make it? But staff around us at the time assured us it would. We arrived in Cancun, and unsurprisingly, everyone who I recognised from the connecting flight did not receive their luggage. My two friends who I am travelling with received their cases 3 days into our trip, yet I am still yet to hear any information on mine. It has now been 10 days, I go home in 4 days. It has partially ruined a very much needed holiday, I am extremely disappointed. No one from the airline has helped, they are rude when you call and just ask that you email an email address where no one ever responds. They say that baggage enquiries are only managed via email, but no one responds, I have sent 8 emails since my luggage went missing. I have found out more information myself by ringing Cancun airport to find out where my case was last scanned. It’s despicable that they get away with taking people’s money for a terrible service, no support or help. I do not recommend you fly with Eurowings. And to echo what someone else said here, it’s not even that cheap! I paid nearly £600 for my fare, including £60 to check in my luggage. Imagine that, I have actually paid £60 to potentially never see my belongings again. They are an absolute disgrace.

### "whole experience with them was painful"
Not Verified |  Never fly with Eurowings again. Flew Frankfurt to Bangkok. Crew were extremely rude. They threw our food on our tray with no respect. When my boyfriend asked for water for his medicine they complained rudely about using the service-bottom. The wifi is pay for but it was ok, it was announced. However the entertainment was paying too and it was not announced anywhere. The whole experience with them was painful. They have lost a customer.

### "never fly with them again"
Cologne to London. The worst airline I’ve ever flown with by far! Flight was cancelled after sitting on the tarmac at Cologne airport for an hour. No information as to why. Only one representative offering help or advice at the airport. My company were able to book me on another flight the next morning. This was delayed by an hour. No information as to why. The staff were incredibly rude on the plane when helping people with luggage. The seats were horribly uncomfortable and no leg room at all. Will never fly with them again!

### "flights are always late"
Venice to Cologne. Avoid at all costs, you are better off with Ryanair. Living in Cologne I don't get much of a choice of flying with them most of the time, and I'm appalled at how they manage to always do worse than the time before. The flights are always late, with an average delay time that seems increasing with each flight, no customer support whatsoever and little care of providing some service to the airplane passengers... Now they started giving a 5€ voucher to boil off when waiting for the plane, which barely pays for anything at the airport nowadays. Avoid!

### "Worst flight ever"
Punta Cana to Zurich via Cologne. Worst flight ever. They do not provide entertainment unless you pay for it. But even worse they only speak German assuming you understand it. It gets even trickier if someone in the aircraft seeking for a doctor help, but you do not understand what is going on, and then the announcement "dear passenger we need a doctor" is only done in German. I was also seated in front of annoying people that were adamant of not letting me pull down my seat to sleep during the 9 hours flight. I thought this was one of each passengers' prerogatives when buying a tickets. Especially in a 9 hour flight! They brought us to the wrong gate. They let us wait ages because there where not enough buses on the floor serving the flight.

### "generally I am satisfied"
Brussels to Milan Malpensa via Stuttgart. The overall journey was fine and both flights were on time. The aircraft was actually the same, an ageing but well kept Dash 8, that I suppose before belonged to AB. The staff was kind and professional, the service is buy onboard  but not stressing. I fly quite often with Eurowings and generally I am satisfied. Also, the flights count for LH M&M status. I would recommend Eurowings at least for European flights, for long haul I can't judge.

### "changed our flight"
We booked directly on-line with Eurowings for a flight on 31 December 2018 Stansted to Munich. We were advised that Eurowings had unilaterally changed our flight to one day (24 Hours) later. This was not acceptable as we would have missed our connection in Munich. We were told that the flight was not being operated any more. However, both Eurowings and the wholesaler still list the flight on their websites and we could have wasted more money by purchasing the same ticket again. Clearly, either the "reason" for the change is not true or the airline has not kept its website up to date. We suspect the former. We have made our own arrangements (at extra cost and trouble) with another airline. I have allocated one star as that is required. If I had a choice, I wouldn't allocate any stars.

### "inferior, cut-rate service"
Not Verified |  New York to Budapest via Dusseldorf. I bought a ticket through Lufthansa, so I was disappointed to be on Eurowings. I called them to verify their luggage restrictions, and got no answers from the woman I talked to. At JFK they put a tag on my checked bag saying JFK to DUS to MUC but when I asked about it, I was told my bag would meet me at BUD. On the 6+ hour flight there was no meal service (compared to 2 meals on Lufthansa flights of that length, which  was the ticket I purchased). The baggage rules for my connecting flight were different, and the flight attendant hassled me about boarding the plane with a bag and a personal item, even though I was coming off a long haul flight. Unsurprisingly, my bag was not there to meet me at BUD. The employee I spoke to said my bag was in MUC, but had been located and would be delivered in the next couple days. It has now been over a week, and my bag is still at MUC. I have tried to get information on my case through several channels. Their Hungarian customer service phone number (as posted on the official Eurowings website) is disconnected, and there has been no response to emails sent to the airline or their baggage handling contractors (Menzies), and there has been no response on the Menzies lost bag portal's messaging platform. I have explained several times to them, I had necessary medications in my checked bag, which I have not had access to in the time that Eurowings has failed to send my bag. This has been extremely stressful and uncomfortable to say the least. I'm very upset not only with Eurowings but  with Lufthansa, since I purchased a Lufthansa ticket at Lufthansa prices and instead was given wildly inferior, cut-rate service at every turn.

### "Avoid long haul Eurowings"
Dusseldorf to Los Angeles via Munich. My second flight had 19 hour delay. I had to rebook other flights- it was an absolute mess. Avoid long haul Eurowings flights if possible. Onboard service was ok. TV costs 10 euros to use but they have great new movies. Staff was extremely nice. Gave some people free food and gummy bears in addition to catering included in some fairs. I got a free sandwich and banana and declined the gummy bears. Legroom was a little tight- but I'm 6'2.

### "Worst airline ever!"
Miami to Munich via Duesseldorf. Worst airline ever! Worst and rudest customer service! Our flight had 3 hours delay, it wasn’t rebooked automatically like all other airlines would. I’m 6 months pregnant and am flying with a 2 year old, we were given no priority and had to wait 2 hours at a poorly staffed help desk at the connection destination and were told by a very rude lady that the next flight is full so we had to wait over another 4 hours on our connection flight. And all that after an 8.5 h flight from the US with a toddler! Furthermore, the food on the flight was disgusting, my TV didn’t work and we were not given a seat with extra leg room as promised when I called in advance to reserve seats. We were constantly given opposite information, one person telling us our luggage will be sent to the destination while the other said we have to pick it up and check it in again. Poor organized and unprofessional. Eurowings doesn’t care the least about their clients, very disappointing.

### "My flight was cancelled"
I was supposed to be flying on EW1979 from Hamburg to Munich (21:10 - 22:30). Weather forecast predicted thunderstorms for the evening. Additionally, the aircraft that was supposed to be flying me from Hamburg to Munich already had a delay of 1h31min at 16:30 on its way from Dusseldorf via Munich to Hamburg. I called Eurowings to ask for changing the flight to an earlier flight (EW7000, 19:00 - 20:25). This flight had seats available, but there was a changing fee of 150€ as my flight was still showing that it would be in time. (Impossible, since the incoming flight was delayed 1h31m). Long story short: My flight was cancelled. I had to fly the next day and stay another night in Hamburg. I called the hotline for rebooking which was more helpful than the airport staff. Delays can happen and I understand that. This delay was absolutely foreseeable as the incoming aircraft was delayed. In the end, the weather in Hamburg was sunny and the other flights in the period in question were on time (LH033, FR4026, EW2045, SK4844,SX207, JU935, EK062, OK544, BE7110).

### "really good value"
Vienna to Hannover. I was travelling with hand luggage and upon check in they told me that my little suitcase with my medium size backup would have been not allowed, but as this is kinda crazy as I´ve never had any problems with this, at the end they allowed to enter with this in the plane. The flight was okay as well the cleanliness of the aircraft and the crew was really polite, not complaining for anything on this flight, really good value between service and money.

### "last time flying with them"
Not Verified |  Cologne to Rome return. When I purchased the ticket for my daughter and I, we paid an extra 40 Euros to get seats and snacks during the flight. The aircraft was changed from the time I booked the flight. Not only we lost our seats and didn't get any snacks, but also the extra money we paid was gone. On the way back, not only was the aircraft different, but also instead of going to Cologne it landed in Dusseldorf. When it was time to board the plane, they never announced the boarding and didn't let families with small children get on board first. Passengers sort of figured that out themselves as to when to board. Eurowings also has some of the rudest stewards and stewardesses. My last time flying with them. It is not even that cheap.

### "Canceled the flight"
Cologne to Prague. Canceled the flight half a day before departure. No compensation (not ATOL?) provided just an offer to rebook. As a result my 2 day holiday in Prague had to be canceled resulting in financial loss due to hotel and return flight cancellations. Lufthansa and Eurowings would provide better service to travellers by shutting down this airline!

### "Zero communication from staff"
Flight from Stuttgart to London Heathrow was delayed three times. Eventually we departed 2h35 late. Zero communication from staff as to what was going on. Zero apology from crew. Zero drink/voucher offered. Will not be flying with Eurowings again.

### "a truly miserable airline"
Second time I have flown Eurowings - never again. It is a truly miserable airline. The first time I flew (Koln-Zurich) my first flight was delayed 2.5 hours, and my return flight was delayed 1.5 hours. However, that is pleasant compared to my most recent experience, a Friday night flight scheduled from Koln-Budapest. After waiting more than three hours after hour initial 6:10 departure time, we boarded the plane. It was at that point that the pilot came on the intercom and informed us that the flight had exceeded the maximum time a flight crew is allowed to be "on", and thus the crew could not fly us. This was intentional - the delay was publicized fairly early, and avoiding the regulation would have literally been as simple as looking at one's watch. Additionally, there were only two staff working the customer service line for several hundred passengers. Took roughly an hour and a half to move thirty people through before me - can't imagine the people in the back of the line. Once I got to the desk, my questions were ignored and I was handed a "Customer Relations" card with a phone number that rang for over an hour with no response. Flight was delayed until the next morning at 10:10 AM, which means that everything I booked in Budapest (a little under 200 Euros) went by the wayside without being used. Absolutely pathetic airline. Your flight will not take off on time. The staff will try to scam you (and deny the EU regulations regarding passenger rights that are a) easily available online b) on a card in the airport). You would be better off walking.

### "passport had only 3 months left"
Cologne to Stansted. This was a disastrous experience and will never fly with Eurowings again. First up on my outbound flight I was refused boarding saying that my passport had only 3 months left on it despite not needing a visa to travel to Germany. My visit to Germany was for just 5 days. Ended up using the train. On the return flight the flight was delayed by 75 minutes and upon reaching London had to pay extra money for overstaying in the car park. On top of it my baggage was damaged by handlers. No apology has been offered. Have put in a claim and up to now they haven't acknowledged anything only to be given a claim/ticket number. Have emailed numerous times for update on the claim all I get is Zero response. Will never use them again.

### "seats are very comfortable"
London to Hamburg. Had a disastrous time checking in at Heathrow and have written a full review on this. However Eurowings were very helpful as my mother is very elderly so has less mobility. Eurowings crew ensured my mother got to her seat safely and even radioed ahead for wheelchair assistance at the aircraft door when we landed. The seats are very comfortable and for once people are given free soft drinks and a snack. I would say better than BA in this instance.

### "best low cost carrier for me"
I was flying from Munich to Dortmund on Eurowings. This flight is also a Lufthansa codeshare flight. At Munich Airport, Eurowings departs from the modern and sleek Terminal 2 (i.e. the Lufthansa terminal). Eurowings has its own counters with its own agents and a different booking system, therefore its not possible to check in at the Lufthansa counters. There is a separate counter for Business Class/HON/FTL/Sen passengers. While Eurowings is not part of the Star Alliance, they have an agreement with Air Canada/United/ANA so that as a United Gold passenger I could use the lounge and priority check-in. No priority bag tags, though: they do not have them at all. The flight itself was good. In the so-called Smart fare a sandwich and a non-alcoholic drink plus water were included. Foodwise that is more than Lufthansa would offer on a domestic flight. The first ten rows have regular Lufthansa legspace, beginning in row 11 it is much more narrow. There was an additional 5€ charge for a seat in the first ten rows even in Smart fare/UA Gold. Crew was good. Flight was on time and boarding easy. I still prefer full-service carriers, but if Eurowings is considered low-cost than it is probably the best low cost carrier for me. Sidenote: The business class fare would have been 30€ more expensive.

### "seat was very comfortable"
Not Verified |  Originally my Eurowings flight from Dusseldorf to Hamburg was supposed to depart on the 9th of July at 8.45 pm but unfortunately that flight got cancelled. I went up to the Eurowings Counter where they had already organized a room in the Maritim Hotel at Dusseldorf Airport including Dinner and Breakfast. And they gave me a seat on the next available flight at 06.40 am the next morning. The extra leg room seat was very comfortable as well. The Service on the aircraft was very professional and good.

### "frustrating travel"
Not Verified |  Flight from Dublin to Düsseldorf was last minute delayed-at first 20 mins which turned into an hour and a half. Finally arrived in Düsseldorf now to find the next flight from Düsseldorf to Berlin has also been delayed by an hour, although it could be more. Several other of their flights displayed on the airport screens are also delayed. Not going to make public now resulting in an expensive taxi fare. Poor conduct and frustrating travel. Should’ve spent the extra to fly with somebody more reliable

### "avoid them if you can"
Vienna to Miami via Dusseldorf. I didn’t even get to go on it because of their last minute cancellation, within less than 12 hours from departure. Besides the awful inconvenience of missing the trip, I have lost over €400 euros that the airline has failed to compensate. I have tried everything to communicate with them, I wrote an email and the auto-response answered I’d be contacted by Eurowings within six weeks. I talked to them at their Vienna airport counter and the airline staff misinformed me passing me on to some department that didn’t even have to do with my claim, and all the contact phone numbers they provide will make you wait hours on the phone without an answer, besides charging for the call. Eurowings offers really poor customer care, avoid them if you can.

### "Staff were rude"
Not Verified | The flights were late we were dumped at the wrong airport and are hundreds pounds out of pockets. Staff on the ground didn't give a toss about this and just dismissed our worries. We voiced our concerns and the issues but all that happen we were downgraded to basis flights. I called customer services and after 45 mins I was cut off. It took the airlines 3 days yes 3 days to get to our resort and still waiting for contact from them to see what they are going to go about it. It ruined our holiday completing and then on the way back we got sent to another airport but not the one we expected to be at. Had to pay for another set of coach tickets home another £101 and rebook the taxi. Never in my life time will I use this airline again. Staff were rude and just brush us off.

### "customer service is the worst"
Gothenburg to Zurich via Dusseldorf. Eurowings’ customer service is the worst there is! Plus they do everything they can to save money and not action as promised. I’ve received an advance email informing me that my flight will change to one day later than was scheduled. Before acknowledging that email, I contacted their customer service (minimum time of waiting was 35 min) and they said to book a hotel for the extra night and they would reimbursed the fees. I asked to have that in writing and they refused saying that I need to send the receipt from the hotel to a specific email address which I did but I had no response until now (more than 2 months). Upon my return from my trip I contacted the customer service again and ask to see what happens with my reimbursement. They said that since I send that email there is nothing they could do even if its been so long and I was clearly didn’t get any response. When I asked them to contact their colleagues or transfer me to the people dealing with such a cases they said they can't connect me with that department and its only via email which again they don’t respond. So basically they say various non-sense trying to frustrate you and give up the case so they don’t have to reimburse anything.

### "horrible and stressful experience"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Birmingham. We checked in and got all the way to the gate before we were told out flight was cancelled. The only reason we found out was I was with my grandmother in a wheelchair who had assistance from the airport staff. We ended up running around the airport, going back through security, picking up my grandmother's bag at the bag drop then begging the Vienna ground crew for a different flight. They eventually rebooked me on a flight through Munich which caused me to miss my train at my destination. They were unable to put my family and I together so my grandma went via Frankfurt and would be picked up by other family in Birmingham. I ended up getting my.passport stamped three times for Vienna in the debockle. All in all a horrible and stressful experience.

### "really good product"
Düsseldorf to New York JFK. Basically the two A340s are former LH aircrafts, with their current 2-2-2 business class. The colour scheme is also identically. So the seats should be known to anyone; I like it. A great seat. Food was spiced well, nicely presented and a delicious three meal course for dinner. Extremly friendly cabin crew on both legs. Number of movies is low, IFE good (same as @LH), WiFi is really bad and very expensive (unfortunately not the LH FlyNet). A really good product on the routes from DUS. I asked the flight attendant how the one A330-300 is configured and it is the current Cathay Pacific Business Class.

### "not recommend this airline"
Bangkok to Bonn. I was sat next to a child that was climbing all over the seats and constantly getting kicked by it, the staff did nothing to help. I asked to be changed seats and got ignored, would not recommend this airline to anyone. Also you have to pay €10 to watch tv which is ridiculous when you just paid £300 for your flight.

### "recommend ignoring Eurowings"
Not Verified |  Edinburgh to Munich via Dusseldorf. The aircraft were fine on these two sectors and the cabin service was up to standard on the first sector. However the second sector did not meet our expectations. We paid extra for a snack but the flight attendants failed to deliver said snack. We showed our boarding passes which confirmed our eligibility and a flight attendant even promised to deliver it. It never arrived. Three emails to eurowings' conatct address have been ignored. I recommend ignoring Eurowings.

### "a very nice flight"
Düsseldorf to Berlin-Tegel. It has been a very nice flight but a little delayed and the operation at the airport took very long. When we entered the airplane we had a kind crew who helped us to find our seats. But the legroom was pretty poor but luckily this was only an one hour flight. The seats were also old like all the interior. The toilet was so tiny that I could not even stand there but at least it was clean.

### "experience was really horrible"
Munich to Thessaloniki. It was the first time I have booked with Eurowings so I checked their website in case a prior online check in was necessary. As I was informed that I had the opportunity to check in at the airport, I went to Munich airport without an online check in. First of all the flight,which in the end I didn't take, was delayed twice. That was not the problem though. As I reach the counter for the check in I was told by the the clerk that my flight has been overbooked and I had to rebook with an other airline or for a different day. The result was to beg several assistants of the family company of Lufthansa to overbook my flight to Thessaloniki for about 3 hours until they finally found a way to overbook my flight as well as for other 10 people in the same flight. As overbooking is a usual tactic for Eurowings, they definitely should mention that in their website .My experience was really horrible and I would never book with this airline again, although my flight was rebooked without any cost in the end.

### "Excellent flight"
Munich to Stansted. Excellent flight with good comfort and excellent staff. Delayed takeoff due to extreme weather. Air bridge at both ends made entry and exit easy. Food on board looked fine- we didn't eat but we had tea and a chocolate bar.

### "most horrendous journey"
Stansted to Puerta Plata via Cologne. Worst airline in the world. Flight was late leaving from London, could have offloaded us but kept us on the flight knowing we would miss our connection in Cologne. Flew us to the wrong airport and then left us stranded to try and find our own transport 6 hours drive to our original destination of Puerta Plata. No onboard entertainment, staff in airports are just reps and not Eurowings staff and they could not have been more unhelpful. It was the most horrendous journey of my life and I would never wish flying with Eurowings on my worst enemy.

### "there was no my luggage"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Rome. At first I was notified that the flight was delayed. Then after dropping the luggage while searching for the gate, the flight was cancelled. Apparently the company independently rebooked my flight and had to wait there for 5 hours. In addition, nobody gave the passengers notice about the food & drink coupon that apparently we could use. While rebooking the flight and taking the new boarding pass, I emphasized several times to re-address the luggage, as I needed to have it with me today. We landed and there was no my luggage. (Other passengers were in the same condition too). The luggage was delivered after 3 days. The airline didn't respond to my emails, not speaking about the compensation. Don't recommend the airlines at all, 0 customer service!

### "waiting for our compensation"
Our flight arrival flight was cancelled and the departure flight was postponed (by over 3 days) from Munich to Faro and we followed the exact steps outlined by Eurowings to rebook our flight. It has now been well over two months that we are waiting for our compensation for the cancelled flights. Speaking to customer service (which charges for every single phone call) is no help at all, because no one there is actually able to provide concrete answers. Emailing the email address they provide with result in no response at all, and basically we have been hitting our head against the Eurowings wall for weeks now. It's simply impossible to receive any kind of answer from their customer service department.

### "10 hour flight delay"
Munich to Las Vegas. Summary: 10 hour flight delay. Compensation: a Refreshment coupon. No other options available. For some customers this type of consumer service might seem adequate or not be an issue at all. For me, I have learned my lesson and will pay up to +25% premium and choose another airline.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
❌ Not Verified |  London to Cancun via Dusseldorf. Outbound flight: The reclining mechanism on my seat for my 12 hour flight was faulty. At take off I was flung backwards. You could not lean back on the seat without it moving into its fully reclined position. The air hostesses did nothing and would not move me. Return flight: Two flight delays. Lost my luggage - still has not been found after 5 days. Worst airline I have flown with. Never again.

### "price far away from acceptable"
Milan to Hamburg. I fly Eurowings regular, it is a Lufthansa daugther company with the quality and service standards of a very low budget airline but a price far away from acceptable. Lounge access is not allowed if Basic tarriff is booked also for Gold card holders and even with heavy delay (even a single flight costs 200 EUR but very little competition in Germany after bankruptcy of Air Berlin). I have about 60-80% of my flights delayed. Some of my flights are operated by other airlines so dont expect to sit in a Eurowings plane.

### "very negative experience"
Tunis to Stansted via Cologne Bonn. Just a generally very negative experience. The outbound flight was late. We were flying via France and so had to rush for the connecting flight. We needn't have bothered as that flight was delayed also. The problem was, we were running around trying to find the gate, but there was no-one there to tell us that the reason we could not access the gate was because the flight was delayed (which was not what the board said). The return flight was also delayed. We had a connecting flight in Germany and a bus was supplied to take us from the plane to the terminal. Whilst myself and a friend were carrying hand luggage and assisting two 5 year olds down the steps, the bus driver decided to close the doors and leave. In the cold and the rain with two 5 year olds and a connecting flight (which we were late for) we were told to wait and the bus would return. After waiting a while, we decided to walk at which time the staff started shouting at us and threatened to arrest us. Now scaring my children, I got very upset trying to explain that we had a connecting flight and needed to get to the terminal. The plane staff were very unhelpful as were the assisting staff. Again, needn't have been worried about the connecting flight as it was, you guessed it, late.

### "delay as there was a strike"
My flight from Cologne to Zurich was delayed 1 hour and I had to miss my connecting train from Zurich. Eurowings did not help at all with any reimbursement or apology and told me that they are not responsible for the delay as there was a strike! I will never fly with them again. I chose them because it was the cheapest option. Now I know they may seem cheap at first but they will cost you much more.

### "The worst flight ever"
Budapest to Mauritius via Munich. I booked a return ticket from Budapest to Mauritius. Both of way needed transfer once. The way I went there and the first flight when I return were totally normal. you know in such long flight you could have some basic entertainment and food. This flight is the only one that you need to pay every single thing extra! For example, the earphone. I didn't start my movie at the beginning but I felt it's odd when the crew was selling this. They gave you access to a movie without earphones. Moreover, when cabin crew started to serve the food, they ignored me, I thought she may did not see me. So I asked one staff in the end, and she said the ticket I booked is just seat without service. I said how come I book a seat to spend 12h without food. She said I could buy it with cash, but Euro only. I just have dollar left but they did not accept it so I left with empty handed and during these 12h I have nothing to eat. What's more ironic, when I decided to start a movie to transfer my attention, I noticed even I have no right watch anything, they request me to pay again! I was  extremely angry. I started to worry about my luggage if they transfer it or not. because in that situation I didn't book any service except a seat. I landed, all the info I received, there is single word mentioned that I don't have extra service. Last but not least, this young team's attitude and service is horrible. I strongly felt that they don't care the non-German speaking guest. Everytime when they come to me, they will tell me I need to pay to get what I need. The lady who distribute food, she just skipped me, I was trying to ask her, and she pretended as if I am a troublemaker or food beggar! Another lady who told me I didn't book food, she knew my situation and I couldn't purchase even I have money, until the end she never came back to me with anything solution? The worst flight ever.

### "Very nice and enjoyable flight"
Very nice and enjoyable flight with Eurowings from Düsseldorf to Faro. Flight departured 10 minutes late, however this is acceptable. Legroom was very good, I could strech my legs completely. Staff was very friendly and helpful. 10 minutes of free Wifi were offered, if you wanted to continue useing internet you had to pay a fee. Overall I had a great experience with Eurowings.

### "bag taken from us at the gate"
We travel always to Antalya with only hand luggage. One of our cabin bags, that had the correct dimensions and wasn't overweight, was taken from us at the gate. It was not permitted in the passengers cabin. Result: at arrival we had to wait 30 minutes at the baggage belt, a bottle whisky was broken, so the trolley was stinking and soaking wet, our reserved transfer to Antalya was gone and in the next the passengers and the driver complained about the smell of our trolley. I asked several times at Eurowings why they took the trolley. First they said it had to do with safety. The trolley has been more than 100 times inside the cabin, so that is rubbish. Then they said the luggage bins onboard were maybe full, but half of them were empty. Even the hostess on the plain was surprised the trolley was taken. I loved to fly with Eurowings, but now they drop to the level of Corendon and Ryanair.

### "The service was perfect"
Munich to Rome. I have been rescheduled to the flight of Eurowing on 22rd March from Munich to Rome, as my LH flight on 21st Mar in the evening left Munich without us, due to delay. But our plane took off exactly on time, I discovered that the space between the rows was even little bit more vs regular LH planes I fly. The service was perfect, the cabin crew was very polite and attentive. So my message is that there are also many positive experiences with Eurowings and the low rating here can be in a way misleading.

### "appalling and ridiculous airline"
London to Hamburg via Dusseldorf. Absolute appalling and ridiculous airline, I recommend to never use them wherever possible! I had a total of 4 flights booked with them on 1st May and only 1 made it on time. Worst was when in LHR told me that I will get grounded overnight in Duesseldorf on my trip home to HAM due to delays and there was actually an alternative direct flight LHR-HAM with available seats, but they could not be bothered to put me on that flight. So Eurowings rather flies an empty seat and grounds a passenger half-way due to delays than moving a finger for bringing a passenger where he booked to go. So I rebooked myself on the alternative LHR-HAM not to get stuck the way Eurowings had planned it for me. And than that 4th flight again got delayed by about 3 hours. Considering only 25% of my 4 Eurowings flights made it actually even remotely on time, I question their capability and competence

### "pay for an extra legroom seat"
Stuttgart to Hannover. Since a couple of months they changed their policy so that you now have to pay for an extra legroom seat where you can put your knees in a normal position. Instead they place now an advertisement in front of you.

### "I call that a rip off"
Cologne to Hamburg. Booked SMART Ticket, which includes a tiny Snack box with 0,2l water and tiny cake as well as an other drink of your choice. But on both flights, they distributed only the snack box and offered no other drink. The crew told us, since the flight is fully booked, they would not offer that additional drink service, because there is not enough time with a crew of 3. I call that a rip off, if you pay for a drink, you should get it. It is not my problem it the crew is on minimum. That is the reason why I book SMART Tarif, because I want a coffee on an early morning flight. This is not the first time that this happened with this airline. They sure need some competition in the German market. If I can avoid Eurowings I will try, but out of Cologne they have a monopoly. Baggage took over 30 minutes, even there where not a lot of passengers at the belt,

### "was a mediocre flight"
Nice to Cologne. At the airport we checked in. The staff were friendly. Our flight had a delay for 20 minutes. It`s acceptable for a lowcoster. On board the purser welcomed us a bit annoyed. The seat was comfortable with enough legroom. At our cruising altitude I bought a baguette it smelled OK but it was fresh. We arrived with a delay for about 30 minutes at our destination. It was a mediocre flight with a unfriendly crew.

### "stood waiting for 4 hours"
The customer service for Eurowings is horrible. They canceled our flight from Düsseldorf to Zürich at 5 am and it took them until after 11.00 to let us know what was going on. We stood waiting for 4 hours for them to communicate to us. They told us that they could not do any bookings at the desk and had to "email" our request to Portugal for rebooking. This took 4+ hours and there was no communication. We asked them to call the main office, and they told us they did not have the phone number so they couldn't call if they wanted to.. There were 200+ very angry people by the time this was over. I have been flying for more than 20 years and I have not experienced anything this unprofessional in my whole career.

### "flight had been cancelled"
I booked a flight from Birmingham to Dusseldorf some months ago with a connection to Erkilet (5 hours layover) via kiwi.com. Lufthansa is my favourite airline for many reasons so was actually really pleased to be travelling with Eurowings and had no need to check reviews - or so I thought. Being a bit of a plane geek I had been keeping my eye on the flight for the last few weeks and noticed that it was very delayed and diverted twice over the last month which I thought was odd it was then I started checking reviews and was horrified therefore I had a inkling that my journey may go wrong. Flight from BHX departed at 7.45 and my taxi was coming at 5.15 I woke at 4.15 and saw a text message which had been sent at 1.20 that morning telling me the flight to DUS had been “changed” to depart at 12.05  This meant that the chances for getting my connection were slim. As if a departure time is simply changed that close to the time ? It clearly wasn’t a delay - they wouldn’t text you about that would they? Thankfully I had the option to not accept the changes with kiwi.com and get a refund (which I’m sure will not be easy) so that meant I could look at other options as I simply did not trust them not to just cancel it altogether. I then had to re book with THY at double the price but I couldn’t take a risk and guess what at 11.15 Eurowings text me again to say the flight had been cancelled. So glad I trusted my gut and rebooked otherwise would have been stranded at BHX. Absolutely shocking. They wrecked my travel plans and caused me so much hassle not to mention that what was a fairly cheap ticket booked ages ago turned into a very very expensive trip. I really wouldn’t advise anyone takes any chances booking with these jokers.

### "a delay or cancellation"
Cologne to Edinburgh. One of the worst, if not the worst, airline I have ever flown with. I fly a lot with Eurowings and every time without fail there is a delay or cancellation at the airport in Cologne. It is never announced on the board or from the staff either. There is always a problem with having too much hand luggage on the flight and, instead of sorting it earlier, the airline always leaves it to the last minute to arrange for baggage to be stored in the hold. Once on the plane there have only been a few occasions where staff have helped passengers store their hand luggage. The majority of the time they just stand back and let the passengers sort it, resulting in further delays. The service of this airline at the airport should be a lot better.

### "Staff nice and smiling"
Short domestic route Cologne to Hamburg and return. My experience with Eurowings improved much, as previously (on flights DUS-WAW-DUS) I didn't enjoy it due to cramped space in Dash Q400 and poor service. But on this particular rotation it was way better. CGN-HAM on brand new A319 with nice interior and comfy seats. Cabin crew very nice, but the service itself was like a pure low-cost. However, the flight was very short (just 45 minutes) so could not complain much. Return hop operated by Adria Airways - delayed by 45 minutes. Interior nice, overhead screen with live flight tracking, cabin crew served tasty snacks and soft drinks free of charge. Staff nice and smiling. Overall, the option for travelling from Cologne to Hamburg was great, as flights were considerably cheaper than train rides.

### "never fly again with this company"
I was flying from Düsseldorf to Geneva on the 03.03.2018 with Eurowings. I booked the flight with departure time at 7.05 and arrival time at 08.25. After 16 days Eurowings changed the departure time to 06.25 and also the duration of the flight as the arrival time remained the same (from 1 hour and 20 minutes to 1 hour and 50 minutes) without any explanation. When I got to the airport, after the check in the departure time was delayed by 30 minutes at 7.05 due to a freezing in the toilet area of the airplane. We finally got in the plane at 8 o'clock instead of 6 o'clock where we have waited for about one and a half hour for take off. When we finally arrived in Geneva at 11.15 we couldn't get off the plane because of some other plane taking our parking place as we were told by the captain. The doors opened at 11.45 so the overall delay was over 3 hours. During all these hours we were offered only 5 centimeters of sandwich and a water. I checked after 5 days online there was an online form for a reimboursement of 250 euros for the delay that was never sent by email so the company doesn't inform passengers on their legal rights and also after completing the form I have never received a confirmation email. The plane was an old airberlin plane, a bit dirty and old interior but with good leg room. Nevertheless the crew was smiling and really nice. I will never fly again with this company because the problem is not that it is a low cost airline, but the whole organisation and planning of the flights. Easyjet is also a low cost airline but I have never had an of the problems above.

### "would not buy this ticket again"
Phuket to Hamburg via Cologne. Horrible flight. Online check-in was for unknown reason not available. Flight was delayed 3 hours and we were announced only the evening before flight. Original departure time 06:40, new departure time 09:30. We got bit stressed but all was ok at the end. We booked hotel next to airport in advance so slept and were fresh but we saw plenty of people not taking hotel and waiting at the airport whole night. They looked destroyed in the aircraft. Secondly, food was really poor. Piece of bread or cake at beginning of the flight and after 11 hours first (and last) warm meal. Last 2 hours before reaching destination staff decided to serve warm meal. They did not announce what took them so long. Warm meal (meat or pasta) was not tasty and too small portion. Full grain bread and 30% percent butter pretended to be healthy but tasted really bad. You can order anything additionally and pay for it, if you catch some of staff of course. Entertainment package was a joke, anything you want to do - listen music, watch a movie you must pay 10 EUR per flight. This could be included in ticket of such price category or at least offer could be improved. I saw 80% of the movies already and I am not a big movie fan, there were just so few movies. Btw if you decide to watch a movie, then earphones/headphones must be purchased if you do not bring them with you. Beverages were average. For alcohol or something special you need to pay. Seats were ok, average. Staff could come around to collect trash during flight more often. Staff as such was not enough for such flight, not enough in amount, could be more polite, could be even more trained. I must admit there was no problem with my luggage and we arrived safe home, catching second connecting flight. Second flight Cologne-Hamburg was short and pleasant, even staff seemed much better. In my opinion airlines must get better prepared to handle long flights such Cologne-Phuket. They cannot operate them in this way. I would not buy this ticket again, in whichever price category.

### "cancelled in the last minute"
I had a flight last night from London to Hamburg, they cancelled in the last minute, they rebooked me today via Düsseldorf, again delayed. A 1 hour flight takes me almost 1 day. Disappointing, not recommendable and I'll try to avoid when possible

### "It’s incredibly disrespectful"
Phuket to Cologne. The flight has been informed to be delayed in less than 24 hours before departure. We were supposed to fly at 8:30am local Thai time and land in Germany at around 15:15pm. Flight has been first informed to be delayed till 21:00 than to 23:00 and eventually till 00:30 next morning. We are still waiting in hotel that we have arranged by ourselves. We have tried Twitter, Facebook Instagram and called numerous time and have not heard anything except standard: please raise a claim and we will review it for reimbursement within 4 weeks. We called to the desk in Airport in Philet and they were unable to tell us is they will cover hotel expenses or food expenses. It’s incredibly disrespectful to treat almost 300 passengers like this, we have paid more than 600 euro per person for flight Cologne to Phuket return and it’s not a so low or budget price! I will make sure to never fly this airline again that ruined our holiday return home and all the following commitments!

### "I've been standing for over 1.5 hour"
Dusseldorf to Berlin. Terrible organization or no organization in Dusseldorf. There were 10 people at check-in counters and only 2 working. There was no information about boarding, last call-nothing! Now I've been standing for over 1.5 hour at the Transfer counter that has 1 worker covering 1 person for 15-20 min. It's 1.40pm and the staff just told us she closes at 2pm. Dusseldorf to Berlin.

### "Good price and on time performance"
Best Eurowings experience so far flying from Dusseldorf to Hamburg. Good price and on time performance. This started with the outbound flight. The plane and crew were leased from Czech Airlines. That meant old fashioned seats and a friendly crew and to my suprise a complementary drink and snack (I had the basic fare). Landed 5 mins ahead of schedule. Inbound flilght was on a Eurowings plane with only 20 passengers. We started 10 mins early and landed 20 mins ahead of schedule. Dusseldorf Airport had the annoying habit of parking late planes far from the terminal so we had to take the bus, but with only 20 people this was I breeze.

### "Not a single announcement was made"
After having reached the gate, the flight from Lyon to Duesseldorf by Eurowings was delayed by more than two hours. Not a single announcement was made to inform the passengers waiting at the gate as to why, for how long, when delayed boarding will take place, etc.. On the contrary, at the gate the original departure time has been kept until the final delayed departure and on the departure time information boards one could read 'Go to the gate'. After we finally had taken off, neither the pilot nor the crew did bother to apologize nor provided any reason for the delay. After many delays in the past caused by striking personnel of Eurowings, and that additional bad experience, I have decided to avoid any booking with Eurowings in the future. I never have made any comparable bad experiences with any other airline.

### "Overall, a pleasant flight"
I had a pleasant flight from Dublin to Düsseldorf route. The ticket was reasonably priced, as was the checked baggage fee. I was travelling with two family members on the same booking, and I was pleased to be seated together. There was sufficient legroom. However, the overhead storage compartment was rather small. Overall, a pleasant flight with nothing really to complain about.

### "Overnight very pleasant flight"
Windhoek to Köln with Eurowings. Flew with my daughter. On time departure. Overnight very pleasant flight, friendliness of staff above average. Food / drinks good. Seat comfortable, legroom ok. Inflight Entertainment at a cost - good selection of movies and series. Looking forward to more of these legs with Eurowings  in future.

### "no help from Eurowings"
This is the worst airline in my history of flying. I was supposed to fly from Miami to cologne Germany and when I arrived st the airport in Miami I received an email two hours before my international flight that it was canceled. There was no information given on what to do, where to go, why it was canceled, etc. I called the “Eurowings” help number who told me to go to Lufthansa and they would help me. When I arrived at the Lufthansa desk, the employees there asked why an unoffiliated airline would send them to their airline to fix the problem. At this stage, I called Eurowings help desk back, and stuck them on the phone with the Lufthansa employee. After the Eurowings employee was slightly understanding of why Lufthansa couldnt fix their problem, I was sent to Eurowings counter where everyone was camped out on the floor with no answers. Once a representative came out they informed up they would do their best to get us somewhere near our destination the following day and they did not know where to put everyone for hotels so to stick around until they could figure that out. I flew with another airline with no help from Eurowings. Now - I’m trying to fly home from Cologne to Miami and the flight is delayed an hour and a half at the moment with absolutely no information as to why or what’s happening. Never fly this airline. It’s horrendous and the staff are rude and unhelpful. I wonder if we will ever take off.

### "They are cheap for a reason"
Avoid this airline at all costs, I thought Ryanair was one of the worst budget airlines I had ever had the misfortune to travel with but no, Eurowings have fought hard for their title of worst airline ever and they deserve it. Myself and my 15 year old daughter were due to fly out of Düsseldorf back home to London on the 10th December, it started to snow slightly and then I received an email notification to say my flight had been cancelled. But at this point it was showing still ‘on time’ on the departure boards in the airport, feeling a tad confused I joined an extremely long line to the Eurowings customer service (and after two hours) reached the front and rebooked on to a later flight that evening. When we went over to the ticket desk to receive our new tickets and to check in for the later flight the male Eurowings check in clerk smirked and said “you won’t be getting on that flight” which made me think about maybe booking a hotel nearby just in case (which I did). After more hours of hanging around the airport, the later flight was indeed cancelled and we queued up again at the customer desk but this time I was in a 4 hour queue, when I eventually got to the front of the queue we weren’t offered an apology, an offer of somewhere to stay, or even a glass of water but were stuck on the next day morning flight at 6.55am. We got to our hotel which was now fully booked and set the alarm for 4am. On waking at 4am I saw that there was an email informing me that our flight had been cancelled again. So back to the airport to join a 6 hour queue and noticed the airport was full of sleeping passengers who hadn’t managed to book a hotel. While in the queue I once again provisionally booked another night in the same hotel (as it was offering free cancellation if we didn’t need it.) Once I reached the front of the queue we were told all flights that day were now full and we had to stay another night, again not any apology or offer of food and drink despite it now being 24 hours since we had been stranded. We were put on the 11.00 flight for the next day. We spent another night in a hotel, another day of food and drink that I hadn’t budgeted for and still not one offer of anything from Eurowings for me or my daughter. We finally made it home in the afternoon of the 12th December and as advised on twitter sent off all my receipts for hotels, food, drink etc and received an email back to say they would process this within 5 weeks. Five weeks have now passed and after phoning the customer services of Eurowings I’ve been informed that it could take 7 weeks, oh no wait maybe 8 weeks and the 5 weeks was just a figure they tell their customers. I would think carefully if you are thinking of flying with these jokes. I wouldn’t fly with them again even if I were offered free flights for 20 years. They are cheap for a reason.

### "complete lack of support"
Lisbon to Dusseldorf. I have been constantly getting flights with Eurowings from Germany to Venice and sometimes also to other destinations, and I can't remember I single time a flight was on time. I had flights canceled without reason, constant delays of hours and a complete lack of support in any of these situations.

### "Extremely bad customer service"
London to Berlin. Extremely bad customer service. Flight was booked from London to Berlin on the 10th  December 2017. However the flight was cancelled and they offered a free replacement flight on the 11th December. When I accepted the flight, they charged me 143 pounds extra. Called them to solve the issue and they claim that they'd send the refund back. This was on the 19th of December. Till date, no refund has been made. Called the company many times, they claim that we have to email the accounting department who refuses to reply emails. Asked them to provide the paypal transaction id for the refund they claimed they've made and they've refused to do so. Beware, you'll never get your money back and their poor attitude just highlights their company's values.

### "Had to pay for meals"
London to Cape Town via Cologne. They got the name wrong on the tickets, tried for days to rectify the name change and was finally successful on the day before travelling, I thought. Only to check in at the airport and discovered that nothing was changed and then still to be told by the check-in person that it's okay as Eurowings allows 3 mistakes. All that trouble in the first place. We were delayed without prior notification and feared that we'd missed our connecting flight. Fortunately there were quite a few passengers on the flight who had to get the same connecting flight and it was announced that the connecting flight would wait for us in Cologne. As a flight of 9 hours we thought we'll be given a meal, not a chance. A bottle of water and that was it. Had to pay for meals. On arriving in Cape Town, our luggage was nowhere to be found and no one could help us. It appeared connecting passengers from London did not have their luggage transferred onto the connecting flight. We landed at about 12:20 pm and we were reunited with our luggage at 7:30 the following evening. We had no change of clothing, toiletries and had celebrations to go to on day one and two.

### "No proper warnings about delays"
Brussels to Berlin. Very outdated seats, worn out and dirty. Worst food I had on the airplane. No proper warnings about delays. 20 mins after the boarding time, they announce a delay by printing the message on the screen without proper audio announcement. Continued delaying every 1h. Just tell us upfront.

### "No priority boarding"
Stansted to Vienna. I only use them because I have no alternative (not the price, the route) and endure the experience. I have got Senator Status for many many years and have spend a lot of money with Lufthansa and the Lufthansa Group. This seems to be irrelevant if you fly Eurowings. No priority boarding, you get one glass of water and even if you don't want a meal (it does not deserve the term meal) you have to get and pay for it if you want a reserved seat. Moody staff and many times delayed.

### "no customer service whatsoever"
I was forced by my company travel policy to take a 3rd rate airline called Eurowings. The plane was supposed to leave at 7.05 pm, was postponed to 8.15, 8.45, then 9pm. A Czech Airline plane finally landed at 9. By the time we went in, they closed the door at 9.35, and we did not move, they told us that the airport was temporarily closed to clean the tracks from the snow, then they moved the plane a little, "to go to de-icing", nothing happened (although we saw some planes leaving). At 11pm, they told us we would go back to the airport, we waited an extra 30 minutes to get a bus to the terminal, and were completely left alone by this so-called airline. There are 18 conveyors belts for luggage in Dusseldorf airport, and no indication where our luggage was, and nobody to inform! There is no customer service whatsoever from Eurowings, we only got a message saying "if you want to find an other flight, go to "www.eurowings.com". By this time all airport hotels were full. Both Eurowings and the airport employees had disappeared, all counters closed! I spent a sleepless night in the airport, and am well past the age for this kind of rubbish. A chance I had a smartphone, I had to find on my own a way to get back. There is 1 Thalys per day from Dusseldorf airport to Paris, at 6.06 am and I managed to book a seat. I finally arrived home by 3pm on Saturday. What adds to my frustration is that the Air France flight I originally wanted to take did leave on time (I heard the “last call” by 7.50), and that all this was about 2cms max of snow (3/4 inch). When it happens in Paris, everybody shouts that this is an inefficient, badly managed airport (which I believe to be true), but here, between Eurowings and Düsseldorf Flughafen, the myth of German efficiency blew away. Eurowings' business models is based on what they call "optimization" of the aircrafts' flight time. It means that they simulate on computer that they can make as many flights as possible in a day with planes coming from various airports and companies. As any person with a minimum of sense knows, in real life it does not work, which is why they are so often late. As they don't care about their customers it's not a big matter for them. On the way in, I had a propeller plane from Air Berlin (I know, they are supposed to be bankrupt) which was already 50 minutes late (the flight time!) at midday.

### "it was total chaos"
Flew Eurowings from Zagreb to Vienna via Stuttgart. Terrible experience right from the start. The plane was late enough taking off from Zagreb that we missed our connecting flight in Stuttgart. The customer service window had approximately 75 people waiting for help with missed or canceled flights. We did manage to get a flight 6 hours after our initially scheduled flight but that was also 1 1/2 hours late. At one point they decided to board the plane and loaded all the passengers onto 2 shuttle buses. For whatever reason, the very crowded, sweltering buses were left on the tarmac for 30 minutes before the drivers opened the doors and there was a mad trampling rush to get off the buses and board the plane, it was total chaos. The crew on the plane were the rudest I have ever encountered and I fly a lot. They bypassed myself and my daughter with the service cart and then acted very put out, when I asked for a beverage. I was told that everything on the cart needed to be paid for because of the class of my ticket. I have no issues with paying for service but I refused to give them any more money for incredibly poor service.

### "never fly this airline again"
Kavala to Dusseldorf. We haven't even boarded yet and I have already made a promise to never fly this airline again. The airport of departure was changed via email at 3 in the night. New airport is more than two hours away. We had to rent a car tot get there in time. There was a bus between the two airports but this was not communicated in any way. Guess people didn't deal their mail in time and showed up at the airport with busses ready. Flight is leaving an hour early. Only mentioned on the screens, but not on their 'minute up to date app'. I was able to get an online boarding pass but nobody told me i had to get a paper one at the desk. Boarding is already hour late now.

### "I will never fly Eurowings again"
Cologne to Venice. I’m well travelled and this has to rank as my worst ever experience. Second time with Eurowings. Only reason I flew them was because they have a direct Cologne to Venice flight. It was supposed to be an evening flight out of Cologne. The gate was changed twice. Flight was supposed to be at 7:10pm. Delayed to 8:30pm. Finally ground staff came on to say that flight was cancelled at 8:20pm. Load groans from passengers. No explanation. Zero emphathy. No alternative arrangements provided except to say that a refund is available. I receive an email later from Eurowings with steps to obtain refund. Because of the lack of communication, a majority of passengers ( at least 140 people) rushed to the lone Eurowings desk almost all at once sparking chaos. There were only 2 support staff manning the desk and they were quickly overwhelmed. Most of the passengers were standing in the back hoping to glean information from other passengers. It is a disgrace to leave paying customers in the lurch with no support after the flight is cancelled by the airline. I needed to get to Venice to meet my family and had to scramble late at night to book another flight. I found another flight on Lufthansa the next day from Frankfurt. That meant I had a stay overnight (find a hotel) in Cologne and catch early morning train to Frankfurt. I had to buy a new air ticket, pay for overnight hotel and pay for the train ride to Frankfurt all at my own expense. I will never fly Eurowings again. If there was a way to give Eurowings a negative score I would because giving them a zero would a compliment to this sorry excuse for an airline.

### "delayed by 40 minutes"
Vienna to Rome. The gate changed 15 minutes before the scheduled flight time and then delayed by 40 minutes due to no spelled reason. The staff  were unable to provide any information. Seems like Eurowings is a very cheap airline and customer service is not one of their priorities.

### "No priority boarding"
London to Stuttgart. When Lufthansa switched all flights not going to/from Frankfurt or Munich to Eurowings they stated it will not mean lower service etc In fact, the prices stayed high (even higher on routes where LH Group has taken over parts of AirBerlin) No priority boarding for Star Alliance Gold Members, poor meals/drinks, no newspapers, few miles.

### "awful excuse for an airline"
Dusseldorf to Newcastle. I paid £350 for a return ticket to be treated like cattle. No smiles or manners from the staff or crew. Both ways delayed with no explanation and they left us sat on the bus on the runway for 30 minutes next to the plane whilst it was refuelled (not great at anytime let alone when pregnant!). Again no apologies. I asked to buy a packet of M&M's on board when the trolley got to us and you would think i had asked him to give up a kidney! I would expect a lower standard of customer care if i had paid peanuts for the journey. I will never use this awful excuse for an airline again.

### "you even need to pay for a beer"
Brussels to Stuttgart. Once again I had to fly with Eurowings, the so called "Low Cost" airline LH established It proved that what had changed is only service level (worse), but not price. The Basic-Tarif doesn't even allow a Gold Member of Star Alliance to enter the lounge anymore Plane is at outside position, and you even need to pay for a beer.

### "never apologized for the delay"
So I flew yesterday, 8 November 2017. Venice to Cologne. Went to the airport at 19.30 as the flight was scheduled at 21.30. After spending 2 hours to check my luggage in, confusion all around as no one was saying anything and we were all just standing. The staff notifies us that there was a problem with "computers" from the German side and hence the delay. No apologies given. So after another hour, finally checked my luggage in, had some extra weight, went and paid 50 euro for extra 4 kgs and that is fine but the staff member was a really a bad host. Not a smile, not an apology, more interested in making you pay. Good thing I booked extra leg room, drinks and snacks included, guess what? A cup of lukewarm coffee was all I got. The flight crew never apologized for the delay, no one from Eurowings did. Never again with this company.

### "ok for the money you pay"
Bangkok to Cologne return. Booked in "BEST" fare. Priority Check-in and passport control, information with voucher for lounge, lounge service and boarding absolutely perfect, but only in Bangkok Suvurnabum airport. The service in Cologne very bad if not inexistent. Check-in- and boarding personnel inefficient. No priority boarding. Lounge information inexistant, so you find yourself back in a complete different boarding area (B) from which you cannot or only uneasily get back to the Lufthansa lounge in C area. Service on plane good but not even earplugs or eye-covers available. On a previous flight we got a nice grey zip-bag with socks, earplugs, eye-covers etc in it, such times seem to be revolved, within 2 month. Inflight entertainment same as 2 month ago. Still ok for the money you pay, we know it's not a real first, or business-class" but why not try at least to get the same service in their "home-airport" as in Bangkok.

### "will get no help if you have issues"
Dusseldorf to Paris CDG. They lost our 3 bags on this very short flight. They found 2 of them following day, one bag is still missing! What's even upsetting is that they are not doing anything about it. They do not have a phone number to call for this. Their customer service simply tells me to email their "claim" email address, which I did multiple times, I get an automated reply and nothing else. Very frustrating, stay away if you can. You will get no help if you have issues, they will defer you to an email address or will ask you to call later, but you will get no result!

### "the most delayed airline"
I am a University student who travels regularly between Cologne and Budapest, and the only possibility to fly is with Eurowings. I can honestly say it is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I do not know what goes on in their Operational control center, but it is the most delayed airline. The on-time performance of this route is 63%. What a joke. I fly them 4-5 times a year there and back and I am happy if only once a year they manage to fly me on time. I have had delays where the flight took place the next day, I had delays where the flight from Cologne was already over Czech airspace, and they had to turn back because they realized the crew would run out of duty time - real proper management their. Last time, to minimize the delay from Budapest to Cologne, they replaced the AC in Budapest, as the originating flight from Cologne was over 2 hours delayed. So they took us with an Air Berlin plane which was already positioned at Budapest. I paid extra money for added legroom, as I am 6.2ft/187cm, did not get extra legroom seat on Air Berlin plane. Numerous occasion my plane was so delayed landing in Cologne that there was no longer train service during the night, so I had to take a taxi home, which sometimes cost me more money than the plane ticket.

### "didn't expect that much"
Prague to Dusseldorf was really good, didn't expect that much from this company. Delayed a little bit, but still manageable and we arrived only 15 minutes late. Even on such a short flight, we get a free drink and a small snack. Aircraft was pretty clean. On the way back though, total disaster. Delay 1 hour, aircraft (19 years old) dirty, seats tattered) unorganized boarding. Only left half of the plane got meal and drink (I dont even know why). Staff unfriendly and obviously bored. Mixed feelings from this company.

### "improve service levels"
Dusseldorf to Milan. This Lufthansa subsidiary is getting worse and worse in its service levels for premium customers: priority boarding cut; access to lounges for the Basic tariff cut, fast lanes that at some airports are the opposite of "fast" or - in the case of Düsseldorf, closed. That is particularly upsetting as I have paid as so called "Best" customer for a service that I am not getting. Also, given the difficult integration of AirBerlin crews and aircraft, the levels of reliability in terms of plans leaving and punctuality have suffered greatly. Trying to rebook flights is not made easy with waiting times of 20 - 30 minutes for the hotline. All in all, having paid more than 300 Euros for a one-way flight, the level of service and reliability does not match ticket prices. Either improve service levels to match prices or cut prices, please.

### "delayed because crew not here"
Berlin Tegel to Stuttgart. Flight was delayed because crew not here. No info in lounge but only when you arrive at gate. When I ask when do we board (already 30 minutes after original boarding time), they have no clue because they don't get informed by airline. You just wait without any info.

### "a classical low-cost airline"
Rome to Cologne Bonn. Flight was delayed 3 hours, but it was not the airline's fault (destination airport temporarily closed due to a bomb from the II WW). We got free snacks and beverages for the inconvenience. For the rest, it was a classical low-cost airline, with little space for the legs, no entertainment, but everything as I expected. The only thing that I did not like is that, despite the delay was known well in advance, we were all sent an SMS saying that the times for check-in had not changed, forcing everyone that had to ship his luggage, like me, to stay for hours at the airport.

### "the trip was wonderful"
Cologne to Cancun. Me, my wife, and our 5-year and 4-month old sons travelled from Cologne to Cancun with Eurowings (11 hour flight). We had seats in economy class and the trip was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The flight was clean and looked liked new. There was enough space for my legs although I'm a tall guy. Overall, we were happy with the service and would go with them again. Of course, our expectations were in accordance to their rates.

### "rotten customer service"
Horrible airline. Sitting in the airport and started receiving delay notifications. Half hour each - not bad after the first two times but then we suddenly received a notification saying that our flight was delayed til the next day at 3PM with no explanation or apologies. After an hour and a half on the phone to customer service, was told that we can book a hotel or taxi etc and we will be compensated. Submitted compensation and still waiting for a reply from a human being (have only received automated responses). Their customer service line is a joke as they keep telling you to send an email. Rotten customer service - avoid at all costs.

### "not fly with them again"
Izmir to London via Dusseldorf. A bad experience will not fly with them again. The plane and seats was really comfy but when we arrived at Dusseldorf the staff was so rude, also when I arrived at London Heathrow they did not give me my stroller so I had to carry my toddler. Then when we arrived to collect our baggage they did not put it on the plane with us they left it in Germany, still waiting for it now!

### "unfriendliness of cabin crew"
Istanbul to London via Cologne. I have never experienced flight which was so cold. Despite telling the crew nothing was done about it. The unfriendliness of the cabin crew was standard throughout the both flights. The food was basic and over priced for what it is. I will not be planning to travel with them again.

### "predictable delays each time"
Unfortunately I do not have any other choice but to use this airline. With almost 2 years experience with 3-6 flights per month, 90% of departure for the flights Milano Malpensa-Dusseldorf-Milano Malpensa are delayed 30 mintues - 3 hours! Not recommended as predictable delays each time.

### "archaic check-in procedure"
Seattle to Cologne, returning Berlin to Seattle. If you can avoid flying Eurowings, do so - they have the most archaic check-in procedure. Rather than allow online check in, you must check in at the counter (which guarantees a 30-45 minute line). Even on long haul flights, everything is charged as far as food or drink goes. Any more entertainment than the flight tracker is going to set you back. Don't even try to use their phone customer service. The personnel are rude and extremely unhelpful.

### "arrival on time"
Jerez to Dusseldorf. Departure and arrival on time, understandable loudspeakers, hilarious, nice tone used by purser and captain. Clean seats, board menu not used, embarking under rain, therefore access should have been organized. There were no screens showing the flight progress

### "frustrated and disappointed"
Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow. First flight out cancelled at very short notice. Unsympathetic customer service who gave false information about availability of flights during the day, forcing us to rebook on the last flight out and so miss business meetings. Arrived at airport to find last flight out delayed by 30 mins. Very frustrated and disappointed with poor service.

### "very decent pitch and legroom"
Flew Bucharest to Zurich via Dusseldorf. No priority checkin at OTP at all. Chaotic queuing before the three open counters. On both sector changes of aircrafts. First sector on German Wings (A319) and second operated by Air Berlin (A320). So not sitting at the emergency exit but a row behind. But still on both legs very decent pitch and legroom. Had a Smart Ticket which includes a sandwich, jelly bears and water. Sandwich gets smaller and smaller each time I fly with them. Would say 4 small bites. If I would not have had baggage, I would not take that price plan anymore. Flight OTP-DUS very punctual, the flight DUS-ZRH delayed by 45 minutes.

### "I have never had so much legroom"
I did not expect such a good flight from Düsseldorf to Dublin. The flight was operated by Air Berlin, due to the wet lease agreement. The plane boarded on time and also arived punctual. I have booked the Smart Tarif, due to this a snack and a drink was included. The sandwich wasn't very good, just bread with salami on it. The onboard entertaiment was outstanding. You could stream movies and series to your mobile phone for free. The cabin crew were very professional and friendly. But the best thing about this flight was definitly the seat. I have never had so much legroom, I didn't book a seat with more legroom however. Maybe it was because of the old Air Berlin seating, I dont know. I recommend Eurowings and the prices are also great.

### "delayed over and over"
Glasgow to Dresden via Düsseldorf. After being en route for 7.5 hours, our flight was delayed over and over again. Flight time is less than 2.5 hours total, but our travel time is now at 10 hours. This kills connections, too. Everything costs extra, too.

### "They don't care about service"
Dublin to Hamburg via Dusseldorf. Dublin had with catastrophic boarding. The gate we were waiting at, wasn't even equipped with seats. Consequently we missed our takeoff slot which meant missing our flight connection at DUS. It was clear when we took off, that we would require assistance in DUS. When we arrived late in DUS, we were told by the crew to contact the Eurowings staff on the ground. There was none. We passed the passport inspection. After that we found a Eurowings desk, with a Eurowings employee who watched an employee of the airport, who was explaining that he wasn't in charge of anything. He told us, to find the ticketing desk of Eurowings. The Eurowings woman smiled and looked friendly, but she said nothing. So we found the Eurowings ticketing desk in the terminal. There we met the first helpful Eurowings employee. He made a booking for us on the evening flight to HAM, and he asked us why we had no luggage with us. Before we could get our new boarding passes, we should "go and find it". He literally said, that Eurowings doesn't care about luggage which is rejected due to missing flights. We were told to find a door with a bell. Of course, we didn't find it. Finally the police and the customs authority and the airport authority assisted us in finding the door an in reentering the arrival hall, Eurowings did nothing. We found our bags just standing somewhere. Eurowings calls this place the mobile baggage-desk. There was no staff. Ther was no desk, not even a sign, there was luggage all over the place. Eurowings will fly you to your destination. They don't care about service, except you pay €3 for a coffee. When Eurowings offers flight connections, they should assist their passengers when something goes wrong and not leaving all problems to the airport und the customer.

### "wasn't what I'd call cheap"
Hamburg to Dublin via Cologne. HAM-CGN was okay, just the flight, no service. Seat comfort below average. Cologne to Dublin boarded on time but was delayed due to a cracked cargo net which was fixed within an hour. I'm aware of my no-frills fare, although even that wasn't what I'd call cheap, but a glass of water would have been thoughtful.

### "Very satisfied with trip"
Paphos to Vienna. Stress free travel for family with young child and dog. Good flight- no bumps. Food is ok, use buses rather than direct connect to airport terminal building, but that was not material. Some delay in departure (20-30 min) but arrival time not materially affected. Very satisfied with trip - excellent value for money.

### "Staff are super friendly"
Flew Zurich to Newcastle via Dusseldorf. OK so you cannot apply the same standards when flying first class with a premium airline as you do when flying a low-cost in economy. However in context Eurowings is a star. Staff are super friendly at all stages of travel and they are also very helpful. I had a tight connection in Dusseldorf, flight left Zurich a bit late which made a tight connection a potentially missed connection. Attendants let me sit at front of plane so I could get of plane first for mad dash to connection. Announcement was made with my connecting gate and directions to it. Plane was clean. I enjoyed my flights with Eurowings, the price for a flight booked only a week in advance was very reasonable.

### "no support from the service on the ground"
I've been flying the route Cologne-Venice very often in the past few years and almost all the time flights have not been on time. Delays spanned through 1 to 3 hours caused by the most varying reasons. Usually no information other than the delay time is given and there is no support from the service on the ground in term of food/drinks or help for those missing connections because of the delay. Many times I had to rely to a very expensive taxi to reach my final destination, like this time. Contacting customer service for complaints or compensation has so far revealed to be unhelpful.

### "disappointed with Eurowings service"
Stansted to Zagreb via Cologne. We checked in at Stansted & the staff wasn't sure what he was doing he asked his colleague a few questions regarding our baby pram & if he needed to give us a receipt & he then went off for 5/10mins to get a label for us to go on the buggy. The pram came off in Cologne & we flew on to Zagreb without it , once we worked out it wasn't on the luggage belt we went to the customer service desk at Zagreb & they gave me a irregularity report, the lady gave me a number to call if I had any further questions, the number I was given I tried to call for 10 days & there was no answer I was told it would be open 8am-8pm - well that was a lie!! I was also told by the lady at customer service that the pram would be brought to me when found so I gave her the addresses of where we would be staying for the next 2 weeks. 2 days later I got a text message to say I had to fill in a inventory & claims form online to help locate my item faster. It took 5/6 days until I actually spoke to someone on the phone to still tell me my pram had not yet been located this was a different number I called which I found on the internet. 13 days later I received an email to say they had found my buggy & were sending it to pula airport near to where we were staying the next day, however we were expected to fly back to the UK the following day, their colleague had written in the wrong information of how long we were staying, I then received an email on the 28th July to say they were transferring the pram to London Stansted & I would be contacted once they know delivery time to my home address. The pram was delivered to my home address on 1st August, 19 days after we checked it in at Stansted. The inconvenience & stress of not having our baby pram for the whole holiday totally ruined our time we couldn't go out in the evening as my toddler does not sleep in our arms just because staff could not do his job properly at Stansted - so disappointed with Eurowings service.

### "service friendly and professional"
Flight from Dusseldorf to Milan with Eurowings. The flight was on time, the service friendly and professional, everything ran smoothly. The leg space is limited, but still ok for a short haul flight. No frills, but very good value for money. Not quite as cheap as some low-cost competitors, but the overall product is superior.

### "delayed an hour and a half both ways"
Eurowings flight delayed an hour and a half both ways, on Thursday evening flying out of London and on Monday evening flying back from Vienna. There was no notice so we had to wait in the airport which is very boring. Also meant the entire day was a write-off both times.

### "Worst travel experience"
Hamburg to Zurich. Worst travel experience ever. Flight was delayed and then cancelled after 6 hours wait going out. Got a late flight missing all connections. Going home now and flight is again delayed 3 hours without any information. All other Eurowings flights are also delayed. Never flying this airline again.

### "they've lost my luggage"
Warsaw to Newcastle via Düsseldorf. Awful experience. I travelled in 4 segments this week and every single one was delayed by at least 45 minutes. On the last leg they didn't even bother to tell us. Finally, they've lost my luggage and I haven't even been provided with a reference number.

### "1.5 hours to get through"
Düsseldorf to Rome. I arrived 2 hours early for my international flight to find a baggage line that took 1.5 hours to get through. I was reassure but three airline attendants I would have time to make my flight and check my bag. While in line, many other customers were experiencing the same frustration about missing their flights. I made it to the front of the line with 40 minutes to make my flight and the woman at the baggage counter assured me the bag would make it on the plane and I would make it through security, no problem. I did make it to the flight to find a completely irate attendant who told me I couldn't get on board, that she had cancelled my seat. The flight ended up being delayed 15 minutes so I made it on but my bag did not. Waiting in the baggage line now.

### "I found the legroom okay"
Stansted to Cologne Bonn. Booking and checking in was relatively simple and staff were friendly. The aircraft was pretty nice and clean while not offering any entertainment. I didn't arrange for any food as the flight was a quick 50 minute flight. The seat comfort is okay for a quick flight. I found the legroom okay but I am short, so if you're above 6 foot, it may be below average. There is supposed to be wifi after you watch a video but then it came up with a page I can't interact with and everything was in German which I don't understand. Overall, for quick flights, I'd say it's generally fine if it wasn't for delays. My flight to Cologne Bonn was delayed by about 40 minutes which was fair enough. My return flight was booked for 7:35PM. This was later delayed to 8:20PM, delayed again to 8:40PM, then they said it would be another 20 minutes, then it was delayed until Midnight. They offered 10 euro food vouchers but with only one cafe at the gate and it not serving food at that time, they were pretty useless and there was a lack of communication going on. Customers were getting quite heated and asking questions and just told each other what was going on until things calmed down and I asked for an official word as to what was happening. Understandably, these things happen but this was my first time going away by myself and the other passengers seemed pretty shocked by this delay. Overall, I'd say, maybe try your luck with it if you've got a quick leisure flight but if time is of the essence, probably not.

### "flight schedules need to be more reliable"
Having used Eurowings / Germanwings / Lufthansa for the past few years flying frequently throughout each year between Hamburg and Birmingham I have become very disappointed with their service of late with regard to frequent flight schedule changes. These have occurred whether or not bookings have been made well in advance or at short notice. Despite accepting my bookings and payments for direct flights, they have changed my last few flight schedules multiple times to completely unsuitable indirect flights. These flights would have extended my journey time (which is usually one hour 20 mins flight) by between three and seven hours, if not more, due to the bad connections. I have had to repeatedly rearrange my plans and re-book flight dates and times which has sometimes resulted in me missing appointments / events. If the airline(s) wish to discontinue their direct flights between Birmingham / Hamburg they should not make them available to book and then withdraw them sometimes almost immediately after booking is confirmed. This has made me very reluctant to book further flights with Eurowings. I have emailed customer service about this several times over the past few months and am yet to receive a reply, just automatic acknowledgements. Only after my first email was submitted I was advised I would receive a reply within 6 weeks, which I find unacceptable. I have since found another airline that have re-introduced this route so my next flight on this route is already booked with them. Apart from this the I have found Eurowings flights are generally on time, check-in staff and on board service satisfactorary. Overall their flight schedules need to be more reliable and online customer service needs serious attention.

### "happy to book with them again"
This return trip, London Stansted to Vienna and return was the first time we have flown with Eurowings. We purchased BEST class tickets which meant that we had seats at the front of the plane and the middle seat isn't occupied. We also had a snack and drink included, and Star Alliance Lounge access which was much appreciated. On both trips the service was excellent from check in onwards. The flights were on time, the on board service efficient and friendly. The planes we travelled on appeared new and very smart and clean. We were pleasantly surprised by our first experience of flying with Eurowings and will be very happy to book with them again.

### "Eurowings have never replied"
On 2nd March 2017 I booked Eurowings return flights from Düsseldorf to Birmingham UK for myself and my 12 year old daughter. The flights were booked online using my Miles & More Lufthansa account. As usual I printed out my Travel Itinerary documents at home and everything seemed to be correct and as normal. On arrival at Düsseldorf airport on Sunday 9th April we were faced with one of the longest queues for a Eurowings check-in that I think I have ever seen. After queuing for ages we finally arrived at the check-in desk, only to be turned away by the check in assistant because the name on my Travel Itinerary document did not match the name on my Passport. On close inspection my short first/given name was indeed printed instead of my full name. I explained to the check-in assistant that I booked on-line via the Lufthansa website with my Miles & More Account and even presented my Miles & More membership card which shows my normal full name. This form of identification was not accepted at the Eurowings check-in with the assistant stating that the names differed by more than 3 characters so she could not check me into the flight. I asked if they could simply update the Travel documents based on my Miles & More Card plus Passport. She could not. If I wanted the documents changed I would have to contact Lufthansa. I was sent from the Eurowings check-in desk to the Lufthansa service desk but the woman at the Lufthansa Service desk just said “sorry we are only a service desk we can't help”. I was re-directed to the Lufthansa telephone helpline, which also was unable to help. I tried to re-book the flights at the Lufthansa service desk, with a similar reply "sorry we can't help, we are only a service desk we can't book flights". Eventually I found L'Tur at Düsseldorf airport and re-booked the whole journey, with the same start and destination airports, on the same day (but later flights), with the same carrier (Eurowings), this time with the correct full names on the documents for an additional price of €688. When my daughter and I were finally on-board we were looking forward to a little something to eat and drink, but the steward bypassed us both, i.e. no drinks and nothing to eat. Apparently our tickets were “Smart something-or-other” which means no on-board service. I had hoped the treatment on the return journey would be better. We received nothing to eat or drink. An altogether disappointing treatment for tickets costing over €1000. I had resigned myself to this being one of those bitter life learning experiences, “next time check that all the details on the documents match up 100%; until I started checking some older travel documents at home. To my surprise I discovered that I have travelled with my daughter with the same carrier and same type of document errors several times before, but without all of this hassle and extra cost. It seems obvious to me that the flight that we were booked onto was overbooked and the check-in staff were looking for an excuse to bump passengers off the flight. I contacted Lufthansa Customer Services (the parent company) who passed the buck to Eurowings, who have never replied.

### "Buy cheap, buy twice"
London to Berlin. I booked onto this flight notifying the airline that I was flying with firearms only to be rejected at the airport as they did not have the booking on the system after I specifically spoke with the staff. Unfortunately I had already booked onto a flight to another destination with the firearms at a later date and faced similar problems. This airline is a joke taking weeks to respond to any emails sent will little or no help charging per firearm? In future I will pay more and have less hassle. Buy cheap buy twice as they say. Totally disappointed.

### "very nice and friendly"
Cologne to London (LHR) with Eurowings operated by Germanwings: We started with an on-time boarding, and as I walked on the plane I was greeted by a flight attendant, very nice and friendly, I made my way down the aisle to my seat in 10A. I arrived at my seat and noticed that it was the exit row, and I asked the flight attendant if I could sit somewhere else. He replied "sure go ahead and sit behind this row. We also departed on-time, approximately 30 minutes after take off the crew started service, and once again I was quite surprised, because I did not expect to get a snack on this short flight, the crew also handed out drinks to everyone on board, and the rest of the flight was comfortable as I had the whole row to myself, as we arrived in London we were in a waiting queue for landing, however that was OK as we arrived still 10 minutes early.

### "I was positively surprised"
Bangkok to Zurich via Cologne. I was positively surprised by their premium economy ("best") product. All ground services are as in Business Class: priority check-in, fast track security screening, lounge, priority boarding. When flying "best" you find yourself in a small, private section in front of the plane. During your flight you could order alle their items on their wings bistro. They have a nice variety of products. The presence of the crew during the flight was so-so. But when you called them they were always happy to serve you. The crew was very young and seemed not very experienced. There was hardly any interaction between the crew and the passengers. The seat is the same as Lufthansa's premium economy: great recline, enough privacy. Very limited entertainment options.

### "problem with customer service"
Vienna to Düsseldorf. Fairly good experience on board, I have problem with customer service and their claim issues. Broke my 300€ worth luggage, and refuse to pay for it. The customer service is arrogant as heck. I don't recommend them at all.

### "crew was very unhelpful"
Milan Malpensa to Cologne. The crew was very unhelpful during onboard procedure just dictating rules without proposing solution or helping to stow luggage. I asked for a sandwich and coke, but I've been told to wait until the dinner was served to passengers that had ordered it. I already had the exact change in my hand and the trolley was in front of me. I waited for them to get back but no one showed up again.

### "the absolute worst airline"
Zurich to Düsseldorf via London. I arrived at the airport in Zurich to be told nothing of my delay. I was suppose to take a flight from Zurich to Düsseldorf to Heathrow. My first flight was delayed for weather I was told by a random passenger. Apparently I heard later employees went on strike. The delay lasted 4 hours then I arrived in Düsseldorf where are next flight was canceled and I waited in line to speak to a representative. There were about 100 of us in line. They decided to just shut down for the night and not help anyone. A representative said I could book a new flight or hotel and they would pay for it. He gave me a card to call or email for help. After calling the number I realized it didn't exist. Then, I wrote an email and never heard back. I had to book a hotel and buy a very expensive ticket out the next day. In terms of travel this was the worst experience I have ever had. Attached is the photo of a useless number and email that I wasted my time trying to contact. This is the absolute worst airline on the planet.

### "impoliteness of the crew"
Hamburg to Amsterdam. I was very dissapointed with the way I was treated by the crew, specially by a lady from the cabin crew. The flight was delayed, which can happen. But how hard is it to give the people waiting in line a heads up? Then by entering the plane it was hard for the crew to great their customers. I greeted them in their language and asked if there maybe was any room for my suitcase (which was the size it was allowed to be). The answer was no. I asked what I was supposed to do. She said in a very unpolite way that it could be packed downstairs. I was a little bit shocked by the impoliteness of the crew. If you become a cabin crew I think one of the first things you learn is to be polite! It was not my fault that the flight was delayed.

### "avoid low cost on long flights"
Varadero to Cologne with Eurowings. First time I used a low-cost company for a long-haul flight. Put it simply, avoid using low cost on long flights unless you have no other options. I knew the remarks / complaints about the company so I was well prepared and it fullfilled my expectations. First some good points: Check-in was very fast as well as the boarding. Departure on time and arrival in advance (great!). New equipement and safe feeling. Now the negative: Food: don't expect anything grandiose from it. Actually the cold meal is just 2 big bread slices with a thin layer of ham. The main complaint is that you would get something better for a cold meal you order on board. The thing is, you paid extra for this meal. Comfort: seats are in textile material which is not the most confortable for long flights and the maximum angle is limited. Cabin atmosphere was horrible. Relation with the cabin crew: so, so. That's the main problem with low-cost company, a seller-buyer feeling where the company wants the cuts the expenses at maximum while letting you pay for each extra. Premium economy (understand extra legroom) was a plus and corresponds with 34" while standard seats are 30" but there are some good seats among the standard economy seats with no seats in front (row 30 and row 4 in the A330-200). While it appears that the seat space was the same (for standard economy) as Ryanair seat it felt that there was more space. Also interesting to note we had to pay 100$ to get to the best class for the smart fare and 150$ for the basic fare. Interesting if you're hesitating for a best seat. I'm not sure however this stands for all flights. In the end I wouldn't recommend this company unless for short flights or if you don't have any other options. After the flight I regretted not to have booked a 15% more expensive flight with another company. However the basics are met, alive, on time and overall good logistics.

### "certainly fly with them again"
Flew Eurowings from Stansted to Cologne and back using Germanwings aircraft. Fare was very competitive and opted for the Smart fare which includes baggage and a snack. Both flights delayed because of fog at Stansted which was not the fault of the airline. The seat was comfortable with good leg room. Crew efficient and friendly. I would certainly fly with them again.

### "a dry, cold bread"
Vienna to Cologne using their Best fare option. Business class price with economy service for loyal Lufthansa customers. The a la carte 'meal' (a dry, cold bread with two slices of cheese and a drink) and only bus boarding at departure and destination is a shame for a 900 euro return flight.

### "arrogant and impolite flight attendants"
We flew from Bangkok to Cologne on the 16th of January 2017 with Eurowings. Never again, we will choose this airline, even though it is cheap. We understand why. There was enough legspace for me, but my partner (close to 2 meters) was struggling. Nowadays they ask $20 or so, extra, for extra legspace. Secondly: dear Eurowings, we are on an international flight! Everything was in German. Did it ever occur to you that are multiple languages in the world? I don't speak nor write German, perhaps your staff could learn some English and manners? Never have we experienced such arrogant and impolite flight attendants. Water was included in our Basic Fare, but we never got it, we had to ask for it and the flight attendant told me that on "your next flight you have to make a squeeky noise. Right, there won't be a next flight with Eurowings with us. Furthermore, the staff addressed other passangers quite rudely by "ask the blond one. Another thing that really annoyed me was the fact that everything had to be paid for: food, drinks and even the entertainment system was paid. We didn't buy anything as the movies were in German. Do you really expect this on an international flight? In any case, we would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "seats are so small"
Bangkok to Vienna via Cologne. I've taken numerous long haul flights to Europe as my husband is European but Eurowings is definitely the worst airline I've tried. First, I didn't know that there are a few categories to the fare type. Luckily I checked a week before my flight and only then i know my fare is the Basic with no luggage and meal on board. Luckily I found out in time to save me from paying a lot in the airport. Then come the ground staff. They are super rude! I was asked to either pay excess fees for another luggage or throw it away as they claimed my hand carry is too big. I travelled with AirAsia with the same amount of luggage. Eurowings, a nice airline name but poor airline in so many ways. Meals on board were bad and no inflight entertainment. Everything has to be paid for. The seats are so small with super narrow legroom and there's no blanket and pillow for you unless again you pay. I took their short haul from Cologne to Vienna and it was bad as well. The cabin was cramped and the crew just don't care.

### "ran out of most items half way through the flight"
Flew Eurowings from London to Phuket via Cologne. Booked them as their flight times were really reasonable and the price was good. Flying from London to Phuket the flight was delayed and we were told it was due to weather conditions, which is funny as from all flights at the airport their one was the only one delayed. From Cologne to Phuket all you get for 13 hours is a small bottle of water. There is food available to buy but they ran out of most items half way through the flight. They sold people headphones but it turned out their system was down, so there were no movies or anything. Flying from Phuket to London via Cologne there were supposed to be 3 hours between the connection in Cologne for London but they changed the time of the flight allowing for just 1, which would have been fine if they didn't fly out of Phuket an hour late for some reason. At Cologne the staff were rude and we were rushed and made to run, like it was our fault their flights are always late. We arrived in London to find out that they have left our luggage in Germany, so now we are waiting to get it maybe at some point.

### "crew was just plain rude "
I flew Eurowings from Düsseldorf to Zürich after arriving with ANA from Narita. What a shock from ANA service and hospitality to Eurowings. Compared to ANA the cabin crew was just plain rude and annoyed. I got a Booking class including a Meal and Drink. But the Sandwich they hand out was terrible. It seemd other passengers had to pay even for water. Thats a bit cheap, feels like Easyjet. Cabin was dirty and trash from the previous flight laying around. The window was dirty. Thankfully the flight was nearly empty so there was enough space.

### "quality of the service is cheap"
Vienna to Amsterdam via Hamburg with Eurowings. The plane was full when I got on board, and all baggage cabinets were full. I was unable to find a spot for my standard-sized carry-on luggage anywhere, and asked the flight attendants what to do. They told me to place the carry-on luggage underneath my seat which was located on the window side. It is a small carry-on bag with wheels which is no larger than any other, but it was preposterous even to attempt it, because the aisle seat and middle seat were already occupied by people, and it was clear that the luggage would not fit underneath my seat. Being stuck between people waiting from behind to get on the airplane and unable to find a spot for my luggage, I asked the flight attendants if I can place the luggage temporarily and find a spot somewhere in the front; one of the flight attendants frowned and snapped at me saying there is no space for them to save the luggage for me. The flight attendants simply stood there at the entrance without offering any help or solution to the problem while observing the difficulties that I was going through. I unanimously decided to leave my bag with the attendant as the only other choice was to either get off the plane with it or abandon my luggage; I chose the latter. The flight attendant later grudingly took my bag and handed it to another flight attendant in the front asking him to find a spot. To be fair, the price is cheaper than most airlines, and perhaps that is why the quality of the service is so cheap too. Next time, I rather pay a few more bucks and receive quality services entitled as a passenger who purchases services in exchange.

### "service onboard was impressive"
Palma to Vienna. Eurowings is taking the place of Air Berlin at Palma de Mallorca. The service onboard was impressive, and professional attitude of staff. Seat are quite confortable, I was in seat 6A. Plane departed on time, and we arrived to Viena 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Food and drinks were offered for free if you pay their Smart fare. Really a good option.

### "we couldn't complain"
Birmingham to Hamburg with Eurowings. For the money we paid to get to and from Hamburg for a lads weekend we couldn't complain. Slight 10 minute delay on the way out from Birmingham but the planes looked brand new and the seats were much more comfortable than I have seen on UK budget airlines.

### "boarding an undignified scramble"
Edinburgh to Dusseldorf with Eurowings. This airline goes from bad to worse. 50% of their flights I have taken have a delayed departure, but they never tell you until the last second. Despite having their useless app, I always pass security before Eurowings admit that the flight is late. Again. In fact the airport state boards update before the app, so don't try that dodge. In fact, they gave the time to write this review while sat in departures for another flight delayed by over an hour and announced 20mins before boarding. I have lost count of the times I got up early for a Eurowings flight that left late or the times I got home late. Explanations are few and far between. It usually involves staff arriving late if they do tell you. Do not pay for a premium seat; boarding is an undignified scramble that makes Ryanair look good. The inflight food is terrible and the coffee is stewed for extra nastiness. A dreadful, smug, incumbent airline.

### "cabin crew were efficient"
Return Heathrow/Bonn with Eurowings. Both flights on time. The basic seats have minimum space which is acceptable for a short flight and the price. The cabin crew were efficient but never smiled when greeting or serving food to passengers. The size and number of cases allowed as carry-on luggage was not checked so the overhead lockers were very full and could not easily cope with the numbers. Self check in did not work in Bonn but there were check in desks available. Online check in is only available 72 hours before departure and not for return flights at the same time which is not user friendly.

### "poor space within luggage compartments"
Barcelona to Vienna and first time with Eurowings. Never again unless there is no other option. Delayed and I lost all my city train conections. They do not give you even a glass of water inflight. I flew to Barcelona for the same price with Niki who offered non-stop beverages and even some snacks. Second rate terminals and airports. Although only 8kg baggage is allowed most passengers had huge enormous bags - which led to poor space within cabin luggage compartments. If you have a choice to fly by other companies - avoid Eurowings.

### "friendly crew and good info from the cockpit"
Only a slight delay with the last flight out flying from Manchester to Dusseldorf, which is worth a mention since Eurowings flights tend to delay at the end of the day. Friendly crew and good info from the cockpit. Booked basic so no food, but can't complain for 50 euros. CRJ900 is nice because of the much better legroom than on other LCC. Irritating that EW are not accepting Dutch IBAN-numbers, so you always pay 10 euros more and you get their digital magazine (which I don't want).

### "won't fly Eurowings again"
Paris CDG to Berlin. The service was friendly but Eurowings left my suitcase in Paris. I was on a direct flight, no connections, and I wasn't late, so there was no obvious reason why my bag wouldn't land with me. What was worse was the tracking system. Although my bag was apparently on the next flight on the same day, I didn't find out anything about the status until two days later. On the same flight as me was a French woman who didn't receive her bag but her boyfriend did even thought they checked in their bags at the same time. When it finally indicated that "item was located " I went to Tegel to pick up my bag instead of waiting for delivery. I couldn't do much for two days because I didn't know when my bag would be delivered. When I went to pick up my bag, the bag recovery area in terminal C was like a zoo but this isn't just Eurowings's problem. But I did meet other people there who were putting in complaints at Eurowings for lost/misplaced bags from Paris as well. This seems to be a recurring problem I fly fairly often and my bag has been delayed only once. This is a short flight from Paris to Berlin. Such inefficiency! I won't fly Eurowings again.

### "cannot find anything positive"
Zurich to Hamburg. Heavy delay. Unfriendly staff, poor cabin layout at high costs. Unfortunately it is impossible to avoid Eurowings from and to Hamburg. It is only the lanes and counting legs for miles&more which keep this airline in business. Even if I try, I cannot find anything positive. The best experience is usually the bus ride from the far away tarmac to the arrival hall.

### "false economy to fly Eurowings"
Vienna to London Stansted with Eurowings. One class flight but Eurowings offers different pricing for a similar seat. Staff has a list indicating fare code of each passenger and serve free drinks only to those eligible, which at online check in 48 hrs (rather than 24) before flight passengers can pay for additions. The flight is similar to say Easyjet but better in that Eurowings does not make it difficult for passengers like Easyjet to stipulate that passengers must print boarding passes, and with Eurowings paying for luggage at counter costs the same, unlike Easyjet it costs more if not prepaid. The fight is on time and not bad in itself, except the arrival airport is Stansted that is inconvenient. I chose Eurowings for a lower fare than BA, but with a piece of check-in luggage charged for 30 Euros, and the inconvenience of Stansted (difficult / costly / time consuming public transportation) I have to say it is false economy to fly Eurowings on this route. BA to Heathrow with fast and inexpensive tube connection is a better idea.

### "won't try again for a while"
Bangkok to Prague via Cologne. A last moment decision & a one way ticket thus the pricing was a factor, however if I count all the add-ons, then Eurowings isn't anywhere near a low cost compared to other airlines. Long haul trips needs ample kgs for your luggage and a meal. Payment for every single item is expected but beware any changes in your flight that you might need. Any rebooking is always mlre expensive than the entire fare! Flight from Bangkok already overbooked and trying to get some passengers to take a later flight. Wanted to Change my flight several days back with their call center and they could've spared themselves a headache and the 300€ for anyone who agreed to fly another day! All flights were on time. A nice fresh A330 from Bangkok and a completely full flight. The crew was going overtime to handle all the service and this is where I can say the flight was uncomfortable. Food service and figuring out who prepaid and what seats, then drinks then duty free - slowly many passengers realized that they were hungry and the individual orders started to buzz. Crew running up and down the cabin, payments with not enough change or a faulty credit card machine, etc. Not a moment of peace till before landing. Connection in CGN is ok and short hop to Prague with an A320 was only 50min. An interesting option but tickets need to be truly competitive as I'd gladly pay the several hundred dollars and get some peace of mind. Mostly recommend for shorter flights. Long haul wasn't my cup of tea and won't try again for a while.

### "communication was very poor"
Bangkok to Cologne. Very disappointed with Eurowings. They have changed our schedule 3 times without providing us any information. Communication was very poor. You have no right to reclaim if the flight's delay doesnt exceed 4 hours, but the time that you waste and the new arrangements you have to do due to their inefficient management are not enough to compensate us.

### "recommend flying with Eurowings "
Vienna to Valencia. Aircraft was just a couple of months old and was in very good condition. The leg room was very spacious. Flight departed on time. All in all I can recommend flying with Eurowings - even if you don't get a snack and a water if you fly them!

### "thing hard about using this airline again"
Dusseldorf to Lisbon. The ground staff were thin on the ground but spoke better English than staff in London Heathrow. The embarkation was controlled and the staff were well presented. The cabin was spotless and staff welcoming. The flight was about 2 hours and 40 mins and very pleasant. I had preordered a snack but for the price the contents were meagre and not to be repeated. I paid quite a lot for very little and would not do so again for travelling with this airline. All that was in bag I had purchased online was a chocolate bar, a tiny bottle of water and a sorry excuse for a sandwich with one mouthful in it! The arrival into Lisbon was punctual but a very long bus ride took place from the arrival point to a terminal and then followed a very long wait for the luggage too! I will think long and hard about using this airline again. On the one hand they have a good route network and the cabin staff are professional and organised but things like the meagre purchasable food items and add ones for luggage are off putting.

### "bag-drop was quick and  efficient"
London Heathrow to Dusseldorf. The bag-drop was quick and efficient and recall the woman who assisted me being very friendly and making a good first impression. The departure board was slow to show the gate for my flight but that was not the fault of the airline. Boarding was not well managed and several people commented that they could not understand the spoken English of the woman making the announcements. The cabin was clean and fresh and the staff neatly turned out. The flight was just over an hour and the cabin crew did well to sell drinks and snacks and coped with some very rude passengers too. Disembarkation was well managed. This was the first flight of trip from London to Lisbon via Germany. I quite like this airline as their website is transparent and user friendly.

### "overpriced poor service flight"
Bangkok to London via Cologne with Eurowings. Using a similar model to Easyjet and Ryanair of charging extra for everything doesn't work for long haul flights. I was carrying hand luggage and took food bought at the airport on board, which ended up being much cheaper than buying their smart fair. I did purchase sandwiches onboard which were honestly terrible and overpriced, and they also charge an extra 9-10 euros for in flight entertainment. The connecting flight was also delayed 3 times, the third time wasnt even announced meaning that I had bought a replacement transfer ticket from the airport only to miss it for a second time (I missed the first due to delays as well). The only thing they give to you is water, the absolute basic needed for human survival on a 12 hour flight and they don't even offer that very often. Not only this, but it seems that they hugely overbook their flights. In Bangkok there were signs asking people to voluntarily surrender their seats in return for 300 euros worth of vouchers. The check in queues were huge and at Heathrow they lumped all the check in and baggage drop queues into one without even any separation for the destinations. The online check in and self check in counters would not work. Luckily I alerted a staff member to this fact and he accelerated me to the front of the queue as I did not have luggage to check. If I had waited in the lines which were probably at least 1 hour long then I would have possibly missed my flight. On arrival to cologne airport the flight connection desk was empty, leading people to queue aimlessly for no reason. No one showedup and a security person had to come and explain where people should go to catch their connecting flights. I planned initially to buy food for the long flight in Cologne but got to the Eurowings terminal only to realise there was only a single cafe selling absolute basics such as overpirced croissants. Overall the flight was not that much cheaper than alternatives which include hold luggage and recognise the importance of food, refreshments and entertainment on a long flight. While I expected the food situation, the menu should not be so expensive and the cost of the flight should reflect the lack of amenities like other budget airlines and the customer service should not quite be so sub-par. Unfortunately this was not the case and I ended up booking an overpriced poor service flight.

### "efficient and quick"
It was a typical European flight, operated by Germanwings. Check-in in Rome was efficient and quick with no waiting time at the desk. Due to a thunderstorm at STR the airport was closed which ended in a delay at Rome. We were informed about that at the airport, so everyone kept calm while waiting. Once on board, we still have to wait nearly one hour in the plane. The crew, esp. the captain kept us informed very often about the current situation at STR – so well done. The seat comfort was nothing special, but I never expect much when travelling across Europe. One thing I really have to complain about is the included meal in the Smart Tariff, the given sandwich was nearly inedible, very dry and without taste. Overall I would say that Eurowings is a good choice for travelling around Europe.

### "an extremely poor sandwich"
Cologne to Rome. They provide you with fancy packaging that contains an extremely poor sandwich. Legroom is fine, but I always pick the seats with more legroom. Friendliness of the cabin crew was poor. I was sleeping when they came with the beverages cart, when I woke up I was thirsty, so I walked to the cabin crew and asked for some water. I got told I could only buy some, but I didn't have enough coins, no euro bills in my pocket and you cannot pay with credit card for less than 5 EUR.

### "certainly isn't Lufthansa anymore"
Dusseldorf to London Heathrow. Flown as part of a trip to San Francisco. I asked the customer service on Facebook if we could use the late night check-in in Dusseldorf and I got two wrong answers. First of all they said there was no late night check-in, which was false and then they said I could use it for a flight to the USA. Wrong! US-authorities don't allow this we were told in Dusseldorf. Thank you Eurowings for not knowing the rules! Inflight experience was typical Eurowings : rather cold crew and a snack. On the inbound flight one of the stewardesses corrected a passenger in front of other passengers for changing a seat in an unpleasant way. Not necessary since it wasn't a problem and unacceptable behaviour from a crew member towards a customer in my opinion. Inbound last flight was delayed, which seems to become common practice with Eurowings. Great legroom in the Smart section though. All in all I would still recommend because of earlier experiences, but it certainly isn't Lufthansa anymore.

### "never intend flying them again"
Manchester to Valencia via Dusseldorf. Outward flight no problems, however, the return flight and the resulting complaints and lack of action descended into almost farce. On check in at Valencia we were informed of industrial action by French air traffic controillers and there would be a delay and a 10 euro food voucher was issued. We eventually boarded a flight to Dusseldorf unaware that we would be one of the last aircraft to land before the airport closed for their nightly curfew. On arrival at Dusselldorf we were treated well by the airport staff who made arrangements to leave on a 7am flight the following morning to Manchester and also found us a hotel for the night, top marks for airport staff, no help offered by Eurowings. On arrival at check in we were told we were not on the system but eventually it appeared we would be boarded and our bags were accepted, again airport staff gave us every assistance. The flight left on time but when the stewardess started distributiong the in flight snacks to the Eurowings SMART passengers (which we were) we were told our status had been downgraded but could not tell us why. Due to my condition I badly needed something to drink and it ended up with my wife having to plead with the stewardess for something, a bottle of water was grudgingly giiven. Because of our delay I had to make alternative arrangements to get hom from Manchestr. Shortly after outr arrival home I e-mailed Eurowings with receipts for my expenses etc. but apart from e-mailed promises and promises made by telephone no action appeared to be being taken! 7 weeks after our disastrous return flight I finally received almost all my expenses including the difference between the basic fare and the SMART fare we had paid for "as a gesture of goodwill" ?. There was no explanation of how this debale ocurred just a promise that the various departments had been informed. It would appear that Eurowing are only interested in taking you money and if anything untoward happens you are on your own and complaints are treated with contempt. Needless to say I never intend flying with them again.

### "is almost no customer service"
There is almost no customer service. My young children and I intended to fly from London Heathrow to Mallorca via Duesseldorf at the end of May. When it was clear that the delay to the first flight would mean we would miss our connecting one, I got fobbed off 3 times at Heathrow when asked to book another connecting flight. We didn't get coupons for a meal while waiting for the first flight. I couldn't rebook another flight on my own initiative as I had checked luggage. Don't worry, I was told, they will take care of you in Germany in any case. Well, there had been some weather issue and a security issue at a close by airport: there were at least 500 people in a queue for 2 customer service people. Back to front of hall and around food courts. People said they had been waiting for 5 hours and more. Some of them said I had to go back in to retrieve my luggage. Airport security and baggage then told us our bags were on their way out. Wait by gate 1. We followed up regularly with the baggage person, but by 10 pm, 5 hours later, no luggage. I took my kids to a hotel and by early the next morning flights I had booked myself as there was no one on phone or in person. My luggage was lost for nearly a week and each contact with the airline was time consuming, one agent was outright rude. Now 2 months later I have spent days trying to get the simple answer from the airline I need for travel insurance: reason for the delay. I have to put one star, but I would rather give none. It is still beyond my imagination how a German airline gets away with this.

### "a bad off shoot of Lufthansa"
Eurowings is habitually late. I arrived at MAN for the last flight to find the flight cancelled and - surprise - the next morning also cancelled. So that says they used the planes on busy holiday routes The Eurowings desk is called AGENNY so you have to find that and the girl who is usually on doing gate could not book me onto LH as well that cost them more. So it was next day and that took 24 hours on my schedule. I applied for compensation and the response time to the enquiry is 5 weeks! The is a bad off shoot of Lufthansa. It’s not easyJet and it’s not Lufthansa so its lies in the middle with mediocre service – they have served the same sandwich offering since they launched.

### "such a chaotic airline"
I am a frequent flyer but I have never experienced such a chaotic airline. Flight was from Cologne to Stockholm. We were waiting at the gate for boarding, nothing was indicating that the flight would be delayed except for the missing aircraft in front of the window. Ten minutes after scheduled boarding time an airline employee showed up to inform us that the flight would be delayed for about two hours and that the gate had changed. Then the employee rushed away without answering questions or explaining the delay. The monitors at the airport did not indicate anything, the flight just disappeared from all screens. Other staff that we asked did not have any clue when or where the flight would depart. Two hours and two gate changes later we finally departed but our parking position in Stockholm was occupied because of the delay and we waited another 45 minutes on the tarmac at the destination until we were able to deplane. Never again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Dusseldorf to Moscow via Berlin. I just went through the worst logistical nightmare while checking in for my Eurowings flight from Düsseldorf to Moscow on Eurowings. (July 27, 2016). I live in USA and was visiting my husband in Germany and then flying to Russia to visit my mom for two weeks. I was 26 weeks pregnant and my doctor had no issues with me traveling. I did not cover my pregnant belly (huge mistake!!) and was asked for a 'Mother's Pass'. I explained to them that my doctor in Texas approved my travel and that we do not have special mother's passes. The lady at check in called her boss who came to talk to me and proceeded to explain that all pregnant women in Europe are supposed to have a mother's pass from their doctor. It's the law. I pulled up my online medical records and sonogram to prove how many weeks I was but it was not enough. He insisted on mother's pass. Of course I tried to argue with him and he told my husband that I was slow in the head and he preferred to talk to him instead! That comment annoyed even more. They denied me getting on the plane and sent me to a different section of the airport to rebook the flight. Turns out all flight were booked for the next three days and my ticket was non refundable. And my mom was already on her way to Moscow to meet me! (She lives 6 hours away from Moscow by train). I was devastated but refused to take no for an answer. It was 30 minutes before departure, and I thought what do I have to lose? So I put on a very loose cardigan that completely covers the belly and decided to go through the same check in just go to a different desk. The most important thing was not to run into the manager who called me stupid and not be noticed by the lady who checked me in originally. I was lucky and it worked this time! They did not ask me for mother's pass since I covered myself. I went through security, got on the last shuttle to the plane, and just as I was taking a deep sigh of relief an airport official walked in right before the shuttle left and asked me if I was the one pregnant. So I had to get off the shuttle and be interrogated again at the gate, this time by three people. After pleading with them and shedding a few tears, one of them asked about my due date. I told her November (three months away) and she laughed and said I was good to go! To make things worse they lost my baggage and it has been 4 days now and no bag yet. I will never fly this airline again.

### "delays seem to be normal"
I flew from Barcelona to Berlin for a weekend with Eurowings and the plane was 4.5 hours late. The return flight was 4 hours delayed. I don't know what is happening with this company but lately, from what I've read, such delays seem to be normal. We were kept informed by sms and email about the growing delay, but no food was given to us. Only a free drink onboard. Reason for the delays was that the plane arrived already delayed from previous flights. I've always travelled with low cost, but had never experienced such great waitting times. For a weekend trip to spend +10 hours in airports is really frustrating.

### "missed my connection"
Eurowings flight from Newcastle to Düsseldorf. Was delayed 2 hours so I missed my connection with LH. The main problem I had was no information on the ground at NCL and ground staff very rude. I have to say the same about the cabin crew on this flight. Also stuck on the tarmac for 45 mins due to the fact that we missed our slot. At least LH helped me (they where excellent).

### "crew were polite and attentive"
Cheap ticket at only £229 including luggage one way so was not expecting much. Eurowings flight was on time and arrived early into Bangkok. Boarding was not made clear as only announcement in German and the flight had multiple nationalities on board from Europe and the UK. Aircraft was clean and crew were polite and attentive. For the price of the ticket this was as a bargain and met all my expectations. However in view of the cheap seat which means higher load factors the seat pitch is very tight and your backside will know you have done an 11 hour flight. Also as expected you will need to pay for any films which are on offer through the IFE.

### "poor service and communication"
Dubai to Koln-Bonn with Eurowings. Poor service and communication. 19 hrs delay at Dubai airport for no apparent reason? Not the delay was the worst problem but the lack of communication. Nobody is available for comment or help. Staff is nowhere to find at the airport.

### "seat was typical Lufthansa"
I flew with a Eurowings flight from Milan to Stuttgart operated by A319. The seat was typical Lufthansa with an ok legroom for a 190cm man, the food was okay - they give you a sandwich a 0.2 litre bottle of water and a cranberry biscuit. The cabin crew wasn't the friendliest but still ok!

### "service wasn't bad"
I booked a flight with Eurowings (my first time) from Stuttgart to Thessaloniki. I found out that the flight was being operated by a Germanwings Airbus 319-100 which was 16.4 years old. The interior was quite pleasant being a standard Lufthansa seat. I booked a Smart Ticket and for that you get a free meal (sandwich + 0.2 litre bottle of water) and a free other drink. The legroom was ok for a 190cm man (6.3 foot) and the service wasn't bad.

### "fall below quite low expectations"
Tried to fly Hamburg to Colgone on June 6. The 7.00 flight was boarding at 10.00 when I arrived at departure area for flight at 10.25, while 9.00 flight was cancelled altogether. A few moments later, departure time delayed from 10.25 to 13.00. Rude male gate agent told people to move to ticket counter for changes. So went back to the office. Next try June 8. Outbound flight fortunately uneventful. Return boarding pass showed 14.45 boarding time for 15.45 flight (internet said an A330 was going to be used, explaining the early boarding time). Showed up at gate at 14.45 but no aircraft, no gate agent, no info on screens. Recognisably indifferent gate agent later re-issued boarding pass twice. Finally boarded an A319 at 16.00, found seat in extra-narrow back of cabin, and took off 40 minutes late. This operation seems to regularly fall below quite low expectations and should be avoided (which is easier said than done though as on some domestic routes the only other option is taking the train which does not work if you have an early appointment).

### "attendant not friendly or helpful"
Dusseldorf to London Heathrow with Eurowings. My seat was booked twice. I took it first and for an undisclosed reason a flight attendant rudely asked me to leave the booked seat and go search myself for available one. I did not hear a single 'sorry' for the error the airline made. Flight attendant was not friendly or helpful at all.

### "worst companies I've travelled"
Berlin to Phuket via Cologne with Eurowings - the flight to Phuket operated by SunExpress. One of the worst companies I've traveled. You have to pay for everything, so that makes your flight no cheaper than other better companies. I paid for a service that I didn't get, and when I ask about this service they didn't know anything about it. I paid also for 2 meals - the first one was ok, but the second one was just a half sandwich and bottle of water.

### "delay seemed to be quite normal"
Paris CDG to Berlin Tegal, and one of the worst experiences I have had with an airline for a short distance trip. I flew with Eurowings three times within 4 days. Each of the three times the flight was delayed and arrived from 30 min to 1h late. I found the crew disorganized and we way too much time in boarding. In general, we got very few information about the delay as it seemed to be quite normal for the staff.

### "last 3 journeys were late"
I have used Germanwings and Eurowings between Cologne/Düsseldorf to London STN/LHR in the last 16 months. I am not sure it is by pure chance the last 3 journeys by Eurowings were late by 1 to nearly 3 hours. The airline is not a cheap option when compared to Ryanair and Easyjet.

### "efficient and inexpensive"
Dusseldorf to Basel, an on time performance and only 55 mins flying time. CRJ900 is a comfortable plane, due to ample leg room. I don't get the deboarding logic at Basel airport. Like Geneva this airport has stand alone gates, with an underground connection to the main terminal, but it wasn't used. Instead,  we boarded a bus and drove to the other side of the gate building and got off the bus there. Still had to walk a long way to the exit. Eurowings however proved to be efficient and inexpensive.

### "service was very friendly"
First time flying with Eurowings and it was not a bad flight at all from Vienna to Barcelona. The flight was on time and the service was very friendly. Surprisingly the leg space was much more than expected. The flight wasn't busy at all, I would say it was not even half full.

### "luggage was kept by the airline"
Our Eurowings flight from Vienna to Stansted was cancelled after a 6 hour wait. We were rebooked onto a flight 24 hours later and our luggage was kept by the airline. We' includes my 2 year old and 6 month old sons. When we arrived the next day at the airport, after another 2.5 hour delay we flew, our suitcases did not. It took 2 days for us to get our suitcases delivered and that was this evening. Only one of the suitcases was ours. Eurowings continue to refuse to help in any way and say they will only get involved 5 days after the suitcases go missing. Our holiday is only 6 days long and it was for my mum's 60th. We didn't have her presents for the day, I don't have my babies eczema cream or any of the home comforts that my children need.

### "very enjoyable flights"
Stansted to Cologne Bonn return. Very enjoyable flights out and back with Eurowings. The seating was very comfortable and there was plenty of leg room. Even a snack with coffee was included. Both flights took off and arrived on time. I won't hesitate to use them again in the future.

### "will not use again"
Bangkok to Cologne with Eurowings, and only find out that you won't get food until you check in for the flight. This is a 13 hour flight. At check in they tell you you can buy a meal on the flight. When you are in the flight you may be told there is no meal available. Great, no food for 13 hours. To get a blanket you have to pay 6 euros. Entertainment system is very limited. Cup of tea costs 2,50 euros. Not possible to pay in another currency. Stewards speak German but weren't friendly nor helpful. Will not use again.

### "experience was very positive"
London Heathrow to Hamburg return. I wanted to visit my friends in Hamburg for the New Year and flights were only available on Eurowings to suit my needs. I was pleasantly surprised that my experience was very positive on both legs of my journey, and have no complaints. Refreshments onboard are cheaper than other airlines.

### "service onboard was ok"
I booked this flight from STR to RLG with Eurowings to avoid being effected by the Lufthansa strike. Check In was efficient, staff were nice. Lufthansa Lounge experience was rather sad due to the poor selection of food. The buffet really needed restocking. No bathroom in the lounge. There was no priority boarding at the gate which surprised me but I didn't mind. The service onboard was ok though it's nothing like Lufthansa Business Class. Seats are the same as LH and ok for such a short flight. I wouldn't want to sit on them for more then 3h. Food quality was awful. I opted for a cheese sandwich with the weirdest texture I have ever tasted. It felt more like chewing gum than a sandwich. In comparison SAS does a much better job its Economy Plus fare where one gets better quality food. Flight was on time. Sadly no priority luggage. Would I book Eurowings/Germanwings again? Only if I have to.

### "Worst tasting sandwich"
Vienna to Barcelona on Eurowings. Internet check in was a challange. OS Ticket allows not check in at OS home page. Trial on Germanwings/Eurowings works only with the additional Eurowing booking code. Baggade drop off at OS counter! Lufthansa group is disarranged with Eurowings. The Miles&More booking was not possible, despite booking information on OS ticket purchase? New A320 with winglets. Slightly delayed. Seat comfort acceptable cabin looks clean. Staff was okay but no highlight. The Snack on “Smart” seat was the worst tasting sandwich in the last 5 years of my flights.

### "think twice before flying again"
Our outward Eurowings flight was 30 mins late taking off, and the return was 45 mins late taking off. I found the booking a seat not user friendly, and booking the return flights on the morning of our return flight, also not user friendly. I was able to book a seat on a flight I had already taken, I was unable to book seats within the price of my ticket and therefore had to pay £18 per person (6 persons). So Eurowiings not a good experience and will think twice before flying again.

### "not full which added to comfort"
Germanwings flight number but Eurowings plane. Almost one hour delay because of late incoming plane. Appologies but I think airlines should offer water, tea or coffee free on board in case of a delay. Plane was only one third full, which added to comfort. Normally the A320s from Euro/Germanwing don't have comfortable seats and legroom. With 49 CHF a good price.

### "this was a nice flight"
I don't get how Eurowings manages to delay boarding of the first flight of the day. Both plane and passengers are present, so I don't see the problem. Otherwise this was a nice flight. Just bought the basic seat for 49 euros, which is a great deal. Easy to use app with mobile boarding pass. Flight had Germanwings flight number but was operated by Eurowings - which will be the future operating name for Germanwings.

This was supposed to be a flight on Germanwings from Hamburg to Oslo. I had booked 2 flights on Germanwings. The first was from Budapest to Hamburg, the second from Hamburg to Oslo after a hotel stay overnight in Hamburg. I booked and paid for one suitcase to be checked in on both flights. I did retrieve my suitcase after the BUD-HAM flight as I needed it in the Hotel. It was 2 separate flights on "Germanwings". I did not know anything about "Eurowings". When the bus that took us from the gate at Hamburg to the plane I saw it was marked "Eurowings". Of course I asked if I was on the correct plane and was assured it was. After we were in the air a short time, I was asked if I wanted anything by a member of the crew, I only asked for a glass of water and was told it would be 3 Euro. Not a bottle of water, a glass poured out of a large bottle. I guess this is the new craze of overcharging for everything on LCCs. But I really knew I had been traveling on a inferior airline when my luggage did not show up in Oslo. It had been left behind in Hamburg. Even Eurowings did not handle the missing bag. It was done by SAS ground handlers in Oslo and done very well. Thanks to SAS I did get my suitcase back all the way to my Florida home.

AMS-HAM-AMS. Very unpleasant experience AMS-HAM got cancelled due technical issues so I was put on their next flight which departed 3 hours later. Once en-route service was good though. Return flight 8 days later was delayed by 1 hour then got cancelled as well again technical reasons. This was the last flight of the day so I was offered a hotel. Instead I requested to be put on the Lufthansa HAM-DUS flight as AMS and DUS were about the same distance by car from my final destination. This was granted and all in all the delay was under 2 hours which is considering the situation not even that bad. LH was one of my preferred airlines but after this round-trip my confidence in reliability of LH (which Eurowings operated this flight for) is lost.

Kiev - Dusseldorf on May 20 2013. Ground staff extremely unfriendly and uncoordinated started boarding before the aircraft was ready so that we had to wait 20 minutes in the bus with no air-conditioning or ventilation where it was very hot. Very uncomfortable seats with no much legroom. Staff on board also not very friendly and did not announce the temperature and time at arrival. Nevertheless we managed to arrive almost on time.

DUS-MAD in class S (economy) in seat 11C. Duration: 2 hours. I was very surprised with the service and comfort on board because we flew in a CRJ-9000. My regulation sized cabin baggage only just fit inside. It was an early morning flight and a breakfast of scrambled eggs spinach and potato cubes was served together with orange juice and a biscuit - all in all pretty good for economy class on such a small aircraft. Comfortable flight overall with two rounds of drinks service. Excellent landing. All in all an excellent flight.

MAN-HAM-MAN. Early morning flight out on Canadair Regional Jet 900. Boarded on time and arrived on time late departure due to airport delays rather than airline tardiness. Service was good and breakfast snack and drink sufficient for short flight. Similar on the way back with delays getting to the runway at Hamburg airport. Baggage arrived OK at both airports in short space of time.

HAM-MXP: An early morning flight to Milan on Canadair Regional Jet 900. Passengers greeted by friendly but distant cabin crew. I managed to get a seat just behind Business class. Leg room in economy class was horrible I am 188 cms and barely fit in. Being an early morning flight they handed us a raisin bread roll and drinks for 90 mins flight which was shameful considering that it is Lufthansa co-operated flight. After snack round cabin crew was no were to be seen until landing. I don't think I am opting for Eurowings again.

DUS-MXP after flying in with Lufthansa from Chicago. Departure on time luggage correctly transferred from the Chicago flight very clean CRJ 200 very smooth flight professional crew landed in Milan ahead of time.

### Eurowings customer review
Flight on time to Milan Malpensa. Everybody got a little bread with Chicken or Cheese a candybar and something to drink. But the 2 stewardesses were quite grumpy towards passengers. CRJ 200 plane was quite narrow inside and the seat wasn`t big either.

### Eurowings customer review
Despite Eurowings getting a bad press since their takeover by Lufthansa this Canadair jet breakfast flight had more than enough service to permit me to skip lunch in Cologne later.

### Eurowings customer review
Dreadful. I fly frequently between Bristol and Frankfurt where unfortunately there is no other choice of operator for this route. Lufthansa/Eurowings took over this route approximately 18 months ago and I have flown around 10 times. Every single one of flights has been blighted with a problem ranging from serious (emergency divert to Heathrow due to mechanical failure of the aircraft) to trivial but highly irritating (about 70% of my bookings from Frankfurt fail to appear on the e-Tix system). I would not recommend Eurowings to anyone and if an alternative carrier is available (and even if you have to pay a little extra) avoid the pain and fly with them instead.

I flew from Frankfurt to Nurmburg during Winter break. My flight to Nurmberg on Eurowings was smooth and quick. There isn't much room on this plane but for a short flight (half an hour) it was fine. Returning to Frankfurt I flew in a snowstorm. I was a bit nervous but the flight was smooth too.

BER to LCY BAE146 - great airline on time departure from Berlin and surprisingly quick flight to London. Aircraft was comfortable and clean and the cabin crew were polite and efficient. Overall a pleasant experience and we would fly Eurowings again.

### Eurowings customer review
WAW-DUS-WAW. Both flights were delayed and operated on Canadiar CRJ-200. The machines seemed to be quite old ones. The staff were friendly and helpful but all of the were chewing gums while providing services or demonstrating safety procedures.

DUS-TLS-DUS. Lufthansa Regional flight operated by Eurowings - overall very pleasant experience nice leather nice small aircradt (CRJ-200) with 50 seat not even half full. Free inflight service including cold + hot drinks (alcohol as well) sandwich and Mars chocolate bar. Crew was friendly except they only showed up once to serve drinks.

### Eurowings customer review
DUS-HAM. Efficient boarding at Dusseldorf. Y Class about half full. FAs were upbeat and professional - seemed to enjoy their job. Each passenger was greeted on boarding. A drinks service was conducted soon after take off. BAE 146 would have been a little cramped if full and was showing its age. All announcements including that of the pilot were made in both English and German despite it being a domestic flight. Overall it was a very brief but enjoyable experience and very good value for the price I paid.

FRA-HAJ on a BAe 146. Comfortable and pleasant despite being full. This is the high standard that some other airlines should aspire to. Simple effective efficient and quietly professional.

FRA-NUE roundtrip in economy. Not exactly a horror story but not great either. Food & magazines were only offered to first class passengers which meant FA on outbound flight never walked past row 7. Too bad we were in row 8! No service offered whatsoever to people in economy. On the return flight we were forbidden from using the overhead bins or the lavoratory - or as the FA said "It's only 40 minutes- hold it! Overall this FA seemed ready to retire- no facial expression very unfriendly. At least I had a window seat. BAe 146/Avro RJ85 aircraft dated but comfortable. No IFE whatsoever not even a magazine for economy class. Frankly Deutsche Bahn provides better service for the price and I would much rather ride the train rather than suffer through another Eurowings flight.

Always late. Took frequently on the route Belgrade Serbia-Munich Germany (BEG-MUC) and they were never on time (out of 10+ flights) - of coursing causing missed connections. They either did not excuse or lied (e.g. blaming heavy snow and congestion in Munich - but after showing to the crew on board an on-line web flight information from Munich airport with 95% flights on time they did not bother to find another excuse or apologize). Service generally nice food decent. I addressed several complaints for repeating delays to headquarters and have not received any reply or compensation. This cannot be higher than 1.5 star.

FRA-TRN On four occasions that I have flown with them one was delayed for an hour because of instrument malfunction. Flap warning light. The second flight was cancelled because of instrument malfunction. The compass did not work. Fifty minute wait on board while the technicians worked then another attempt at departure which failed. No assistance from FA's just a twenty minute wait on board for the bus that took us back to the terminal. It seems that instrument malfunction is plagueing EW recently.

BHX-FRA on a Bae 146 under Lufthansa code sharing - an enjoyable experience. Flight delayed 45 minutes with an apology but no explanation. This meant we missed our connecting flight to Vienna but the transfer desk at FRA organised seats on the next flight one hour later with no fuss. The seats were comfortable leather with excellent legroom and FAs pleasant and efficient. Usual sandwich supplied which was tasty and good choice of hot/cold drinks.

BHX-FRA on a BAE 146. Generally good flight on time. BAE 146 slow and seats very narrow. A 3-3 configuration on this type is ridiculous. If the middle seat is occupied it is very cramped. Legroom is adequate though. Usual service of a small cheese sandwich and a drink perfectly adequate. Staff friendly. Seatbelt light stayed on for the entire flight for no apparent reason but people ignored it. Parked at a remote stand at FRA which involves busing. Overall good. It beats driving to Heathrow or Gatwick if you live in the Midlands and you fly to the real Frankfurt not an airfield 100 miles away. Cheaper than Ryanair too.

ZRH-TXL in Y. Swiss/Lufthansa sharecode flight operated by Eurowings in a BAe 146. Friendly crew enough legroom. Lufthansa catering which on the way to TXL consisted of a triangular dry inedible Sandwich out of a paper box. On the way back a much better bread roll. TXL-ZRH with a two hours delay. Explanation given: The technician called to fix a problem that came up during the flight check had been stuck for an hour at the airport-security. Hard to say whether it was true or an excuse. Would use them again if the prize is competitive.

I have recently flown with Eurowings on a Lufthansa flight from Paris CDG to Munich. The flight crew was professional and appearance very smart. The service was good as flight was only about 50% full. The BAe 146-300 aircraft clean and comfortable.

Wonderful small airline. Flew with them as a Lufthansa codeshare flight Frankfurt - Friedrichshafen and return on a BAE146-200. The service on board was the same as on a regular Lufthansa flight but the fa's were even more pleasant and it seemed as if they really love their job. Both flights left and arrived on time an I would fly with them in the future without hesitation although there is less space on a Bae as on board a B737 or A320 but it's more than enough for 40 minutes in the air.
