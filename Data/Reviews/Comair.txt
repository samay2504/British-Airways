### "Really bad airline"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Comair cancelled my flight because of the coronavirus outbreak in South Africa. They did not want to refund the amount or give me the option of a voucher or another flight in the future. Totally unfair. Really bad airline.

### "Online check in is archaic"
Cape Town to Durban with Comair / British Airways. Check in process is pathetically slow. Long queues and no process to call passengers for earlier flights. Entitled passengers who jump queues because they are more important than you. Arrived Over an hour early and waited over half an hour before being checked in. Electronic checkin at the airport did not work either. Online check in is archaic. Does not even have a link to Stocard on iPhones. Being a foreigner it’s no use sending to my mobile number as I’m not on roaming. Past that the security process took another 15 minutes which made us literally run to the gate. Not a pleasant process. Learn something from overseas airlines on how to get passengers through an airport. It’s not like the airport is even remotely busy!

### "Overall, a decent flight"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. The SLOW lounge in the Cape Town  domestic terminal is a maelstrom of activity around lunchtime, but at least there's an impressive spread of food. Boarding was the now usual queuing on the ramp and airbridge, but passengers were sensibly allowed on at both ends of the plane. Service was efficient although lacking BA's homegrown friendliness. The Comair "four-course meal" was adequate but not up to the best that Club Europe offers. A late departure was compensated for along the way and our bags were more-or-less first off the carousel. Overall, a decent flight.

### "Overall, a decent flight"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Cape Town . The SLOW lounge at JNB sets the standard, with an impressive array of food - even at 11 am - and ample seating. The bar service is good, too, and some neighbours had already finished their third refill of pink champagne by the time they boarded the same flight. As is common on other BA flights, Group 1 passengers were kept waiting on the airbridge before boarding actually commenced. Service on board was friendly and efficient, but very much old school BA as far as the “four-course lunch” was concerned. At least one was able to see the main course before choosing it. Departure and arrival were pretty much on schedule and baggage collection was speedy, too. Overall, a decent flight.

### "A relatively smooth flight"
Durban to Cape Town with Comair. This is a 2 hour flight which was full. The business class seats were the same as economy but with a little extra legroom and the middle seat was empty. The FA's were mature and friendly. There was a full bar service and light lunch was served. The aircraft was clean, left on time and arrived on time. A relatively smooth flight, unlike BA they serve refreshments and full bar service on this short haul domestic flight.

### "ten minutes past check in time"
Not Verified |  Durban to Port Elizabeth. The night before my flight I was emailed and told to check in, which I tried to do, and was told that there was a problem and I would need to check in at the airport. I left two hours in advance for a one hour trip to the airport and on the way encountered a minor traffic problem. On arrival at the airport I was ten minutes past check in time. The person at check in asked about my bag and I said that I did not need to check it in. She then phoned through to boarding I assume, and without any attempt to convince the lady on the other end, in any way, simply said No it's closed. You can't get on the flight. The lady on check in was extremely unsympathetic, lacking in interpersonal skills for a job of this nature. No apologies, not "I am so sorry I cannot help you, try one of the other airlines". She simply said everyone else got here in time. I was beyond annoyed with this very poor and completely unacceptable customer service. I then proceeded to Safair who were able to help me, at a cost of R1300. What made me even more furious, was in the time that I bought another ticket, went through security and then bought coffee, flight BA6323 was still on the tarmac! What was the impact of me being a few minutes late - how did this interfere with your departure? Sorry, this is beyond ridiculous. I will never recommend Comair, and you would do well to advise your staff about working on their interpersonal skills.

### "rude flight attendants"
Upon recent travel from Durban to Johannesburg on Sunday 14th July 2019 it is  disappointing to find that we were welcomed aboard by rude flight attendants.

### "Well done on customer service"
Flight BA6314 Durban to Cape Town was a disaster, plane had technical issues and we were not able to use that plane. I was informed visa a phone call from BA while on the way to the airport that there would be no Business Class on the new chartered flight. I'm not a snob, but it was a surprise gift for my 74 year old mother. Long story short, we flew on Global Air a chartered plane from JNB. It was late and cramped but comfortable enough, and staff very attentive. We were offered ZAR1000 flight voucher as compensation for no Business class. The difference between the two classes was ZAR3000 each per ticket. Upon return I emailed Comair and was very expertly helped by David who did some bartering regarding refunds. At the end of the day I was given a ZAR6000 Kulula/Comair voucher to be used for 1 year as compensation. Well done on customer service and well handled by all involved.

### "efficient and personable"
Thoroughly workmanlike return flights, Johannesburg to Cape Town. Cabin crew were efficient and personable. Seats 1A/C had adequate leg room. Food was adequate and it was helpful to see the three main courses before choosing one. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule.

### "flight itself was unremarkable"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Club check-in for our Comair flight to JNB couldn’t have been more unfriendly and the agent failed to mention the SLOW lounge. We let her ticket our luggage through to LHR, without collecting it at JNB, as she said it would work. Well, we’ll see. The lounge was frenetic, although food and drink were plentiful. The 737-800 was a new model, although Club seating was the usual Club Europe arrangement. Departure was delayed by 60 minutes, but that still left two hours for transfer on to the BA LHR flight. The flight itself was unremarkable and we made up some time. Cabin crew seemed efficient and had a sense of humour. Not at all bad, really - assuming our luggage catches up with us.

### "lounge was quiet and relaxing"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. Comair is a franchise operation of British Airways and the JNB - CPT route is particularly busy. We made use of the BidAir concierge service to speed us through immigration and baggage collection to connect with the Comair service. The SLOW lounge was quiet and relaxing, with a really impressive array of food. Seating in business class was identical to Club Europe, but seats in row 1 are more freely available to non gold card executive club members. Unlike BA's new short haul service, food is served across all classes. However, the food served in Comair's business class is inferior to that in new (Do & Co) Club Europe. Communication from the flight deck was efficient as ever and we arrived slightly ahead of schedule.

### "a year chasing the refund"
It will soon be a year since we travelled with Comair from Zimbabwe to South Africa. But the plane was not in Zimbabwe that day and we were driven by bus to Zambia to catch it. Notwithstanding the fact that the flight was delayed by more than 3 hours because of that, it will soon be a year since we are chasing the refund that was promised by Comair that day. To cross the Zambian border you need a visa that costs 50 US$ per person. But Comair ground staff did confirm that that will be refunded. A year now that "the refund is on its way", "the system is down", "we don't have your flight details", "can you let us know the date", "can we see a copy of the visa", "we don't have your bank details" and so on, the answers are always coming. But not the refund. The amount we are chasing is not that high but be sure that if you were to ask for a refund it would be your day. Last but not least : flight often have a British Airways BA number but when you have a problem, don't even think of asking BA for support. Deal with Comair" is the only answer. So be careful.

### "refused to accept any responsibility"
Has anyone experienced a Comair cancellation? We did - from JNB to WDH in Namibia. We booked the flight through BA in the UK and BA couldn't care less, even though it's sold as a BA flight. They have refused to accept any responsibility. For all flights in or out of the EU BA would be liable for compensation, but they refuse to behave with any sort of honour - you just can't trust them. Comair were hopeless at Joburg, management refused to come and talk to the passengers. Comair staff gave us incorrect details of how to complain. Comair of course don't even have the courtesy to respond to e-mails once we had found out the right one to use. Be warned, this airline is a disgrace.

### "disappointed with the experience"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. I would like to lodge a complaint as I was very disappointed with the whole experience. The flight was delayed, we were at the gate on time and there were no announcements or updates made. Instead the staff just chatted amongst each other saying they don’t know when we will be able to board. Almost 45 min later we boarded, I have two small children (2 years and 5 years) and a pram but we had to stand in the queue. No courtesy and consideration was given that parents with young kids and old people should be allowed to board after business class. I have travelled many airlines with my kids and all airlines give courtesy and assistance when travelling with kids. The aircraft was unclean, chewing gum on armrest and dirt in the magazine pocket. After landing in Cape Town we received our pram back which was returned scratched and the agent that booked us in Johannesburg OR Tambo airport did not tag one of our bags. It was the bag with my 2 year olds clothing, medication and vanity. The Agent we spoke to was very helpful and was the only positive part of flying British Airways. The incompetence of not tagging our bag and possibly not finding it and finding it only after a few days caused a huge inconvenience. The bag was found 6 hours later, despite it being returned it was my toddlers things and I had to go right away to purchase all new things as we were on holiday in Cape Town for a week only and I couldn’t wait for possibly a few days or not finding it at all. 2 weeks later after many emails I received an email that I have accepted the terms and conditions when purchasing the ticket and hence theres not much they can do expect give me a lousy R250.

### "an enjoyable experience"
Myself and my partner flew from Port Elizabeth to Durban on Tuesday 7th November. Departure time was 13:20 and flight time was roughly an hour. Boarding was prompt and hassle-free. There was plenty of space in the overhead lockers so no fighting for space for luggage. The pilot gave good information and kept us in the know regarding timing and weather etc. Having flown a few times within South Africa with Comair it is most of the time an enjoyable experience, the cabin crew are polite and I've never experienced a delay/cancellation. One thing that does grate on me with Comair is the age of their aircraft - it is not a nice place to sit. The seats are weathered and the interior of the cabin is really old.

### "Pleasant experience "
BA6416 from Cape Town to Johannesburg. Pleasant crew served tasty chicken mayo sandwich and complimentary drinks. Return flight was okayish, crew served delicious scrambled egg, bacon + chakalaka spicy sauce breakfast with yoghurt, juice and tea/coffee. Alternative choice was spinach and mozzarella pancake. Pleasant experience on short-haul domestic.

### "inflight service is very good"
Johannesburg to Cape Town on British Airways marketed flight operated by Comair. Check in at Terminal B quick and polite as was security, visited the domestic Slow Lounge which is very good with lots of food & drink options. Boarded on time through gate D2 on to a decent clean 737-800 seated in 1A which was comfortable drinks offered prior to take off, departed on time once airborne service was very good food was okay a full breakfast served.. Managed 40 minutes sleep before decent.. Landed around 10 minutes early on to a bridge baggage off the belt quickly.. I travelled with Comair 3 times over the previous week and find that both ground and inflight service is very good.

### "great service and good food"
Johannesburg to Windhoek return. Checked in at terminal B domestic (British Airways SA) however the flight departs from Terminal A which is about a 10 minute walk away, security was okay immigration a little slow. These flights are operated by Comair but marketed as a British Airways franchise service. Used the Slow lounge which is very good with a good food & drink selection coffee bar and food to order if required.. Boarding from A25 on to a bus. Aircraft a pretty old 737-400 but clean and tidy seat 2A offers lots of space a similar lay out to BA European flights.. Departed on time once in the air service from a nice crew was very good food & drinks pretty good. I was the only pax in business class so very nice experience. Arrival on time however the dreadfully slow immigration at WDH lasted 2 hours with a huge que from 3 arriving flights. Return check in was polite and quick however security & immigration was rude and an absolute shambles! Not the airlines fault. Used the local lounge which was quiet but offered nothing. No wifi either. Boarded the aircraft from gate 2 a short walk to the steps. Departed around 30 minutes late again an old but well kept 737-400 seat 1A offered enough space for this 2hr flight. A full cabin this time but great service and good food offering. Pretty relaxing flight.

### "whole experience has dropped"
Seems the whole experience has dropped from what Comair / British Airways stood for and used to deliver. Could not hear the announcements made. Several passengers commented on this. The staff ignore you as you enter from the mid section of the plane, not making eye contact and looks like it has been a late night and that the passengers are now intruding on their morning hangover. The young lady said move that bag there in front and shuffled off. I do find the local cabin crew miserable and unhappy in their jobs. There was one female cabin attendant that was smiling and showed real enjoyment and happiness for her job. I was not offered any drinks and was skipped. Could have asked but they are so disorganised and muserable serving  that I felt I could go without it. After being a loyal BA customer for 30 years, I think it is time to move on.

### "excellent flight overall"
Excellent flight overall from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg. Boarding at Port Elizabeth was quick and efficient and we departed before schedule, also arriving about 10 minutes early. Plane half full and no one sitting in the middle seat next to me so had the window for myself. Got served a light snack of meat pie (vegetarian option was finished, but irrelevant to me) and a drink. Only Comair and SAA who still serve complimentary snacks in economy class in South Africa. Landing was smooth and baggage reclaim quick. Definitely enjoy flying with Comair.

### "overall reasonable product"
Johannesburg to Durban return on Comair (British Airways franchise). Check in and bad drop at JNB took ages. Staff at counters slow and could not care less. Security was a breeze. Slow Lounge had good selection of food and drink but was overcrowded on a Friday evening. Departure delayed at the 11th hour and flight left over an hour late. Flight operated by a very old Boeing 737-400. Smooth flight. Good crew. Bags out fast at DUR. Return check in fast at DUR. Slow lounge at DUR much better presented. Return flight left on time. Crew on flight some what indifferent. Flight arrived on time into JNB and bag outs fast. Overall reasonable product.

### "most unreliable airline"
Johannesburg to Durban. British Airways (Comair) are going all out to prove themselves as the most unreliable airline. Yet another delay - this time because the plane is still being serviced. I understand technical problems, but services are scheduled and should not become my problem impacting on a full day of meetings scheduled for my destination city. Back to SAA!

### "a bit underwhelmed"
Victoria Falls to Johannesburg, first time on Comair and a bit underwhelmed. Flight was full and FA's served a sandwich and drinks but seemed bored. Aircraft was a Boeing 737-400 showing its age. Flight left and arrived on time so no complaints for that. Would I use them again, yes only if I have to.

### "a really nice experience"
Cape Town to Port Elizabeth via Johannesburg. First time using Comair domestically in South Africa, marketed as British Airways. Check in at CPT quick and easy using my BA frequent flier status I was offered lounge access at the 'Slow Lounge' which I must say is pretty good. Flight boarded on time, a new Boeing 737-800, crew very polite and seating good with space, a snack served on the 1 hr 50 min flight! Bags off quickly on landing. JNB-PLZ check in again very quick and  polite again offered the use of the Slow Lounge which is one of the best I've been in. Boarding on to a pretty old 737-400, not full so lots of room the aircraft kept clean and looked in good shape a small hot meal offered by a nice crew. Departed and arrived on time, a really nice experience on both flights.

### "luggage was damaged"
Johannesburg to Cape Town with Comair. Our row on the flight was skipped when dinner was served and when it was brought to the cabin controller attention, it was already time for us to make our descend. I was famished and exhausted when I arrived home shortly before 10pm. Only to discover my luggage was damaged when the lock was forcefully removed. Not only did the person forcefully remove a combination lock and break my luggage zip in process, but he/she had the audacity to take an intimate item. The call center for baggage claims and lost / damaged property was also clueless and I've been the one to contact them the whole time, while they don't even have the decency to confirm receipt of my mail or contact me to tell me that they'll look into the matter or what the next steps would be for me to take. With the lack of service and bad experience I had on this flight, never again would I book for myself or anyone else.

### "would try to avoid this airline"
I had high expectation as Comair flies under the banner of British Airways and considers itself a full-service airline. Reality was different. Cramped seats, very dirty cabin, the staff were the unfriendliest I have experienced, perhaps they had just a bad day but they seemed not to be smiling at all. Food was average. Forgot a picture onboard which was fortunately handed over to me later, thank you for that. If possible I would try to avoid this airline and go for Kulula or South African Airways.

### "unable to check in online"
Victoria Falls to Johannesburg with Comair, and booked business class because economy full. The biggest gripe is that I was unable to check in online for return journey. As a result, there was total chaos at airport. Long queues are very poor in this day and age,

### Comair customer review
BA operated by Comair is my preferred airline - they always offer customer service above the state owned alternative. Except that yesterday I noticed the counter customer service was despairingly absent at JNB. I have made my best efforts to inform them of this.

### Comair customer review
I recently took four Comair (British Airways) flights in Zimbabwe and South Africa. While the aircraft appeared a little tired, I was impressed with the business class cabin service, catering was good for the series of short flights undertaken and seemed on a par with short-haul Qantas 737-800 international service. If requesting a seat during the booking process, I recommend selecting 1 D E or F. While there are three seats on this side of the aircraft rarely is the middle seat used. These seats are exit row and can, depending on the aircraft configuration, have up to almost a metre of legroom. All Business seats behind row 1 appear only to have legroom akin to economy class (which begs the question why pay so much extra for no more legroom). I fly business class regularly and would happily fly Comair again when next in Africa, and BA when travelling in Europe.

### Comair customer review
This airline flies under the banner of British Airways. I thought the planes looked old and tired. The customer service onboard was OK, although slighly abrupt. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes. My flight with the same airline to Durban a few days earlier was also delayed for about an hour. When I asked for a customer service feedback form, they seemed shocked that I should want to offer feedback. Needless to say there was no way to leave feedback with the airline. I won't be flying with them again. Luckily there is now quite a bit of choice in South Africa.

### Comair customer review
My flight Durban to Jo'burg on 10 May under the BA banner was supposed to connect with QR to Doha and then Singapore but left a little late. Although my baggage was booked right through to Singapore, I was refused check-in by QR at Jo'burg because it was said to be too late even though it was an hour before departure time. Whilst QR rescheduled flights to Singapore at no extra charge' (I should hope so)! I lost considerable time and money (had to pay for a replacement flight to Jakarta that I missed because of Comair's delay), neither QR nor Comair accepted any sort of responsibility or liability for this uncoordinated chaos. Then my luggage took over two hours to find at Jo'burg Airport. Definitely an airline to avoid.

### Comair customer review
I flew from Jo'burg to Cape Town flight 6427 on 23rd April 2014 at 16h00. My travel agent due to being diabetic always books me an aisle seat so I can get up and move for circulation. I also recently had a hand operation and this aisle seat helped me to keep my hand away from other passengers. I checked in and got the seat my agent booked. As I boarded I was told I was moved to a middle seat. When I queried this I was greeted with a bad attitude and was told they needed my seat for a disabled person. When I explained my medical condition and my operation I was told I could wait for another flight if I did not want to take the middle seat. When I got on the plane the person in my seat was not even disabled. When I approached the stewards my complaints was brushed aside. Poor attitude by staff.

### Comair customer review
Johannesburg to Cape Town Business class. Aircraft non operational so 2 hour delay whilst replacement aircraft prepared. Aircraft old and poor condition of seat and toilets. Speaking to ground staff its apparent that delays are frequent due to mechanical issues with old aircraft. Return flight also delayed by 1 hour. According to pilot the aircraft in JNB also non operational and requiring replacement. As before old aircraft tatty condition. Poor reliability.

### Comair customer review
Flew from Jo'burg to Victoria Falls in Zim. BA check in was very smooth and efficient. Turns out the BA lounge is not open during the day and we were directed to a third party lounge which was very nice indeed (better that the Galleries lounge that BA operate). We had to take a bus to get to our plane which was fine and efficiently done. The plane was an old BA badged 737-400 I suspect a reject from European operations. But plane was clean and well presented. We were given a choice of hot meals which I have to say was very tasty and well presented on the outbound leg. The inbound was not quite as nice but still acceptable. Both flights were packed to rafters with not a seat spare but staff coped very well. It would be good to see Comair get some new planes as the old cast offs from BA are really showing their age now.

### Comair customer review
BA 6275 1 August 2014 JNB-Windhoek. BA 6274 15 August 2014 Windhoek-JNB. We recently flew Comair franchise flights between Johannesburg and Windhoek the livery was BA excellent service clean and comfortable 737 on schedule hot meal served with choice of wines.

### Comair customer review
Comair Business VFA (Victoria Falls) to JNB (Johannesburg). Easy check in provided you were only travelling to JNB. Other pax transferring with through tickets to London/USA/Australia were unable to check bags all the way through or get boarding cards for subsequent flights. This meant they had to go through customs and immigration at JNB collect bags and recheck rather than just going through transit. Gave them a very poor experience of BA/Comair in Zimbabwe. This is an airport used by many international pax and should be able to do this as a matter of course. No lounge at VFA airport. It is being rebuilt so maybe will be better in future years. Comfortable seats on an old B737 pleasant lunch and helpful staff.

### Comair customer review
JNB to PLZ. Very good service on this lunch-time flight. Stewardess handled the issue of removing an under-age passenger from the exit row behind us with perfect tact. Tasty hot meal served efficiently (in contrast to SAA which is just a sandwich) and very fast baggage delivery.

### Comair customer review
My husband is blind and we therefore request special assistance on all flights. Flying from Durban to Johannesburg March 26th 2014 and checking in early we were allocated seats in row 21. I asked for seats nearer the front of the aircraft but was told that assisted passengers are always seated near the rear. The 3 assisted passengers on our flight were not embarked until about 20 minutes before departure and once onboard had to struggle through a nearly full aircraft to their seats. The stewardess on duty in that area was as unhelpful as she could be. We fly long haul regularly. BA always embarks assisted passengers first allowing them space to settle down before the crowd arrives. The stewardess in our cabin on our later flight to LHR couldn't have been more helpful. Why does Comair make life even more difficult for the disadvantaged?

### Comair customer review
Another trip from Johannesburg to Harare- 737s both ways and all on time. Crew were good kept us informed particularly on return flight when there were very strong winds and mine dump dust at Jo'burg. Outward meal was a hot meal return meal was the whole grain roll-this seems to be standard. No complaints at all and plenty of leg room in these old planes.

### Comair customer review
Johannesburg to Harare return. Outward flight on time - rather old 737-but clean. Cabin crew efficient lunch time flight so we were offered chicken or alternative lunch which was acceptable. Return flight left Harare on time 737 again and a light snack with drinks. Again cabin crew efficient and information from the flight deck along the route. Arrived on time-good experience overall.

### Comair customer review
DUR-CPT BA6310 2 April. As late morning flight arriving lunchtime I expected a bit of a meal. What I was offered was either a chicken roll or salad roll. I chose the salad roll - multi-grain smothered in margarine with 2 slices of cucumber! That's it! That's Comair's "salad" roll? Even QF do better on their bad domestic days! Why did SAA give up on that route?

### Comair customer review
Economy class JNB-CPT and CPT-JNB. Take off and landing in time. Baggage arrived to carousel even before passengers. Inflight staff very friendly and helpful. Meals are good also for 2 hr flight only (we had a complete lunch/dinner warm meal).

### Comair customer review
Flew PLZ-JNB as part of a BA ticket to LHR. Simply put check in was a nightmare. A bag of 25kg that had travelled with us from LHR at the same weight was rejected as overweight even though the original baggage tag (with weight clearly marked) was still attached. We spent 30 minutes at Club check in unpacking and re- packing our bags on the dirty airport floor with all our possessions spread out. Highly embarrassing until I turned around to see someone at every other counter doing the same. The manager explained that as a franchise of BA - a fact not made clear during booking nor even at the airport - BA insisted they adhere to strict baggage limits for international flights even when they could see that we were executive Gold and Bronze and had flown over with bags the same weight. For this I blame BA but the local staff could have tried to appear less pedantic and could also have found someone with a far more pleasant demeanour for the Club desk. I booked with BA for the service but on this leg was sorely disappointed.

### Comair customer review
Recently flew British Airways from Johannesburg to Cape Town. Found the plane to be very dirty and the service mediocre. Most disappointing was when the flight attendant handed me an envelope with a generic note stating that the special child meal I had requested was unavailable.

### Comair customer review
JNB-PLZ-JNB. Offers consistently good service on this route. Pleasant and attentive cabin crew decent food for a shortish commuter flight and an excellent lounge in JNB for BA Exec card members.

### Comair customer review
Windhoek-Johannesburg on a Boeing 737-300 with British Airways flag operated by Comair. Very good service and ample legroom. Aircraft clean and departure before scheduled time. A very good flight and pleasant experience.

### Comair customer review
I fly to and from NYC each week. I was doing PIT-LGA legs but the cost of the PIT-EWR flights (Continental Express operated by Comair) were significantly cheaper over the past few months. I now understand why. The 6:00PM Thurs evening flights have been cancelled for the past 4 of 5 weeks (with the 5th being delayed 2 hrs). I understand how weather and ATC can affect things but seems to be an operational issue. 4 cancellations in 5 weeks is unacceptable. I will obviously go back to the LGA-PIT legs on US Air.

### Comair customer review
Johannesburg - Port Elizabeth - Johannesburg. Outbound Friendly check-in. Superb SLOW lounge at JNB with excellent buffet breakfast. No priority boarding. Rather old 737-300 with tatty interior. Economy-type seating. FAs attentive. Breakfast served at 11.45 am and rejected after two previous breakfasts (one on Virgin flight the other in lounge). Plane seemed to have a pressurisation problem so a rather painful descent. Inbound Speedy check-in and through passport control in 5 minutes. Reasonable Premiere lounge. Old 737-400 with ashtray in toilet. Attentive FAs and better than usual lunch. Baggage handling quick. Overall good flights and better than Club Europe.

### Comair customer review
Cape Town-Johannesburg. The service was extremely attentive and catering outstanding. The cabin and seating of BA Comair aircraft mean they fall short of the likes of SAA. B737-300 was worn inside - rather dingy and dirty looking and the Business Class cabin was the same as the economy cabin save empty B and E seats. This resulted in a rather uncomfortable journey. I don't think I'll choose another Comair flight in Business Class until their fleet is renewed and material product offering improved.

### Comair customer review
Johannesburg to Cape Town on an early departure (0605). The seats are comfortable and Breakfast was tasty. The crew were professional and friendly. Arrived on time and no problems experienced.
