### ”lack of customer service”
I flew from Japan to Taiwan in September 2024, expecting a smooth and straightforward travel experience. Unfortunately, what I encountered with Tiger Airways was far from that. My experience was riddled with unnecessary frustration, lack of customer service, and poor handling of what should have been a routine situation. The issue began with my carry-on luggage, which I have taken on numerous flights across various airlines, including EVA Air and several European carriers, without any problem. However, Tiger Airways deemed my bag too large, despite it meeting the standard carry-on size on every other airline I've flown with. They insisted I check it in and charged me an outrageous fee of $47.50 for doing so. This was not a mere inconvenience—it was an unnecessary and excessive charge for something that should have easily been allowed in the cabin, as it has been on countless other flights. What made the situation even more frustrating was the timing. I had planned to spend my last few moments at the gate saying goodbye to a close friend, but instead, I found myself dealing with this avoidable situation. Rather than showing understanding or empathy, the airline staff insisted on enforcing this rigid policy without any flexibility or consideration for the customer. Their insistence on adhering to this unnecessary fee turned what could have been a quick and simple goodbye into an extremely frustrating experience. As someone who has flown extensively across many airlines—budget and premium—this stands out as one of the more disappointing travel experiences. Tiger Airways' approach to customer service felt transactional at best. There was no effort to explain the policy beyond simply demanding the fee. What should have been a moment of service recovery—an opportunity to show that the airline cares about its passengers—was instead handled with indifference. Moreover, the lack of consistency in their baggage policy is troubling. Why should a carry-on that is accepted without issue on other airlines suddenly become an expensive inconvenience on Tiger Airways? This inconsistency leaves passengers like myself feeling blindsided and penalized for simply following the standards that have been widely accepted across the industry. Tiger Airways has clearly chosen to prioritize revenue from additional fees over passenger experience. Instead of fostering a positive relationship with their travelers, they enforce policies that not only feel excessive but also detract from the overall travel experience. Forcing passengers into situations like this does nothing to build trust or loyalty, and it’s hard to imagine recommending this airline to anyone in the future. In conclusion, if you're considering flying with Tiger Airways, I strongly urge you to reconsider. While budget airlines often come with some trade-offs, the level of service and customer care on Tiger Airways falls far below the expected standard, even for low-cost carriers. The hidden fees and rigid policies make what should be an affordable option an unexpectedly expensive and unpleasant one. There are plenty of other airlines out there that manage to offer affordable flights without sacrificing customer service and basic respect for their passengers—sadly, Tiger Airways is not one of them.

### "online check-in was unavailable"
I booked tickets from Narita to Taipei. I flew into Narita from the US. An airport employee told us to go through the transfer gates for our connecting flight. We showed up at the gate an hour and a half before boarding. The employee refused to print out our tickets and let us board. He said that we had to go through customs and check-in at the counter outside. This was not stated on our tickets. And we tried to check-in online but the Tigerair manager working there said the online check-in was unavailable due to COVID. We had to book a different airline and Tigerair refused to give us our tickets or money back.

### "poor quality of ground staff service"
Not Verified | Unorganized ground staff at check-in counter flight Don Muang to Taipei for 11/07/2022 @11 pm. Information was not cleared indicating regarding Japan Covid restrictions. Did not provide alternate options for rescheduling or cancellation due to unknown circumstances. Taipei airport, poor quality of ground staff service especially guidelines for passengers.

### "service is absolutely rubbish"
Melbourne to Brisbane with Tigerair. If it was possible to give this sad excuse of an airline a rating in the negatives, I would. Their service is absolutely rubbish! Staff are incapable of answering simple questions and completely incompetent in dealing with simple customer service queries. The lady I spoke to at Melbourne airport literally asked me to step aside so she could help the next customer because she didn't want to answer my query. Rude and belligerent. Online web check in wasn't working at all for my flight. No information given on ticket regarding gate closing times, no willingness to justify the lack of organisation and information! Plane was uncomfortable and had the bare minimum, with no complimentary services. Plane staff were snobby and dismissive. Awful experience, never flying with Tiger. You're better off throwing the money in the bin.

### "Family separated by seating"
Melbourne to Cairns. Delayed as per normal. Family separated by seating. Customers all grumpy as staff had them enter wrong door on plane. Putting conflict front passengers trying to get to front from rear and rear passengers trying to get to back from front on instruction from crew?

### "Staff were lazy and unhelpful"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Staff were lazy and unhelpful. They appeared more interested in selling extras and assessing baggage weight than providing service. While nobody expects luxury from a budget airline courtesy shouldn't be dependent on ticket price.

### "bad reviews are spot on"
Melbourne to Sydney. Why does Tigerair still exist? Always thought the bad reviews were over the top. Wrong! Reviews are spot on. Flight TT254 was on time and we were at the gate lined up to get on the plane - then the plane was delayed for an unknown reason and finally canceled. Magically, the Sydney plane, with the issue, was now going to Adelaide and all the Sydney passengers had been transferred to later Virgin Australia flights. I just hope this was not Virgin Australia (owner of Tigerair) filling up their later flights to Sydney to save a dollar at the expense of their passengers!

### "their service to customers is unfair"
I bought a return ticket from Brisbane to Sydney (28 Sep 2019) and Sydney back to Brisbane (29 Sep 2019) with Tigerair almost two months ago (8 August 2019). On Saturday 28 Sep I flew to Sydney on schedule. Then I received an announcement that the Flight on 29 Sep back to Brisbane (TT374) was cancelled due to engineering requirements and postponed to Monday 30 Sep at 13.40pm. Thus, I stayed in Sydney one more day. On Monday morning, I got to the airport early, and found that the flight TT368 was cancelled also due to engineering requirements. The announcement reached my mobile phone at 10.39am 29 Sep. The available flight is on Thursday. I requested a Tigerair staff to buy a ticket for me back to Brisbane as I could not stay in Sydney longer, and I had to fly back to Brisbane on that day, otherwise, I would give a negative review. However, the staff did not care and said that he only could send me a refund. In the end, I bought the last seat available from Sydney to Brisbane with Virgin Australia at $375.00! I do not know whether the Fair Trading can force Tigerair to pay for my extra airfare. Tigerair is not reliable, and their service to customers is unfair.

### "disgrace of an airline"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. Absolute disgrace of an airline. Cancelled flight. Best option they could give was a flight 2 days later. No good if you have a connecting flight. Will definitely not use again.

### "a lovely flight"
Not Verified |  This was a lovely flight from Hobart to the Gold Coast on Tigerair. Boarding was orderly. We walked to the plane and boarded through the rear. I had row to myself in the second last row. I will travel with them again.

### "staff were very professional"
I unfortunately missed my flight by minutes! However, the staff were very professional, reassuring and efficient in helping me to rectify my mistake. I would like to thank those staff members from the bottom of my heart for making what seemed impossible, possible! What a great team of people there is at Gold Coast airport! Thank you again

### "Disaster of an airline"
Disaster of an airline. Delayed flight from Melbourne to Good Coast. Now again waiting at Gold Coast to Melbourne. Flight was due to leave at 1pm. Now expected to leave at 3.10pm. Further to this our original booking had a time change also from when we booked. We never fly with them again. Pay the extra $30-$40 and go with a proper airline.

### "I am very disappointed "
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Canberra. Never again with Tigerair. I am very disappointed with what happened today on my flight from Brisbane to Canberra. Before this flight I had never had my purse measured. My carry on luggage was 6,5kg (7kg allowed) and she asked me to measure my small purse with my documents and a book and she added that to my luggage and charged me 46$ extra. That's insane.

### "I will not recommend"
Worst trip in my life. I had an urgent trip to Sydney from Brisbane. I needed to fly to Sydney with Tigerair Australia, stay 3 hours there, and return back with Qantas. I arrived to BNE domestic airport 50 min before the flight, but until i tried to check in, it failed and then i called Tigerair Australia assistance, where he said that I am 2 min late, then he directed me to another staff. The other staff had bad attitude and wanted to book me a flight after 3 hours and get me pay extra $ and keep saying that I should check in before 45min and I am late and blaming me why I did not check in online. Then instead of helping, they called the AFP for me because they suspected I may get angry on them. AFP staff was helpful and helped me. I ended up not flying with Tigerair Australia and booking a flight with Qantas. This airline staff are the worst staff I've seen in an airline. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "avoid like the plague in future"
Avoid avoid avoid. We were just en route to Tullamarine for our vacation to the Gold Coast when we received an email telling us our flight was cancelled. Tigerair can only offer us a refund or a flight on Tuesday. No concern over the fact we have paid for a hotel, theme park tickets and car rental/airport parking. No concern to the fact in the least. Just booked flights for tomorrow morning with JetStar at almost double the cost! Even so we would have lost more in all of the above to cancel the trip entirely. Will avoid like the plague in future.

### "Terrible flight"
Melbourne to Perth with Tigerair. Terrible flight, every time I have flown with them it is delayed. No food menu as they are changing it so you have to bring your own. 100% not worth the money and would not recommend.

### "flight got delayed for 2 hours"
Melbourne to Canberra with Tigerair. Got to the airport early, because you don’t want to stress. The flight got delayed for 2 hours. Two hours passed, the flight gets delayed another hour. Conclusion: If you like chilling at an airport for half the day and spend money you don’t have on food because you’re starving then look no further and fly with Tigerair, they won’t dissapoint.

### "just not acceptable"
Hobart to Melbourne. This airline should not be in business. To constantly delay and cancel flights is just not acceptable. 45 minutes before departure the flight was cancelled! This was the first and last attempt with this airline. Book with them at your peril.

### "the last time I am buying with Tiger"
Horrible! Today was the last time I am buying with Tiger! Few weeks ago I was flying from Sydney to Brisbane and had a delay over 3 hours. Ok, sometimes can happen. Today I am flying from Brisbane to Sydney and the flight was cancelled! They moved me to another flight in 3 hours! Cannot believe it. I bought this flight to make sure I am fine for a meeting in Sydney. I am sure I will have some issues when flying back on Saturday, unfortunately bought return flight with this poor airline.

### "no availability to fly"
I booked a cheap flight 5 months ago from Melbourne to the Gold Coast, 2 weeks ago Tigerair changed the time of the flight, then 12 hours prior to the flight they cancelled the flight and no availability to fly out that day. Is this what happens when you buy a cheap ticket. Never again will I fly Tigerair.

### "not very efficient"
Flew Tigerair from Cairns to Sydney only because it was $10 cheaper per person than another Australian airline, shouldn’t have bothered and should have taken the other one! Had to pay for baggage for my husband and I, only 15 kg authorized. We realized the day before flying that it wouldn’t be enough and wanted to add another bag: not possible! They just don’t do it. Instead you can add extra kilos, so we tried to do it online about 10 times which didn’t work! We then called the help service the next day: fare prices had increased. I was also supposed to pay $5 fees for this change over the phone (that I got free when I said the website didn’t work the previous day). Overall: not very efficient, very slow, couldn’t send me the proof of my new registration, 34 min over the phone. I didn’t know it wasn’t a free number, had to pay over €80 ($120) for this one call. On the plane: average minus rating. Would not recommend this airline at all. Pay a little bit more and get better service quality and less troubles.

### "perfect for a low cost airline"
Sydney to Melbourne and was impressed - great cheap ticket. As I was using auto check in kiosk at the airport a professional Tigerair check in staffer approached to assist me even though I did not need help and she put me in an exit row with extra legroom and directed me to check in counter for bag drop and instantly issued a new boarding pass. Well groomed warm professional supervisor pulled me out of line as he was free and line was busy with a family and he took me to another counter to quickly check my bags and complete check in - everyone called me by name very friendly. On Flight cabin crew were all well groomed, great uniforms - men in vests and long sleeve, women with scarves and wedding worthy hairdos - great for a low cost carrier - friendly smiles and very professional looking us in the eye and calling us by name. Flight on time - boarding was completed early. Actually liked the cloth seats - most seats are leather on low cost carriers. Liked A320 over 737 - it feels more spacious. Liked how they use front and back stairs for boarding/de-planing as it is much faster than the long slow que on other airlines which only use one door. Simple menu - but perfect for a low cost airline - you can pre order bigger meals too. Low cost terminal at Melbourne is brand new - simple and slick - very efficient - what more can you want for the price. Airline has massively improved since problems a few years ago.

### "this was a very unfair process"
I recently flew from Canberra to Brisbane return. Flight out of Canberra was hassle free. Checked in online. Flight was good. Staff friendly. Seats comfortable. Short flight - no meals required. As I was only traveling to Brisbane for a few days to assist family move house I had only organised the 7kg carry on. I had no problems on the Canberra to Brisbane leg. On the return leg however, it was brought to my attention that the 7kgs was to include my handbag. I have never flown with an airline that also weighs your handbag. Needless to say this caught not only me by surprise but it caught many other passengers by surprise also. My baggage was just over 7kg and I was made to pay $50 extra before I could board the plane. I thought this was a very unfair process in a number of respects - firstly I only weigh 60kg and my total baggage was 8.4kg. Yet the guy in the row opposite me probably weighed 100kg and had a bag equal to mine. I realise we can’t discriminate but where is the fairness in this process? I would not fly Tigerair again without purchasing the additional baggage when I checked in. It would have cost me $12 not $50 at the gate. Tigerair must have made another $1000 at the gate from people like myself or those that just completely ignored the 7kg rule and thought they could take unlimited weight as carry on. Definitely need to consider the additional luggage costs when considering to fly with Tigerair. In the end I probably could have flown with Qantas!

### "a nightmare"
Taipei to Okinawa. Trying to work with this airline is a nightmare at every stage. Their website is pathetic, to be honest, and it seems to me that their goal is to nickel and dime you to death in any way possible. I attempted to add a bag online to my reservation and the website told me it had to be added within four hours of departure. Okay, one more thing to do on travel day but that's fine. Try within the time frame and the option is grayed out, no reason why. At this point I'm on my way to the airport and don't have time to figure it out and decide to talk to the desk workers. The desk workers shrug, nothing they can do so I end up paying nearly double. Honestly, all of this would be frustrating but not so bad, I arrived safely, right? Well, I reached out to their customer service today to see what they had to say and this is what tipped me into being furious and writing this review. Their customer service portal is buggy and inefficient, the rep I'm talking to has given no name but immediately blamed me with this line: "Your flight was 18:20, our office hour is 9:00 to 21:00, in this situation I believe you can contact us 4 hours prior departure. Apart from repeated blame of this type, the rep continues to disappear from the chat for 10-15 minutes at a time, I'm actually still on the chat at this moment waiting for him/her to return. Seriously, I get that mistakes happen, I know all that customer service people have to deal with. But I'm giving them screenshots of how the option was unavailable and they're saying they don't believe me. *An hour and a half later, a manager got in and said my complaint was denied because I didn't have a full screenshot, only one of the actual page which was taken on a train en route to the airport because of their policy. I would not work with an airline that treats their customers so poorly, especially when there are better alternatives, like Peach for Asia travel.

### Tigerair customer review
Flew Sydney to Gold Coast. On the way there, this airline was fine however on the way back we were waiting in the line and we started to board. All of a sudden the flight attendant randomly comes to the middle of the line (unfortunately right where me and my two friends are standing) and asks to weigh our bags (7kgs allowed). Granted we were over our allowed weight and I would not have minded paying had she done this to everyone in the queue! We were literally the only people in the entire flight to have their bag checked. I was appalled to see people passing me with suitcases much heavier and bigger than mine! I know she’s selected us because we were 3 young girls and we were an easy target because we wouldn’t make a massive fuss (although I was happy to express my dissatisfaction). I am okay with paying if my suitcase is over, I can take full responsibility for that but if you are going to do one person, you have to weigh everyone’s! You can’t choose easy targets to get extra money. So my annoyance then continued as the women charging us took so long to do so I then didn’t have any over head space for my case and was sat the whole flight by a crying baby (no ones fault about the child) but it wasn’t a pleasant trip. Overall I would not fly again with Tigerair nor would I recommend them unless they had this issue sorted. It’s not professional. I love flying but I have never been more annoyed.

### "the worst experience"
Hanoi to Singapore. Tigerair has been the worst experience in my life. I bought two tickets for a Hanoi to Singapore flight, scheduled on July 13, 2017. Departure time was 4:20 pm. When I arrived at the airport my flight had left at 1:00. I was never notified. During my long trip through Southeast Asia, there were changes in my flights with other airlines. Fortunately, Air Asia, United and Qatar notified me and I took precautions. Tigerair never did. They only sent me an “important notification” about a meal change from mutton to chicken. Even though I got a signed document by their representative in Hanoi, stating that he “will make sure” that we took a next day flight, he did not fulfill his promise. When we arrived to the airport, he just washed his hands. I needed to reach Singapure to take a flight to LA. I had to buy two last minute flights with Malindo Air and Malaysia from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur and then to Singapure. Ended up paying 1,000 dollars. Also, I lost two paid hotel nights in Singapore. After four weeks waiting for a reply from Tigerair they are silent, even when I have a signed document from their representative. Tigerair gives a bad name to Singapure: no ethics and no efficiency. A shame. Avoid this airline at any cost.

### "careless attitude"
Jakarta to Singapore. The ticket was purchased during peak season. It was one of the cheapest available. Despite previous bad experience, we are willing to give this another chance. Boy was it a very wrong decision. The A319arrived 30 minutes late. But when we boarded the plane, the captain apologised that we can't pushback due to crowded departure slot of Lion and Garuda. We waited for another 45 minutes. Then we were given the push, but stopped miday, before being pulled back to the gate. I noticed that the runway was switched. Engine start failed. After 20 minutes they decided to fix the problem. The door was opened, and the engineers boarded. After that, we were notified that they are going to perform ramp start. Twice they tried, twice they failed. The passengers were alerted to the noise. After an hour and a half since we boarded, we are finally told to disembark. Then, the shenanigans started. I would love to see a symphatetic and understanding gate agent, but throughout my 25 years of experience of air traveling, good luck finding one. After 2 hours of non-decision, false promises of rebooking us on different flight, we were told that they were trying to fix the airplane in an hour and allow us to reboard the plane. Well, it appear to us that there are no maintenance activities going on. Nobody did anything to the plane apart from the original flight deck and cabin crew doing whatever was left there, including a couple of ground handling staffs. A couple of passengers protested the decision to reuse the same plane. But his answer to the concerned passenger should win the best callous unsymphatetic answer ever. You are all insured". Luckily, everyone just resorted to shouting and crowding. For 4 hours, we were not given any food or solution. The only comfort we offered was the water we had inside the cabin during engine start tests. I would like to commend the flight deck and cabin crew for their professionalism. The captain repeatedly apologised for this unfortunate events, however the gate agent did not utter a single word of apology. It is not like I would forgive him anyway. But the careless attitude and time-wasting oressure tactics in order to leave us without choice is infuriating. I dare you to try this airline.

### "Avoid if you can"
Phuket to Singapore. Avoid if you can. Delays on both legs, impossible to check in online, no leg room, the food is terrible. 1 hour and 10 min delay for a 1.5 hours flight is completely unacceptable. The company pesters you with mail after mail of spam and then conveniently forgets to update the departure time when there is a delay.

### "amazing staff member "
Male to Bali via Singapore. A good journey thanks to an amazing staff member in Bali airport! I had extra luggage 25 KG. I booked online extra KG but my company had to change my traveling dates hence, no more extra luggage (which I did not know). On the website it says save 30% and book in advance, I assumed my 25 kg would cost me 120$ instead of 90$ that I paid online : very wrong! They asked me to pay 550$ to check in my bag, more than the ticket both ways! I was in the middle of the airport, tired, with my 14 months old baby waiting for God knows what. The staff was trying his best chatting with Singaporean staff to get me a reasonnable solution, after 1 hour of intensive discussion and a crying baby, and tension between us, he managed to get me the bag for the normal 80 USD. Thank you so much for your comprehension and gentle attitude. Overall the flight was good and the staff helpful with the baby.

### "delays have become the norm"
Again Tigerair is delayed flying from Sydney to Melbourne. We had already been informed since booking that the flight had been rescheduled to 3 hours later, this was inconvenient but ok. However, to now be stuck at the airport with a further 2 hour delay on the revised flight time is ridiculous. Delays have become the norm with this airline, what a disaster.

### "seemed value for money"
Singapore to Wuxi. Regular flyer on legacy carriers but had to book Tigerair recently as their flight time and location was more suitable. Pleasantly surprised with the service onboard, great cabin crew staff that made passengers feel like they were wanted on the flight. This made the flight experience so much enjoyable and seemed value for money flying with this airline.

### "had to call again and again"
We booked the flight Ho Chi Minh City to Gold Coast with Tigerair 2 months before departure date, then we received an email informing that our flight has been rescheduled. From the email, it said that we can have the option to have the voucher to book another flight. Before we decided to get the voucher, everyone in the call centre said that it will take 3 to 4 weeks. So, we are happy to wait for that. However, after 4 weeks, nothing happened then we have to call them. The thing is they said there is a new policy and now it will take 6-8 weeks. We had to call again and again, the call centre said it is out of their control so they can't do anything. How funny that the new policy is launched and still applied for the request sent to them ages before.

### "only good thing is the punctuality"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Tigerair is the airline you would want to avoid. Being the budget airline, they charge for every single thing, including excess of 1-2kg of baggage. I was charged for SGD$60 for excess of 3kg, which is absolutely mad. I also faced with extremely rude group staff who have no customer service skill at all. The excess baggage was done randomly, which again is not professional at all. There was a time they charged me for just changing the air ticket timing, which turned out to be more expensive than buying a whole new ticket. The planes are old. The only good thing about this airline is the punctuality.

### "a surprise birthday celebration "
❎ Unverified |  Singapore to Bangkok. The crew organised a surprise birthday celebration for my wife on board the airplane. The crew were friendly, caring and helpful and offered their own donuts to my wife to represent it as a cake. My family are so grateful to their kind hospitality. Keep it up! Tigerair will be my first priority for my next destination. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

### "the little things that matter"
Singapore to Taipei, travelling in June 2017. Kudos to Customer Service Team for their quick and satisfactory service. They went against its non-refund policy to grant me a USD60 refund for checked in baggage that I had wrongly booked. Though the amount involved is not a big amount, it shows their gesture of good will and willingness to be flexible and accommodating. Truly appreciated - it's the little things that matter and so far so good.

### "flight itself was good"
Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. The cabin crew lacked service skills onboard and not understandable English announcement pronunciation, but otherwise the flight itself was good. Barely a short 34 mins flight time, was able to enjoy the comfortable journey when the back row of the seat pitch is more generous then the front one. However the schedule is not so convenient and the payment service charge is slightly higher omong others. There are a western and female cockpit crew together with cabin crew greeted us with feeling when we all disembarked, nice touch!

### "the flight was enjoyable"
Jakarta to Singapore. The cabin crew and ground staff was efficient and nice. The flight departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The baggage upon arrival was quite fast and I do not need to wait very long. The seat was standard of LCC. Overall, the flight was enjoyable and will fly again with Tigerair.

### "follow up service non existent"
I was on my last leg of my flight coming from Singapore to Phuket, all was going well, had checked in for the flight and about 20 of us had boarded before they stopped the boarding and started chatting at the front. We were then informed that they were going to delay the flight for 3 hours because 50 passengers were on a connecting flight and they didn't want them to miss it. Now the entire flight is 90 minutes so delaying the flight, double the actual flight time for a minority of passengers is not good people skills. Then just to rub it in, they offered everyone a $10 meal voucher as it was already evening, and if you have been to Singapore you probably know $10 gets you just about nothing. I did write to Tigerair asking an explanation on how they decided the majority had to wait twice the flight time for some passengers and they were very quick to acknowledge and agreed to follow up. Last I ever heard from them. So Tigerair your customer service is shocking, your follow up service non existent.

### "it is so dysfunctional"
Perth to Bali. It is difficult to know where to start with Tigerair as it is so dysfunctional, from extremely poor customer service to the extent of lying to customers on more than one occasion. Cancelling flights and not informing customers, leaving them to find alternative travel arrangements with not even an apology. Promising a refund and not giving one.

### "really unpleasant experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. This is the first time that I booked tickets in Tigerair and it is a really unpleasant experience. Flight TR2455 was supposed to depart at 11:35 am from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore - however it was delayed by an hour and it was announced that it is rescheduled at 12:30pm. Then the flight is again delayed and this time due to a technical issue and they could not even tell when the flight will come to KL and leave for Singapore. This is so fustrating and disappointing. We are flying from India for a holiday in Singapore and it didn't start well, thanks to Tigerair.

### "aircraft's are clean and modern"
Flew Singapore to Bangkok. I've used Tigerair many times during the last few years and never had a problem with anything. They are nearly always on time, the crew work hard and are polite. The aircraft's are clean and modern. Check-in staff are very efficient, much better than Emirates or Monarch. Very good airline.

### "the good and bad of budget travel"
Singapore to Penang return with Tigerair. You get to experience the good and bad of modern day budget travel with Tigerair. Having booked a round trip I was able to print my boarding pass and go straight to the gate, hence I could skip the long check-in line in the morning. Bus gate this flight probably due to cost-cutting, and if you happen to be one of the unlucky few who decided to buy a board-me-first option, they'll board you first on the bus (and not the plane). Unsurprisingly departure was delayed due to the need for the bus to loop several times to pick up passengers from the terminal. Return flight from Penang was almost like a traveller's heaven: flight departed 30 minutes early as everyone had checked in at Penang Airport comfortably ahead of check-in cut off time. It also helped that there was an aerobridge and well-organised handling agents, which meant passengers were all on board in less than 20 minutes. Arrival in Singapore was of course 30 minutes early. Being a budget airline, the service was almost non-existant. Can't say that I don't like this airline as they've performed well on the return leg for me, but there is always room for improvement when it comes to departures from Changi.

### "recommend for its low price"
Flew on Tigerair  TR2455 from Kuala Lumpur back to Singapore. I got my one way ticket for SGD27, which is cheap. However, I was disappointed that a paper boarding pass, which looks like a receipt, is issued even at the check in counter. And the counter was quite chaotic. Apart from that, the cabin is quite comfortable, refreshments available for sale. I will recommend this airline for its low price.

### "such helpful and friendly staff"
On 13th September I travelled from Singapore to Macau on Tigerair. I witnessed a very helpful act by the steward onboard the flight. When the plane was reaching Macau, a lady told the steward that she lost her ring on board the plane. He crawled onto the passageway to look underneath the seats to try to locate the ring. When he could not find it, he asked the lady and the other 2 passengers to vacate the seats so he could do a thorough search. He managed to find the ring under the seat cushion of the lady. If not for his perseverance, this lady will not be able to find her ring. I observed that this steward was very friendly towards passengers and would walk up and down the aisle talking to them. It is a joy to be served by such helpful and friendly staff.

### "consider Tigerair for future trips"
Singapore to Penang. I traveled with Tigerair many years back, an average budget airplane with less service provided on the plane. Recently, I needed to plan for a trip for my family of 10 to Macau, found out the only plane to fly there is Tigerair, so set with "no choice" attitude, I bought the tickets via online for a group of 10 pax. thinking that I can provide the names and details nearer to the flight. Few days ago, I decided to provide the full details of the travelers via the website but unfortunately, I can't do it. So I sent an email to a lady who is in charge of group booking. She responded fast to my numerous emails, and even helped me to update the details the second time within 24 hrs. I really must show my appreciation for such good service provided by her, to acknowledge and share here. I will consider Tigerair for my future trips whenever possible from now on.

### "definitely better than expected"
Ho Chi Minh to Singapore. A great experience traveling with tiger air. It was a first for all of us, experiencing such good service from the staff at the service counter and on the airplane. We were pleased with customer service especially with the well wishes upon knowing it is one of our member's birthday. Also, the cake which was presented onboard the plane by the staff was unexpected and surpirising. Travelling with Tigerair was definitely better than expected.

### "Seat quite comfortable"
Check in smooth, ontime boarding. Got front row seat from Surabaya to Singapore and last row from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Seat quite comfortable. cabin crew look tired but try to give best response. Standard flight for low cost flight, but food price in cabin too expensive. Smooth take off and landing.

### "good service and understanding"
Manila to Singapore. I booked wrongly for my relatives as such that the to and from places are interchanged. I called the next day the airline and told them of my problem. Knowing that change fee will be same as booking new flights since it was a promo fare, I was really worried. But the airline is kind enough to understand the error and changed for me with minimal fee only. So grateful that the airline was so helpful and with prompt service that my mother and brother was able to come & have a grand tour of Singapore where I am working. I heard friends experience this with other airlines but they really don't care on your error. Aside from giving seat sale, they also give good service and understanding to customer, This is a great experience indeed!

### "not enough leg spacing"
Guess you get it what you pay for. Was a cheap flight for Dhaka to Singapore return. Bought a service called "Board me first" which suppose to board me on the plane first. They even didn't asked for, so I had to tell them I am a "Board me first" passenger. Because it's a cheap flight, no food, even water, served to others. Thank god I had meal on my flight, and the food are horrible. Only the water worth paying for (12 USD for the meal), because they don't provide water at all. Seems like they just put as many seats as possible, not enough leg spacing.

### "always been a good experience"
Singapore to Manila Clark. Tigerair has been my airline of choice for a good number of times, the ticket price have always been competitive if not the lowest for the route. Despite being a budget airline the staff does try their best to accommodate any such request I or my family may ask. The only thing I would like to raise for awareness to the management is to be a bit more lenient when it comes to rebooking a flight, suggest to remove "extra extra" charges especially if they are dealing with a loyal customer. Other than that, it has always been a good experience with Tiger Air!

### "friendly, helpful and polite"
I'm travelled from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore with Tigerair, unexpected treatment from budget airline. Cabin crew was very friendly, helpful and polite. Much better than some other airlines.

### "staff welcomed us warmly"
I traveled from Hyderabad to Singapore with Tigerair flight TR2625. After reading a few reviews about budget airlines I didn't expect different treatment but surprisingly staff welcomed us warmly and helped to settle down with a pleasing smile. Take off and landing are amazingly smooth - it was a wonderful flight.

### "ground staff polite and kind"
Singapore to Surabaya TR2260 with Tigerair A320. The flight depart and arrive on time. The ground staff was polite and kind. Boarding was quick and smooth and cabin crew greeted us warmly. The price was not very expensive thus we decide to choose TIgerair. The seat was an LCC standard. Overall, It was a nice flight with Tigerair.

### "staff were super friendly"
Singapore to Ipoh with Tigerair. It was a short flight of about an hour and a half. The flight took off with a 5 minutes delay due but arrived Ipoh before the scheduled time. The captain was fantastic as he greeted us warmly when we alighted the plane. The staff were super friendly. The price I feel is a bit high because Firefly offer a cheaper price and I might choose Tigerair if Firefly is not available. The seat was not comfortable for long journeys - it feels like you are sitting on metal. The inflight entertainment was so so but overall a good flight to Ipoh.

### "lack of transparency"
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City with Tigerair. Flight experience was as expected for a low cost carriers - I chose it as the schedule was more convenient than other options on this route. Have taken Tigerair many times however this was the first time that after checking in and in the queue for passport control I was pulled out if the line by 2 security people had my carry on bag and back pack weighed and learned that you are only allowed to take 10 kg combined weight. I had exactly the same luggage as my inbound leg and had no issue at all but here I was forced to pay $50 to have my bag checked in. Poor experience and lack of transparency by the airline. Why was this not done at the check-in counter? I learned my lessson - never again will use this airline as I'm not willing to put up with these kind of schemes and rip-offs.

### "relatively terrible experience"
Hong Kong to Bali Denpasar via Singapore return with Tigerair. Relatively terrible experience across the four individual flights. First, HKG-SIN boarded after an hour delay (no reason/apology given). Pulled back from gate, then swiftly returned. Was told there was an engine fault. Sat onboard for another half an hour. Then told we needed to disembark, which meant going all the way back through transfer security (painful process considering there was only 1 lane open in the midfield concourse at this time of night). Finally boarded again. Eventual takeoff just under 3 hours late, but very little sincere apology given by staff. Was still charged for a glass of water despite the delay. Second flight from SIN-DPS also delayed once onboard due to technical glitch, although thankfully did not have to disembark this time. Return flights, DPS-SIN fine and almost on time, but SIN-HKG yet again delayed once onboard for another technical issue. 3 flights out of 4 having technical issues is quite alarming and does not fill one with confidence. Legroom is standard for a cheap airline but the seats themselves are extremely uncomfortable. Aircraft looking quite dated. Departure gates regularly changed at the last minute. Prices of food onboard expensive and quality below average. Perhaps the worst offence of all - amidst the chaos of the disembarkation on the first flight, I note that there was no safety demonstration given by the crew at all before take off.

### "flight attendants were quite haughty"
Flew Tigerair from Singapore Changi to Denpasar Bali roundtrip. Used the boardmefirst service, which let us board a few minutes before all the other passengers. The airplane was OK but very cramped. There was no inflight entertainment onboard, and no food included in the price. The flight attendants were quite haughty, but thankfully the flight was only just over two hours. We arrived on time.

### "very efficient and polite"
I recently made an error on my online booking for my flight from Bali to Singapore and contacted Tigerair customer service to request a refund. They responded very promptly to advise they were looking into my request. They again came back very promptly and although the initial offer of credit was not suitable when I explained my travel plans they came back immediately with a refund option. I found their customer service very efficient and polite. Very impressed with the support I was given.

### "flight basic and uneventful"
Boarding simple and much faster than I predicted, since they board from back to front and I was sitting in 2D. Made it on board in two minutes, got settled. Captain and First Officer seemed professional, but didn't notify as to the reason we sat at the gate for 20 minutes till right before we pushed back and said it was a ATC hold. Polite crew, but they didn't do much to smile and welcome every passenger. My vantage point from 2D showed me that they are mainly there to guide people down the aisle, welcome some of them and help with overhead storage. Flight was basic and uneventful, but Tigerair crew seems more focused on completing what must be a well scripted and revenue-generating process of selling food and drink, issuing opportunities for duty free twice in one three hour and 25 minute flight, and cleaning up after the meal. Other than that, they just sat in the front bulkhead and chatted. Lots of storms this time of year, and you can't avoid the bumps, but you can tell they have their skills and duties sorted out and felt nothing but calmness and awareness from them the entire ride. Wonderfully executed touchdown in a slight crosswind. The only disappointing thing is their KrisFlyer points allocation. For a roughly four hour journey, I only accrued 100 points. Seems it would be at least 1300. It would have been on Cathay or Singapore.

### "no wheelchair to be seen"
Having spent 4 days of my holiday in Bangkok Phuket Hospital with an attack of Bronchitis I was pleased to be returning once again to Singapore. Whilst at Phuket I arranged and paid for a wheelchair to be provided and the service I received from the staff at Phuket Airport was excellent. I was assured that a wheelchair would be awaiting me upon my arrival at Changi. Unfortunately when we landed there was no wheelchair to be seen. A female member of the cabin crew ran off to find the chair whilst I hobbled as best I could. Half way to arrivals I met the cabin crew member, now running the other way with the chair which she helped me into and another passenger then took over and wheeled me right through to the baggage area.

### "TigerAir lost my luggage"
Ho chi Minh to Chennai via Singapore. TigerAir lost my luggage, and then said they would send it on next flight, but didn't. Then said they'd fly it to another airport, but didn't. I was surprised I got it back at all, 1 month later. Total cost in renewed visas, flight changes, (including a missed flight), and hotels in the wrong place (waiting near the airport) - $1200. Next time I fly on a more secure, more honest airline and save money that way. TigerAir are of course not interested in covering my losses.

### "crew have smiles on their faces"
Singapore to Phuket on 14th March. As my mom is a plus size she needs a seatbelt extension. I politely asked the cabin crew for the extension. She rudely tells me later, with her arrogant attitude. I then got a bit worried as the aircraft was about to move, and asked her again for the seat belt extension, and again she gave me the same annoying attitude. Later she came and passed me the extension. But today on the return flight I ask for the extension, and to my astonishment the cabin crew thanked me for requesting the extension and provided this. I noticed the rest of the crew have smiles on their faces and it feels very welcoming.

### "surprisingly good service "
Surprisingly good service for a budget airline! on this flight from Singapore to Maldives. A lot better than other budget airline where they shut the blinds on you after take off. I like how the air stewards and stewardesses patrol the aisle several times.

### "worked great for me"
For the price, I was happy with the service and flight with Tigerair. My flights went from Phuket to Singapore to Saigon, but had an overnight layover in Singapore. I chose the long layover to give me a chance to see the city. Both flights were relatively short, about 1.5 hours long. But they were both right on time. No drinks were free, but for the price I paid, I am fine with that. Drinks and food were available, but overpriced. Coke in Thailand is 40 cents. On Tigerair, its $3. Despite this, the airline performed where I wanted it, my luggage was delivered on time. I pre-purchased 20kg of luggage each way. If you had just a carry on, the flights would have been ridiculously inexpensive. The boarding process was a bit odd, but not sure if this was just Tigerair, or the airports. Tigerair worked great for me, and if you aren't looking for lots of bells and whistles, it will likely work for you.

### "Tigerair lost my luggage"
I have flown Tiger many times without problems and this is the first. Tigerair lost my luggage in Singapore en route from Bangkok to Jakarta. I went to Jakarta my luggage did not. Losing luggage is not so bad. Not having a system to track and find and report is bad. Add that to the customer service that will tell you what you want to hear and actually do nothing. Therein is the problem. Tiger lost the luggage and Singapore Airport had the item - not Tiger. Tiger promised to send it on the next flight - they did not, then the next flight 2 hrs later - they did not. Then they promised to send it that next evening - after I had left Jakarta. So the arrangement was - They send it to Jakarta (after failing three times) and then they send it to me in Denpasar by another airline as Tiger do not fly to Denpasar. I had no confidence of ever seeing my luggage again! So I flew back to Singapore and found my bag in SAC Lost Office - not in any tiger facility. They did not have - they never did have it and they did not seem to care. Very disappointing - to say the least.

### "smooth and hassle free"
Our experience with Tigerair from Singapore to Kalibo was good - mainly due to the crew onboard who made our flight memorable, smooth and hassle free. Value for money. We never regret getting the extra legroom seats. Excellent.

### "an okay experience"
Ningbo to Singapore with Tigerair, and the flight was okay, staff was unfriendly and didn't smile but I didn't have to interact with them except hello and goodbye, both of which went unanswered. The departure was a bit delayed (30 minutes) but we arrived in Singapore almost on time. Seats were quite comfortable, nice magazine to read. I would fly with them again if the flight is cheap enough, as overall it was an okay experience.

### "get what you paid for"
Dhaka to Manila via Singapore, and with Tigerair you get what you paid for. The best thing, it is cheap for those travelling on a tight budget. You will get the minimum in order to get to your destination. I had 4 flights, no delays. What I didn't like (I can't complain because it's a budget airline) was the food Quality, I wouldn't buy any hot meals again from Tigerair. The quality is not good. Again, you'll get the minimum in order to get to your destination. You will not even have a blanket even if it's freezing in the Cabin.

### "cheap hassle free flight"
Langkawi to Singapore. I had booked two flights on Tiger Air, I was notified by email that one had been cancelled and given the option of a full refund or a flight the next day. I chose the refund and two days later the money was in my account. I had taken out the online insurance offer when booking, I had to fight and send mails back and forth for a refund on the insurance premium - I was first told no refunds once a certificate of insurance has been issued - after threating the insurance company by going to the insurance ombudsman I was refunded. Flight was on time, check in was easy, flight was fine. as with all bucket airlines, read the small print, follow the instructions about online check-in and prepaid bags and you'll have a cheap hassle free flight. I will be flying with them again.

### "an unscheduled delay"
Singapore to Denpasar with Tigerair. This was a trial, I usually fly Garuda or SQ. I figured it was worth trying Tiger as their itinerary fit what I wanted. When I showed up to check in I was given a ticket and the agent asked me to go to the service counter. I asked why and he informed me that the flight was 3 hours delayed. At the service desk they informed me that I had been unreachable when they tried to inform me about 45 minutes previously. As if that would have made a difference. I asked why there was a delay and was told it was a maintenance issue or a refilling issue. In neither case does that explain an unscheduled delay. I certainly won't choose to fly them again without some testimony suggesting my experience is highly irregular.

### "lost loyal travellers"
Denpasar to Singapore. I am a regular customer of Tigerair and in general quite satisfied with their value for money proposition. Now for our upcoming holiday I forgot to turn off the 20 kg add-on luggage option that is the standard option for all of my 5 family members both ways. At 27$ per person the maximum added costs is 270$. When I called their service hotline for some leniency it was made clear that once confirmed nothing could be refunded. Actually the lady said that "no refund is possible for all services you added. I calmly made clear to her that I didn't add anything but that her airline added it for me. Still, nothing could be done. Tigerair just lost a whole family of loyal travellers.

### "values customers time"
On 28 September 2015, my friend and I were flying back from Taipei to Singapore at 1730. Our flight was cancelled due to Typhoon Dujuan. All other flights were also cancelled and we had to find our own accommodations as most of the hotels around the airport were full. We were told to return to the airport at 9am for a flight at 1245 on 29 September. When we returned, the airport was chaotic due to the large number of cancelled flights the previous day. Many of the budget airlines had cancelled their flights and their passenger had to find tickets for themselves as no replacement flights were given. We obtained our new boarding passes and proceeded to the gate. Unfortunately, there were not enough buses to bring us to our plane and we finally departed Taipei at 2am. During the flight, some passengers were concerned that they were absent from work for 2 days and requested a letter from the airline to explain the situation. When we finally arrived in Singapore at 6am. The COO of Tiger irways came on board our flight to apologize for the delay and gave every passenger a letter and S$200 cash! I was never a big fan of Tiger until this moment. Not only did this budget airline give us a replacement flight. They must have lost a great deal of money for our flight since the one way fare from Taipei to Singapore is only about S$150! This is a company that values customers time, convenience and business. This is not even an action that a full fare airline would have taken. I will always make Tiger Airways my first priority from now on.

### "no attempt to communicate delay"
Tigerair flight from Bangalore to Singapore delayed by 3 hours through midnight and the airline manager sheepishly mentioned that a few passengers did get the notification when it was obvious that the airline made no attempt to communicate the delay. The intention was not to make the travel at all convenient for its passengers.

### "it's a decent airline"
Singapore to Bangkok with Tigerair, a budget Asian carrier. It's hub is in Singapore and it flies a pretty extensive network around Southeast Asia. In-laws in Singapore recommended Tiger over its main competitors, AirAsia and JetStar. We have flown with them numerous times, the latest being a trip to Bngkok and back. Checking in at Changi in Singapore was a breeze as there was, for the first time, no line at the counter. Checking in at Bangkok was a lot more troublesome, as a group of seven was in line ahead of us and, instead of using the group check-in line, used the regular line. A substantial line developed behind this group as the Tigerair agent appeared to be relatively new on the job and seemed flustered. Another agent opened up and he took care of us quickly. Tigerair has a good boarding system, when they follow it, and so boarding is usually quite quick. Tiger has a couple of A319's, but mostly use A320's on their routes. Seat pitch is minimal at 30", so it's a little hard on me at 6'2" tall, but it's not unbearable as most of the flights we take are only 2-2.5 hours in duration. There is no IFE, meal or beverage service (unless paid for) and no in-seat power. Planes are kept quite neat and the seats, apart from the legroom, are pretty comfortable. I wouldn't want to fly Tiger much more than the 2-2.5 hours that we've done in the past, but for flights under this duration, it's a decent airline and, much to the shame of this American, offers a similar flight experience to the big three US legacy carriers.

### "on time and quite economical"
We were 4 people travelling from Bangalore to Denpasar via Singapore. Tigerair is a budget airline. No check-ins are allowed. Cabin baggage of 2 per person with max 10Kg each. Since there's airport transfer in Singapore, we need to pay extra money and is not included in ticket. We had no idea and were in shock when we were asked to pay INR 7700 (S$40 per person) in Bangalore airport. Ground staff couldn't explain us the reason why we need to pay and couldn't help us to pay online for the return either. They said that had we paid online 48hrs in advance, it's about INR 2000 lesser but unfortunately, we had no idea. For return journey, we couldn't figure out in Tigerair website and  had to pay the same amount in Singapore airport. In Singapore airport, a person explained the reason for payment and was very helpful for our queries. I wish Tigerair had given more information ahead or include it in ticket since it needs to be paid anyway. Even in website, it's very difficult to determine how to pay the amount online. We had long wait in Singapore (9.5hr). We couldn't avail free Singapore trip (Changi airport offers that) since we were on budget airline and we didn't have a Singapore visa and Indian passport is not allowed for transit or on-arrival visa. On positive side, timings were maintained perfectly and quite economical.

### "Kudos to the TigerAir ground crew"
My wife and my three children aged 6, 4 and 1 were travelling from Ipoh to Singapore on Tigerair 2483 on the 29th November 2015. Being a small airport, we were pleasantly surprised by the attentive ground crew who helped my wife and I carry out cabin carry-ons up the stairway to the aircraft and all the way to our seats. That certainly helped us greatly as the distance from the waiting area to the aircraft requires about a 200m walk across the tarmac. With the ground crew help we could carry our infant and hold the hands of our toddlers. Kudos to the TigerAir ground crew at Ipoh Airport, Malaysia!

### "don't expect any help"
Our Tigerair flight was from Denpasar to Phuket via Singapore. As the connection was under 8hrs the booking included the tigerconnect which ensures baggage is transferred straight through the connection airport without having to collect yourself etc. When checking in we were told we had to pay a further 400kIDR for the tigerconnect. When I explained we had already paid for the service, the staff said I should call head office to make the complaint and there was nothing they could do as they did not work for Tigerair! We received no help at the Tigerair desk in Terminal 2 connections at Singapore airport. Staff was more interested in watching youtube and smirked when I asked if he could call someone who could help. I have complained through the portal and tweeted but received one reply ignoring the issue. I haven't received any further help. There were also random gate changes before take off. The flights themselves were ok. Overall a pretty poor airline, and if you have an issue don't expect any help!

### "offered assistance"
Have always flown with Tiger as my choice of budget airlines, and so far only Tiger have not given me flight delay problems. Recently I just booked another flight to travel in November. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I was forced to cancel the trip. Although Tiger have stated their policy as no refund and no cancellation, the staff at Tiger truly went the extra mile for me and my family. They offered direct and correct channels of assistance and help, were cheerful throughout. Alternatives were given for me to choose, and they resolved all issues. Thank you Tiger, the human touch is really felt.

### "services are getting better"
I could fly one way on Tigerair Singapore to and from different destination at low cost. Inflight beverages at reasonable price as desired. Online booking is easy after first time. The total cost for each flight could be inflated by default charges. Untick those unwanted items like checkin bag, insurance, sms alert - will show the difference. My family and I flew more than 8 flights a year with Tigerair Singapore last 6 years. Never encountered technical delay, newer plane could be the reasons. Cabin services are getting better each flight.

### "a nightmare came true"
Tigerair was a nightmare came true! After enbarking and disembarking twice because of severe technical problems (the whole process lasted for 8 hours), and in that time we got no food and no drinks. More imporzant we received no information from staff. We, a group of 23 decided to take another flight. The staff was not able to get our luggage and after another 4 hours and endless discussions we get our luggage, and booked a flight with KLM to Singapore.

### "I am still waiting"
The communication and coordination of the Tigerair ground staff leaves a lot to be desired. Leaving from Bali to Singapore we were told a certain gate number (Gate 6) by the board and check in counter. Sometime during the 30mins before the flight is supposeD to depart, some passengers found out the Gate number has changed to Gate 5 thru the information board. About 150 passengers got up to relocate. At the time of departure (we have not boarded the plane) there was no one manning Gate 5. Instead we hear over the speaker that the plane will be delayed by 5 mins. Approximately another 20 mins passed and once again TigerAir got its passengers to play musical chairs. The info board sneakily updated the Gate number back to 6. No communication from the ground staff still at this point. All passengers dragged themselves to Gate 6. So this time, after we have been waiting patiently for 35 mins after the plane was meant to depart, we suddenly were informed the plane will be further delayed by 1 hour. No explanation was given whatsoever. As yet, I am still waiting. I haven't even boarded the plane and I'm already regretting "flying" with Tiger Air. It's a good thing Bali airport has free wifi so I can spend my time writing this review. I will send another review if the flight itself has any redeeming factors. Otherwise, I would recommend not flying with Tiger Air.

### "Within 24 hours TigerAir responded"
During my first Tigerair online booking I encountered an error ID which did not allow me to complete my payment after I have submitted my credit card information. When I tried to book again I saw that the price has gone up and thought it could be due to December peak season. However upon checked out I have realized that for reason unknown the additional cost was due to the 25kg baggage fee charged to three of us. I have deselected this option in my first try but in my second try the luggage add-on was selected without me realizing it. Immediately I wrote in to the Tigerair customer portal and within 24 hours I have received a response from TigerAir that there's no refund once a booking is made. I wrote in again and attached a screen shot I have captured on the error problem ID and explained that I understand the no refund policy on flight. However as we plan to travel light we do not need the extra luggages and request for TigerAir review and at least explain what's the problem ID was? Within 24 hours Tigerair responded and agreed to refund the luggage add-on. This is really great customer service and they understand that I am willing to pay for what I need and I appreciate the TigerAir team's flexibility in looking at my plight. For this, a big thank you to TigerAir. On a side note, the Feedback Portal is not easy to locate and I can't reply to the response from the Call Center from my email and has to raised a new response by going back to the TigerAir customer portal. This is quite inconvenient. I appreciate the response within 24 hours that was great! Thanks again.

### "smooth flight and seat reasonably comfortable"
Flight was delayed by 2 hours, they would have known this at the time of check-in but said nothing until departure time came and went and still no incoming aircraft (and even then only when a couple of us demanded an update). On board experience was fine, smooth flight and seat reasonably comfortable. A special mention for the food - I pre-ordered a vegetarian "Tomato Koora", this was small and predominantly rice, but has to be one of the tastiest meals I can remember, airline or otherwise. I would fly Tigerair again, but I would make sure (as I did this time) that I allowed a long gap between connecting flights.

### "I will fly with Tiger again"
Enjoyed a smooth Tigerair flight from Singapore to Bangkok on Tiger Airways. Check-in was easy since I did so 72hrs before the flight and had the boarding pass printed for direct-to-gate clearance. Did not experience the queue and waiting time was almost zero, allowing me lots of time to shop at duty free. It was an early morning flight. A slight detour meant we had to board the plane which was parked on the tarmac. Onboard the crew were friendly and professional. I will fly with Tiger again for my next trip to Bangkok.

### "Telephone customer service unhelpful"
Telephone customer service was unhelpful. I booked a late flight (6:15pm) from Melbourne to Brisbane due to commitment,s however the airline moved me onto the 12:30pm flight ($32 cheaper than I paid). I required a refund as they advised they could not book me on a later flight. The refund will be processed within 3-4 weeks. Throughout my phone call I asked the customer service representative "why can i still book the 6.15pm flight online (price is now $169)? She advised me that the flight is unavailable and will not be flying on this day. How can Tigerair or third party providers continue to sell flights for a future flight which is 7 weeks away knowing that it will not be running for a cost of $169? This seems like a dishonest money making scheme as they will continue to transfer passengers who have paid $169 for the 6.15pm flight to the 12.30pm flight which is currently selling for $69. Tigerair is currently making $100 per passenger who books the 6.15pm flight as this is a preferable flying time only to be moved onto an unpopular timeslot.

### "I had a very pleasant experience"
I had a very pleasant experience with Tigerair. It was only a short flight from Singapore to Hanoi, but I was looked after and would be very happy to travel with them again. What I was most impressed with was their incredibly fast reply to my recent request for them to resend my e-ticket from almost 2 months ago. It was literally 15 minutes, if that. I am extremely impressed with their post flight customer service.

### "staff went an extra mile"
Great Service. I was travelling Tigerair from DPS to SIN on flight TR2289, 31st August 2015. I had  mild motion sickness on the particular flight. Just as I got to my seat the cabin crew came forward and asked me if I need anything, just to make sure I was alright. Tigerair staff went an extra mile to check on me every 10-15 minutes.

### Tigerair customer review
I fly Tigerair 2 to 3 times a month on the Singapore to Saigon route. The flight leaves on time from SIN 99% of the time and from SGN maybe 95% of the time but always arrive on time. The staff are friendly and efficient, the plane is always clean though I wish they would update the in-flight magazine more often. If you want to eat anything, you need to pre-order. The food is okay but it's really not necessary to eat anything on such a short flight. Changi has plenty of good food. I used to fly VietJet but it has become such a horrible airline. I have no real complaints about Tiger. It's a good airline.

### Tigerair customer review
That was the first time I'd flown with a low-cost airline and I felt a bit worried at first but everything ended up okay. The flight was smooth and nearly punctual. Staff was a bit cold but I had no problem about that. No food and beverages was served for free so better prepare your own. Overall I had a decent round trip SGN-SIN. I will consider flying with them again if possible.

### Tigerair customer review
This flight was operated by Tigerair Taiwan, and redeye flight was 80% full. Food is unique, all is Taiwanese local delight but portion was too small. Seat was almost same with other LCC like Jetstar Asia, Vanilla Air etc.

### Tigerair customer review
First time flying on Tigerair: Penang-Singapore-Penang in March 2015. Cabin crew (especially on the Sg-Pg flight) were very helpful and pleasant. Flights departed on time in fact arriving ahead of time in Singapore. I utilised the web-check-in from Sg and had direct-to-gate eligibility - this is a good feature. Would definitely consider Tigerair for future flights.

### Tigerair customer review
KUL-SIN. Flight boarded in an organized fashion. Flight attendants smiling and friendly - even when dealing with an unruly passenger who wouldn't sit in his assigned seat. Flight is 45 minutes so quick up and down but the FA's came thru with Duty Free and a drink cart. Clean A320. Tight seats but still my knees didn't touch the seat in front of me. For a short hop its fine. Wouldn't want to go more than 2 hours with them however. Nice airline.

### Tigerair customer review
Took TR SIN-MFM on 6 October 2014. Flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. Seat was okay though there was quite a jostle between other passengers trying to squeeze their numerous hand carry into the limited overhead compartments. Ordered the double croissant chicken ham meal and it was surprisingly very good. The croissants was flaky the flakes were crispy and it was warm moist and buttery inside. Service was prompt and friendly. For the rates offered could have flown full-service airlines like CX or SQ on promo fare to HK instead. However as no other airlines fly the SIN-MFM route this is the best (and only) option so far.

Just flew TR2465 Sep 20 2014 9V-TAN KUL (gate L3 ) - SIN (E23) 18.36-19.23. Excellent service seat not comfortable but since a short 47 mins flight it satisfied.

My last flight with Tigerair was from Singapore to Cochin. It arrived some 20 mins before even though it was pouring outside. Nice smooth flight with some enjoyable bumps on the descent into Cochin. Pilot's announcements clearly heard.

Took TR2904 SIN-MFM on 4 August 2014. Flight was punctual service friendly seat quite comfortable for a budget air. One of my best TR flight so far.

### Tigerair customer review
1st time on budget carrier TR2288 on 15 Jun  lots of people almost full flight a brand new aircraft A320 sharklets. More comfortable breathing than 20 Jun RI836 stuffy aircon. Staff were very friendly the duty free was on 30% discount. When disembarking the plane the staff cheerfully greeted passengers. Ground staff were good. Not so strict with baggage weight compared to some airlines. Overall I will not mind flying Tiger Airways again.

RI836 20 June 2014. Early arrival into Changi airport food reasonable and good. Staff forgot to clear the tray a kind passenger helped me to tell the staff to clear my tray. Staff do help people to pack their luggage in the overhead compartment.

Flew Tigerair from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore on June 28 2014. Clean aircraft since this is a bargain airline there are no classes of service. There was a delay leaving because of a passenger and their luggage but we made up the time flying. Flight staff was nice even though this was only a 45 minute they still did a beverage service. Everything with this airline costs $$$ I am surprised they didn't charge you to use the bathroom! There was actually more legroom on this aircraft than there is on Air Asia but they are snug seats for sure. The seats do recline quite a bit again more than on Air Asia. I think my coke cost $4.00 SD. No complaints about the flight staff landing was a bit bumpy but that happens.

### Tigerair customer review
We travelled to and from Chennai (India)-Singapore on 9th June and 16th June 2014. Flight was not at all comfortable take off and landing were bumpy. It's accepted that flight is one of the cheapest for Asia pacific region but they could at least serve a glass of water for free on a flight of 4 hours. All drinks including water cost 4 s$. Space between seats is too small to be comfortable.

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore-Phnom Penh 12 June 2014 and PHN-SIN 13 June 2014. Both flights on time. Load was full plane clean and service prompt. Announcements clear. Both flight landings were bumpy. The onboard drinks were overpriced. It should be cheaper in order to generate more sales. For the price and on time it is a good deal.

### Tigerair customer review
Denpasar (Bali Indonesia) - Singapore - Bangalore (India) May 2014. The departure time for my Bali-Singapore flight was advanced by a few hours with no prior intimation. They claimed that they had sent me an e-mail but no such thing was done. Second they put me on a later flight from Bali to Singapore. When I pointed out that this would leave me just 40 minutes to catch my connecting flight to Bangalore they assured me that that would be fine and they would have someone assist me at the airport. On reaching Singapore I practically ran to the Transfer Desk at Singapore only to be told that check-ins were closed for the Bangalore flight (which was running full) and I could only be accommodated in the next flight 24 hours later. My protests about what I was told at Bali fell on deaf ears. Tiger refused to provide me accommodation and I was invited to spend the night at the terminal. They did give me meal vouchers which are accepted in exactly two restaurants in the entire airport. As long as things go fine Tiger is OK after all my journey in the other direction (Bangalore - Singapore - Bali) had passed off without incident. However once something unusual happens you will feel the full impact of Tiger's service (the lack of it rather).

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi and Bangkok to Singapore. Tigerair has got a gem in the Straight to Gate service in Singapore - no queues no need to check in at airport if all you have is a carry on bag and for the period of time I was travelling I also got a complimentary cup of coffee at Changi T2! Singapore to Bangkok a full flight. Aircraft had old livery and old blue seats seat comfort was ok legroom was tight and no recline (I was placed in Row 11 in front of emergency exit rows). Cabin service was good on this flight. Bangkok to Singapore was a newer aircraft with slightly more comfortable black leather seats (same seat pitch as previous flight) and I was again assigned a seat in Row 11. Flight was completely full. Service on this flight was quicker than the last - meals were sold/served 10 minutes after take-off and duty free immediately after that. Arrival in Singapore was 20 minutes ahead of schedule gate to immigration in under 5 minutes. Tigerair is a pretty good experience and excellent value for money (I got my tickets in a web sale) but pay to select your seat if you can (lest you get assigned a really lousy row like mine).

### Tigerair customer review
I flew from Singapore to Penang with Tiger recently. At the boarding gate there was 1 hour delay for the flight where the airline didn't even make an announcement. The plane was an old A320 which had an old cabin with crammed seats. My tray table was broken and seats did not recline properly. After we took off I asked the stewardess for a soft drink but she just told me to ask later. The bathrooms were okay but the flush was not working and no water in the sink. From now on I will not fly Tiger again unless I have no choice.

### Tigerair customer review
Chennai-Spore-Jakarta on 22 Apr. I have taken 8 flights on TR in the India-Spore-Indonesia sector and all were on time. Clean planes and pleasant crew. I have only two comments. I always select a first row seat and pay around $ 25 for it. Normally the middle seat will be vacant (no one wants to pay for a middle seat) which gives you some elbow room. However on 3 occasions when the flight was full passengers who had not paid the extra were given free access to to the front row making the paying passengers regret their decision. I have taken lot more flights in AirAsia also in the first row but I have not encountered this situation there. My second complaint is about the "board me first" privilege which is charged at $ 5. This is never enforced at Chennai Jakarta and Bandung. It is announced at Spore but on my last flight passengers were bussed to the plane and the boarding order was how one got off the bus. I will not be paying for this useless privilege in future.

### Tigerair customer review
I flew from Singapore to Denpasar with a friend under the same booking. We didn't pay to select our seats when ordering online. The check-in staff assigned us separate seats blaming full flights and we were the last few to check in (although we arrived at the counter almost 2 hours before the flight). We boarded the plane and found both our individual seats had been occupied by 2 people from 2 different groups which like us had their seats assigned separately as well. What's worse is there are 2 empty unassigned seats adjacent to each other a few rows in front of us - thankfully we ended up in those seats. The feeling I get is this is a set-up to traumatise passengers and pay to select seats in future flights. I know it is innocent until proven guilty but consider yourself warned.

### Tigerair customer review
Flight DG7933 3 April that is now Hong Kong to Clark PHP. They continually cancel flights disregard your paid for premium seating supply you with the wrong terminal information advertise down town check in at Hong Kong but close it 5 hours before the flight. Have not boarded thr plane yet but everything else has been a mess.

### Tigerair customer review
The website is not exactly user friendly. The fares are really not all that cheap and had there been a reasonable legacy carrier flying to my destination I would have taken that. Ground staff was borderline rude and slow. The planes may be clean but the seats are cramped (esp. if you are tall) and there is hardly any leg room unless you pay (even more) and upgrade to an exit aisle seat. Cabin staff on the outbound leg were alright but on the return leg were not friendly or attentive. I've flown several budget airlines in Europe Australia and Asia and Tigerair is without a shade of doubt at the bottom of my list.

### Tigerair customer review
Manila - Singapore - Manila (March 7 2014). Check-in was flawless ground crew very friendly pushback on time. Landed at Changi ahead of the scheduled arrival. Flight crew friendly seats very comfortable. Flight crew uniform is horrible. Return flight to Manila excellent. I just wish the check-in agents at Changi were friendly.

### Tigerair customer review
Satisfactory flight from Singapore to Hong Kong. Good value for money and friendly staff.

### Tigerair customer review
Bangkok - Manila Clark - Bangkok. The flight was fine and on time (better than when SE Air operated the route). The problem now is that there is no bus connection from Clark to Manila late at night the only option to get to Manila being a ridiculously expensive Taxi (50% of the air ticket cost) or a Jeepney ride into town and a bus to Manila. Getting back to Clark for a 0800 Departure was just too much hassle so I threw my ticket in the bin and flew Cebu Pacific out of MNL.

### Tigerair customer review
Phuket to Hong Kong with an overnight transfer in Singapore. In-flight experince was ok. Ground service was unacceptable. Cabin crew were well trained and spoke excellent English. You pay for everything from selecting seat to prioritized boarding to drinking water on board. Seat pitch is fine I paid 20 USD for a front row. Flight was delayed 30 mins for both legs. We paid 20USD for TigerConnect which allows us to claim the boarding pass for connecting flight with no need to pass immigration. We were surprised we couldn't be checked in until 3am the next morning! No chance no place to negotiate. Even the immigration officer said it should work and agreed to let us in if we have a b/p from Tiger check-in. When we arrived in HKG our checked luggage was left in Singapore. They promised to deliver our luggage by midnight to my hotel. Not surprisingly we ended up collecting our luggage back at HK airport the next afternoon. However cabin service was quite good.

### Tigerair customer review
Flying from Clark to Singapore the only choices are budget carriers - I chose Tiger over Cebu Pacific because their timing allowed me 7 hours instead of 3 to make my connecting flight in Singapore. When I arrived at the airport at 6.30am along with 140 others I received the news that the scheduled 08.00 service would be departing 12.10 at the earliest. None of us had been contacted - ground staff were apologetic but said they had only just learned themselves. I felt foolish for choosing Tiger as I watched the 12.10 Cebu Pacific flight depart on time by then knowing that our plane was still on its way back from Hong Kong. Updated information was hard to come by luckily I found out just in time to change my onward flight that our departure would be more like 2pm. The flight itself was OK but it was quite bemusing that they delivered the standard "thank you for flying with us hope to see you again soon" script on landing without a hint of irony. Lesson learned - I'll not use Tiger again if I have to connect to another airline.

### Tigerair customer review
Took flight from Denpasar to Singapore. No problems great plane friendly staff. When I read comments about flight cancellations I realize that those who complained probably never read the terms and conditions and just ticked it without knowing these eventual consequences.

### Tigerair customer review
Flew from SIN to HKG on the very early morning flight on Friday 24th Jan and returned HKG to SIN on the mid morning flight on Sunday 26th Jan. Both flights departed on time and landed HKG on time and landed SIN 15 mins early. Boarding was prompt. Good effort Tigerair.

### Tigerair customer review
We decided to give Tiger a try for the first time we were on a pretty tight budget. The booking process was smooth enough however the airport check in would prove a nightmare. We were flying Brisbane to Sydney. Tiger does state on the booking that check in closes 45 minutes prior to departure. We made it to the airport terminal with about 55 minutes to spare. With a toddler and 3 suitcases in tow we began looking for the Tiger check in area. Signs and directions were almost non existent but we eventually found 3 self check in computers against a wall near the Jetstar area. By the time this happened we had 41 minutes to departure and the computer advised us to go to the counter. Once again the Tiger counters are difficult to find where we discovered there were no Tiger staff. The 2 Tiger check in staff members also double as the boarding staff at the gate. We had to get information from other airline staff and were told they won't be back until the next check in which was 3 hours away. By pure luck one of the staff members returned to pick something up and advised us that it would cost $85pp for the flight change. Needless to say we spent a little extra and booked Virgin. I do take full responsibility for not allowing enough time at the airport but Tiger should at least have a customer service rep available in the terminal at all times. There was simply no information available.

### Tigerair customer review
I booked Bangkok to Clark with Tiger Air Philippines (ex SEair) early November after Air Asia cancelled my original flights. The flight was re-timed once after I booked it but on the day operated absolutely on schedule. Cabin interior was spotless crew were friendly and even the seat pitch was decent. My only criticism is of the pricing of in-flight food - the prices are in PHP but if you want to pay in Thai Baht you pay the same figure (1PHP = 1THB) - a 35% hit which means a small bag of nuts can cost you over $8! Bring Pesos or bring your own food.

### Tigerair customer review
Flew SIN-BKK and BKK-SIN. Both trips were smooth. Will fly with Tiger again for my regional trips. Cheapest and value for money.

### Tigerair customer review
SIN-CGK SIN-HKG-SIN. A good experience with a low cost airline. The seat was comfortable compared to other low cost airlines but a little bit small legroom. Staff was friendly for both flight. Recommend flying with Tiger Airways especially for a great promotion.

### Tigerair customer review
Will never consider flying them again. Was refused check-in for being 5 mins past their 45 min cut off. This may have been almost understandable apart from the fact that the flight left 25 min late due to an earlier problem.

### Tigerair customer review
First time flying with Tigerair. BKK-SIN-JOG. Thanks to Tiger Connect easy transit in Singapore. Both flights were on time and the I had a meal as well the food was really good. The only problem is I cannot check in online. However the check-in in Bangkok was really efficient. All crew were polite and friendly.

### Tigerair customer review
KUL-SIN-KUL. A nice budget airline compared to other airlines. The queues were quick and easy during check in and staff also friendly. Prices were also reasonable.

### Tigerair customer review
Flew from Kalibo to Manila yesterday. The woman behind me never switched off her phone for the whole flight and the woman in front of me was happily watching her iPad to relieve the boredom of take off. Staff couldn't have cared less after I pointed it out to them. The woman watching the iPad during take off had it sitting on her tray table. Safety regulations are made for a reason I assume and not a choice for the passenger to choose to follow.

### Tigerair customer review
SIN-TPE return. As this is a budget airline I was not expecting any superb service as you get what you pay for. However I would not fly again on Tiger Air for a flight more than 2 hours as the SIN-TPE route which takes 4.5 hours was very uncomfortable with the very crammed legroom. I needed assistance from the cabin crew and when I walked to the front of the plane found the crew to be sleeping. Overall it's one of the cheapest airlines to fly and by not expecting service standards to be like the standards of the normal full-fare airlines you will get along fine.

### Tigerair customer review
Bangkok - Clark round trip. Due to their dreadful on time record over the past 12 months it seems like Tiger have had enough of SE Air operating this service and it's now a Tigerair operated route. Bang on time departures and early arrivals on both flights (something the SE Air never managed). The aircraft is the same but the Cabin Crew are in Tiger uniforms. Hopefully the reliability (and the low prices) will be maintained.

### Tigerair customer review
17 Aug 13 Flight TR2639 from Chennai to Singapore and flight TR2204 from Singapore to Bandung. Both flights left on time. First flight arrived 25 min before time and the second arrived 5 min before time. Check in at Chennai was slow probably because I arrived 150 min before departure. Only two counters were open. The third counter opened after 20 minutes. In all it took 40 min to check in. For both flights I had booked seats on the first row at some cost but it seemed to be worth the money. There was no one else in the first row on both flights although the flights were quite full. Crew was very friendly on both flights. Tiger now transfer baggage between many connecting flights at SIN (for a USD 13 transfer fee) and this does away with the hassle of passing through immigration retrieving baggage and checking in again.

### Tigerair customer review
We found Tiger to be a great airline when traveling from Singapore to Hanoi. The check-in was great with early check-in available at Singapore airport We had purchased Board-Me-First which is a definite advantage and we found the in-flight staff to be lovely. We would fly Tiger again.

### Tigerair customer review
Arrived in Singapore with 2 hours to get on my Tiger Air flight to Hong Kong. Got my boarding pass with my checked bag fine and carry on bag fine. Just about to go through the Departure and was followed by a Tiger Air employee who said that my partner and I needed to also weigh our 2 other personal items we were planning to take on board along with our carry on. The extra purse and wrapped paintings were 13 kg total and our extra cost would be $390.00 ($30 per kg). We decided to remove some items and we did that as soon as we found out. We just did that and were told that the flight was now closed and that we would have made it if we had just paid the extra weight charge of $390. Had to purchase new air tickets for a flight the next day.

### Tigerair customer review
Route DPS-SIN RI834. Flight was late and it seemed that crew did not care - boarding and after boarding was slow and inefficient. First 1 hour late boarding added 45 minutes to the delay. To my surprise its not permitted to consume beverage or food that is not purchased on the plane. Check-in granted a connect in Singapore to our next flight but it turned out not to be the case on arrival.

### Tigerair customer review
BKK-CRK-BKK Tiger Flight operated by SE Air. On check-in I was told the flight was on time. An hour later it had slipped 4 hours and a couple of hours later was further delayed. It eventually turned up 10 hours late for a 3.5 hour flight to Clark. No apology explanation or acknowledgement of the delay was made by any crew member. A week later on return to BKK they cancelled their Monday flight a few days before travel and offered a refund or a Tuesday flight. Dreadful service.

Flew round trip from Singapore to Krabi delayed on tarmac for an hour on SIN-Krabi leg without any notification from pilot on return leg was delayed by 5 hours. On previous trips have faced similar delays consistently. Granted its a LCC but would choose Jetstar over Tiger any day.

### Tigerair customer review
6/3/13. From Singapore to Manila. Family of 4 was seated middle seat scattered rows. We paid $400 for 4 after booking 1 year ago. There was an excess of 25 kg in our luggage which the check in attendant already knew and she still gave us our boarding pass. She left us waiting in front of the counter and came back only to assist and organize the long line behind us. We left and walked to security only to be stopped by a Tiger personnel. He confiscated all our boarding passes weighed all our carry on baggage and demanded that we either re-pack and get rid of some things. It was too late for us to check in bag. We had to pay before boarding. Meanwhile the plane was a very tight space. Very uncomfortable seats my daughter and I got the worst mine wouldn't recline as I was in front of ER exit and she was next to a yelping baby. If there is another option stay away from Tiger Airlines!

### Tigerair customer review
I have to say that for a LCC I love Tiger. You pay very little for your ticket thus you cannot expect a premium product. My BKK-SIN flight left on time was predictable a new plane and got me home content. Given what I paid it matched my expectation. I got great service by check-in staff. Staff were accommodating and charged me less than they should have. The only thing they could do is introduce web-check-in for this flight. Not sure why some Tiger routes have it and some don't.

### Tigerair customer review
Recently booked a flight with Tiger as it was the cheapest option at the time. When there was an issue with the booking confirmation dealing with the Tiger customer service team was the most painful thing I have had to endure. The airline itself may not be so bad but dealing with a minor issue that may happen is not worth the money you may save. I ended up having to re-book a complete different return trip with a different company and just forfeit the money I had spent on the trip with Tiger initially.

### Tigerair customer review
Recent flight SIN-HKG-SIN was pleasant and met its objectives of being safe and reliable. My only comment is their seats are relatively cramped. But considering that this is a budget airline and the ticket price the comfort criteria has to take a backseat.

### Tigerair customer review
Traveled from Singapore to Bangalore on 19th April. Flight delayed 45 mins. I am 5ft 5 inches tall and found the leg space to be very cramped. I bet it will be a nightmare for anyone taller than me! Considering the amount of money I am saving I will give a thumbs-up for this airline!

### Tigerair customer review
We flew into Singapore on our way to Krabi in Thailand and the connecting flight was with Tiger the following day. I have to say I was a bit apprehensive but there was nothing to be concerned about in Singapore. We arrived early the next day and were allowed to check in at the Tiger Early Check In counter - absolutely no issues here nor any additional costs. The bonus was when the check in lady gave us invitations to visit the SAT business class lounge on the top floor. We didn't ask and she didn't say anything about it. My wife saw the invitation when checking her documents. This was an unexpected surprise and was very much appreciated. The boarding was seamless and although the flight only had one class and held many passengers it was cheap and clean. Aircrew were very professional and did a great job on a 90 minute flight. I am intrigued by all the negative comments about Tiger and it is clear many low cost passengers expect silver service from budget airlines. They should understand that they would never have travel opportunities without these LC Airlines and learn to appreciate them more.

### Tigerair customer review
Tiger left me stranded in Philippines. Booked Bangkok to Clark Manila on return to Clark told there was something wrong with my booking and that there was no record of me on there computer and that it was a website malfunction. Refused to let me fly and made me pay for another flight the next day at 3 times the price I had paid although it was there fault. Not interested in my protests just left me stuck in the airport. Since then tried to get money back from Tiger but all emails and phone calls ignored. Avoid this airline customer service is non existent.

### Tigerair customer review
A 1 hour morning flight to Singapore was almost 8 hours late! Things happen and everyone wants safety to be the first concern but tell your customers what is happening and what your course of action is to satisfy customers. Many passengers missed connections for which they had to pay out of pocket for new tickets. Tiger waited 4.5 hours before ordering a second plane to fly in and take us to Singapore. Then we had to wait for the plane to arrive and refuel etc. There were no company representatives rearranging flights for people no representatives offering a free lunch voucher at the airport or even offering water to people. There seem to be no protocols they follow with these situations. Free drinks were not offered once on the plane. Most passengers paid for a least 2 meals at the airport with no compensation from the airline. People are sympathetic if you acknowledge the situation. The seats are tiny as well. My legs were solidly planted in the back of the seat in front of me.

### Tigerair customer review
I recently flew SIN-KCH return with Tiger. I was very impressed with the efficiency and quality of this budget airline. Flight was on time the plane was immaculately clean and the seat pitch was manageable for a short-haul flight. Friendly and professional cabin crew was a pleasant surprise. I will be happy to fly with Tiger again in the future.

### Tigerair customer review
Flight from Bangkok to Singapore on 4 Jan 2013 was supposed to depart at 09.00. Boarded A320 as normal but it did not take off. Captain announced there was a technical problem of an unknown nature. Sat onboard until 10.00 when the captain told us to return to the departure gate where we were told to wait. Then told to move to another gate to wait. Waited until after 13.00 when they announced the flight was cancelled. During this time fellow passengers were trying to get on alternative flights. There were only a couple of staff to handle hundreds of passengers. We decided to get a refund and ask to retrieve our luggage from the grounded plane. Luggage finally delivered after 15.00. A whole day was wasted by this airline.

### Tigerair customer review
SGN-SIN as TR2323. Check-in and boarding was smooth although Saigon airport isn't a particularly good one. My family and I were on an exit row seat so had plenty of legroom which was extremely good for me as I am nearly 6ft3. Service was limited although that is a Low cost carrier's model. Slightly overpriced items from the menu which were far more expensive than AirAsia. Although departed Saigon nearly 20 mins late my flight somehow arrived two minutes early plus we arrived at terminal two which was a nice terminal Changi as always extremely efficient. At $50 a pot it was outstanding value and would definitely recommend.

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore-Cochin. Cabin crew service was great ample legroom for price did not encounter any problems through the flight. There was a usb port to charge your electronic device and there was also a universal plug point which could be used to charge laptops. Flight was very quick and comfortable and the staff were very professional. There were no delays whatsoever. I highly recommend this airline.

### Tigerair customer review
KUL to SIN onboard. Check-in and immigration at the Low-Cost Carrier Terminal was fast and efficient even though many flights were departing and flight was almost fully booked. Aircraft was a brand-new A320 which arrived 5 minutes before the scheduled departure time resulting in a short delay. Legroom was a little tight - I am just over 5 ft 8 so taller people might find it uncomfortable - but the seats were in excellent condition. Cabin crew were friendly and completed the meal service etc quickly. Baggage was unloaded within 15 minutes or so from disembarkation. All in all I was very impressed.

### Tigerair customer review
A regular flier with this airlines I had no quarrels given the low cost of the tickets. Staff were friendly and courteous much of the time. However one misgiving was on a recent first time flight from Singapore to HKG. A crew member seemed a tad lost on immigration requirement. Wasted time filing up arrival declaration cards (7 in all ) for transit in Hong Kong which could have be done for our actual destination to Shenzhen. Older relatives travelling with me were less knowledgeable on this matter and needed help from me. Overall a nice experience.

### Tigerair customer review
First time to the Philippines. BKK-CRK-BKK 20 - 25 June with Tiger/Seair and was satisfied. Both ways were on time smooth boarding. Cabin staff seemed friendly. Seats were ok for a budget airline. Seat selection and board me first (seat 26A) was a bargain. I would definitely use Seair BKK-CRK-BKK again.

### Tigerair customer review
Paid for "Board me First" and got sent to the wrong queue. Glass barriers prevent changing so boarded in the last group and had no bin space. No apologies from Tiger staff. No IFE and apathetic staff make for a long annoying trip. The value for money is poor. I normally fly Garuda on the same route but they were full. They are 30% cheaper seats are very comfortable and they have good entertainment.

### Tigerair customer review
SIN-PEN. I found the check-in to be inefficient and slow. Staff was not friendly and to be charged for every kg of overweight hand luggage is ridiculous. Boarding was on time and flight attendants were friendly. I feel they are lagging behind other low cost carriers in the region and will try to not use them in future.

SYD-MEL return. The fares were quite cheap at $10 plus associated charges. Check in boarding departure/arrival times and luggage collection were all good. The facilities in MEL are poor though. Will definitely use again.

BKK-CRK-BKK. Second time I've used them on this route. Operated by SE Air. Both flights on time no tech problems with the aircraft. Excellent price compared to Cebu Pacific and aircraft was pretty full both ways so I think they're giving the competition a run for their money. Quick and hassle-free both ways though Clark which is beginning to look like a proper airport - just pity about the transport options to and from the airport.

### Tigerair customer review
KUL-SIN-KUL was my first experience with TR since they offered the cheapest ticket for this route at very last minute. Cabin crew professional and courteous. Food offering good variety (from the menu card). Good inflight reading materials. The best would be boarding process at Budget Terminal. We were queuing in 3 different rows representing front middle and rear seat. The 'rear' group was the last to board. Overall nice flight and lovely flight crews who updated the flight plan in very clear English.

### Tigerair customer review
SIN-HKG-SIN. It is evident that Tiger had improved. Highly efficient cabin crew and flight was on-time for both sectors. Check-in wasn't a problem and I would definitely recommend Tiger given their efficiency and low fares.

### Tigerair customer review
BKK-CRK-BKK. 10 hours late into CRK due to non arrival of the aircraft. So instead of arriving in Clark early afternoon we arrived at midnight. No apologies from the Captain or Crew. The flight is operated not by Tiger but by SE Air. Had I known this I probably would not have booked it - but it was cheap and I was keen to try an alternative to Cebu Pacific who getting increasingly expensive. Return flight was on time and online ticket change was cheap and simple. Return flight was on time no problems.

### Tigerair customer review
Deceptive ticket prices fail to include luggage fees credit card fees and seat-assignment fees. Online check- in is not available so long lines at the airport counter. Stingy luggage policy (7kg per person $70 per piece for check in at the counter) and a three-day-in-advance "luggage reservation" requirement. Pay a few dollars more for another airline and save yourself the aggravation.

### Tigerair customer review
SIN-HAK-SIN. Cheapest option available and pretty decent for a budget airline. Standard A320 with cloth seats which suit me just fine. Legroom adequate which I found surprising as I had issues with legroom using rival airlines'. Did not purchase food on board which is understandably expensive. SIN-HAK was smooth and punctual just that children on board the flight were very noisy. HAK-SIN was delayed and experienced slight turbulence and bad weather delayed landing even more. Overall rather value-for-money.

### Tigerair customer review
Original flight at 11am from Hong Kong to Singapore however flight delayed to 1pm. The flight was suddenly diverted to Ho Chi Minh in the middle of the flight and we got trapped there for nearly 7/8 hours. No staff or any crews were there to assist us! Finally we board the same flight at midnight and arrive Singapore at 3am. We tried to contact Tiger for some explanation and refund yet still no reply from the company.

SIN to KUL return. Boarded on time with no delay landing earlier than estimated. Onboard service is good with reasonable price for items/food sell.

### Tigerair customer review
Travelled from Clark Pampanga to Bangkok. Flight left and arrived on time. Major downside - passengers were made to walk from the terminal gate to the plane. On my return flight however a shuttle was provided for passengers. Also not enough legroom. Overall the price is worth the service though.

### Tigerair customer review
Brilliant with no frills. Prices were final - no surprises. Left on time and landed a touch early. Obviously you pay for onboard snacks but I thought prices were reasonable. Service was efficient and does the job which is all you expect at this price. I think they have turned a corner and would definitely fly them again.

SIN-DVO return. Outbound flight had a slight delay of a few minutes. Inbound flight on time. FA's were attentive and overall experience was ok. I will fly this airline again especially if promo fares are available.

Return flight SIN-KBV. Relatively attractive price only small delays on both flights kind and helpful staff. Generally very good experience. Prices of food and beverages onboard could be lower.

SIN-DVO. Flight to Davao departed 30mins late. Immigration cards were distributed in the airport and it was quite chaotic. The baggage collection was messy as the airport's conveyor belt was too short for all the luggage and some had to be manually carried out by airport staff. Seat was okay for an almost 4hour flight. The return trip was fantastic. Left on time and arrived in Singapore 30mins before scheduled. Very friendly FA's. They use the tube to/from the aircraft at Davao instead of the stairs. Really low fare and no need for a stop over at other airports. Will fly with Tiger again.

SIN-HKT-SIN. Given other reviews we were pleasantly surprised by our first experience on these short flights. Even with baggage and booking fees return trip came to less than GBP90 per person. PDF itinerary was never received by email but it wasn't asked for at check-in. Check-in queue at Changi budget terminal was short and efficient. Flight on time. For return journey no check-in queue at Phuket and we were allocated exit row seats without requesting them. Flight departed on time even though many other flights (including Silk Air to Singapore) were delayed by an hour or two that evening. Plenty of leg room in exit rows but seats don't recline and have no lower-back support. Take a cushion for longer flights! Modern clean cabins on both legs. Would definitely fly Tiger again short-haul.

SGN-SIN and SIN-SGN. Flight to Singapore was 1 hr late. The seat back pockets were filled with rubbish and the floors of the aircraft were filthy. Flight attendants were nice for most part but it seemed like their only responsibility were to sell drinks/food and duty free items. The budget terminal in Singapore seemed "too low cost" since seats weren't provided at the gate. Other than that the flights were good for their value.

### Tigerair customer review
Booked a flight from HK to Singapore due to fly and was told at the counter flight was cancelled. There was no notice thru email or phone left to fend for own self at the airport told to return the next day if I still want to try catch a flight back. No guarantees no apologies and staff was just too eager to ignore. Hotline does not work emails do not too. Once back in Singapore I realise they made double deductions of the same amount on my credit card. Till now no replies no refunds from them.

### Tigerair customer review
Flown a number of times between Perth and Singapore. The website is not user friendly they entice you with low fares and pile on the surcharges for seats baggage credit card use etc. Aircraft's are not cleaned properly I found coffee stains on their tray tables and the magazines and emergency procedure manuals. Staff are dressed poorly in a cotton blouse and slacks. I recently tried calling up the customer care hotline and was answered by a person who couldn't speak English properly. There is a limit to how 'budget' an airline can get.

SIN-BKK-SIN KL-SIN. Checked in 3 hrs early and requested emergency exit seats which was met without pre- booking it. Flight from Bangkok to Singapore was 1 hr late but was usual for a budget airline.

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore-Ho Chi Minh. I thought that the Singapore budget terminal was calm clean and organised. Check-in and queue took about 15 mins and was given exit row without asking. Boarding was by groups of rows and no problems with overhead bin space. Food and drinks offered and seemed much more expensive than other airlines. Cabin crew friendly flight on time nothing to complain about. Cheaper than others on this route.

### Tigerair customer review
I flew with them on the HKT-SIN route. Flight was delayed for 2hr 10mins and captain apologised. Cabin crew looked uninspired but because it was a short night flight everyone was sleeping. For the price I paid I would definitely fly TR again. I just wished they flew out from Changi Terminal 1 instead of the Budget Terminal.

### Tigerair customer review
First time using Tiger and was extremely satisfied. Both HKG-SIN and return were on time smooth boarding. Cabin staff seemed friendly enough and food and drink prices though more expensive than AirAsia are still not too badly priced and a reasonable selection. Seats were about as expected for a budget airline fairly comfortable. And for just HK$1200 round trip it was a bargain and about 1/4 the price of Cathay Pacific! Would definitely use again.

### Tigerair customer review
Very unreliable especially when you are travelling with your infant. They cancelled the flight and notified only upon reaching the airport at the check-in counter which is just 2 hrs before the departure time. They had made alternative arrangements but did not notify me that would involve transit from Singapore-Colombo and 2hrs wait and then to change flight to Chennai. The most shocking part of this travel was this unreliable airline didn't book tickets for my 11 month infant from Colombo-Chennai. The journey which was supposed to be 4 hrs + 3 hrs at both the airports now turned out to be 12hrs. Personnel at Tigerair did not consider how an infant withstand such a long time without proper sleep. Highly disappointed with Tigerair response and arrangement.

### Tigerair customer review
I travelled Chennai-Singapore. Though the travel was comfortable on the 4 hr day flight the customer services are very poor. The basic need of water supply of even one bottle was not arranged by the Airways but available for sale just like a shop. They should charge and include the cost at the time of booking for which no customer will mind for making payment. But once we enter in to the flight our need to be taken care by the Airways. Simply by advertising that the Budget Airways the basic requirement should not be ignored. I have already complained but no response. That indicates the Tigerair is after business only and not for customer care. I hope they will give top priority for customers need also.

### Tigerair customer review
Our flight from Singapore-Bangkok was overbooked. We had to stay in a hotel in Singapore and take the next flight one day later. They told us we could stay in a hotel and get the money back. We never got an answer to our refund requests. They overbooked all flights. Choose Air Asia we had never problems with them.

### Tigerair customer review
Flight cancelled with no notice no email no text - next available flight in two days maybe - queue here for a refund that will take 3 to 6 weeks! - never again no matter how cheap it seems. Be warned!

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore to Phuket a couple of times. I saw the comment : Everyone says you only fly Tiger once! I understand why. Surprisingly this flight was not late as every other flight I took with them. When booking online they keep adding charges for everything even paying with credit card so the saving is not worth the hassle of delayed flights and poor service.

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore to Krabi and return. I arrived at the Budget Terminal at 915 am for the 1025 am flight. There were still a line of about 10 to 15 people waiting to be checked in at the two counters that were open. After a ten minute wait we were checked in. Despite not reserving a seat in advance we were allocated a complete row of six seats. The flight was about 85% full. We boarded about 15 minutes before flight time. It was drizzling and we were offered an umbrella for the short walk to the stairs to board the aircraft. On board the seats were leather-covered. There was a five minute delay in push back and we took off at 1045 am. Once air-borne the crew began buy on board service and well as duty free sale. Service was fuss free and it was a short 80 minute ride to our destination. We landed five minutes behind schedule and proceeded for our holiday. For the return flight we arrived at 1015 am at Krabi Airport for the 1135 am flight. There were queues at the two counters opened for check in. We waited about ten minutes before it was our turn. The flight was full but the agent managed to offer us 6 aisle seats that were not too far from one another. The aircraft arrived about fifteen minutes late from Singapore and that delayed our departure from Krabi as well. Service on board was similar to the inbound flight. Nothing much to expect nor complain about. Just a clean smooth journey back to Singapore. For regional trips in and from Asia Tiger does the job fine and provides affordable point to point service most of the time.

### Tigerair customer review
Our Tigerair flight from Singapore to Perth last night (booked prior online) was just as good as any other budget airline I have flown. True - you don't have any video screens to watch movies and short informative docos on places you will be landing at nor even the flight path and flight info as your travel to your destination but service friendly and attentive; a choice of 3 hot Asian meals and snacks and usual food / drink you can buy. A320 was clean with no problems. Maybe the Asia side of Tigerair is more passenger friendly and organised? but give them a go if you're travelling around Asia.

### Tigerair customer review
India to Singapore and back to India. There was nothing to complain about. I purchased the tickets when they had an offer where the return ticket was only 1 USD. 4 of us travelled and including the return ticket it came to around 58 USD including baggage cost for two 20 kgs and one 15 kg. The flight departed from Chennai late by 30 mins but we reached Singapore on time. Check their website frequently for any such frequent offers that they provide to get such a low cost ticket.

### Tigerair customer review
Manila to Singapore very smooth and on time. Friendly and smiling cabin crew. The captain kept us updated of the weather situation en route to Singapore. With ticket less than $USD40 to Singapore I couldn't ask for more.

SIN-KUL. Basic service around 75% aircraft capacity. Despite the many complaints on this carrier yet to have any to have a bad experience myself.

### Tigerair customer review
HKG-SIN good flight since got exit row seating. Plane new condition and clean. Brought carry- on bag without issue. No complains except for the really tacky uniforms the attendants have to wear.

### Tigerair customer review
I have been using Tigerair lately. For the flight route that I used the fares have always been the cheapest. This goes to their priority seating price as well. Cabin quality is among the best in the budget airlines industry. For punctuality in departure and arrival it often missed the schedule though not by a lot. Didn't encounter hours of delay as experienced by some here. Another shorting is they do not have much food selection as compared to say Air Asia. However their in-flight shopping list is more impressive.

Hanoi to Singapore on new A320 plane. On time arrival and departure in Hanoi. Service was good hot meals available on 3 hour flight. Not a full flight so we could move around. Landing was smooth budget terminal basic but quick to clear customs.

Perth to HCM through Singapore & returned 5 days later. Really cheap on time no frills food or drink carry on luggage. I am 6' so a bit tight but Great value for money.

### Tigerair customer review
Singapore to Perth. We were careful about our cabin baggage limit and whilst we had pre- purchased 25kg checked baggage knew we would exceed this and have to purchase extra 15kg. Earlier reviews prompted us to arrive early for check-in expecting queues. We arrived early to find a special "early check-in " queue. We checked in our 2 bags totalled around 30kgwe had bought 25kg but no extra charge. Slight black mark when our priority boarding status was not recognised and we were put in the wrong queue - sorted that ourselves. Flight was on time and very smooth cabin crew excellent.
