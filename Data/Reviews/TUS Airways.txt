### "Overall feeling was good"
Overall feeling was good . The only negative thing - they started the check-in process at about 1h55 before scheduled departure. Taking in account the terrible queues in Larnaca airport (about 30 minutes for passport control; after that about same time for security check), that was crucial.

### "Horrible service"
The duration of thr flight is 45 minutes, the flight has been delayed for 3 hours and we have been at the airport since the delay was not reported to us by the airline not an email has been sent. I have been trying to contact customer service via email, WhatsApp and messenger and no one has responded. There are no staff at the service desk they just keep delaying without any notice. We want to cancel the flight instead of spending 6 hours waiting for a one hour flight but no one is responding. Horrible service.

### "professional and friendly"
Boarding on TLV was done on time but delayed to get permission to depart. A320 was in a good condition and clean. Stewardesses were professional and friendly. Inflight service was: beverages, coffee, water, sandwich and granola bar. On the return flight there was a 55 minutes later departure schedule change (they informed us with e-mail 2 days in advance)

### "good service and friendly staff"
Quick flight with good service and friendly staff. Check-in was efficient. Aircraft was clean and welcoming. Only negative was the arrival at a station where bussing brought us back to the terminal rather than an airbridge.
