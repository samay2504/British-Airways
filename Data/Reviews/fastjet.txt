### “Do not fly this carrier”
Not Verified | Do not fly this carrier if you value your time. They do not have any empathy and caring for customers. Our flight was canceled without notification and when confronted or reasonable accommodation they keep sending us one office to another. In this part of world it matters who you know. Spend little bit more money for reputable carrier and save yourself from frustration and headache.

### "Very happy customers!"
Perfect experience. After having read the reviews on Fastjet, I was very nervous despite friends reinsurance that the airline had improved dramatically in recent years. Well everything was perfect. The ticket was very reasonably priced. Check-in online and baggage drop off were easy. The flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. The air hostess was charming. The snacks (though not fancy) were good and our chairs were comfortable. The baggage was on the carousel by the time we arrived. Very happy customers!

### "pleasant flying experience"
Not Verified | The stage was all set for what would be a beautiful day to fly. Clear blue skies, not a cloud in the sky, and not much headwind. As I arrived at the domestic terminal of Harare Airport, I can clearly see the need for renovation of some essential equipment and facilities and it just so happens that the Government has embarked on mega-renovation and expansion projects at the Airport. Concentrating more on the flight itself, the pre-check-in speed and procedure carried out by the Fastjet crew is swift and takes no more than 20mins regardless of numbers as they seem to have a strict booking policy and tend not to overbook a plane, so the number of passengers can just about be projected consistently. What may frustrate the odd business traveler who may be in a rush to get to their destination is the mere fact the wait before the plane actually departs is rather long. Im not sure if this is due to the fact that the plane will be going through extensive preflight checks or that passengers have to wait for an aircraft to be flown in from the Fastjet base in South Africa. In closing the pilots command the plane and flight with extreme professionalism and on this particular flight of mine from Harare to Victoria Falls, they did make up for the lost time in the skies and one would hardly notice it as, the flight was smooth, no turbulence and the inflight crew members looked after passengers very well, even managed to squeeze in a snack meal in the short 45mins flight between Harare and Victoria falls. The landing was once again smooth and disembarking of the was plane quick and luggage was received well. All in all a pleasant flying experience with Fastjet.

### "Terrible experience"
I recently flew on fastjet from Johannesburg to Harare. The flight was delayed by almost an hour due to technical issues on the aircraft. They made us wait for almost one hour in the bus while they fixed the aircraft. I did not feel safe at all while flying and I was extremely disappointed. While up in the air the aircraft was making a really strange squeaky noise which was very unsettling considering that the aircraft had some sort of technical issues. Terrible experience overall, would not recommend at all.

### "definitely an affordable price"
Not Verified |  It’s nothing too special but it was definitely an affordable price. The inflight food and beverage was comprised of a juice box and bottled water. The customer service is ok. There was in issue with the website where it continually declined my card but it actually charged my card every time I attempted— meaning with four attempts there were $750 in false charges. Fortunately the customer service could be reached by WhatsApp and they were able to refund me for the imaginary flight bookings.

### "They refuse a refund"
Not Verified | Fastjet cancelled our flights. They refuse a refund and refuse further communication. At first said they would refund taxes, now we cannot get a single response from them after multiple emails. This airline sold us a product, they cancelled.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Johannesburg to Harare. Do not fly this airline. I flew Qatar Dallas to Harare, Zimbabwe via Johannesburg - US to SA was without incident. Instead of picking South African Airways for the final leg to Zimbabwe I chose Fastjet to support my home airline. Big mistake. My bags were checked through to Harare but while in SA I picked up a few things requiring checking in an extra bag. I paid online to save a few bucks only to get to the counter to be told that I needed to pay an extra R500 because one of the bags I had already checked was not paid for and that they did not code-share with Qatar Airways. It’s madness and wanting to find ways to scam customers, then they started threatening that they would pull one checked bag if I did not pay extra. The bag was already checked all the way through! I will use SAA instead.

### "Don't fly this airline"
I was supposed to fly from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls. Two weeks before flying I received a message that all flights have been cancelled. Until now I am waiting for a refund, which I never received yet. Don't fly this airline.

### "airline had ceased flying"
Not Verified |  Dar es salaam to Mbeya. I bought my ticket in October 2018 on the Fastjet website. I turned up to fly in February 2019 from Dar to Mbrya to be told by airport staff that the airline had ceased flying. Right up until the day if departure its website still showed the flight as on time. They never even bothered sending me an email telling me they weren’t flying any more! Then I sent seven emails and made five phone calls to their office asking for a refund, phone was never answered, emails never replied to. I went to their office this morning and demanded a refund – they now say they will give me my money back in 21 working days time. I will wait to see if it happens. Be warned – do not fly with this airline!

### "I needed to pay double price"
Victoria Falls  to Harare. I brought my ticket receipt to the counter at the airport to check in, the staff told me they couldn't find my flight so asked me to go to the travel agent 200m away from the counter. The travel agent told me Fastjet didn't get the money from my credit card so they just cancelled my flight without telling me, and I have the confirmation email shows they got the money and gave me the ticket PDF file. Another customer came in too and his flight was cancelled too because Fastjet didn't get money too. I needed to pay double price again get on board. The travel agent attitude is pretty bad, she said: Lady I am helping you, I am not fastjet. Then I emailed them to ask refund they never response.

### "FAs were professional"
Went from South-Western Highlands town of Mbeya to the capital Dar es Salaam on 8 August 2018. Easy to buy ticket online, prices fluctuate a lot. Generous hand-luggage (2 pieces) – surprise for an Low Cost Carrier. Two days prior departure they change policy and now open up for everybody holding a ticket to check in 1 full baggage free and to be given snacks/drinks for everybody on board. Thus, you don’t at all get the feeling of an LCC. Homepage and check-in without problems, smooth and generous. The Embraer 190 was very nice, new, narrow body aircraft. Aircraft loaded with approx. 75% of seats. Without requesting I was given a “pay-seat”, no. 12A – a spacious emergency seat. Good announcements from captain. This was a midweek morning on a National Holiday (nane-nane). However, I was scared of any delays or cancellations as the reviews I could find were few, old, and mainly negative or even very negative talking about customers let down in remote areas. As I had international connections in Dar and the transfer time was 7 hours, I eventually accepted the risk of delay as a minor delay would still work. I kept fingers crossed to avoid any cancellation. Location of Mbeya airport is confusing as there are two airports which both claim the IATA code MBI. In reality they use the remote airport of Songwe, 21 km from town. Nice airport in its simplicity and modesty. They have a smooth shuttle service from town to airport. FAs were professional providing soft and hot drinks plus a snack. Inscribed luggage delivered within 5 Minutes. Flight took off 10 Min. before scheduled and landed 30 Minutes earlier than ETA. Can’t fault this airline. Admitted I might have been lucky as approx. 5% of the Mbeya departures says “status unknown”. The reputation that they tend to merge departures could not be verified.

### " very good experience"
DAR-HRE (via LUN), July 23 VFA-HRE, Aug 1 HRE-DAR (via LUN), Aug 2 After flying 3 times and 5 flights in total within a week with Fastjet, I beg to differ from the disappointing reviews here. They are probably justified, but I would like to believe that they are anomalous events in the very good way in which Fastjet regularly operates. Everything went perfectly well on my flights, we arrived at each destination about half an hour early, the planes were clean, with good leg space, the crew kind and professional, and the ground crew very helpful - to the point of refusing to charge us for our checked bag because we had so many flights with them. The flights went smoothly without glitches. Food and beverages need to be purchased, as they must be with all low cost companies, so this was not surprising. What was surprising was that most of the flights had many empty seats. My only issue was that they charged me a hefty fee of over $130 per ticket for the change of flight date, although the planes were half empty. I changed the flights literally 3 hrs before departure because of the post-election situation in Zimbabwe. I forgot to even check whether it would have been cheaper to purchase a new OW ticket, instead of paying for the modification, but I was in a hurry to leave Harare airport and forgot to ask. I find Fastjet no different from any well known low-costs in Europe, or from, say, Spirit Airlines in the US. I fly these very often and know the ropes of how they operate. All in all, a very good experience with Fastjet, if I ever come to where they fly again I will definitely use them.

### "Choose another airline"
Dar Es Salaam to Kilimanjaro. Got to the airport. Flight didn’t exist anymore (it had been taken off that days flight schedule) and I did not receive any prior information. Obviously gave me a lot of trouble because this was unexpected. Don’t get fooled by the price, the risk is too big. Choose another airline at all other costs.

### "flight never took place"
Mwanza to Dar es Salaam. The flight never took place. The staff told us to take a flight next day which was not possible for us. Still don't get our money back. Will never use fastjet again because every time we have big problems.

### "I had to book another flight"
We were supposed to fly on the 16th March with Fastjet only to receive few hours before my flight an email saying that my flight had changed to FN 154. The email that I got was not clear at all not stating which flight had changed (no flight number or departure airport was mentioned) so I assumed that the flight on the 16th March had changed. I emailed the airline but had no response back so I had to book another flight from Dar es Salam to Kilimanjaro which cost me the triple of what I had booked with Fastjet. I arrived at the airport and went to Fastjet desk only to be told that this flight was on time and I was too late (the flight was leaving in 35 min). I showed them the email and they told me that flight change refers to the returning flight. I don't understand how can you change a flight without mentioning the flight number or departure time. My return flight changed from 21:30 to 12:30. Needless to say that this flight change didn't suit me at all as I was on a safari and obviously couldn't make it. I had to book another flight coming back with Precision Air as FastJet didn't offer any other flight times and again the cost was triple. I expected a refund for this inconvenience as it was totally unfair what the airline did and the cost for the other flights that I had to rebook was ridiculous. However none of this happened!

### "very friendly staff"
The flight from Kilimanjaro to Dar es Saalam was on time, check-in was very smooth, pleasant flight, and very friendly staff, including very good safety briefing. Similarly, the flight from Dar-JRO was on time, smooth flight, very friendly and client-oriented staff. On our return flight, KLM was approaching JRO to land, so we spent few minutes circling around. The captain promptly informed us, and cracked a joke," a big bird is ahead of us and about to land, so we need to make way", everyone laughed which brought for a very good feeling.

### "book with any other airline"
Kilimanjaro to Dar es Salaam. fastjet cancelled my flight during the night and I didn't receive any news. When I came to the fastjet office in Moshi to ask for the airport shuttle I was told there is no bus and no flight. There was nobody reachable and I had to try to get my connection flight by myself. Until now there was no answer from fastjet. Nothing. No refund, no email, no call. There was not even a single hint why they cancelled the flight. Better to book with any other airline than fastjet. If you want to throw away your money book with fastjet.

### "and still no refund"
Dar es Salaam to Lusaka via Harare. Fastjet cancelled flight and put me on one 2 days later, without my consent. Notified me via sms. I called in 7 times , sent 2 emails and drove to their branch at airport, to get a refund in process. Finally received email confirming refund would take 5 to 7 days. Been 2 weeks and still no refund.

### "cheap and nasty airline"
Kilimanjaro to Dar es Salaam. Fastjet is a terrible airline. Normally my flights are cancelled but I had to go with them as I did not have any other option. I paid for 40k luggage as I did not want any issues, but of course got to the airport and staff were rude as one bag was a couple kg over 20kg whilst my other bag was only 13kg. All up on was under 40kg by a number of kgs. Staff were rude with zero professionalism - especially one of the fastjet staff. My two son's flights got cancelled so we're stuck on their way to boarding school. Of course the staff of fastjet did nothing. Super cheap and nasty airline.

### "avoid Fastjet completely"
My honeymoon flights from Johannesburg to Zanzibar was cancelled 2 weeks before the planned flight, with no warning. I got an sms saying that my flights were cancelled and that they have been moved to different dates, 5 days after my initial flight plan. Obviously this is completely unacceptable for a flight to a honeymoon destination. You cannot change your wedding date and cannot change expensive resorts bookings which was made months in advance. My whole honeymoon length and location was based around this low cost flight and I will never make the mistake again to use Fastjet. I had to buy new flights on another airline for a very large amount, and also depart on a date and time which is not preferred, but the only flights available. I have not received any money back for extra costs incurred from FastJet. Only a refund for the flight which is very cheap so worthless. Any proper airline has to compensate you for extra cost incurred due to situations which is completely their fault. This is their response: :"We understand that because of the delay there was a negative cost implication on yourself however since delays are possibilities which we advise you of pre-flight, we do not offer compensation or guarantee reimbursements" I did not even have a delay, my flight was cancelled. They could not even respond personally, just this mass generated email. I advise all other people to avoid Fastjet completely.

### "flight was severely delayed"
Johannesburg to Zanzibar via Dar es salaam. fastjet is a shocking airline. Flew with them to and from our honeymoon destination, they changed the flight times with no warning. The return flight was severely delayed causing us to miss all connections, no communication with passengers at all. Also, snack prices are outrageous. The staff onboard were polite and professional. Get something more expensive if you want a reliable airline.

### "really disappointed with fastjet"
I'm really dissapointed with fastjet. For our honeymoon, my husband and I booked a short trip from Johannesburg to Zanzibar, from 18-23 of November. We're both very busy so we cannot take more days off or travel on other days. We booked this months in advance. Then, last week I got the e-mail from fastjet announcing that our return ticket has been changed from the 23 to the 20 November. At this point, I was already very much disappointed (because we only had a 2-day honeymoon and if I wanted to go away for just the weekend I would have stayed in SA) but Fastjet said it was the only option and by now, other tickets were already much more expensive so we couldn't afford anything else. This weekend I got another e-mail, saying the flight had been changed again. We would now depart on the 27 November, 1 week later! And there was not even a return ticket. This was just impossible for us, so we were forced to cancel the trip. Unfortunately, because of such a late notice from fastjet, we cannot cancel the hotel reservations in Zanzibar anymore. Customer service declined my request for a refund of the money which, honestly, is not even close to compensating the disappointment of not having the honeymoon we so much looked forward to.

### " a comedy of errors"
My wife and I booked round trip with fastjet from Johannesburg to Zanzibar because they were the only direct service, so we could avoid immigration/customs and switching flights in Dar es Salaam (airport hell). A month later, fastjet informed us they were cancelling the segment from Dar to Zanzibar and would have us change to Precision Air (a misnomer if ever there was one!) in Dar. For the return trip, they were going to shoehorn us into a Cessna Caravan (what a downgrade from an A319!). Instead, I paid for a one-way ticket with Precision Air to avoid this. The connection in Dar on the outbound trip was pandemonium, and the boarding in Dar for the return flight to Joburg was a comedy of errors and hugely unprofessional behaviour, as the boarding agents engaged in a heated argument in front of all the passengers. Despite the fact I had paid extra for premium seats at the front, we were stuck at the back and I had to insist that we be moved to the seats I had paid for. When we left the plane after arrival in Joburg, the cabin staff were nowhere in sight, to thank us for flying with them. In short, hell will freeze over before we go near fastjet again!

### "I was really satisfied with all"
Victoria Falls to Johannesburg. The flight was really calm and well organized. Actually it was faster than originally planned. Well, what do you need from low fare flight? Get to final destination as soon as possible, feel comfortable and safe and pleasant cabin crew. In my case, all listed met my expectations and I was really satisfied with all. Thank you fastjet, you were valuable part of my lifetime trip!

### "made mistake booking ticket"
I booked a ticket online and made the mistake of selecting Dar es Salaam instead of Zanzibar. I was told it's fine and that I can get off in Zanzibar and then sort the return flight of 26 June out at the Fastjet Officeses. Subsequently I spent a half a day of my holiday at the office. My flight wrongly booked leaves Dar Es Salaam on Sunday just after 8:00. That would mean that we would have to book another flight through to Dar Es Salaam and pay for an additional nights accommodation. Worse is that we lose another night of our holiday. Fastjet has another flight on Sunday with seats available but advised us that they can not accommodate us by allowing us to pay in the additional Zanzibar to Dar Es Salaam fair and to move us to this flight without charging us more than what a complete new full price ticket for the whole trip is.

### "flight is cancelled"
Mbeya to Dar es Salaam with fastjet. Arriving on Mbeya airport, already checked in and about 15 minutes before actually take off the flight is cancelled. Being the only flight coming in and flying out from Mbeya, the cancellation must be known much earlier, Anyway, Fastjet thank you for the service and missing the connection flight to Holland without refunding the damage.

### "a serious disappointment"
Nairobi to Dar es Salaam with fastjet. The Cabin Crew were the only good thing on this flight. I work in hospitality and the customer service we received was appalling. The only reason we knew that there was a flight time change was because I read every email twice even if they are reminders. Otherwise, the email with the flight change of time was sent as a Flight Reminder with no actual indication that there is a change of timing. When I called the sales office at 4am (when customer service is meant to open) to query if this was correct and not a typing mistake, she said yes, when I asked if there was any way to change the flight, as our party needed to be in Nairobi by 11.00 pm latest, she said no very rudely, then I asked if she could assist us with another airline and while speaking to her, she cut the phone. When calling back to speak to her again, we were on hold for 9 minutes before giving up. When trying to discuss this issue at Dar Es Salam airport, the attended stared at their computer not even acknowledging the fact I was talking to them, with no response after explaining what happened. When checking in, our attended didn’t look up once. I asked a few questions with no acknowledgement. After asking the same question four time, my friend told me to give up as it is clear no one was interested to help. Even though the flight was not full, we were seated on the very last row, where the seats were so small, I couldn't fit in them. Luckily our Cabin Crew were very nice and let me move, and spoke to another passenger about swapping. We had planned a surprise birthday party for one of my friends when dropping her home, as she just turned 25, however as we didn't get back to our homes until 1.30am, everyone had to leave, and the entire surprise was ruined. Luckily again, the cabin crew were nice and made a announcement on the overhead. Honestly the entire experience with this airline apart from the cabin crew is a serious disappointment.

### "plane was new and comfortable"
fastjet is a low cost airline, so if you are used to this type of airline, nothing will surprise you. We flew from Kilimanjaro to Dar es Salaam and paid for 1 piece of baggage which wasn't expensive. The plane was new and comfortable compared to other airlines on this route. The check-in was smooth, boarding quite fast as well. Flight left on time and arrived a bit ahead of schedule. Nothing really to complain about.

### "never fly with them again"
We flew fastjet from Johannesburg to Mt Kilimanjaro Airport as my family and I had a 4 day game park safari booked. Bags were to be sent straight to Mt Kilimanjaro as there was a transit in Dar Es Salaam. When asking staff at Dar Es Salaam where the bags were just to make sure checked in bags were still with us, they advised us that they had no idea where the bags were - staff were clueless. Then they assured us that it would reach Mt Kilimanjaro based on where we asked for it to be sent, instead of actually tracking the bag. Upon reaching Mt Kilimanjaro, we waited for our bags(which held all our safari supplies and clothing for 4 days). Nothing came and a claim had to be lodged to find our bags. The lost baggage counter staff called someone from fastjet and found out that the bags were still in Johannesburg. I cannot understand why fast jet Staff could not tell us this information when we asked them in Dar Es Salaam. Took 3 days to find our bags, and by then we had just blown $700US on supplies and clothing for 4 days. We requested the airline to send the bags to Arusha airport as that is where our safari agent could have picked up our bags, but they were rude and refused to assist us with the small issue despite them being the ones who missplaced our bags and did not complete their full service that we paid for( transporting bags and passengers) on time. Will never fly with them again.

### "hard to get in touch with them"
fastjet from Windhoek to Dar Es Salaam. Plane was alright and comfortable for this price. Cabin crew was friendly. You pay for your drinks and beverages on board. But they lost my luggage, and are not willing to pay any of my costs as they say they don't take any checked in baggage through another airline. Be aware of this, because I couldn't find this in their terms and conditions! I found it also really hard to get in touch with them.

### "get what you pay for"
Johannesburg to Dar es Salaam on fastjet. Flight was ahead of schedule on arrival, ground staff were quick. The food and beverages have to be bought onboard. You get what you pay for, its a no frills low cost airline. So far so good.

### "what a welcome surprise"
What a welcome surprise fastjet is, giving real competition to Kenya Airways, whose fares are significantly higher. For about 80% less we flew them from Lilongwe (Malawi) to Dar es Salaam. They departed and arrived on time. The plane was new and comfortable. Yes, they charge for additional services, but the customer has  control of how much beyond the very low fare they want to spend for advance booking, more advantageous seating, baggage, and food. Even with all the extras, our fare remained very low.

### "think twice before booking"
This was my first time flying with Fastjet. I selected it after reading mostly good reviews and that they are using bigger jet planes compared to the competition on this route. The ticket price was very good and the booking process rather simple. Now the bad part - I couldn't check in online for the flight. I headed to JRO airport with plenty of time. When I arrived there was nobody at the check in desk. Apparently the flight was cancelled and I was informed via e-mail and voicemail just 2 hours before departure and while I was on my way to the airport. They had rebooked me on the next flight (8+ hrs later) and I was refused reprotection on another airline. As a matter of fact there was a Precision Air flight leaving 3 hours later. I was told I could get a refund (only for the base fare and not for the extras like baggage fees etc) and then pay for my own ticket. The staff was apologetic and understanding. No food voucher or any other support was provided. I had to wait almost 9 hours at the airport. This is not the fault of the local staff but rather an issue of the upper management. They should look after their passengers better and have provisions when flight cancellations occur. I will think twice before booking with Fastjet.

### "not a bad experience"
Flew fastjet from Dar Es Salaam to Johannesburg and two days later on the return flight. Not a bad experience overall. The cabin could be a little more tidier and cleaner. The cabin crew could smile a little bit more. I felt like I was bothering the lady whom I asked for coffee. It would also help if they could mention somewhere pre booking that you will have to pay for checked in luggage. I ended up paying for both flights a total of $50, for checking in a backpack which only had my toiletry (as these are not allowed on carry-on luggage) and a pair of flops. We were also delayed out of Johannesburg by almost an hour, the reason given was that the aircraft doing the flight arrived late (the same aircraft that does the inbound flight from Dar es Salaam) and once we were allowed to board,we were then stopped on the jetway at the aircraft door as we had to wait for both the pilots to come from shopping at the duty free shop. We started boarding again after they had passed us by into the aircarft, shopping bags in hand. I found this very unprofessional and have written a complaint by email to fastjet. Still waiting for a response.

### fastjet customer review
Clean cabin, helpful and friendly service. Most of my fastjet flights left on time. I used Fastjet between Dar Es Salaam and Uganda, South Africa and Malawi. Flights were over 75 per cent full, especially Uganda and Malawi. This is a budget, no Frills carriers. Flights were smooth, great service and clean cabin.
