### "Not recommendable at all"
Not Verified |  Not recommendable at all. Unreliable, delays on both routes. The gate was changed and few times with a lack of information available to the passengers. The competitor Binter is much preferable.

### "The flight was enjoyable"
Originally booked through Canaryfly. Upon arrival at airport we saw that our flight was cancelled. We didn't receive any notice, but it turned out very smooth, as we were already booked on a Binter flight at the original time. To us, it seemed as this happens frequently, and they have a good system in place. The flight was enjoyable, and the cabin crew did a very good job.

### "honest, efficient and reliable"
My CanaryFly flight from Fuerteventura back to Gran Canaria of 5 April was delayed for technical issues, I was forced to buy a Binter ticket for 162 euros in order to make it to my connecting flight back home. I applied via mail for a compensation and unexpectedly they reimbursed the whole amount I had spent for my flight back to Las Palmas. Very honest, efficient and reliable airline, despite the technical problem that may occur to any airline. Great job

### "could not rebook my tickets"
Gran Canaria to Fuerteventura. I bought the tickets 4 months before the flight. But in the meantime I got sick and recovery lasted long. Thatâ€™s why I wonted to replace the tickets for another date. For a few days I called this phone number but no one answered. For serious companies it is unacceptable. After a few days someone finally answered and told me I could not rebook my tickets.

### "not pleasant impression"
Not Verified |  I bought a flight between Las Palmas and Fuerteventura in off-peak season, 5 months in advance at 12 noon (there were earlier flights as well). Quite soon they called me that the flight is rescheduled on 8 am (causes huge problems on Fuerteventura to get to the airport in time as public transportation doesn't function earlier than 7 am - taxi costs 50$ min). Then on a check-in the employee could not find my entry and it took him ~20 mins and several calls to get things sorted out (most likely i was not in 8 am registry list still, as i bought ticket to 12 pm flight initially and someone forgot to update that list), which almost made me late for the flight - got in on final call. Turned out there is no assigned seats at all, so active fast running teenagers occupied all window seats. Then I've put my e-book Kindle into seat pocket and forgot it there, contacted the airline 5 hours later after the flight via e-mail saying that i am still around to pick it up, two days later received a reply "sorry, not found anything" - impossible as I was the last leaving the jet and i am 100% positive about leaving my device in the pocket. Airline web-site as well as in-flight magazine are in Spanish. Yes, definitely the majority of tourists on Canary Island speak Spanish. A very customer-oriented approach. I was flying on Nov 1-4th 2018. Overall not pleasant impression about this airline, avoid if possible.

### "Not a great experience"
Las Palmas to Tenerife. Not a great experience. The plane had SwiftAir livery even though it was CanaryFly flight. The plane was old and produced terrible noise during takeoff. I have flown the ATR 72 not once but it was only such experience. The airline had a free seating policy. It was OK as there were only 15 people in the plane capable of 70+. The crew provided only water.

### "good value company"
Fuerteventura to Las Palmas with Canaryfly, and a really good value company. The most basic seat price included 6 kg hand baggage and 20 kg hold baggage, plus basic refreshments. Check-in, boarding and flights were all totally without incident. A minor request: tea would be a nice alternative to coffee. The outward flight was no more than half full and the flight back can't have been more than a third full. With so many non-Spanish local residents and visitors I think it would be a very worthwhile investment for them to provide their website into English. It was clearly the intention (the icon is there) but I'm sure it would pay off to do it sooner rather than later. The market is surely there but I've spoken to many local residents who had never heard of the company!
