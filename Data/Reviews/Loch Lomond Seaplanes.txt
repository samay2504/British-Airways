### "terrible if you are requesting a Refund"
Great if your flight takes off on schedule or delayed by less than hour but if flight is delayed by more than hour, they do not Refund- even if you paid extra £20 for Premium flight, which according to their own terms and conditions- permits you to a Refund. I have emailed them 3 times, requesting a Refund. No Reply- No Response. On the actual day I received an email to say my 3:25pm flight was scheduled to depart 4:25pm. I turned up at 12pm & requested a Refund but was prepared to be a Stand by on any flight, in the event someone cancelled or didn’t turn up. Neither of these were acceptable. I sat around all afternoon, sat on benches near take off location. Not once did they approach me to update me whether there was space on a flight. I did hear him say to a group - It’s a bit misty but due to clear. But if visibility is not good, you’ll get Refunds. Shallow words to me! As the afternoon wore on, the flights became more and more delayed. The 2:15pm flight had not taken off by 3:50pm. I know this because I was chatting with an American lady who was on the 2:15pm flight. My 3:25pm flight was certainly not going to take off before 4:25pm but much later. But no one came to advise me or give me updates. So, Fabulous if your Flight takes off on time or delayed by less than hour but terrible if you are requesting a Refund - as per their own terms and conditions

### Loch Lomond Seaplanes customer review
My wife and I had the most magnificent experience on Sunday 7th July 2013 when we took a scenic flight with Loch Lomond Seaplanes from Cameron House on Loch Lomond. The pilot and staff were exemplary the take off and landing as smooth as operating on tarmac and the inflight commentary first class. The day was perfect as we flew over Gare Loch Loch Long Holy Loch Loch Striven Kyles Of Bute Tighnabruaich Loch Fyne along the Crinan Canal and finally turned over the Gulf of Corryvreckan where we saw the infamous whirlpool. I cannot praise the whole operation highly enough.

Simply fantastic what an experience. A very time and cost efficient way to travel in Scotland here's hoping they add more routes soon.
