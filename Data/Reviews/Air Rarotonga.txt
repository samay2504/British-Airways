### "very pleasant and efficient"
Not Verified |  Excellent 45 minute flight within the Cook Islands. On time, excellent information from flightdeck. One solitary hostess who was friendly and provided tea, coffee and water. Other drinks could be bought. Everything was very pleasant and efficient.

### "a pleasurable experience"
Not Verified |  Rarotonga to Aitutaki. The flight with Air Rarotonga was a pleasurable experience: spotless clean aircraft with much space for legs, an excellent and friendly service, coffee was served on that short flight on the small plane and even the small airline's brochure and a daily newspaper was offered to read by passengers. I was impressed by the overall quality of the service.

### "airline is a great ambassador"
My partner and I recently flew from Rarotonga to Aitutaki. The flights are 40 minutes each direction. Well, what a professional airline. A full service was conducted with complimentary tea/coffee/water. Buy on board items offered. Cookies were $2.00 and value for money. The only flight attendant was professional and courteous. the aircraft was immaculate. Seat space rivals some international airline's premium economy offerings. These flights were very pleasant. This airline is a great ambassador for this idyllic part of the world.
