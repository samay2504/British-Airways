### Henan Airlines customer review
I've used within China 4 different airlines: Air China Spring Airlines Shenzen Airlines and Kunpeng Airlines. Clearly the best one was Kunpeng Airlines. Although the flight had a delay of 2 hours (bad weather at the airport from which the airplane came; information at the airport was good) boarding really fast after the airplane arrived. Nevertheless it was clean inside and the crew was very friendly. As it was a short flight (only 45 minutes) I expected less or no service onboard. Was surprised that they offer a drink and a small meal. The airplane itself seems to be a new one.
