### "had to spend a night in Madrid"
Very early flight (6:00 AM). Was booked to allow an immediate connection with MAD-GIG on Iberia (Business class too). However the second leg was cancelled by Iberia months ago, and they booked us to Rio de Janeiro on the following day. Very unfairly, they refused to also move the MRS-MAD leg; petty atitude on Iberia side. is it really worth paying a Business Class ? Therefore we had to spend a night in Madrid, at our expenses.

### "very happy with their service"
Right now, Iberia Regional - Air Nostrum is serving the Madrid - Frankfurt route. I was very happy with their service and the quality of food, beverages in their Business Class. The service was quick and very attentive throughout the flight and even the coffee served was very fresh and tasty (which is usually not a strength of Iberia). Despite of this narrowbody aircraft, seating was comfortable and in Business Class, the seat besides you will be left empty. I can really recommend you this Business Class service on this route with Air Nostrum.

### "punctual and comfortable"
Madrid to Toulouse. Once again a punctual and comfortable flight. Good legroom, on time departure and arrival. On flight entertainment was however not working à you have to pay for anything on board

### "Disappointed with Air Nostrum"
Not Verified |  Disappointed with Air Nostrum. Air Nostrum said that due to a change of aircraft, the CRJ 1000 instead of the ATR 72 was not fit to land at San Sebastian airport for technical reasons. How come a bigger aircraft like the A319 of Vueling can land in such airport? They diverted us to Pamplona. The flight was delayed more than 2 hours. Finally in Pamplona they took us in a bus to San Sebastian but instead of using the shortest route by motorway, the bus driver told us he was taking the longer route. I reached my destination almost 3 hours later than I was supposed to.

### "very unpleasant experience"
Casablanca to Madrid. The Check in for the flight was handled by Royal air Maroc staff, who were 20 mins late in opening check in due to an issue with a previous flight. It was a friday afternoon and only half of the immigration counters were open which resulted in an hour long wait to clear immigration. I wandered down to the boarding gate to wait for our flight. It was time to board but there was no aircraft at the gate. We were provided no infomation by Royal air Maroc ground staff about the flight or expected departure time 18.40. I discovered that the flight had not left Madrid. There was no food vouchers offered, no information provided regarding compensation for flight delays flights to the EU or details about the delay. The flight from Madrid arrived a little under three hours late. We were bussed to the aircraft which was parked some distance away despite having our boarding gate E1 free. The crew apologised for the delay and told us they had to swap an aircraft due to a technical issue. The CRJ 1000 has a narrow cabin and the seat was comfortable but a little tight. There were no complimentary drinks or snacks offered on board by the crew despite the long delay. After landing the aircraft taxied to a remote stand and we were bussed to the the Terminal (4S),. Our allocated baggage carousel was undergoing maintenance and the delivery of the bags was delayed by 15 mins. Overall a very unpleasant experience with Air Nostrum compounded by the poor communication. I arrived at my hotel over 4 hours late

### "price to not show up for a flight"
I booked a return ticket with Air Nostrum and found out that I could travel a day earlier. When I tried to change the ticket the price quoted was twice the price of the ticket I had paid before. I decided to book one sector with another airline and wanted to cancel that sector. The price to not show up for a flight that i paid for was over 100 euro. I could not cancel otherwise and if I would be no show the return ticket will be cancelled. I learned my lesson and will not book tickets with this airline again.

### "Highly recommended"
Madrid to Granada. Excellent. Efficient and attentive cabin crew. Arrived and left on time. New aircraft and comfortable seats. Straightforward boarding and disembarking. Highly recommended.

### "my seat had been changed"
This flight was reserved weeks ahead of travel and was part of a journey to enable me to travel to London with a connection in Madrid. Firstly the website would not let me check-in online (although I had chosen my seat on the same website) when I reached the airport it transpired that my seat had been changed. I ended up at the very back of the flight by the lavatory. The flight was delayed and the lack of communication was a real concern, A group of Chinese passengers became anxious as they had a connecting flight and sadly the ground staff were rather rude and ignored them. Boarding did not follow the rules at all and was chaotic with a few passengers going back through the barrier to use the lavatory! The ground staff did not seem to care one iota. Incredibly passengers were allowed to take on far too much luggage. Once in Madrid a passenger realised he had left a bag behind at the airport in Seville the cabin crew member did not care less and shrugged her shoulders and pointed the man to the exit.

### "leaves much to be desired"
Bologna to Madrid. The service of the leaves much to be desired, from the attention at the time of check-in to the punctuality that does not exist. One hour delay on the outward journey and two and a half hours on this return trip, of which an hour and a half were inside the cabin without any attention or explanation. The captain, already with all the people ready to leave, says that we were going to have to wait two hours to get out. ES: El servicio de la aerolíneas deja mucho que desear, desde la atención al momento del check-in a la puntualidad que no existe. Una hora de demora en el viaje de ida y dos horas y media en este viaje de regreso, de las cuales una hora y media fueron dentro de la cabina sin ninguna atención no mayor explicación. El comandante de a bordo, ya con todas las personas listas para partir dice que íbamos a tener que esperar dos horas para salir.. las compañías aéreas tienen todas las concesiones habidas y por haber mientras los clientes somos siempre rehenes.

### "very kind cabin crew"
Flew Air Nostrum from Madrid T4 to Ibiza. Nice short flight on a sunny afternoon. Fast drop-off baggage, a gentle Iberia staff member helped us to print boarding-passes, half-hour late boarding (walked to the plane). Comfortable seats, very kind cabin crew. Flight itself was great, splendid manned by a Lady-captain. So, we started our summer holiday relaxed. One week after, second leg, Ibiza to Valencia, 45 mins. flight on turboprop. Bit cramped seats, bit noisy, but for a such a short time wasn't important. Final approach was rather steep, but landing was OK. Both flight were on time (less than 15 mins. late arrival), uneventful, luggage claimed fast and in good situation, decent priced. I will not hesitate to use Air Nostrum for Spanish domestic flights in the future.

### "received horrible treatment"
Gatwick to Malaga via Madrid. I was flying in business class with Iberia from Gatwick to Madrid and with Air Nostrum from Madrid to Malaga. The first flight landed in Madrid with a delay and my connection to Malaga was a bit strict of time also because the first flight landed on a gate far from the boarding next flight gate. I managed to get on time on the second flight and, afraid for my luggage transfer on the second flight, I asked to the crew to verify if my luggage was on board. This verification I asked, was just because for the previous 3 flights in 2017 I had with the same route with them, my luggage went lost every time. The answer was that it was not in there duties so nothing to do about. Just because this question, I received a horrible treatment during the flight. Food was awful as the service, the plane was not clean and no complaint form was provided after my request. I will never fly again with Iberia and not with Air Nostrum as part of Iberia. Dirty aircraft, no customer service, also if in business class, no decent food.

### "very happy about my experience"
Madrid to Lisbon. I feel very happy about my experience with Air Nostrum. The flight was cheap,  ground service was fast and helpful. The pilot and the crew were very kind. The seat was comfortable and the choice and quality of food and drinks was good and convenient.

### "check-in our hand luggage"
Porto to Madrid. A small aircraft and we were asked to check-in our hand luggage or to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival. I find this irritating, as I had one piece of luggage, within the rules. Other people didn't. Those should be asked to do this. Besides this, staff were nice. Seating was OK.

### "expect better from Air Nostrum"
Alicante to Madrid. Uncoordinated ground staff who left 2 wheelchair users waiting without communication for over 30 minutes in a communal area. Check-in was laborious with one staff member conducting personal conversation rather than processing her passengers. Boarding was slow, very slow indeed! Two wheelchair users were left in a hot area without communication and were then boarded first. This was no problem other than other passengers being required to descend narrow stairs and wait for a  bus. The bus was very full and needed to make 2 journeys. Passengers were allowed to carry with them far too much luggage and this proved to be problematic in the extreme. Following departure the staff were poorly coordinated and communication was poor. Arrival was prompt but a bus was needed to negotiate a very large Madrid airport! Clearly, much needs to be done to improve matters. One would expect better from Air Nostrum.

### "leg room somewhat limited"
IB8483 from Menorca to Palma operated by Air Nostrum. Boarding was on time and fast. The crew were friendly and their English was excellent. Apart from Spanish and English, there even was a shortened announcement in Catalan after boarding which I found very original. This was the first time this happened to me in the Catalan speaking regions of Spain. The aircraft wasn't very clean, there even was some chewing gum stuck to my window frame. For this short flight of about 35 minutes, snacks and drinks could be bought. The leg room was somewhat limited but for that short duration it was absolutely no problem at all.

### "leg room was a bit on the short side"
IB8496 from Palma to Menorca, operated by Air Nostrum. Boarding started with a significant delay of two hours but the ground crew were very conscious of that fact and tried to speed up the boarding process as good as possible. At boarding, the aircraft was baking hot. This bettered only a little during the flight but with the flight being just 30 minutes long, the temperature wasn't as big a deal as it would have been on a longer flight. The crew were friendly and talking to them in English was no problem at all. The aircraft was very clean. The leg room was a bit on the short side. There was no complimentary drink or meal service.

### "very good and would choose them again"
I flew from Madrid to Marseilles with Air Nostrum, everything was what I expect from flying on a short flight. I flew on a brand new CRJ1000. I liked the size of the plane, to the bigger A319. (operated by Air Nostrum's owner, Iberia). I also found the seats more comfortable than Iberia, more legroom and 2 by 2 layout rather than a three by three. Warning, If you are claustrophobic or don't like flying in small, regional jets, fly Iberia, or Iberia Express, but still very good and would choose them again.

### "cabin staff very kind"
Flew Air Nostrum from Melilla to Madrid. Was a business flexible ticket. Quality / price excellent. Ground service in Melilla is nothing special for business flyers. Just a different row for check-in. The seat comfort for a short flight (less than 2 hours) was OK even though for a business class you could expect more. Breakfast is served for free for Business class giving two or three menus. I had fruit and it was very well served with yoghurt / cheese. The quality was excelent. I asked for kosher food and this wasn't given. They said they do not have kosher menu but suddenly on my way back they brought me kosher food. No entertainment on board. Bathroom without hand towel. Cabin staff very kind.

### "did not speak Scandinavian language"
Our direct SAS flight (to be operated by Cimber) from Vilnius to Copenhagen had been cancelled, so SAS re-routed us through Stockholm. The airlines between Vilnius and Stockholm turned out to be Air Nostrum. Seat pitch was the same as with SAS. Cabin staff did not speak any Scandinavian language nor Lithuanian, so announcements, including security instructions, were carried out in Spanish and English, and my wife and I didn't understand. Onboard we wanted to purchase some items, such as sparkling water and a sandwich. The purser then told that none of the goods from the menu card could be purchased. I thought that it was an SAS flight operated by another airline, and I actually expected SAS service. However, the only reaction to this was that they couldn't do anything, because this was Air Nostrum. I then argued that it said SAS on the ticket, and even the SAS logo was painted on the tail wing, but also this didn't seem to bother the purser at all. She said that all food/beverage services were only for business class. When my wife made it clear that if she actually did get sick during the flight, the cabin staff would have a problem, the purser got my wife sparkling water.

### "leg room was adequate"
Alicante to Madrid. Short flight to connect to a long haul flight. Ground staff were efficient at Iberia desk. As usual you have to leave larger carry on bags on the ground next to the plane and then pick them up on arrival next to the plane. Seats are leather and on a 2 by 2 basis in both business and economy. Service was adequate, leg room was adequate even for two over six footers.

### "smooth and well organised"
I have flown on Air Nostrum for the first time on a quick 1hr 40min flight from T4 Madrid Barajas airport to Marrakesh airport. It was a smooth and well organised operation. I had not flown on a CRJ1000 and discovered it is a very pleasant and smooth aircraft with the value added of no middle seats as it is a 2-2 configuration. Interestingly enough it appears that this subsidiary of Iberia is able to carry out a better, friendlier service and have nicer uniforms than its parent company. The flight was good, service was good, the communication from the pilot and stewardesses was good. The only thing that was not good (not the airline's fault by the way) were the screeching children that some parents were unable (nor interested) to control, who managed to run riot around the plane and disturb pretty much everyone in the flight, to the point that one of the flight attendants had to go around with the youngest element and ask passengers who it belonged to shortly before landing as the parents were clearly not too interested in the safety of their own child.

### "very good short flight"
Alicante to Madrid with Air Nostrum was a very good short flight. Checked in a few days before on line and got emergency exit seats at no cost.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Madrid to Bordeaux IB8554 March 4 2015. This would have to have been the worst service we have had on any airline! We are Platinum / Emerald frequent flyers. Plane was an hour late and pax were kept on bus with no explanation insufficient meals for the only 2 business class pax - us! Pancakes and only other meal not quite frozen! No welcome on board no welcome drink for business class pax us! No cabin assistance unless we asked repeatedly. And finally just to add insult no response to our original complaint about this and we have to fly with this airline again unfortunately. If we had a choice we would not fly Air Nostrum.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAH-PMI return on ATR72. Both flights on time crew good. Prices seem steep for non residents of the Islands. Used Iberia/BA airmiles so only paid tax.

### Air Nostrum customer review
28th August 2013 I took a flight from Malaga to Melilla. I found the ground staff to be very professional and well turned out. They were welcoming and conducted their duties with pride. The flight was on an ATR aircraft which is ideal for the relatively short flight from Malaga to North Africa. The flight departed on-time and the cabin crew conducted a safety demonstration. Bizarrely one of the cabin crew showed the food to purchase card but then said there was nothing to buy! The flight was suitably comfortable and arrived into Melilla exactly as per schedule. Disembarkation was well managed and orderly. Overall I had a good impression of Air Nostrum. The tickets though seem expensive.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Smooth way through the airport of Madrid. Check-in done online. The best way to do it nowadays. Even though Air Nostrum operates from the K area in Madrid this flight was boarded by bus which is ok. Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful. The inflight service consisted of 'tu menu' which is in your seat pocket and from which you can buy 'Iberia' style snacks and drinks. Not too long ago this carrier still offered free of charge beverages and even snacks and sandwiches.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Just learnt from an online check-in that my flight tomorrow from BCN to NCE was cancelled without them notifying me. They were not at all interested nor apologetic when I phoned for an explanation. I paid more to travel with them over the cheaper alternatives to avoid this situation. Such a short flight but it has cost me over 2K so far in re-routing around their failure. An email from them could have avoided so much trouble.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAN-MAD-MAN on a newish CRJ900. Business takes me to Madrid a lot and this new route replaces the stop at LHR and shaves 4 hours off the journey for me. Friendly efficient clean with nothing to grumble about.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAD-MUC on a newer CRJ-1000. As opposed to our terrible experience on Iberia for the earlier legs of this trip this was a night-and-day difference. Clean modern plane with legroom efficient FA's drinks and snacks served. Air Nostrum does everything so much better than its parent. If you are compelled to take Iberia flights make sure you use Air Nostrum for as many legs as you can - it really is a superior experience.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Madrid to Porto. A relatively modern CRJ1000 (2+2 seating) offered more legroom than Iberia A320. Flight almost an hour late but this is becoming the norm at Madrid-Barajas so it's not a big deal. Crew pleasant and served drinks and a small packet of nuts on 1 hour flight.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Madrid to San Sebastian on Canadair RJ 200. Just four business class seats on this 35 minute short-haul regional flight. Very friendly and attentive service with free drinks and filled rolls for business. Oversize hand luggage was put in the hold and could be collected on the tarmac at the destination. You wouldn't really pay for business on this regional airline as it's not really value for money for such short hops. But if you happen to travel in this class then it's very pleasant.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Madrid-Murcia return. I've had a few flights with Air Nostrum now and find their flights reasonably enjoyable. Service pleasant and friendly from the FA (coffee served) and flights seem to leave on time. I was very impressed with my check-in at Murcia's small terminal and which involved ticketing right through to Tokyo using Iberia and Japan Airlines connections and the whole process was seamless and efficient. I'm not sure if I like travelling in CRJ 200s that Air Nostrum uses but that may be because on Air Nostrum at least I never seem to be able to get clean windows and am unable to see outside much at all. Do these aircraft ever get cleaned?

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAD-NTE-MAD. We were bussed to the aircraft and boarded very efficiently. The only FA spoke perfect English and Spanish and broken French. CRJ200 series (50 seats) was clean. FA was very friendly. We were served a drink and a packet of nuts and then biscuits and another drink. FA also gave out activity books to kids and newspapers and magazines to passengers as required. Air Nostrum did very well considering Iberia's service.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAD-VAL-MAD. A very satisfactory flying experience with flights leaving on time. Nice comfortable leather seats well turned out and friendly cabin crew who saw to the needs of my grandson by providing a colouring book and pencils. Light refreshments and newspapers were also provided. A pleasant change from flying budget airlines.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Porto-Madrid business class. Ridiculously small space in Business class the same very narrow space as in economy. There are just 8 business class seats but if full as in my case it is no joy at all and the service is poor too. The flight left in time it was short so endurable. On arrival in Madrid the luggage was off-loaded right beside the aircraft and we had to take it from there ourselves.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Gran Canaria - Valencia return. Checked in online in both directions and only had to drop my luggage at the counter. Almost full CRJ 200 and must admit that it was a pleasure to fly with this airline. Comfortable leather seats emergency exit seat so plenty of legroom for a 6'4'' passenger like me (also noticed that the other rows of seats also had above average space) although the seats were a bit narrow due to the width of the plane rather than Air Nostrum seating. The two flight attendants were cheerful and helpful: a sandwich and beer was provided (more than adequate for the time of day and length of flight (2h30m). Infinitely better flight than Iberia via Madrid Air Nostrum will be my airlibne of preference for domestic flights in Spain.

### Air Nostrum customer review
NCE to MAD on a full CRJ-900. Flight left on time even though the plane had two busloads to fill it up. Service not extraordinary. Hostesses served us drinks and cheese sandwiches flight landed on time even though took 30 minutes in order to stop to gate. Good airline worth the price (250 euros return booked 1 month in advance) but do not expect a great service.

### Air Nostrum customer review
VLC-TFN. El avión impecable el servicio a bordo adecuado al tamaño del avion (bocadillos mini y refresco) coste economico y puntual. Este verano repito. Clean airplane the service on board adapted to the size of the airplane (mini sandwiches and refreshment) all at a very good price. This summer I will travel Air Nostrum again.

### Air Nostrum customer review
I have travelled on Air Nostrum a couple of times and find their service very good. I find it more relaxing than travelling on other airlines. Food consists of a sandwich or cake.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAD-VLC-MAD in economy. MAD-VLC on Air Nostrum and VLC-MAD on Iberia. Maybe I was lucky but the experience was quite good. The flights both ways were on time and without any unpleasant incident. Connecting from Air Canada (Terminal 1 in Madrid) to Iberia (Terminal 4) was a bit of a trial. It took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway. Air Nostrum used a Bombardier CRJ a bit tight for space. Service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations. No inflight entertainment - none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight. The two FA managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches (an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside) although they had to rush to get it done. I was in the last row and the descent to Valencia airport was choppy - felt like a life raft in rough sea! Anyway service was pleasant and I give Air Nostrum full marks. On my return leg on an Iberia Airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below Air Nostrum. FAs did their job and were reasonably pleasant. Clean plane with 3+3 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room. The flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to Madrid on time. The downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class. There was food for purchase but I didn't see a single person purchasing. No IFE or video demonstration of any kind. I had only carry-on so can't comment on baggage handling. Overall a good experience I would give Air Nostrum 4 star and Iberia 3 star.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAD-TOU-MAD on CRJ 900. The flight attendants provided a very good service. Even though the flight only lasted 50 minutes they did their very best on this time. The only bad thing was the announcements the flight attendant who was in charge didn´t spoke french. Maybe in flights that go to France they should speak a bit of French.

### Air Nostrum customer review
FRA-ZAR-FRA economy on Air Nostrum for Iberia in mid-June. I was disappointed. The all-economy seating when booking had been altered to mixed configuration business and economy by departure date and the economy passengers seemed to get much poorer service and food than the one or two passengers in the little business class cabin. FAs on all flights also seemed to have a bad case of attitude. Maybe I was having a bad hair day but I found the service poor the flights noisy (in the CRJs) the windows almost impossible to see out of. So I was happy to finally land in Zaragoza and Frankfurt.

### Air Nostrum customer review
MAD-NCE-MAD on Canadair CRJ900 a superb aircraft. It is in a completely different league than the parent company Iberia. A sandwich two small bottles of wine and a coffee on a 1hr 20 run served by friendly professional flight attendants. This is one very good airline and if you dont have to connect onwards onto an IB connection you will enjoy the experience.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Tangiers-Barcelona on a Canadair operated by Air Nostrum - way better than Iberia its higher class and service is also better than Iberia. The whole plane was business class.

### Air Nostrum customer review
Basel via Barcelona to Granada. The flights between Basel and Barcelona were operated by Air Nostrum although sadly since they've stopped flying to Basel. I think their service is nothing short of amazing. First of all on the return we were even given a hot meal. This was in economy class and the flight is less than two hours. Generally the quality of the food is good and the service in economy class is more like what you get in Business class on most airlines. The flight attendants were very friendly which only made the contrast to the surly unfriendly bunch working for Iberia seem even more unfriendly.
