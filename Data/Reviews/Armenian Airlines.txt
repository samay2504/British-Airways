### "avoid this airline if possible"
Services are disaster, extremely long delays over 6 hours , no proper communication, or notification. My rating is Zero, avoid this airline if possible

### "complete disregard for customers"
Not Verified |  Absolute disaster. AT NO COST, look further, never fly with them! Armenian Airlines made my flight unbearable. You can’t check in online unless you pay for a seat — a blatant money-grabbing tactic. They nitpick everything, including bags, as if their goal is to ruin your mood. Trying to contact them is a joke: phone lines are silent, and they ignore messages on Facebook and other platforms. Their complete disregard for customers leaves only a feeling of disgust. I never thought an airline could be this atrocious. I wouldn’t recommend dealing with them to anyone.

### "nothing short of a nightmare"
Not Verified |  If I could give Armenian Airlines negative stars, I would. My recent experience with this airline was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, it was a comedy of errors that left me questioning why I ever chose to fly with them in the first place. Let's start with the booking process. Trying to book a flight with Armenian Airlines felt like navigating a labyrinth designed by a sadistic genius. Their website was a hot mess of broken links, confusing menus, and error messages. It took me longer to book my ticket than it did to plan my entire trip. If that doesn't scream "user-unfriendly," I don't know what does. The day of my flight arrived, and I foolishly thought that the worst was behind me. Oh, how wrong I was. The check-in process at the airport was a disaster. The line was longer than the Great Wall of China, and the staff seemed completely disinterested in helping passengers. I had to wait for what felt like an eternity before I could even drop off my luggage.
