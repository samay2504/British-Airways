### "does not care about you"
Not Verified |  On April 10th my flight from Dushanbe to Almaty was delayed for more than 5 hours. Because of this, I missed a charter flight to Vietnam, for which no one refunded the money. Air Astana did not offer any hotel, no compensation, no alternatives - I was left to my own devices. I had to buy a new ticket and pay all the expenses again. The support service does not care about you and your problems, you can not even try to contact them. Complete indifference to passengers. First and last time with this airline.

### "a bad first experience"
Not Verified |   2 days ago we already had a delay of 3 hours from Almaty to Astana where we had to offboard the plane and change planes. Now, going back to Almaty, we already got 5 mails telling us the flight will be delayed, already more than 5 hours!! I am getting the idea we will not fly today. What a bad first experience with Air Astana.

### "Excellent flight"
Not Verified |   Excellent flight, comfort, service, politeness. The flight is around 2.5 hrs long, and we were served a decent meal, a good selection of beverages, provided good entertainment in comfortable seats. MTotally recommended!

### “service throughout was excellent”
Not Verified | I upgraded from Economy to Economy Sleeper on this 8 hour flight. This gives you a row of three standard economy seats to yourself in a separate and quieter segment of the cabin between economy and business. You also get a mattress, pillow and duvet, the idea being that you can sleep across the three seats. This does not really work because: 1. If you try to lie flat your feet stick out into the aisle 2. If you prop yourself up (sitting) with your back to the window, the inner arm rest sticks into your back. 3. The mattress which is meant to be attached via straps to the seats slides off easily when you move. 4. If there is turbulence and you have to fasten your seat belt it is not possible to do this while lying horizontally across the seats. 5. Standard economy seats lack the depth needed lie down comfortably across them. 6. You cannot watch a programme on the entertainment system in a horizontal position. I tried for a while to find a comfortable position but gave up in the end and just sat in my reclined seat. It’s a nice idea and was worth a try but it does not deliver. It was quite a costly upgrade too and the airline would be better served converting that mid-section into proper premium economy with more comfortable and spacious seats. Of the 5-6 rows on each side of the cabin, only two were occupied, which perhaps reflects the point I am making about value for money. The service throughout was excellent and my review and ratings refer specifically to the Economy Sleeper offer.

### "providing amazing in flight service"
Not Verified |  I'm a frequent traveller and this was our first time using Air Astana from London to Delhi. I read some great reviews nevertheless, I was quite apprehensive to say the least. Well, how wrong was I, Air Astana in my humble opinion is indeed providing amazing in flight service and great user experience. We flew Airbus 321LR that appeared to be fairly new, extremely clean and looked after. Our economy cabin was looked after well, we had nice amenity kit, the food served was nice and tasty and with proper cutlery. Equally, choice of beverages was excellent too. The crew is well trained and do their best to keep passengers happy. On the improvement side, we spent about 3+ hours in Almaty and found the airport to be quite small and quite basic which I think is a bit of let down and so I think that's the area they need to actively work on if they really want to get more customers flying with them. I certainly will fly with them again and recommend it.

### "encountered multiple issues"
The plane was fantastic and entertainment was pretty good too. However, encountered multiple issues that ruined an otherwise fantastic trip to Almaty and an excellent flying experience. Firstly on the way from Bangkok to Almaty. I was given the option of three meals: chicken with rice, chicken with noodles and vegetarian rice. I proceeded to order the chicken with rice, which had no chicken in it, when I informed the air hostess about this, her response was initially there is no chicken with rice and when I told her that her colleague said it, she then said there's chicken in it when there obviously wasn't. When I mentioned it again, she said that she will come back to me if there's any meals remaining and never came back. I let this issue go as the overall flight experience was good. Secondly on our flight from Almaty to Delhi. The air hostess asked me whether I wanted the vegetarian or non-vegetarian option. I obviously said the non-vegetarian and she mentions it's over and the person next to me received the last one. I was okay with that but then she asks the people after me the same question and somehow they end up getting one. Finally when we got to Delhi. We purchased an additional luggage for a total of 3 from Almaty but they've recorded it as 4 which led to more than an hour of waiting till they issued our boarding pass to the corresponding flight. Overall very disappointed with the delays and meal availability which ruined an otherwise excellent flight. I would seriously reconsider flying Air Astana again.

### "didn't use the first segment of the flight"
We had booked and paid flight from ALA to TAS and back. Since it was a vacation trip we made decision to take a train to Tashkent instead of airplane to enjoy the desert scenery. On a way back at the airport of TAS while trying to checkin the flight TAS-ALA it was said to us that we cannot fly back because we didn't use the first segment of the flight and money cannot be returned as well. Employees at Air Astana office in Tashkent were rude and kept saying that this is our problem and we should learn about airline rules before. Luckily we had enough money to stay in Tashkent for 1 more night and book a train on a next day, but what if someone has an emergency case or simply have no enough money? Btw the price for the flight we were refused to join, 2hr before departure was about $300-350 per person for 1.5hr flight, so it's pricey.

### "one of the best experiences"
I had have one of the best experiences with Air Astana because my April trip from Dubai to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty and Astana and back included 6 flights and all  were in time. Different types of aircrafts, such as B767 from DXB to ALA, Airbus 321 long range from ALA to NQZ Astana and Embraer E2 to UKK, all were clean and their condition was also good. Of course in this challenge A321Long range definitely wins because it was brand new. As for food everything was nice and wide choice of beverages is still available as before pandemic. And one more thing I took part in air Astana stop over holidays program for international travellers and my hosting in Almaty and Astana in hotels was very friendly. On international flights airline gives complimentary amenity kit even in economy class. I just have to mention that my screen of entertainment system on my way from Dubai to Almaty didn't work. That's why I took one point from my overall mark.

### "Disappointing service"
Not Verified | I fly this airline weekly for Almaty-Baku-Almaty and I have never ever had the flight on time. 40-60 minutes delay is routine for Air Astana. They have to reassess their attitude and schedule because those repetitive delays are not acceptable for what they call 4-star airline. The airline prices are not on level of service they provide either - Disappointing service to be honest.

### "Food was exquisite"
This is really a different airline. The plane was impeccable, clean, looked young. Cabin staff is really amazing, taking care and checking during the hole flight. Food was exquisite. The Samsonite amenity kit was amazing, sleek and modern. A real pleasure to travel on this airline.

### "rescheduled for a morning flight"
I booked with Air Astana for a flight from Tashkent to Astana transiting in Almaty. Our flight was delayed for over an hour in Astana - an additional one hour later than my original booking. This meant that I now have too short a transit time and need to be re-scheduled. I received an SMS advising that I am rescheduled for a morning flight (arrival 10 a.m. the next day instead of 6 pm) I then went into frantic messages to my hotel in Astana cancelling my booking - about AUD100 extra for a few hours! On check-in I was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me. So I am unaware of this, land in Almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher. There, I am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm. So, again, frantic messages to my hotel - after over 20 minutes running around to get a Kazakh SIM card - to re-book my room. I found the place now fully booked. Called them and thankfully, they re-booked my room.

### "I haven't got any repayment"
The flight that I report was supposed to take place in March 2022, but it never took place. It was cancelled. However, a year after the flight, I haven't got any repayment although I've sent all the necessary documents to the company. All I got was promises. I did try to believe the company and even traveled with Air Astana once again in October 2022. Still, no keeping promises.

### "This is how an airline should be run!"
What a nice little airline! Air Astana provides economy passengers with a surprisingly generous amenity bag which was a nice touch. Cutlery was real metal (rare in economy!) The food was really good and the staff were friendly. This is how an airline should be run! Well done guys.

### "an amazing experience"
Not Verified |  It was an amazing experience on all the 4 flights with Air Astana (IST-ALA-DEL and DEL-ALA-IST). Seats were very comfortable with enough leg space. Food was fresh, delicious and filling with lots of options (if you book pre-meal). Airline staff was exceptionally helpful and caring, they were just a bell away. Definitely value for the money.

### "No lounge or priority check in"
Everything was perfect, but not in Atyrau or in Almaty, no ground service available for business class. No lounge, no private vehicle or at least priority check in. There was a line in Atyrau in business class check in but only one agent was available and service was not welcoming at all. I suggest to provide an access to VIP lounge if you don’t have own lounges in Atyrau and Almaty airports, and add it to the ticket price. In flight service was exceptional.

### "I haven’t received yet any answer"
My flight from Aktobe to Almaty was canceled. I had another flight to Phuket and then from Phuket to Sydney by another airline. Air Astana didn’t provide any option to get to Almaty, they only offered to return money or re-book to 3 weeks later. Call center couldn’t help. I bought by my own ticket to Almaty through Nur-Sultan and requested refund for this segment and compensation of my expenses for ticket I purchased by myself. I haven’t received yet any answer from them from July, 5, 2022.

### "exceptional customer service"
I experienced exceptional customer service from the ground staff who checked in our baggage was professional and exceptional customer orientated. Not only she helped with our special request (which she could easily deny as per rules and which required an extra effort from her side) moreover, she went beyond that. She send an email to the Air Astana representative in Georgia asking for assistance, which we never asked for. She even accepted a slight extra bag weight and wished us a pleasant flight. Airbus 320 Neo - nice aircraft with comfy chairs. Good selection of movies, would be cool to have some podcasts though! Overall flight was good, rest of the staff did well also.

### "Thoroughly enjoyed flight"
Thoroughly enjoyed flight from Nur Sultan (Astana) to Frankfurt with Air Astana Sunday 14th Feb 2021, I was travelling from Almaty to Frankfurt via Astana. First leg economy, second leg business. The service on both flights was very good and the food and drink outstanding. Tasty sandwich on the first domestic leg and given plenty of choice and excellent presentation of starter and main course on the international flight. Good Job Air Astana.

### "Keep up the good work Air Astana"
I have been using Air Astana on various domestic and international routes for 15 years. I have seen great improvements in this time from the early days. Not only in the quality of the aircraft and facilities but especially in in the cabin services. My recent flight this month highlighted this. Though I travelled economy I found the cabin staff very attentive and helpful. They were polite and supportive and prompt with any requests. The food was excellent, it was breakfast but hot, tasty and filling. The amenities packs are now eco friendly. They contain all those items that one requires on a journey of 3 hours or longer. They look good too. It was a new aircraft that was very clean, with comfy seats and was equipped with an excellent entertainment package. My only concern was travelling during these difficult times and the flight was full, understandably with the reduce number of flights scheduled. The in cabin safety brief, which is excellent and worth watching in all three languages, has had an amendment to relate to the latest pandemic requirements. The cabin crew enforced these rules without fear or favour in a very polite and professional manner. Keep up the good work Air Astana, you are my favourite airline.

### "waiting for a refund for 3 months"
Not Verified |  Poor service with customers. I booked 2 tickets in February and March. The company canceled the flights and sent emails automatically. No clear information or explanation. I tried many times to contact the call-center of the air company to get more information about the flight and discuss the schedule, but no answer. I sent an email immediately but replied after 2 months without detailed information. I have been waiting for a refund for 3 months. This is my first time to face such as poor service and no respect for customers.

### "Service was excellent"
Almaty - Saint-Petersburg is my favourite route. Flight was on time. Aircraft was brand new A320NEO (2 months old). Service was excellent, food was very good, choice of beverages perfect. Now airline using eco packs for amenity kits and it looks so good! And also inside of the kit they even put neck pillow, because flight was longer than 5 hours.

### "return journey equally enjoyable"
London Heathrow - Nur Sultan - Almaty in December 2019, returning 8 days later. Check in at LHR was efficient and fast track through security excellent. However the flight was then delayed at the last minute and there was hardly any seating at the gate where we had to wait, no announcements/updates and few staff who seemed a little disorganised and unhelpful. Several passengers including myself had connecting flights which was making people quite agitated as they were unsure what would happen if they missed their connections. Once aboard, the cabin layout and space were excellent. Staff were efficient, polite and you were made to feel very welcome. The food choices were great, very tasty and portion sizes just right. There was a huge choice of drink options too. The seat converted easily to a very low level lay flat bed and I managed to sleep for a few hours. Upon arrival in Nur Sultan I was met off the flight (pre-arranged) and taken through security with a quick stop in the lounge to freshen up before joining my connecting flight on to Almaty. The lady who met me was excellent and couldn’t have been more helpful. It was a huge help to me as I was travelling alone and there was very limited time to pass from international to domestic and then find my onward flight to Almaty. She spoke perfect English and made the transfer very smooth for me. The flight to ALA was good. Plenty of leg room and great adjustments on the seat, especially for leg support, but perhaps more tricky to climb out of from a window seat than the previous flight layout. The breakfast menu was excellent as you could choose anything from a pastry and coffee right up to a full cooked breakfast. The cabin crew served this efficiently in a limited time frame. My return journey was equally enjoyable. On the Nur Sultan to LHR leg there were about 40% seats not occupied in business class which made the experience even more special as the staff had more time to ensure you were comfortable. It was nice to be able to enjoy this leg during daylight hours as I’d slept a chunk of the outward version of this leg! All in all I really enjoyed my first experience with Air Astana. The only disappointment was the initial delays at Heathrow, the area we had to wait and how these were handled by the ground staff there.

### "trip was quite difficult"
I want to say thank you to the Nomad Club team. Recently I had a trip from Almaty to Dubai, this trip was quite difficult, we went through all sorts of delays to weather and other reasons, flight changes, etc. Once this trip was over I described everything to Air Astana Customer care, and I was very satisfied with their response and actions.

### "very pleasant crew"
Almaty to Bishkek. Have flown this route number of times in past year sometimes via TSE, the older version of Embraer used which in my view is more comfortable than the new model in their fleet. All Sectors on schedule, very pleasant crew.

### "inattentive and rude"
Atyrau to Almaty. Cabin crew was inattentive and rude. Twice requested for a blanket, didn’t get it till the end. That time I thought maybe it’s not included for economy seats. But last time had to take business class ticket, yet no blanket was given and service was still not the welcoming. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Food quality was satisfying. Also my friend’s luggage was lost on his flight. Asked me to help him to negotiate with lost and found team since he doesn’t speak Russian. The operator was non-helping. When i asked her the approximate time his luggage will be delivered she told me that it will be there after one hour. We waited 3 hours at hotel lobby at night, and didn’t get it. The lost and found was already out of service. I guess company like this can afford to make the lost and found service 24/7. So the luggage was delivered only at noon, even though airplane that brought it from Amsterdam arrived at night.

### "Awful experience"
London to Nur-Sultan in August 2019. Awful experience. They used to be good but not anymore. I often fly from London to Almaty using Air Astana. The check in company ASC at Heathrow Terminal 4 used by Air Astana are rude and not friendly at all.

### "customer service is horrendous"
Tashkent to London via Almaty / Astana. Air Astana customer service is horrendous, especially if you’re stranded at an airport trying to get home. On my 7-hour flight, there was no inflight entertainment or USB charging points. I’m on the verge of tears midway through a journey from Tashkent to London via Almaty and Astana. My flight from Astana to London has been delayed, which happens. It’s not the first time and won’t be the last. Air Astana’s handling of the delay has bee utterly abysmal and frankly negligent. I was at the airport 1.5 hours before my flight was due to leave as I was transferring from Almaty. I had no notification or text message, I just found out when I wanted to make my way to the gate! I tried to find some staff, no one was around to ask questions. I went to the business lounge, who rang someone and said “they’re coming”. A whole 40 mins later, no one came. I went to one of the gates to ask staff there. They asked if I was on the Dubai flight. When I said no, they walked off. At this point I didn’t know whether my flight was cancelled, delayed or what time it was due to London. I eventually found a desk in the corner of the terminal and they advised me to go upstairs to get some food and water. They had no vegetarian options at all and tiny cups of water. I’ve been travelling for 20 hours at this point and still don’t know when I’m going to get home ... but at least I have a drop of water to keep me going.. Do yourself a favour and book any other airline.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Novosibirsk to Almaty via Nur Sultan. Check in was easy and straight forward. There were no problems with being 1kg overweight. Both flights left and landed on time. Cabin crew were polite and spoke good English and managed to serve a snack on each flight, despite them being short flights. Seats were comfortable. I had paid extra for the Nur Sultan - Almaty leg and quite spacious.

### "one of the best experiences"
Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I credit Air Astana for their superior service on a recent flight from KUL to ALA last Tuesday 1st October. The service received on the flight was second to none, where the team leader provided a first class service during the the 7 hour flight. The quality of the main meal, wine and snack was excellent. I know Air Astana has received some criticism in the past but it was one of the best experiences I have had when flying. They made you feel welcome and special from start to finish.

### "billed R1800 for my hand luggage bag"
Beijing to Almaty. Airline billed me R1800 for my hand luggage bag, while was within its weight limit. According to their statement hand luggage and a laptop bag is 2 items, hence the reason I needed to check in my hand luggage, knowing only on bag is allowed. They than ask me to pay via my debit card. We were a team and I was asked to pay, my team was allowed to take hand luggage and a laptop bag. I demand my money to be refunded.

### "only 1 kg of checked luggage"
Moscow to Shymkent via Almaty. For foreign passengers buying Air Astana's tickets through travel websites such as Expedia or Priceline, beware of tactics in getting people to buy their low priced tickets, only to find out the 'Economy Class with one piece of checked luggage included' actually means only 1 kg of checked luggage, which is less than the weight of most suitcases! On their website, the baggage policy for Economy class is stated as 20 kilos, with no mention of a 1 kilo policy. We flew from Moscow to Shymkent and even though our confirmation page clearly stated we are economy passengers with 1 piece of luggage included, we were forced to pay for excess luggage because their system showed we are not allowed checked luggage. We complained to the supervisor in charge of Air Astana check in desk at Moscow SVO airport but she was rude and unhelpful. She was basically saying 'I don't care what your Confirmation Page says. We go by our system so either pay or don't fly! We have since complained to Air Astana and asked for a refund, but no reply yet. Beware!

### "express my deep gratitude"
Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the crew of KC936 at the 25th August for their good work in conditions of prolonged turbulence. The stewardesses, in spite of the shaking, carried out the service, organize food and drinks. The food was excellent. Service was on top! Thanks to the pilots and the entire crew for the excellent flight.

### "not at all apologetic for the delay"
Astana to Delhi via Almaty with Air Astana. Horrible experience, airlines delayed the flight but gave no updates or indications when the flight would go. They changed the pre blocked seats, shifted me from aisle to window, this is despite having a boarding card for aisle seat. When I complained to cabin crew, they were arrogant and told me you did not pay to block so we can move you if we want. They were not at all apologetic for the delay, on top of that they did not serve a proper meal saying that I had not made a special request, which is strange as I had not made a special request while coming into to Almaty as well, but the they served the meal. The passenger in the seat in front also had an issue and the stewardess was like you can write if you want it doesn’t matter.

### "it was a total chaos"
Our flight from Baku to Nur-Sultan was supposed to depart at 11.50pm on 23 June 2019. However, due to mechanical problems, the flight got cancelled and we were rebooked on the flight at 11.50pm on 24 June 2019. Therefore, we were delayed to depart Baku for 24 full hours. The Air Astana ground staff in Baku Airport made absolutely no formal announcement in English about the process. So we did not know what to do and what to expect. Many passengers just formed a circle around the ground staff and it was a total chaos. The whole process took almost 5 hours from flight cancellation until we got our bags and left the airport. All passengers were very exhausted and we were not provided any food or drink during that time. We were provided food or drink for the first time around 6 hours after flight cancellation. It seems to me that Air Astana could not professionally handle flight delay/cancellation situations. I also requested Air Astana to provide us delay compensation according to the "Air Astana Rules on Long Delay Cancellation and Denied Boarding" policies on 28 June 2019. I have not heard from Air Astana since then.

### "personnel are professional and attentive"
Not Verified |  Almaty to Moscow. Every time I used Air Astana I was always satisfied by the service provided and attention to every detail. Aircrafts are ideally clean, quality of food is good, personnel are professional and attentive. But this flight positively surprised me. New aircraft, updated stylish kits for passengers and especially children, comfortable chairs. I felt myself, like I was in business class! In general, compared with other airlines, Air Astana differs by its client orientation in every element of service: dessert choice, music, responding to requests, desire to do all that is possible to solve client issues, cleanness inside aircrafts - which is very important (blankets, toilets, etc).

### "they were extremely unprofessional"
Almaty to Dushanbe with Air Astana. Forced me off my flight during check in (plane was not cancelled, it was overbooked) even though I booked 3 months in advance. Staff said this happens everyday and could provide no help. They suggested I contact their office who has not responded to my questions. Staff even asked me to please complain because this happens so often and they are clearly sick of it. To avoid this problem for others, I would recommend not using this airline as they were extremely unprofessional and no one could answer my questions. I travel every month to many countries across Asia and have never been treated so poorly. Later, Air Astana replied to my compliant with A) Wrong flight/date, and B) blamed it on a travel agent (I didn't use a travel agent) and C) stated an email notification was sent when it was not. The fact that they will lie to invalidate my legitimate complaints shows the type of business they do.

### "would go out of my way to fly Air Astana again"
I have never been so positively shocked by any other airline in my life! I've heard nothing but good things about Air Astana, but my experience even exceeded those high expectations. On the 2hr45m trip from Baku to Almaty, there was a full amenity kit provided (that which rivals those on transatlantic routes) ear plugs, pen, toothbrush and toothpaste, lotion, comb, eye mask, and socks! Small candies were provided before takeoff on both flights. The meal provided from Baku to Almaty was average (it's always a risk coming from a city which isn't a hub.) On the Almaty-Bishkek leg, water was provided before takeoff, as it's a less than 1 hour-long flight. The cabin crew were so pleasant and well spoken in Kazakh, Russian, and English, and the pilots gave beautifully detailed and eloquent messages in all three languages as well. Seats were average, but I didn't mind with all of the other services provided. Important - Row 14 on the 757-200 aircraft has no window, so please take caution when reserving seats. All in all, I would go out of my way to fly Air Astana again!

### "friendly and professional"
Nur Sultan to Shymkent. Extremely nice experience. Food and drinks served on short flight all included in the ticket price. Cabin crew very friendly and professional.

### "review Cabin crew training"
Almaty to Istanbul. Please review your Cabin crew training program. KC 911 on 17/06 delayed for 30 mins. Actually there were at least 3 flights, which were delayed around of this time. Ground staff of Air Astana did excellent work. Even though it was crowded, they handle situation professionally. 5 star to Ground staff. (Except of one thing. Lady on the check-in counter told me, that there is no delay of the flight, when actually it was a delay for 30 mins. I mean, not a big deal and most probably delay wasn't announced to staff at that moment. But fact is fact, I would rather spend 30 mins with my beloved ones, instead of crowded "transit" area (if you can call Almaty airport hall a transit area)). Real bad experience starting with announcement of the flight. Not sure, whose fault it is, airport or airline, but should be sorted. You can not hear, what staff announced, it is simply hard to understand about which flight she was talking about. Sound had a really bad quality. Waiting area was crowded and too loud. Almaty airport is very old and small. It should be replaced a long time ago. The reason, why I'm leaving this comment are cabin crew. Seriously guys, you need to review your politics and training program. As a constant customer, you can see how quality is going down. If Supervisors and business class crew are still on track, your junior/economy staff is losing a mark. Crew was rude. They commanded to do procedures, before take off and when customers (who may never flew before) looked for explanation, the answers were very sharp and again rude. Crew responded with single words, time to time mixing it with Russian, and it was obvious that it was hard for them to express themselves in single sentence. They gave an option of two meals, as usual chicken and beef. However during serving, crew literally served us without asking anything. When someone noticed, that they would prefer beef, crew responded, that she would prefer beef as well, but what is left is left. Same crew complained, that she has to wait for customers when all of them visit restroom, and because of what she is not able to serve the rest, who were keep calling her.

### "a 4 Star experience"
Nur Sultan to Frankfurt. In every sense a 4 Star experience. As a frequent traveller it was my first 4 flights from FRA to ALA via TSE and back and I was impressed. An excellent product with attention to detail. The presentation and quality of the inflight catering in my opinion is slightly above a 4 star carrier. Great airline,great product.

### "children's food came as baby food"
Seoul to Istanbul via Almaty. I was uneasy throughout the flight. Passengers have been on board for over an hour and have not left. In the meantime, the announcement came 40 minutes later. The children's food came out as baby food. I asked stewardess the adult meals because child could not eat, but she declined firmly.

### "Food was perfect"
St-Petersburg to Istanbul via Almaty. A21 neo for both ways with Recaro seats,comfortable for 5-6 hours flight. Food was perfect, especially from Istanbul. Good choice of beverages. On the way to Istanbul I over slept my dinner, but I got it after and the coffee was hot. In Istanbul new airport I had to visit Air Astana kiosk and I got  qualified assistance there! Other flights Saint-Petersburg to Almaty, from Almaty to Astana and back to Saint-Petersburg were very good.

### "never come back with blanket"
My flight from Tbilisi to Bangkok via Almaty on 15-16APR. I wasn't sure what’s wrong with inflight service for sector ALA to BKK. My friend and I have asked crew for blanket as it’s very cool and we were unable to adjust the temperature due to the type the aircraft which didn’t have the option on the compartment. She was providing blanket to passengers and when she reached my row/seat, she said that “Women/Children first” Her tone/sound eye contact was very rude. Is this policy to provide blanket to women and children first? I don’t mind if I get after, but I didn’t get it. I doubt that Women/children paid more expensive ticket? However, I also paid for the ticket. I was’t taking free flight. We were waiting until she provided blanket to all women and children. However, she has never come back with blanket to us. My woman friend sit behind has offered her blanket to me as I was so cool and freezing. Have sent this comment to the airline and they apologized but not response or clarify from what I doubt/questions. In addition, drink has’t served even water in the morning before landing at Bangkok. I asked for water, but the crew said I am busy with collecting blanket and never come back to us.

### "Excellent economy flight"
Excellent economy flight with Air Astana. This was an afternoon flight and they provide an amenity cit for all passengers and a blanket. Cabin crew friendly and hospitable. Several times they go around with drinks and the food was really delicious. A perfect Economy flight.

### "best option for the region"
Almaty to Istanbul. I use Air Astana for my domestic and international flights, I can say that they are best option for the region. The quality of service, aircraft quality keeps increasing.

### "impression is great"
Dubai to Almaty. Overall impression is great. Flight attendants very attentive and nice - food is good. Entertainment, since I am traveling often, variety is limited for me. Renewed in two months, not enough. Some some standard business class seats, but I would prefer to Beijing a bed seat, it is night flight.

### "a very nice experience"
Almaty to Astana on an early morning flight in economy class. I was impressed by this aircraft which still feels very new inside. Inflight entertainment is available at each seat (with a USB port) and there is a good selection of programs. The flight attendants were nice and professional, good info from the pilots and we arrived to Astana with no delay. Overall a very nice experience.

### "Consistency of ground service"
Almaty to Astana. Consistency of ground service, food, cabin service and inflight entertainment are core values of this airline. Sometimes I push myself to have connecting flights to the destinations where they have no direct flights.

### "nightmare in trying to confirm cancellations "
The shared Lounge Facility at Heathrow was very good. The ground crew and cabin crew were all very friendly as my wife was travelling with a very painful condition. The Business Class seats offer a great deal of room and can be arranged to lie flat, but are a bit hard, the food was good. The cabin crew arranged for a wheelchair and assistance at Astana, which was there on arrival. We unfortunately had to cancel our onward flights to Bangkok as my wife's condition took an unexpected turn for the worse. We had a nightmare in trying to confirm cancellations and working out the refund due. Customer service had not replied to an email after 10 days. However, it is not that mistakes happen that is a detriment to airlines, it is how they are handled by senior management. I wrote to the CEO vie email and got a very prompt response, with a 2 page letter explaining some of the background, but more importantly what would be done to avoid a repeat should this happen to someone else.

### "perfect meal each way"
This journey was 6 legs long with Air Astana. Saint-Petersburg to Almaty, from Almaty to Ust'-Kamenogorsk and back, Almaty to Aktobe and back, and finally from Almaty to Saint-Petersburg. If my trip from LED to ALA is usual thing almost two times a year, but my new discovery was domestic flight KC863/864 from Almaty to Aktobe. Oh my god, even choice of hot meal dish. Other stuff just have to mention : clean cabin, perfect meal each way. I also had my air astana's mug I got last year. It's capacity is about 400 ml and asked to fill it up with coffee: "no problem, sure!“ I heard the answer! My flight from Ust'-Kamenogorsk was delayed, but I got notification by e-mail 4 hours before departure, so I was still at home. 6 flights and only one delay. I think it's good factor. overall: everywhere I saw attentive staff, helpful managers and perfect service.

### "cabin crew are very professional"
Amsterdam to Atyrau. I am a regular user of Air Astana for work purposes and have been for over a year now. I had never heard of Air Astana before so I was very skeptical to say the least. What a mistake that was. I would put Air Astana right along big international carriers. The on board service and food are excellent the flights are on time. The cabin crew are very professional and language skills are excellent.

### "modern, well appointed planes"
Tashkent to Hong Kong via Astana/Almaty. Arrived early at Tashkent airport just to be told that Astana Air does not offer a lounge at that airport anymore. Boarding was chaotic, as they annouced boarding, traveling business class I rushed to the gate, only to be told to wait 10 minutes. Then, they started boarding the around 100 economy class passengers as I waited standing by the counter. After around 15 minutes, I was invited to board, very weird process. Once onboard, I was greeted by 2 friendly flight attendants, who showed my seat and offered an welcome drink. Cabin was beautiful with mood lighting and well apointed, very comfortable seat for 2 hours flight. After take off, they offered more drinks with warm nuts, plus took dinner orders. Food was delicious, well prepared and of high quality. Next flight from Astana to Almaty, they offered a good lounge in Astana, with some basic snacks. They had a special boarding line for business, boarding was very efficient and fast. 767 cabin is really beautiful, well appointed and comfortable even for longer flights. Welcome champagne offered and menus distributed. Food, once again, excellent and high quality, as well as drinks options. From Almaty to Hong Kong, the longest portion, I was invited to the lounge, but as I entered it, I was advised that Air Astana passengers cannot use the buffet facility or bar, and must pay for any drink consumption of drinks, even water. Noticed passengers from other airlines using the same lounge to have access to a full buffet and drinks choice, so very poor experience for Air Astana premium customers. Anyway, they also offered a separate line for business class and boarding was fast and efficient. Once again a 767 with beautiful cabin and very comfortable flat seats. Also this time, crew was courteous and friendly and dinner was of high quality, as well as drinks. They also offered a very nice ammenities kit and noise-reducing headsets, but wifi was not working on this flight. All in all, in those 3 flights, I received excellent service from professional and courteous flight attendants plus high quality ammenities and food / drink choices. Only aspect to be improved are the lounges experience, especially for international flights. But all flighst were ontime, with excellent crew and modern and well appointed planes/cabins, so I am looking forward to fly on Air Astana business class again in the future.

### "All flights on time"
Saint-Petersburg to Astana, Astana to Almaty and from Almaty to Tbilisi. Food just perfect, chicken with baked potatoes, next flight potato dumplings with bacon, and the last one beef with pasta. Good amenity kit on international flights in economy class - useful brush, tooth paste, socks. First flight was on A320 with no personal screens, but I used KC TV app. Next flight about 1 hour and it was B757 with personal entertainment, and the last one was Embraer 190 also I was using KC TV. Cabin crew on the flight from Almaty to Tbilisi was unbelievable attentive. All flights on time, clean cabins.

### "way more than I expected"
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Astana / Almaty. Air Astana was way more than I expected. Check in was super easy and the cabin service is great. The food, drinks and entertainment make long flights easier. They took amazing care of me when flights changed but I had an important appointment and they moved things around for me to get me back in time. They also put me up in a great hotel where I was also able to go explore Kazahkstan for a day! I will definitely be looking for flights with them again.

### "weren't able to give me an answer"
I'm replying back on Air Astana's response which been posted on 18th September 2018 : Air Astana's response: Let us highlight that the transfer counter in Beijing is not just an Air Astana or Cathay Dragon transfer counter. It is a general airport transfer counter for all airlines, and all transfer passengers wait there for the counter to be opened at 6am. Based on the report from our colleagues in Beijing, on arrival you were met by our staff, who checked your baggage tag and passport. After the transfer counter opened, you were provided with boarding pass on time and continued with your flight to Hong Kong. I asked so many times Air Astana representatives to recheck exactly this details about operation hours of transit counter in Beijing, they weren't able to give me an answer. Based on the report - "your colleague in Beijing met me and provided the boarding pass"?! Nobody met me at the transfer zone, the lady from the immigration desk saw i was crying and offered me the help, she wrote on a piece of paper details of my flight based on my ticket on my phone, the boarding pass i got only at the gate, couple minutes before it closed! My baggage was founded by Cathay Dragon - yes, but when at the same day i called Air Astana representatives before my baggage been found and asked to check regarding my missing baggage, i got an answer over email only after 1 week. I have been a loyal customer of Air Astana over 11 years and instead of apologies, Air Astana representative try to look this case that it's my fault - its fault of Air Astana representatives. You cannot sell on your official website the tickets which have only 1H transit time, i believe you should recheck transit desks operating hours before you sell those connection flight or at least notify your clients about potential risk of missing the connecting flight, as flight arrive at 5AM transit desk open at 6AM next flight at 7AM. 2. I believe Air Astana representatives should have better knowledge about those details and when clients ask about transfer activities in the airport where will be connection flight, your rep. should be able to provide this info. I will not even bother to write all this post but its very affair that after 11 years using your airline I have been treated like this!

### "aircraft was new and clean"
Delhi to Almaty. The aircraft was new and clean. Business Class passengers were greeted and escorted. The staff were attentive and courteous. Food on board was as good as airline food can be. We were a group of over hundred passengers that flew in over 3 days for a celebration and in spite of a some celebratory behavior, the crew were friendly and tolerant. One of the return flights had some technical issue and the aircraft had to be changed. We are looking forward to travel back again.

### "a solid experience"
Delhi to Almaty. Great airline and service, no complaints. The staff was courteous and helpful. New planes, overall a solid experience, highly recommended.

### "no personal inflight entertainment"
Delhi to Moscow via Astana. The Check-in staff at Delhi airport were more suspicious towards Indian passengers. The staff was asking more questions than the immigration officers. The ground staff was managed by Air India. And the staff of the Air India is the worst, they were very rude and behaved unprofessionally. The in-flight entertainment looked like it was from the 90's. There was no personal inflight entertainment system on board. The plane looked the older fleet. Cabin Crew was quite friendly. But the food was the typical. I expected Kazakhstan cuisine on board. Beef was not served on Board. And now the Transit part. Astana airport was of good size and very well maintained. But the problem is that the airport doesn't provide drinking water to the departure and transfer passengers and people have no choice but to buy drinking water (1 euro for 500 ml). Wifi was not working, the login wasn't opening (neither in my laptop nor in my mobile phone). Astana to Moscow no complaints for this flight because everything was perfect. From food to the in-flight entertainment system. Returning, Moscow Sheremetyevo to Almaty in-flight service by the cabin crew was very good. Problem was that there was no personal inflight entertainment system. The Check-in staff at the Moscow Sheremetyevo was quite friendly and helpful. Almaty to Delhi flight was late due to transfer passengers. But it was not a problem because the duration was not much. The problem The cabin crew looked exhausted for no reason. The food served on the flight was only a light breakfast (omelette and a small piece of potato cutlet) which is not sufficient for a 2 hour+ flight. A complete meal should have been served. There was personal no in-flight entertainment system. Only a screen on top at a distant which was playing a movie in Russian/Kazakh. Almaty airport was quite Small but well maintained. The airport looked crowded because of the huge amount of passengers. And also no potable water for passengers. Only payable bottled water.

### "Excellent service"
Not Verified |  Flew Delhi to Almaty with Air Astana. Excellent service, the aircraft was well maintained and they exceed our expectations on ground too. Even though we had a technical glitch with the aircraft they were super fast to resolve it.

### "awful experience"
Hong Kong to Tbilisi via Almaty. A horrible and awful experience I ever met. Unprofessional ground crew and poor arrangement of delayed flight. I wont take Air Astana again and wont recommend.

### Air Astana customer review
Delhi to Almaty return. Our group was more than 20 passengers travelling to Almaty from Delhi on 10th Sept. We were very impressed with the in-flight service and the personal touch. One of the air hostesses also welcomed us both in Hindi and English. Our group’s return journey was on 17th September from Almaty to Delhi which was again very comfortable and the service was extremely good.

### "Worst flight experience"
Bishkek to Kuala Lumpur via Almaty. Worst flight experience in 30 years! The flight was grounded unannounced by the pilot after a minor medical emergency of an elderly lady who had become unconscious in economy class and all +200 passengers were forced to evacuate at Turkmenistan airport and were left there for 15 hours with no water, no food and zero care, whilst the crew was relaxing and recovering in their hotel. The flight resumed after 15 hours with the same crew, whom I perceived as careless and unprofessional. For one unconscious lady passenger, more than 200 were left stranded. Needles to say we lost our connection flights (different airline) in Kuala Lumpur and were forced to pay. This was the first and last time I took Air Astana and so will be my associated, family and friends.

### "a high level of service"
Almaty to Kuala Lumpur. My family and I travel with Air Astana and are accustomed to a high level of service provided by the airline. During a flight last week from Almaty to Kuala Lumpur I witnessed a crew have to respond to an emergency medical situation about an hour into the flight. The professionalism of the Captain and Crew in handling the situation resulted in saving the life of a passenger. Medical emergencies can happen to anyone and at any time. Having experienced the crew's actions first hand I am confident that my family and I are in safe hands with Air Astana.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience and terrible service. Its overpriced flights, for a direct 6H flight from Hong Kong to Almaty i paid 1700USD! For this price during the flight we didnt have TV, worked only 1 toilet, can you imagine the toilet condition, it was disgusting! Food was terrible and stewardess completely ignored when i asked for water at list 5 times. I was flying back from Almaty to Hong Kong with the stop at Beijing. When I was doing check-in at Almaty airport at Air Astana counter, as i have Nomad Club and its automatically set request window seat when i buy an online ticket, a representative from Air Astana said, they don't know why it doesn't work and they don't have time to check what is the problem. They gave me only one boarding pass, however, did check in to my baggage directly to HK. Air Astana representative said i don't need a China visa as only 2H transit and boarding pass they will give me at Beijing transit, as it was 5 AM flight transit counter was closed. i couldn't go through immigration as I don't have Chinese visa. I almost missed my flight, luckily because i been crying for 2H at immigration desk, the lady at immigration helped me and wrote on a piece of paper my boarding pass, to let me go through immigration so i can go to different Terminal where was my flight to HK. I arrived to HK my baggage was lost! I emailed and called to Air Astana the same date when I arrived in HKG, they promised to find my baggage as soon as possible and study my case with their terrible service, it was one week since Air Astana baggage department finally contacted me. Plus my suitcases arrived broken!

### "Terrible client relationship"
Almaty to Seoul. The flight was delayed because of technical issues and this affected our travel plans, which ended up emptying our pockets because we had rearrange our following flights that were following. We wrote a letter to Air Astana 6-7 times requiring the compensation. We sent the invoice of our expenses, that we received from Vietnam representatives as a check of payment. Air Astana told us that invoice is not a valid document for compensation. We talked to Vietnam partner again, and received a letter from them stating that invoice document they gave us earlier serves as a check of payment in Vietnam and they can only provide the invoice document in their country. We forward this letter to AirAstana and never got response. Terrible client relationship. For two months I can not get my money back, not talking about the time value of money.

### Air Astana customer review
Moscow to Delhi via Almaty. Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional "thick" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though. To conclude, I recommend Air Astana, and the economy experience is outstanding, but I will try to fly via Astana next time, since Almaty airport is just so awful.

### "service unbelievably attentive"
St Petersburg to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty / Astana. Clean new cabin, perfect meal each way, especially from Astana. I have to mention that food cooked in Kazakhstan always better than from other airports. Wide choice of beverages. Good schedule : short connection in Astana on the way back to LED. KC TV app very useful and its good thing for flights no longer than 5 or 6 hours and cabin not equipped with personal entertainment system. Service unbelievably attentive. Absolutely recommended.

### "Service attentive"
St Petersburgh to Oskemen via Almaty. Clean new cabin, perfect meal each way, especially from Astana. Wide choice of beverages. Even for the day flight they give you trip suite. Good schedule : short connection in Astana on the way back to LED. TV app very useful and its good thing for flights no longer than 5 or 6 hours and cabin not equipped with personal entertainment system. Service attentive. Absolutely recommended.

### "significant improvements"
St Petersburg to Bangkok via Almaty. There has been significant improvements to this airline in the fourteen years since I first flew. It was a day service between St Petersburg and Almaty on a clean A320. Seats were comfortable, spacious and with a reasonable recline. Food was good and well presented. In flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection. Cabin service was a little hit and miss - I asked for wine with my meal and by the time I realised that it had been forgotten I had finished and did not ask for it. The cabin crew spoke reasonable/good English but only spoke to me in Russian because initially I had spoken to them in Russian. The check in in St Petersburg was fast, efficient and in English. They had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane. The flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in Almaty. The Almaty - Bangkok sector was a night flight on a new Dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 2.30 am. Check in in Almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers. (It would have been faster to use the economy check in counter)! Food was good and the seat/bed was comfortable and there was quite a selection of in flight entertainment. I was identified as a foreigner and so spoken to in good English. The plane left and arrived on time and again my luggage was amongst the first off the plane.

### "very memorable flight"
Astana to Dubai. It was very nice family trip from start to finish. Everything about the flight was perfect, quick check-in, boarding, quality of special meal, reservation of seats and comfort, kids amenities, entertainment system, cleanness of cabin. I would only recommend to provide wifi access but cabin crew informed me that internet is available on some flights. Since I flew with my daughter of 4 years old I had things to do and hadn’t had a chance to enjoy internet anyway. Crew is very positive and i have been individually welcomed as a Silver member. Overall it was very memorable flight and I would recommend Air Astana!

### "I was upgraded"
Kiev to Almaty. During my stay in Kiev transit, I was upgraded to business class, which made my day. On-board  service was professional, good english-speaking, good service. Food quality and presentation incl. menu fulfilled expectation without any complaints. Choice of beverages was interesting. Entertainment via wifi is working well, the provided screens on high quality. Air Astana are highly recommended from me.

### "Not the worst but not the best"
Air Astana has practically a monopoly in the Central Asian region where I live and work and they don’t hesitate to remind the customer of that. I have travelled approximately 75-100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from Moscow for both myself and my fiance. You’d think this sort of ‘loyalty’ (is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options?) would earn me a little more respect than what I received today, but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports, all I seem to get is ignorance and hostility. Customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in Central Asia in my experience so I’m long past expecting “service with a smile.” I was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of Dushabe. Apparently Air Astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing. These fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit (10kg for Nomad Club Silver members) when the standard tickets allow for 20kg (30kg) respectively. I unknowingly booked this fare through a third-party website where there was no indication that this wasn’t a standard fare ticket. As I said, the ticket price wasn’t particularly cheap. I expect this sort of thing from FlyDubai or Wizz Air but from a national flagship airline? Seriously? Of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a government-backed monopoly? And about the Nomad Club, it’s quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is. Almaty Airport, the airline’s hub, is a glorified bus station which is insanely overcrowded, overpriced, and boring. On a positive note, the air crew staff are polite, if not exceedingly. Not the worst but not the best.

### "exceptional high standards of service"
I have had to recently use some other airlines and this has reinforced my appreciation of Air Astana’s cabin services. Air Astana has set and manages to maintain exceptional high standards of service. Al the cabin crew appear to have fundamental English skills. The new uniform is fresh and professional. The safety video has been improved and is actually pleasant to watch even after many flights in a short time frame. The new aircraft have screens on the backs of the seats and passengers can select their entertainment. The new earphones are great and I always keep the set. The passenger pack is in a useful bag and the products inside are good but I miss the mini-biro pen. The food and beverages are of good quality with a proper cutlery. I have found the cabin crew to be attentive and responsive to my needs. Depending on the airport I have boarded check-in staff may not have the same consistency but my recent check in at Atyrau was good (this is not usually a friendly airport though there are some exceptional individuals working there). I would say without fear of reproach that Air Astana is my preferred airline of choice.

### "Fantastic service from cabin crew"
Flew Delhi to Astana with Air Astana. Fantastic service from cabin crew, and airport personnel. Improved meals. Still need to get personal TV screens on all seats, on all flights. The "watching shows/films on my own personal device" is a cheap way out, I definitely do not like this option. In the year 2018, all planes should have screens on all seats especially on long flights! Always feel safe on Air Astana flights! Air Astana is a top-notch airline!

### "good entertainment"
Almaty to İstanbul in March 2018. There was no delay on flight. I remember smiling crew faces for that trip. There was delicious food and good entertainment for 6 hours flight. Note: wishing to see bigger planes for such a long vayage.

### "I write to commend staff"
Antalya to Almaty. I write to commend staff on an exceptional level of service when I traveled with Air Astana on the 23 May. The service I had was a superb experience throughout the flight. I trust that you will pass on this recognition to the specific staff members from this flight.

### "staff is very nice and friendly"
Istanbul to Atyrau. I'm traveling for more than 15 years with this company (I am also a "Nomad Club" member as Gold). I can  recommend Air Astana since their prices even better than competitors in the region. The airline is improving. The last flight  was a safe, comfortable and pleasant flight. The staff is very nice and friendly the food is good. Topping all that were the good selection of movies on board.

### "crew was attentive"
Tashkent to Almaty. Excellent food, high tech inflight entertainment via their application and on time. Although flight was only for one hour thirty minute crew was attentive. The only thing I would feel to improve to make announcements shorter since all are in three languages.

### "The catering is perfect"
I am frequent flyer with Air Astana. Almaty – Dubai is the best available option. The check in procedure at the business class counter works smoothly without any problems. Business lounge at Almaty Airport is not good. Boarding is OK, still some airport problems, not enough jet bridges. The seats are comfortable for a five hour flight if it is not a night flight. The catering is perfect, flight attendants are very attentive, beautiful smiles. The entertainment program is OK, we are provided with iPad in business class with good choice of the video programming. Internet is missing on this type of the aircraft.

### "refuse to bring my hand luggage"
Frankfurt to Astana. It is my first time to refuse to bring my hand luggage because I have the computer backpack and a small handbag! The hand luggage is 9kg, but I took out a think book and said it could not account to the whole weight. They still not listen to me. i was refused to bring it on board and pay money as the overweight luggage. Afterwards I will select another airline but not Air Astana.

### "tv screen did not work"
Almaty to Dubai. Business class with 28 seats and 15 degree seat recline for more than 4 hours flight? First and second rows are for extra charge, that gave you no choice for meal. As they start asking meal preferences from back rows, by the first row it happens nothing to choose from. Only one restroom in business class. Broken multimedia system, tv screen did not work. Still there is least and not last - very nice crew members.

### "I expect good service"
Almaty to Astana. The early morning flight allowed me to have the whole Sunday I could spend in Astana. We had a good breakfast in the aircraft. This year I enjoy my Silver Nomad. Despite of the downrating I was happy to know that Nomad Club members start to enjoy better scoring of points. Now we are 3 times quicker to collect the points necessary for the new tier or bonus ticket. Nomad Club develops well and I appreciate it. This weekend I will have my next flight to Almaty to enjoy running at Almaty Marathon that is also supported by Air Astana. As usual I expect good service from Air Astana that keeps me being a loyal client.

### "I wanted to get a refund"
I wanted to get a refund for a flight that I didn't take in January. Informed Air Astana in advance that I won't be able to travel. Asked to transfer my money back to another bank account as the old one was already closed. After three months of slow feedback, collecting all necessary papers by myself, contacting my previous bank in Asia, this company stopped answering my emails. But the strangest thing happened when they transferred my money to Cambodia, though I live in Ukraine. Though they said that "your refund is in process", now they just don't answer at all.

### "Very good experience"
Almaty to Kiev. Very good experience on this flight. The crew was very attentive and helpful,  and plenty of legroom considering we were on a 6 hour flight on A320. Amenities were great and they offer everything you need to enjoy the flight.

### "service and food were excellent"
Excellent flight. This was quite different from the outbound KL-Almaty 10 days ago which was delayed 6 hours. The biz class is configured in 1-2-1, so every pax has his/her own aisle. The bed is flat at 180 degree (unlike the Air Astana 757). The service and food were excellent. While the TV screen was big, the choice of movies could have been improved. Air Astana, after the incidents with the outbound flight delay (Almaty - KL), you have redeemed yourself thanks to two of your very dedicated managers in the Kuala Lumpur operation. In addition, your b-class product in 767 is also way better than that of 757.

### "Service was exceptional"
Excellent service from Air Astana team. A very pleasant flight of just under 4 hours flying from Moscow to Almaty. Service was exceptional and the crew very attentive. A very smooth flight and pilot was very careful with manoeuvres. Overall I was very impressed with this airline and felt very safe.

### "Cabin crew were effective"
Bangkok to Almaty on Boeing 757. Quick and efficient check in and given priority pass and lounge invitation. Boarding was quick. Seats were angled flat but reasonably comfortable. Cabin crew were effective and had good English. Meals were quite tasty but not quite to the standard that I have come to expect from Air Astana. Flight was uneventful and landed a few minutes early. Luggage come quite quickly off the plane. Almaty to Moscow (A320) Early morning departure and the traditional sit up business seat with reasonable leg room and comfort. Food was a little disappointing compared to previous flights. Portable entertainment with reasonable selection of films although I mostly slept. Cabin crew were good and again had very good English skills. Plane left and landed on time and luggage came very quickly off the flight.

### "good service and great tasting food"
Almaty to Kuala Lumpur. My final destination was Jakarta, but Air Astana could only check in my luggage until Kuala Lumpur as there was no facility to check in to another airline. The flight was delayed more than 3 hours from Almaty. Original departure time was 11:30PM - it was not until 2:50AM we boarded and left for KUL. During this time the flight time was changed at least 3 times - from 11:30PM, 2AM, 2:30AM and 2:40AM. There was no apology or information provided other than for technical reasons. Due to the delay I missed my connecting flight to Jakarta. The product flat bed is only 140 degree at the best. It is an old style low bed where you almost sleep on the floor. A 10 inch ipad was provided as an alternate to ptv. The movie selections are limited and nothing to rave about. The positive - no crowd in business class, great duvet and blankets, good service and great tasting food.

### "amazing service"
Tehran to Tashkent via Almaty. At the moment I am in transit at Almaty airport (not the best airport to spend the night) but Air Astana pleased me on the flight from Tehran to Almaty. It is the first time I have flown with this airline. Excellent, punctual, well turned out crew. Polite. Clean toilets. Amazing service.

### "recommended? Of course not"
I booked a flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt (with a later connection to Valencia) at 23:00 local time. This flight was departing almost 7 hours later, at 5:50 am. However, when I approached the counter I found out the flight was already delayed to 19:00 pm. 13 hours delay! Ridiculous. And they let me buy the ticket from their own webpage. Most of the passengers accepted hotel and waiting, but ten of us couldn't wait. I explained to them about my connecting flight to Valencia and I accepted any possible route which would take me to Frankfurt on time or any part of Spain but they denied this option for four hours, insisting on my delayed flight with them as my only option (13h waiting in Bangkok airport plus 14h in Astana). Missing my connection to Valencia and being late for work. I even got the chance to talk to someone from management on the phone, but she would only say "I'm sorry". Only good part was their ground staff, which suffered this situation exemplary even though they were lacking the power to do something. Finally I accepted the refund of my ticket, which they signed, and booked a flight with another airline, spending a big amount of money to get to Madrid. After this, I was expecting the refund of the ticket, but they only offer me 3.930THB, which is not even a 1/4 of the amount I paid for the ticket. I have never in my life dealt with a despicable airline such as Air Astana. It makes me feel sad because they have really good staff onboard but, recommended? Of course not. They will ruin your holidays and feel ok about it.

### "very good representatives for the airline"
A small gift provided on boarding the aircraft was a pleasant addition to the warm welcome for all the women travelling on IWD, a gesture which set the tone for a very pleasant return trip from Heathrow to Pavlodar. Each and everyone of the flight staff were friendly and helpful and very good representatives for the airline. There was more than ample space, I could stretch out on three seats and actually managed to sleep. The inflight entertainment was great and the safety notice really slick so I actually watched it in three languages. The catering and hospitality was super and I will look forward to flying with them once more.

### "a very pleasant event"
Whilst my journey from Bishkek to Alamaty was short, I found the flight to be a very pleasant event. The aircraft was quite modern and the seating was very comfortable. The safety advisory video was modern, novel and refreshing, rather than the traditional rushed human version. I found the Air Astana staff to be very pleasant and helpful. I would have no hesitation in recommending Air Astana for future flights.

### "All very easy and positive"
Flew Air Astana from Astana to Frankfurt. All very easy and positive, nice people, good food, comfortable seat and all on time, what more can you ask for? Wonderful safety video performed by silhouette actors, so good that I watched it in all three languages, very clever! Tablet screen just a little disappointing but had a good range of films.

### "they let me down real bad"
Astana to Paris. In general Air Astana offers decent service quality, acceptable food & entertainment on the board along with fairly new aircraft despite quite often being disproportionately expensive. I flew many times with them and never had problems until two days ago when they let me down real bad. When in the beginning of January they started offering promotion flights to several destination in March for their loyalty card holders, me and my sister decided to take advantage of it and planned our trip to Paris during Nauryz (3 day National holiday in Kazakhstan) in advance. However, on Monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 21.03 to 23.03 due to "Spring flight schedule corrections", thus completely eliminating any chance of using these Holidays for a trip. These types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed BEFORE offering promotions on the dates. Upon contacting their CS They declined to change flights or to compensate internal tickets. I'm deeply disappointed however, considering their near monopoly status in Kazakhstan i fear i cannot boycott them that easily. Shame on you Air Astana for scamming your frequent fliers.

### "staff is extremely helpful"
Moscow to Astana. Excellent flying experience. The company uses the newest and comfortable terminal of SVO, which is a definite plus. Very clean and new planes, comfortable seats with enough legroom. Entertainment system is on even during the short flights in economy. The travel kits including a toothbrush with toothpaste, sleeping mask, slippers and a pen is provided even in the economy class. Migration cards provided onboard to much convenience. The staff is extremely helpful, welcoming and nice. The food was absolutely delicious. Steel cutlery provided even in the economy, which is very nice. Great value for money.

### "Cabin crew was welcoming"
Astana to Almaty. Business class seat was comfortable but looks old style and pretty tired, not a flat bed though. For 1,5 hour flight is ok. Cabin crew was welcoming and supportive. Food was not designed to be served on morning flight as they served lunch or dinner menu (chicken and fish) instead of breakfast.

### "a very good experience"
This is a great connection between Almaty and Pavlodar allowing a return trip within 24 hours. I left Almaty for Pavlodar at 6.30 pm on Thursday and was back next day at 5 pm. Although I flew both ways on a smaller Embraer-190 plane, the flight was not long at all taking around 1h 40m in one direction. Both flights were on time, no delays whatsoever. The flight attendants were very friendly and welcoming. It was great to see that it is possible to use the KCTV flight entertainment on this flight via a mobile device - excellent service which will hopefully become available on all Air Astana airplanes. Overall a very good experience and thanks to Air Astana for maintaining high standards of performance on regional flights like this one.

### "food was good, service excellent"
St Petersburg to Kamenogorsk via Astana, flights were in time. Cabin was clean, food was good, especially on the way from LED to TSE and service excellent. Inflight entertainment before I boarded, I got app KCTV to use aboard, this app for cabin WiFi. For me selection of movies should be wider, but when your trip just about 3-4 hours, it is enough. In some planes they still don't have WiFi or captain forgets to turn it on. New terminal in Astana is very good but for passengers flying to countries from former USSR, which now are Customs Union members they don't sell even water in duty free stores because of union's rules (they can't sell alcohol and all stuff with additional tax fee).

### "Never flying them if I can avoid it"
London to Dushanbe via Astana and Almaty. 2.5 hrs delay at Heathrow due to broken brakes. No TVs, chargers or AC on the very old plane. Due to the delay I missed my connection and am stuck in Almaty for 2 nights which I assumed Air Astana were paying for, but the hotel they've just put me up in have just come and asked for payment. Total shambles. Never flying with them if I can avoid it. Staff all very friendly and helpful.

### "will fly Air Astana again"
Astana to London. Air Astana provided me with great assistance at a time when I needed a relaxed easy journey. All staff I encountered were polite and helpful. There were no delays or issues at any point. Plane journey was smooth and arrived on time. Seats were comfortable and food served was delicious, not just for airline food. Entertainment on board is lacing with each seat needed a screen rather than one between rows. Easy booking process and very flexible airline with a personal touch that goes a long way. Will fly Air Astana again.

### "extremely comfortable beds"
Hong Kong to Almaty with Air Astana was amazing. Business class has extremely comfortable beds with your choice of a regular blanket or a lovely plush duvet. Food is terrific with at least four choices for the main course, lovely appetizers and soup. The flight attendants and crews cannot do enough to make you at home. The magazine and media selection is wonderful. Traveling with my eight-year-old daughter was especially nice. Air Astana has an amazing National Geographic branded children's kit which was a huge hit!

### "nice crew and very good service"
Almaty to Bangkok. New plane, nice crew and very good service. I travel with family and also like treatment of my small children - they provide attention, and give gifts. The travel kit in economy class is also great. Excelllent qualty. The pilot kept great contact with passengers. I am really proud of our national carrier Air Astana.

### "flight attendants are very nice"
Moscow to Almaty, A321 is new aircraft with about 32 seats in business, not flat bed but for the 4 hours flight, the seat is enough. The food is good. Rich variety and tasty. Services of flight attendants are very nice, attentive and good. The entertainment system is provided through IPADs, it is good choice, but I would increase the number of the product -if you travel often, you watch everything. Generally, in my experience, it is always on time.

### "certainly fly again with them"
I was flying from London to Almaty via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. I had planned to arrive in Almaty 3 days before the wedding. However, due to the heavy snow fall, the airport at Istanbul closed. I was stranded, without my luggage, and so worried that I would not arrive in time for my wedding as the earliest flight Turkish Airlines could offer was on the day of my wedding. My fiancé saw Air Astana were able to fly earlier and bought me a ticket. I was stranded, without my luggage, not knowing what was happening and when I would be arriving with my fiancé but Air Astana were wonderful and very professional. The cabin crew were a credit to Air Astana. I will certainly fly again with them and recommend.

### "very good quality of services"
Personnel au sol et navigant très agréable et attentif. Bonne ponctualité . Les sièges sont confortables en économie tout comme en sleeper eco . Très bonne qualité de services de manière générale . Les repas sont également de qualité. Le transit à Astana est très facile et les connexions sont bonnes. Très bon rapport qualité prix pour cette compagnie que je recommande vivement. Staff on the ground and navigator very pleasant and attentive. Good punctuality. The seats are comfortable in economy as in sleeper eco. Very good quality of services in general. Meals are also quality. The transit to Astana is very easy and the connections are good. Very good value for money for this company that I highly recommend.

### "highly recommend Air Astana"
Bangkok to Almaty return. First time flying with Air Astana and was incredibly impressed. The service from ticketing, check in to on board was exceptional. Travelling with a baby can often be tiring and stressful however they accommodated our needs every step of the way. On return we had a quick transfer in BKK to another airline. Air Astana staff were able check our luggage right through to the final destination & tagged it to ensure ground crew knew of the urgency. All went very smoothly and we made connections with zero fuss and; our bags arrived first on carousel. I highly recommend Air Astana and look forward to flying them again.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Bangkok to Almaty. I travelled with the Air Astana for the first time and it exceeded my expectations. The airline staff was responsive and extremely attentive. No issue with any request. The food variety and quality was outstanding (I am considered to be picky). The seats were very comfortable whether you wish to sleep or watch a movie. It was the best flight experience I have had.

### "made it an absolute breeze"
Bangkok to Almaty. Traveling on an airline for the first time, with a 1-year-old child is one of the more stressful things you can do, but Air Astana made it an absolute breeze. The service we received on the flight was excellent. The food menu was extensive and varied and the drinks menu was the same. The inflight entertainment was extensive and current and the seats were comfortable (I'm 100kg and 6'2"). Nothing was too hard for the staff, they were  the friendliest hosties I've ever encountered. We will be back.

### "smiling crew, clean cabin"
Air Astana is improving. Even domestic flight was perfect: smiling crew, clean cabin. when they run out of one of drinks stewardess apologized a few times. The weakest thing in Air Astana is inflight entertainment: no personal screens. But they  put wi-fi and suggesting to download app before flight, so, before boarding just get the app!

### "Crew is very friendly"
If you want to go for the shortest travel time from Europe to Urumqi. I travelled from Amsterdam (with Lufthansa) via Frankfurt and Astana (TSE) to Urumqi. The Air Astana flight FRA-TSE was by an old but nicely retrofitted Boeing 757 with blue mood lighting. The flight was advertised having IFE, but this aircraft didn't have any, which was quite a pity. The flight from Astana to Urumqi was with a relatively new A320. The seats on both aircraft were a little old and wobbly. Crew is very friendly and hands out candies prior to take-off and landing. Dinner on the flight from Frankfurt to Astana was good, they even have a menu card. If you order a beer you get a 500cl can, which was a pleasant surprise. All passengers get a small kit with tooth brush, sleeping mask, ear plugs and a pen (useful to fill in immigration cards). During my trip from Amsterdam to Urumqi, I did not encounter any Air Astana ground staff. But when travelling back to Amsterdam, I did and I can say that ground staff is very friendly and helpful, speak English very well. On the way back our flight from Urumqi to Astana was delayed for 4 hours. It was a very pleasant surprise that Air Astana ground staff handed out burgers and softdrinks while we were waiting. And after landing in Astana a very friendly lady was waiting for me and my colleague to help of rescheduling our connecting flights to Amsterdam.

### "got worst seats for travelling with children"
Moscow SVO to Almaty with Air Astana. Specific seats were requested during ticket purchase. The seats were confirmed during online check-in, and even more, I double checked the seats by phone right before the flight. At some point, the aircraft type was changed and nobody warned my family with an infant - they got worst seats on the plane for travelling with children.

### "attendant was very kind"
I did the flight from Paris CDG to Astana in the class called Premium sleepers which I wasn't aware of, great idea of dedicating a full row for one costumer, very easy to get rest, the meal was at business class level. The flight attendant was very kind, making sure everything was fine. On the way back was in business class, very good experience once again, nice meal and atmosphere, with good features and amusement. The only thing was that on my way to Astana, I was told that I couldn't enter the lounge (but I am gold on Flying blue and was Premium sleeper customer).

### "going from strength to strength"
Atyrau to Almaty with Air Astana. Having flown KC since it's inception, I have watched this airline is going from strength to strength. They have a modern fleet with exceptionally well trained and disciplined cabin staff. KC is now genuinely a world class airline. The way I measure world class is not in the mundane (which KC excels at) but when something different pops up - a wallet left on board was returned to me before I had even departed the airport. Lost and Found matched my credit card name to my eticket along with mobile details and tracked me down. Great work in the air, great work on the ground.

### "not the hub of 4 Star airline"
Since 2009 flying once a year I can say Air Astana are getting better. Only one problem, the airport in Almaty is not the hub of a 4 Star airline. sometimes passengers just don't separate roles of airport and company, but I do.

### "cabin crew were friendly and had reasonable English"
Check-ins for both flights were efficient and friendly and done in English. Each flight departed and landed on time. Cabin crew were friendly and had reasonable English (there has been a marked improvement in the 10 years that I have been flying with Air Astana). On the flight to Almaty lunch was served and on the flight to Bangkok a very late dinner was served. With a 1.00 am departure for Bangkok the Airline would be much better served by giving a light supper soon after take off (or have a decent meal available in their lounge) and then having breakfast about one hour before landing. The food was well presented and portion size was adequate. The wines were OK. On the Tbilisi - Almaty sector they offered an IPAD but did not take advantage as I had my own entertainment. My luggage did not get any priority and was one of the last bags unloaded from the plane. From Almaty to Bangkok my luggage did get priority and was off the plane soon after I arrived at the carousel. Overall a pleasant experience without any unpleasant incidents.

### "flights are mostly uneventful"
Bangkok to Almaty via Astana and Almaty to Tashkent return. This was my first time flying Air Astana. I was part of a business trip that was promoting tourism in Thailand. The best flight was ALA-BKK, since they had AVOD on the seat backs - the aircraft don't have AVOD. The food was average, with the exception of BKK-TSE, which gave me a very good breakfast. Most flights, check-in is average, although some employees are more enthusiastic than others, and once onboard the flight, there is a flight attendant handing out candy. Boarding process could've been more efficient. ALA-TAS and back used an Embraer plane, and the seat is the most horrible seat I have sat in and recline is half of what you get on an A320. The flights are mostly uneventful. Overall, I would pay for the upgrade to business class next time, but if I were forced to sit in coach, I wouldn't mind.

### "would certainly use them again"
Flying from Tashkent to Ulaanbaatar via Almaty and Bishkek we had booked all three legs via Air Astana but a month before the departure they notified me that the Astana - Ulaanbaatar leg was cancelled and offered to reroute. Having heard good things about Turkish Airlines we chose the Tashkent-Almaty-Bishkek-UB option with the last leg on Turkish. Air Astana responded to every email of mine within minutes and while we were to have an overnight layover in Astana in the original plan with a hotel paid by us, Air Astana put us up in a new Bishkek hotel with food and transport to and from the airport. The flights themselves were on time, had more then average legroom, newer planes, good food and friendly attendants. Turkish Airlines was the low point of the three legs, being one hour late arriving from Istanbul, but it did complete our necessary connection. Given the need and opportunity I would certainly use them again.

### "we saw no inflight entertainment"
Flew Air Astana from London to Beijing via Astana. We were all disappointed with the aircraft fleet. Despite prominently showing inflight entertainment for economy class on the website we saw no inflight entertainment on our route London to Beijing (surely quite a major long haul route worthy of IFE?). It was a horrid flashback to flying long haul in the 1980s - I thought this was a thing of the past. What is particularly galling is the image of lots of TV screens on the website - mis-selling, beware.

### "overall it was a good experience"
From Seoul to Astana in Air Astana business class. Overall it was a good experience and my first flight with Air Astana, the crew was kind and pleasant, the food not so bad and the legroom more than average. Let's say the service is on the same level of the most famous european airlines (but not even close to the Japanese ones). One thing that disappointed me is that they changed the airplane at the last second and instead of the new Boeing 767 they just received 2 years ago, I  found at the gate a 25 years old 757. Even if the 757 was fully refurbished and the cabin were really well made, they can't hide the age of the plane. I try to choose my flight after a research about the airplane I would fly with and I am happy to pay a bit more for an airline that use new and bigger airplanes. Although it is a common thing for almost all airlines, I'm don't recommend an airline that use narrow body jet for flights longer than 5 hours.

### "outrageous fee for overweight baggage"
Dushanbe to Almaty. While they're inflight service was quite good, their ground service was deplorable. I was charged an outrageous fee for overweight baggage - 144 Euros. They refuse to let me carry my luggage cart onto the plane and required that I check it and charged me an additional 45 Euros. Additionally they charged for food or beverage in the business class Lounge.

### "plenty of legroom"
Normally, there are direct flights from Bangkok to Almaty, but on some days, Air Astana flies with a smaller plane (B757) and makes a short stopover in HCMC. The 2-2 seat configuration is good, as there is plenty of legroom between the rows, the seat is comfortable. The entertainment system consists of iPads with movies, music, games, etc, equipped with excellent earphones. Food is reasonable, though not excellent and the wine / drinks selection rather limited. The crew was pleasant and attentive, but the business class was only occupied at 25%. I have to fly often to Kazakhstan, will avoid the days where the airline stops in HCMC as the trip takes almost 4 hours more.

### "aircraft was clean"
Flew from London to Astana with Air Astana. The aircraft was clean, staff friendly and food great. I had a brilliant experience. To add to this I was upgraded on the way back which really did make my trip.

### "friendly crew and tasty food"
Air Astana from İstanbul to Almaty on a night flight. Plane was satisfactory and the business seats were up to standard. Big size blankets. A friendly crew, and also tasty food. The movies was new realesed. Thanks air Astana.

### "seen some major improvements"
Istanbul to Atyrau. I have been flying now with Air Astana for the past 12 years. In this time I have seen some major improvements in aircraft, entertainment catering and inflight service. Service levels are matching if not exceeding many long established airlines. The crew are attentive and customer focused, expressing Kazakh hospitality in a professional way. The food and beverages are very acceptable and there is a excellent selection of meals for those with special dietary requirements. Something I need to use myself. I enjoy the music selection though the earphones are poor and so I carry my own. You can't always be lucky with the movie but it is guaranteed to be recent. Again their sometime the playback technology can have glitches. Very annoying when you are actually engrossed in a film for it to jump or freeze. The inflight magazine has a nice variety of articles that will meet most tastes. I hope to see them continue on this same flight path for the foreseeable future.

### "service is exceptional"
Delhi to Dushanbe via Almaty. Air Astana is one of the nicest airlines I have flown and their service is exceptional. The flight attendants were polite and helpful, and the seats were clean and comfortable. The food in economy class was some of the best I have had on an airline - several options, including a vegetarian option that was delicious. The selection of newspapers, food, cleanliness, and service in economy class was excellent. I appreciate Air Astana's exceptional quality and service.

### "good flights for economy"
Flew Air Astana from Astana to Bangkok via Almaty. Very good flights for economy, crew are friendly, meals are of reasonable quality, crew passes often with drinks, amenities kit basic but practical, good entertainment with individual screens, cabin and toilets very clean. Anyhow, not many alternatives if you want to fly to Kazakhstan.

### "attentive and thorough staff"
Seoul Incheon to Astana. There had been a plane change from the Boeing 767 I was expecting to a Boeing 757. My assigned seat in Row 1 had been shifted to Row 4 (last row of business class which I always try very hard to avoid) -- and when I discovered it -- I found that it was impossible to change because the other seats were already allocated. The transfer desk at Seoul said that there was a system glitch preventing them from entering my Lufthansa Miles & More Number into the system -- meaning that I would have to save my boarding pass and mail it in after I returned. I resent the imposition on my time. The seats were slanted and I slid off the seat while trying to sleep on it. I may have gotten two hours of sleep on a seven hour flight. Making up for all these issues was the amazingly attentive and thorough staff and the delicious food. They opened the wrong red wine and when I pointed out that it didn't correspond with the menu they had given us, they found the correct bottle and opened it. I was amused that they had obviously served it the 12+ other people before they had gotten to me and that no one else had noticed.

### "service is very good"
It is the first time I took Air Astana to Istanbul. Time was quite convenient, working hours I spent in office and arrived late evening. Enough time for rest and to be fresh in the morning. The food is good, with the great variety and taste. Service is very good, the staff is very attentive. The entertainment system is the ipad provided by the airline which is good solution. But I might say the choice is a bit limited. If you fly a lot, you watch everything good and start to watch international movies that not bad too.

### "service and welcome is perfect"
I am French and thought before that there is no better way to fly than Air France or Lufthansa. Since i am in Kazakhstan (2 years) Air Astana is for me now the number one before European airlines. The service and welcome is perfect, food is really good and most of the time, flights are on time! The fidelity programm is very flexible and very attractive.

### "deterioration in check in"
Atyrau to Istanbul return. Most of the times I check into Atyrau Airport, the customer service at check in is not customer friendly. The communication of any flight delays is sub standard, with passengers not being correctly informed of the real reason why the flights are delayed, just technical fault is communicated. Would recommend the staff go on a customer care course to appreciate that the passengers are actually paying an expensive price for their flights. Been flying with this airline for over 10 years and witnessing a deterioration in the check in process.

### "Thanks Air Astana"
Almaty to Astana with Air Astana, the flight was a bit late, but the staff announced the reason for the delay and we managed to arrive in Astana nearly on scheduled time. The crew was super friendly and attentive. The pilot had a good sense of humour and made everyone smile while making announcements to the passengers. Thanks Air Astana.

### "expensive return ticket"
My expensive return ticket to Bangkok included 5 hours in a seat some charter airlines would be ashamed of, the trip in the opposite direction with unadvertised stop in Ho Chi Minh. The flight was moved forward 15 mins in Bangkok but failed to inform me, but they were late anyway for the original take off time. I won't discuss the food on board.

### "would fly Air Astana again"
Beijing to London via Astana. The flight price was pretty much the same on the Air Astana website as on flight comparison websites, which is usually not the case with airlines playing ridiculous price games. There was a kind refund policy, in which you pay 40 USD per flight as a refund fee if you want to cancel, and you can cancel anytime. I also read that you can get a refund or exchange the ticket if you miss the flight! On the flight the staff weren't petty  and didn't complain when I changed seats and laid across them for a full five hours sleep. Unfortunately the connection flight couldn't leave because the weather outside was so windy and snowy, so i spent a night in Astana, Kazakhstan, in a free and clean hotel with a bus stop right outside of it that very regularly goes directly to the airport for just £0.20. I then caught a flight to Paris the next day on a very modern plane, and from there on Air France to London, which was arranged without cost by Air Astana. Staff generally spoke very good english in Astana, and the office is within the small airport - so there's always someone available for help. When the flight was cancelled due to bad weather in Astana, there was very little information going around as to what would happen next. A simple series of messages would really have put me at ease, as I was quite stressed at the time. But things did turn out completely fine, to my reassuring surprise. The other problem was when I caught the flight from Paris to London, my baggage had not been put on the same flight! To be fair, this may not have been Air Astana fault, as the baggage label definitely listed both Paris and London airports. The bag was put on an Air France flight the next morning and delivered to where I live in about 2 days. I also had a tracking code that I could use to check where the bag was at any time. So overall it wasn't problem free, but everything did work out okay! I would fly Air Astana again.

### "lots of legroom"
Almaty to Hong Kong on Air Astana was one of the best flights I've flown. I loved the new aircraft interior, the Boeing 767 had lots of legroom for me and since there wasn't many passengers boarding I got to use 1 extra seat for me to lie on.

### "kind and polite employees"
Kiev to Delhi via Almaty with Air Astana. I am writing to share for comfortable plane, great variety of food, kind and polite employees on night flight 29th - 30th December 2015. My flight was also easy on timing with less than 1 hour waiting time in Almaty. I appreciate for great service at least 50% cheaper tickets than European or Arabian airlines. (Bought tickets 12 days before departure date).

### "new plane, perfect flight"
Night flight from Almaty to Bangkok. New plane, perfect flight, slept through the whole thing. I was really impressed with Air Astana. Couldn't understand as I only speak english, but managed to get though everything just fine. Only complaint might be when we got off the bus and were trying to get on the plane. Lots of pushing and shoving but this perhaps is a cultural thing but was a bit of an issue. Cost of flight(s) seemed quite reasonable, especially compared to North American flights.

### "may not find overhead storage"
Frankfurt to Astana in Economy class. Air Astana did not restrict the number of luggage pieces that people brought on board my flight. As a result you may not find any space in the overhead luggage storage if you board the flight late. The food was terrible, and the selection of movies.

### "cabin crew were attentive"
This Air Astana flight was from Bangkok to Omsk with stopovers in Almaty and Astana. The food was excellent and separate meals served on each leg of the journey. The flights departed and landed on time. Bangkok to Almaty and then to Astana there was an angled flat bed and I slept for part of the journey. From Astana to Omsk there was the traditional seat but there was plenty of leg room for an Embraer. Cabin crew were attentive and had good English and generally spoke with me in English, even when I used Russian in response. Overall the flight was not good value for money because by including a stopover in Almaty I had to pay the price of two separate tickets (the Bangkok - Omsk ticket was about AUD800 less expensive).

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Almaty to Ust Kamenogorsk return with Air Astana, and flights to and from were on time. The seat was reasonably comfortable. We were given a basic meal in each direction. Cabin crew were friendly and had good English skills. As a domestic flight there was no entertainment service provided.

### Air Astana customer review
We have been surprised by new jets for summer destinations, equipped with modern entertainment, personal ipad with a variety of programs. Quality of meal and drinks onboard is good. Service on board is excellent. Crew were very professional. I can frankly say that these flights were very pleasant for our family and we would fly with Air Astana again.

### Air Astana customer review
Flight from Shymkent to Kuala Lumpur via Almaty and back in April. On vacation we were hospitalized with fever and skipped our flight home. Air Astana appreciated our position and changed dates for our unreturnable tickets without charge, so we could come home later. Great thanks for help, now we are your loyal clients.

### Air Astana customer review
26 April Tashkent-Almaty flight KS128 and 5th May Almaty-Tashkent flight KS127. Embraer 160 from Tashkent-Almaty-Tashkent. Excellent service on Board. It was at a high level starting from check-in to landing. Flight attendants were very neat and friendly also pleased with the print media. Even given candy during takeoff and landing as well as a pillow which were very nice.

### Air Astana customer review
Flight from London on time 767 aircraft with new interior. clean and well presented crew efficient and helpful Food and alcohol selection great seat very comfortable and inflight entertainment console worked well. Arrived on time and fresh. This is a great connection for Kazakhstan.

### Air Astana customer review
Astana-Istanbul-Astana on March 16-18 2015. It was one of my best flight experiences starting from check-in inflight meal offering and friendly approach of flight attendants. It was worth every cent I paid.

### Air Astana customer review
I recently flew return from BKK to ALA. It was the first time I've flown Air Astana and I have to say that I was delighted with the attentive anticipatory levels of service I received. The plane itself looked brand new the business class cabin was spotless and a true delight to sit in. While the inflight entertainment was not as extensive as higher profile airlines this wasn't an issue for me. The dining experience was excellent quality varied food presented fantastically. The service and the environment along with the punctuality made this an excellent first experience of an airline that is clearly having an effect in the region.

### Air Astana customer review
12/2/15 KS942/952 London - Almaty. 21/2/15 KS601/941 Almaty - London. You really get the feeling with Air Astana that the company is genuinely striving for improvement all the time. Staff are extremely courteous and helpful planes are really clean flights generally arrive on time. The new economy sleeper is a winning option for people who dread the loss of a nights sleep but cannot bring themselves to fork out the full business class fare. I travelled with my four children and we all thought economy sleeper was brilliant. At least a chance of sleep much more space quieter cabin and better food that in economy.

### Air Astana customer review
Flight KC929 20 February. Was an overnight flight. Flight left on time and cabin crew were extremely thoughtful. Placed blanket over me while sleeping and when woke even though food service had finished and on way to landing - they found an apple to give me. Was a great experience and very impressed by cabin crew attitude.

### Air Astana customer review
Flight KC930 24 February. Return trip from Hong Kong in mid February. Plane was very delayed but informed. Could in my view been done earlier but was nice to be told a couple of hours in advance. Trip itself was pleasant. Good inflight entertainment and again the inflight crew did an excellent job and were responsive to needs. Food could be improved as compared to other airlines traveled but do note it is economy class.

### Air Astana customer review
I found this routing from HK-Almaty very convenient and have done it a couple of times now. Direct flight airport close to city and city close to ski fields. Great value for money. Well maintained aircraft good attention to service - what more do you need.

### Air Astana customer review
ALA-TSE. B757-200 not new AC but fully refurbished to perfection. Clean and inviting. Crew very well groomed wonderful IFE tasty hot snack on this 80 min flight. Temp however was very high in the cabin and my req to lower it a bit were not fulfilled. I started to feel ill and asked for ice to cool my head crew showed no empathy or care. I was glad it was a short flight.

### Air Astana customer review
IST-TSE-BKK (and back) on A321 and B767 first airplane saws its years the other one is great new and comfortable. The service from the staff was great. Very personalized friendly and they spoke fluent English. There was not IFE on A321 but 2 movies were on drop down screens. Excellent IFE on B767 with HD screens and good variety of movies TV series games. Food was very tasty and plenty of alcoholic drinks beverages coffee/tea. They offer newspapers and amenities kits. Great airline to fly with TSE airport small but new and clean.

I fly regularly on the flight Almaty to Beijing and back. I have to say this is a terrible flight. 4-5 hours at night on an A320. There is little difference between business and economy. The support service for booking and upgrades is simply the worst I have experienced.

### Air Astana customer review
In the last year I have flown Air Astana on 14 different legs now (ALA-SGN ALA-BKK-SGN ALA-ICH and ALA-DEL). During the past the service has been getting better and better. Some irritants during flights such as flight attendants bumping in to your elbows (aisle seats) or waking you up for meals have disappeared. Meals have got better. The old 757 interiors are being renovated. Long flights know offer personal entertainment systems for each person in Economy. All the ticket prices have been reasonable though it is hard to build up miles with Air Astana's Nomad Club. That is one complaint I have with Air Astana. With most airlines I would have gotten free upgrades by now. Many of Air Astana's low fares exclude you from accumulating frequent flier miles. I hope this changes in the future. Overall I say Air Astana is a good carrier to choose nowadays.

### Air Astana customer review
I took six flights over two weeks London-Astana Astana-Almaty and Almaty to Tashkent and all of them were very good and I was impressed with the staff quality of food and video/TV system. The flight between Astana and London both ways wasn't very busy and the planes were very modern and well maintained. It was a pleasure and relaxing to fly with them.

Bangkok-Almaty on 5 Oct 2014 KC932 and return Almaty-Bangkok on 12 Oct 2014 KC931. Check-in staff were friendly and speak good English. The B757 used was clean and have a new look about it. The IFE was reasonably good with offerings of some of the latest films. The cabin crew was friendly helpful and attentive. The overnight flight from Almaty to Bangkok took off at around 1 am. About two hours into the flight a full meal was served. Before landing in Bangkok at around 8.45 a.m. no breakfast was served. For a flight like this suggest that two light meals be served – one shortly after take-off and breakfast before landing. Overall it was a pleasant experience flying with Air Astana.

### Air Astana customer review
Heathrow to Almaty return via Astana in Business Class. This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus! Overall we enjoyed our experience with Air Astana perhaps more so than we were expecting and given that they are often keenly priced I would recommend them.

### Air Astana customer review
Moscow - Astana - Almaty - Bangkok. Two of the three sectors were very late at night or early morning and I chose sleep rather than food. It seemed a little strange serving dinner at about 2.00am! It would be better to offer breakfast when flights depart after 11.30 at night. Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules. The flight from Moscow was delayed for about an hour because of a technical problem. We were promptly advised by the crew of nature of the problem and the likely time needed to fix it.

### Air Astana customer review
Three flights around Central Asia this last week. FRU-ALA ALA-TSE and TSE-AUH. The FRU-ALA flight was so short they offer a cabin drinks service on the ground. ALA-TSE we were offered a drink and small snack on the B757 overhead screens played a silent sketch show. TSE-AUH was on an A320. A full cabin service was offered. Entertainment was on overhead screen and amenity packs were provided. One movies and a couple TV shows. Leg room was good on all sectors. Staff all spoke English. But check-in always seemed to be chaotic.

### Air Astana customer review
Bangkok - Almaty - Astana - Novosibirsk. Good quick check and priority lane in busy Bangkok airport luggage slow off in Almaty (did not get priority despite the label). Good crew and food and wine. The 757 from Bangkok to Almaty was a little tired and angled seats should exclude an airline from four star status. The service from Almaty to Astana was good - a full meal served. From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good. I don't think that they deserve their four star rating but they are improving and the English of the Cabin attendants is a lot better than when I first flew with them 10 years ago. I will continue to choose to fly with them in Central Asia.

### Air Astana customer review
7 Feb from ALA To IST. I travel internationally and domestically frequently. Based on my experience Air Astana is a cut above the rest. As a person who is afraid of flying it is a pleasure to see the rapid modernization of the fleet. I am 193cm tall and leg room is important for me Air Astana usually offers the most. The inflight entertainment is current and changes frequently. Lastly I have found the cabin crew to be very supportive. there was one occasion where I complained about the temperature of the cabin being too hot and the senior flight attendant had a customer complaint book where she recorded my complaint. A great initiative which I have never experienced on other airlines.

### Air Astana customer review
All in all its OK for a relatively short journey and the food's nice. But you should know this: I travel a number of times a year TSE-FRA and am finding more frequent delays with no information given. The last 3 times there were 40 minute-2 hour delays so beware! Quite a lot of confusion at FRA last time when the plane was 90% filled with a single group of Chinese travelling to Urumqi. Don't take a window seat in winter - the a/c isn't up to it and there's an arctic draft every time. Inflight entertainment not much only overhead screens and reruns of candid camera type stuff and one movie repeated on 6 hour flight. Internally in KZ the prices are ridiculously high because they are the only airline which is up to international standards.

### Air Astana customer review
Ala-Astana KC 683 back Astana Almaty KC 954 Almaty-Atyrau (Guriev) - KC 889B Atyrau (Guriev) - Almaty KC 890-B. Good service. Perfect take off and landings. Air Astana continues to work on their services and airfleet and I continue to see an ongoing positive development of the company. Some destinations are more expensive than others but generally good value for money.

### Air Astana customer review
I fly Air Astana very often almost every week nowadays. I find the experience with new 767 ER relaxing though the flights between Astana and Almaty are always full. The ground staff keep improving. Seems new planes brought a fresh spirit on board. 767 Business Class is great and gives privacy to the customers. Looking forward to flying the Dreamliner. Food is much better than before.

### Air Astana customer review

As a family we have flown with Air Astana numerous times (both in economy and business class) since moving to Kazakhstan and have always been happy with the level of service. We travel with a young child and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful.

KC 951 21 May. KC 856 21 May. I fly Air Astana very often. I find the experience relaxing though the flights between Istanbul and Almaty are usually full. The leg room is good. I think the mileage program could be improved where you could upgrade using your miles during check-in. The food is usually fresh though could be improved. Inflight entertainment is weak and needs improvement. Overall good value for money.

### Air Astana customer review
KC621 Almaty-Astana 22/4/2014. Flown old Boeing 757 in business. Old chairs/layout. Plenty of legroom good for sitting and on a short flight less than 2 hours no need to lie down. A full meal was served on this short flight. A very nice vegetarian meal. No entertainment available or offered. No business lounge available on domestic fights.

### Air Astana customer review
KC856 Astana-Almaty 24/4/2014. Flown new Boeing 767 in business. Good new chairs (fully flat nice big touch LCD- screens) and modern interior. Nice choice of entertainment. And much to my surprise a full meal on a flight less than two hours. Good vegetarian meal. Pity they do not have business lounges on domestic flights.

I travel very frequently on Air Astana from Delhi-Almaty. Check-in staff at Delhi and Almaty are very efficient. I had a wonderful experience on 18 April flying from Delhi to Almaty. The flight crew went out of their way to take care of passengers needs.

### Air Astana customer review
April 4 KC951 from Almaty to Astana. Return April 4 from Astana to Almaty KC854. Had the pleasure of flying Air Astanas new 767 service between Astana and Almaty. It was the best domestic economy class service I have flown. Each seat has in seat videos with the latest films tv music etc. I had a choice of international newspapers as well as a warm sandwich and drink. As usual the crew were smiling multi lingual and well dressed. The seats had a good tilt.

### Air Astana customer review
I use Air Astana regularly since I have moved to work in Kazakhstan and currently prefer it to the other airlines I have used. I try to arrange my trips back to the UK around the direct flights to LHR. I have never experienced a delayed or cancelled flight the staff are well-trained and generally open and friendly and the food is not exceptional but is of a consistently good quality. I usually travel economy class though on the occasions when I have used business class it has been a good experience.

Flight KC912 April 2nd from Istanbul to Almaty. It was a fantastic flight crew helpful and smiling. All announcements very clear understandable and most important things for me multi-language Turkish English Russian and Kazakh. The way aircraft was new.

### Air Astana customer review
I have been using the services of Air Astana for years. Always a pleasure to travel starting from the convenient way of purchasing the ticket and excellent relation of crew members. I quite often take the domestic flights around two times a month and therefore comfort is crucial for me. In January I travelled to Frankfurt from Astana. As usual right from boarding until landing it was an enjoyable journey.

### Air Astana customer review
Flying from Almaty to KL KC935 was very good we had an excellent inflight meal and the staff on the plane were helpful and friendly. The seats were comfortable and the leg room was good. I was able to check in online and then at the airport changed my seat to the emergency exit seats due to the extra leg room with no problems at all. Kuala Lumpur is fantastic and as we head towards George Town we are looking forward to exploring more of Malaysia and of course the return flight with Air Astana.

KC 110 and KC 949 31st January. KC 950 18th February. Air Astana is a very good airline. Staff are friendly and helpful. Because of the demonstrations in Bangkok we had to rebook our flights. Air Astana offered us a free upgrade to Ho Chi Minh City though the ticket was more expensive.

### Air Astana customer review
I was lucky enough to be on one of Air Astana's new Boeing 767s returning from Bangkok to Almaty on the 12th January 2014. My business class seat was worth paying the extra over economy with the full lay flat seat and lots of room to spread out with a wide side table. Over the time I've been flying Air Astana I have seen them polishing their cabin service and the professionalism and presentation of the staff is of a high standard. Beverage service was very good although the food let the otherwise excellent travel experience down a little the meal was below par for business class. This was in contrast to the trip down to Bangkok and all previous international flights with Air Astana where the food has been very good.

### Air Astana customer review
Not a bad flight but the use of an ageing 757 with seats that looked like they belonged in the 1970s were a disappointment given the trumpeting of their "new" business class on their website - I think this is more than disingenuous but Air Astana are hardly alone in this. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lack of business lounge in ALA a major minus. Food average. All in all fair service as it should be noted that this is half the price of BA.

### Air Astana customer review
My family of 2 adults and 2 children flew from Astana to Abu Dhabi (non-stop) and back via Almaty. Although it was a New year vacation period with heavy passenger load all services - starting with tickets sales to luggage delivery were efficient and precise. On our way back we flew a brand new Boeing-767 and it was the best plane I have taken so far. We had to stay in Almaty for a night because of the weather conditions and "Air Astana" provided us with great rooms in a downtown hotel and round trip transfer. Staff were polite professional and competitive.

### Air Astana customer review
PEK-ALA-TSE-SVO. Red-eye flight from Beijing to Almaty on B757-200. The aircraft is old but well-attended. Seats are ok. Cabin crew speak good English. Catering was served in the middle of the flight. Passengers who were sleeping were not offered their meals and amenity kits. Arrived early. Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us. They were very helpful and the ground crew were efficient because our baggage arrived safely at SVO. I would recommend Air Astana if the prices are adequate.

### Air Astana customer review
I travelled with my family on the ALA-BKK flight on Dec 15 2013 and back on the BKK-ALA flight on Jan 4 2014 and both flights were on their brand new 767. The seat comfort was the best I have ever experienced in Economy and the leg room was significantly more spacious than in other economy cabins. Both flights were on time and despite very full flights the service was very efficient and pleasant.

Tried to fly Dushanbe to Almaty to Bishkek. Almaty to Bishkek flight cancelled at last minute - no idea why (heard several explanations ranging from technical issues to lack of passengers). No notification from Astana staff until three hours later. I didn't have visa for Kazakhstan so forced to stay in airport transit lounge overnight. Next day tried to get visa at airport so I could drive to Bishkek. Air Astana people completely unhelpful - said it was impossible. Said I could either stay in airport another night until the next flight or fly to Bishkek via Moscow. Persisted and argued. Finally managed to talk to consulate at airport and received visa and took car to Bishkek. Air Astana refused to refund ticket or pay for visa.

Something is going wrong with this previously reasonable airline. Almaty - Astana flights. The basic route for this airline are notoriously delayed. So if you plan on a business trip on this route make sure to factor in at least a fee hours. Better a day. Disappointing. Ground staff not trained on how to deal with this. As a result they are nervous not pleasant and generally not helpful at all.

### Air Astana customer review
I travelled with Air Astana business class from Kuala Lumpur to Almaty on Sunday October 20th 2013. The whole experience was very enjoyable and comfortable. The cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful and the service was excellent. The food was particularly enjoyable and I was able to relax and enjoy the trip back to Almaty after a hectic week in KL.

### Air Astana customer review
I take Air Astana flights on regular basis local and international economy and business. There are a lot of modern new air planes that are being added continuously to Air Astana. The service is much more pleasant and more active inside the plane because the crew are very young comparing to KLM British Airways Lufthansa. The food is comparatively much better than other international airlines. In some planes they have some seats that are very unusual but comfortable you can sleep on them very easy and comfortable. On the international flight prices they are very reasonable. I'm definitely recommending use Air Astana.

13 Oct 2013 KC887 Business Class. Almaty - Beijing. Thoroughly professional service good food! Great entertainment on iPad excellent on board staff simple check in procedure. Lacks lounge in Almaty.

### Air Astana customer review
We travelled from KUL-ALA-LHR-ALA-KUL earlier this month. We were very pleasantly surprised by the high standard of service and attention given by the cabin crew on all sectors. The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.

### Air Astana customer review
Bangkok - Astana Astana - Almaty Almaty - Istanbul. I have been flying Air Astana regularly for nearly 10 years. I think that they are the best airline in the Russian speaking world. My flights left and landed almost on time although we sat in the plane for an extended period of time in Ho Chi Min city and were not allowed off it. The food was good included the shortish flights between Almaty and Astana. The entertainment on the two long haul sectors was a bit limited. Cabin crew spoke quite good English - even on the internal sectors. Seats and legroom quite comfortable though the seats do not go horizontal on the long sectors. They provide good to reasonable value for money.

### Air Astana customer review
Flight LED-ALA. The new aircraft in rather good condition although seats are very used in economy class. Sensible costs good service on board friendly crew and tasty meal. The traveler mini-bag was given consisted of toothbrush toothpaste a bandage for sleeping and a pair of socks. On-board entertainment was rather good also pillows for more comfort were provided by default. These airlines will be my choice for future trips to KZ.

Round trip HKG-ALA-SVO. Meals tasted good. Staff Service excellent both inside and outside the flight. Staff in transfer lounge nice and helpful. Before my return trip from SVO-HKG I had a flight from Riga to SVO with Aeroflot. When I arrived at ALA for transfer the staff of Air Astana suspected and asked if I had any checked luggage. I said I had and Aeroflot had already transferred it to Air Astana as they told me so. He said my luggage was not with the flight according to their record. He also went out to see if my luggage was at claim lounge. He couldn't find mine so took me to report lost baggage. 15 mins after reporting the loss I was waiting for my next flight in departure lounge. My luggage was found at SVO airport. Staff in transfer lounge were professional and helpful.

### Air Astana customer review
Atyrau-Almaty-Bangkok. Atyrau-Almaty flight cancelled without explanation on the day making us stay in Atyrau for additional 2 days without offering accommodation. Replacement flight delayed twice. After we an hour in a check-in queue we were told that they ran out of seats on the plane leaving us and about 20 other passengers stranded. Offered tickets on additional flight on the same day but it was late to get on the connecting flight in Almaty. After 4 hours told that the additional flight was delayed. At 11pm it was announced that the flight was cancelled so we attempted to rebook. Told the next available flight was in 2 days which was unacceptable and we bought tickets with another airline. The next day we flew to Almaty with another airline and got on our connecting flight to Bangkok. As a result of the issues with Air Astana flights we had to spend extra money on the flights in Kazakhstan and Thailand.

### Air Astana customer review
Fly Air Astana once a week on average internal KZ and international. Consistent friendly service and generally very punctual. Last flight Almaty to Atyrau business class.

### Air Astana customer review
Frankfurt-Astana June 1 2013. Economy class. Full house. A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline.

### Air Astana customer review
Astana to Frankfurt and back in May 2013. We flew with a large group of small children. Airport staff were helpful with check-in and we were allowed to board first. Cabin staff were very helpful and friendly and dealt well with our kids (handed out children's packs on the way out for example.) Food was good quality and there were films showing throughout the plane (no individual at-seat screens in economy though). A pleasant experience overall!

### Air Astana customer review
7 hour flight from Almaty to Bangkok this month and it was very comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea. You didn't have a huge choice of movies but most of the recent blockbuster releases were there along with some international movies. Overall it was a very pleasant flight and I would definitely choose to fly with Air Astana again.

### Air Astana customer review
Dushanbe - Almaty in business class. A Western standard experience including attentive and friendly cabin crew and excellent food. On time departure and arrival. This short trip was a relaxing moment in a busy day plus got some work done in the spacious seat. The seat armrest was broken though so hopefully a repair was due just after this flight.

### Air Astana customer review
I frequently fly with Air Astana mostly within Kazakhstan and sometimes abroad. Air Astana is the best airline in Kazakhstan in terms of comfort and service. Luckily I have not had major delays and those which I had were usually weather related. Flight attendants were friendly and professional good aircraft's better legroom choice of food and entertainment helpful customer service. Overall very good progress in the last 5-7 years and dramatically improved flying experience if compared with its predecessor airlines just around 10 years ago.

Flew from Almaty to Istanbul and was greeted by friendly helpful staff on both the outward and inward journeys.

As a consequence my journeys were wonderful lots of leg room and helpful staff.

Almaty to Bangkok return. Everything ran on time (slightly ahead of time actually) and service was up to the usual AA high standards. I was offered a free upgrade to Business Class on the return (overnight) trip which was very much appreciated - I slept solidly throughout the journey and felt surprisingly fresh on arrival.

### Air Astana customer review
ALA-BKK on 13th February 2013 returning on 17th February 2013. Offered a business class upgrade on boarding. The flat bed seats were brilliant for an overnight flight as was the meal drinks selection and level of customer service. A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully. There was certainly more legroom available than on other airlines I have flown into and out of Almaty and Kazakhstan itself. The meal was a lovely Thai chicken curry. The service was great and the drinks trolley was always in service.

PEK-ALA-SVO. Both flights arrived on time. Good food and excellent alcohol selection. Service friendly and efficient. PEK-ALA on 767 and ALA-SVO on 321 old but well maintained. Generous legroom. No individual entertainment. Overall very good value for money.

### Air Astana customer review
Return flight from KL to ALA was in complete contrast to the previous flight down. On time crew very friendly and professional. Food and service was very good. After the debacle of the previous flight the agent in KL met me at the gate to again apologise. He had been very helpful previously. I also received an e-mail from the company's senior operations manager who went to lengths to apologise and explain. I do feel this is more than most airlines would do to follow up. This does give confidence that the airline is focussed on continuous improvement. The entertainment unit also had more movies loaded and this kept me fully occupied and well entertained for the flight. However suffice to say that the experience on the return journey was a good one with very good service and perfectly on time with the plane unloading from an air bridge on arrival making unloading of the 767 much more efficient.

### Air Astana customer review
Flight Almaty - Bishkek December 9th 2012. Horrible experience! All passengers boarded as scheduled by 10pm. Due to weather conditions we were informed we would have to wait. We were kept on the plane from 9.30pm until 4.30am. No reliable info provided by the staff/pilot. No food provided. At 4.30am we were asked to leave the plane and return to the terminal where we were informed that the flight was cancelled and the next one would be in 2 days. Ground staff rude and incompetent. No-one cared to provide us with snacks and hot beverages.

### Air Astana customer review
Long delay in departing Almaty bound for KL. Perfect weather although no real excuse given. On boarding more than 2 hours late and by bus from the terminal to the aircraft which caused more delay we sat on the ground for a further 30 mins while a drunken passenger was off-loaded. At least half the flights I have taken with Air Astana have been delayed by hours not just minutes. On-board I asked the cabin crew to see if the connecting flight would be held or if other arrangements needed to be made. Their reply was that 'we will call ground staff and let you know'. The second time was 'we will talk to the captain' the third time was the same answer. On my fourth request I was then told that we have other passengers who are all going to be late. I was travelling on an Air Astana ticket and there was no concern or accountability shown toward this situation. T Arriving in KL with just 10 minutes to spare for the connection on Malaysia Airlines of course we could not board. 767 used on this route is very old although has had some face-lifts. Seats are narrow for business class seats and they are not lay flat they are "lay on an angle and keep sliding down" seats. The entertainment system is an IPAD style of portable unit. This only had a choice of three last release movies and at the end of the day there is nowhere to put it where you might consider ergonomically sensible to watch it. I would recommend that you definitely leave a minimum of 5 hours for your connections because they will most likely be late!

### Air Astana customer review
KC907/8 DEL-ALA-DEL on Y class. The Flex fare reasonably priced. Check in both at DEL and ALA was good. Minimal waiting times and the staff were very professional. Board process was ok. Slightly let down by the fact that we were bussed to aircraft and made to board via steps in the rain. Both flights were on well kept clean A320s. Flights were relatively empty so I had 3 seats to myself. Cabin Crew were pleasant and professional. Food and Drink was tasty well presented appropriate for route and time of day. IFE from drop down screens were a bit of a disappointment and hard to follow. Better off bringing a book. Punctual departure and arrival. Would fly again and recommend to others.

### Air Astana customer review
ALA-TSB - Emb 190 Business. Early morning business flight. All on time and aircraft full on this relatively new route. Crew were friendly and breakfast was very nice. Departure formalities from Almaty are confusing and bizarre with no priority for business class at any stage apart from check in. No Air Astana staff to guide you through the complexities rather there are hawkers trying to make some cash who are more of a hindrance. Lounge is horrid not even 2* let alone 4*. No priority boarding for business class. Hand held TV offered but I didn't use it. Would happily fly Air Astana again.

TSE-CIT-ALA. A couple of internal Kazak flights. All on time. Clean and comfortable. Leg room good on both flights. Crews fine but seemed to be little interest in standard health and safety (eg phones ringing in flight people walking around the aircraft during taxi). Did a good job but not a 4* airline!

### Air Astana customer review
Service was good provide travel kits headsets entertainment programs excellent but during boarding I was frustrated by rude attitude of flight attendants one flight attendant gave us instructions about emergency exits we set in front and two other crew came to me and asked me if I was instructed or not about emergency exit because I had small bag in my hands. She raised her voice was very aggressive didn't ask me but said firmly that I must change my seat. Then went away to business class returned with flight attendant-supervisor who said it was ok for me to keep my bag in my hands and was very sorry about this situation. I think the crew need more training (working with passengers and working in a team).

Moscow-Almaty-Bangkok. Both flights departed on time. Flight attendants helpful and friendly with reasonable English. Food was good and sufficient. IFE's a bit restricted and out of date for Business Class. Big problems in Almaty because I could not produce the credit card used for the booking. Took several hours of work and an email from a bank in Australia before I was allowed to board the flight. Flight full from Moscow to Almaty and only a third full from Almaty to Bangkok. Despite the problems with credit cards I will still fly them.

KUL-ALA-AKX return. First flight from KUL-ALA on their 767-300 flight was on time and service was great. But for a 7 hour flight it was quite hot in the cabin. Had some trouble with my visa-on-arrival in Almaty but the ground crew were very helpful translating throughout the immigration process: they even carried my bags and checked them in for my connecting flight while I was waiting for my visa. Flights from ALA-AKX and return were good got on their new Embraer and the service onboard was excellent though the crew does need improvements their English. Overall it was a great experience and would like to fly them again.

### Air Astana customer review
Bangkok to Almaty. Excellent flight friendly and helpful flight attendants. Cabin crews English is getting better and more than adequate for a foreigner travelling with them. Food was good but could have been a little better. Seats good - not quite a bed but allow you to stretch and sleep. Portable hand held entertainment units not so good compared with other airlines. I upgraded at airport and this represents excellent value. Pre-booked business class is not good value.

### Air Astana customer review
ALA-AYT-ALA. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Excellent serving of special meals as ordered at booking and excellent care for children and aged passengers. I would recommend providing more toiletries (hand lotion combs etc). If possible please consider other supplier of noise-reducing earplugs those available in the passenger's pouch now don't reduce the noise and pressure discomfort in the cabin.

### Air Astana customer review
Excellent recent flights great selection from inflight service. Very friendly attentive and polite staff. Flights were on time and very comfortable good connections modern aircraft and all in all a great flying experience.

### Air Astana customer review
Four flights IST-ALA-TSE-ALA-KUL. All 4 were on time excellent service by cabin crew very good food and drink selection - both on domestic and international legs. Good seat comfort (cradle seats on shorter sectors angled lie flat on B767 to KUL). The only disappointment was the lounge in ALA which is basically a bar and you get a voucher for a soft drink plus a snack.

### Air Astana customer review
Business class to Beijing return from Almaty. Service was good and staff friendly. Better food better wines even cold champagne now. Staff are the airlines asset. They are informative polite and helpful.

### Air Astana customer review
Amsterdam to Atyrau return. Using Air Astana many times (not just this route) I have found the flights to be very expensive and often delayed due to technical issues or weather plus chaotic check-in staff! However the flight itself is well above average in food flight entertainment and service. Taking into account the experience from arriving at the airports plus the cost of the flight one would expect a smooth journey per se. Unfortunately this is not the case! Being a state airline and promoted as such there is a lot of room for improvement in this area.

### Air Astana customer review
Almaty-Astana return and Almaty-Abu Dhabi and all flights were fine. Check-in cabin service average food basic no delays. The Abu Dhabi flight was in an A320 though so entertainment and facilities were limited. It's like a lesser western airline but they do seem well-organised and have a good website. The only problem I had was caused by Etihad. I booked a codeshare through the Etihad website as it was the same price but included a bus to Dubai. However the bus departure time on my ticket did not exist and had never existed. I had to wait 3 hrs for a bus. If they had provided accurate information I would have made alternate arrangements.

### Air Astana customer review
Almaty to London. The service was pleasant and efficient KCTV was handed out as soon as seat belt signs went out so the time waiting for drinks to be served passed quickly by. As for the new wine selection this is good now that imported wines are included. The change from my first flight (Nov 2007) to now is positive.

### Air Astana customer review
GUW-TSE-SVO. I flew for business in Economy class and was impressed how professional the service was. The food is ok there was IFE via a small flip-down video screen and headsets were handed out to all passengers in time. During the flight from TSE to SVO they issued a travel pack (flight socks blindfold comb). I did have a complaint with the customer service from one member of the cabin crew and requested a comment form which was handled professionally by other members of the crew.

### Air Astana customer review
Bangkok-Almaty (Business) Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. The Business Class was very good and liked the beds. There was plenty of space but would prefer truly flat beds. Friendly check-in in Bangkok and food was better than expected. Allowed to stay in the Business lounge while I waited for the connecting flight to Astana. Business lounge in Bangkok was very ordinary and toilets were in a different area. Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. Everything was adequate and better food than I expected. These flights were still full.

### Air Astana customer review
London-Almaty. The best direct flight between London and Almaty. Service is very good cabin crew are all well presented and professional. My only criticism is that I found the selection of wines quite limited. Everything else was as you would expect from a leading international airline boarding inflight entertainment landing etc. I have been a customer of Air Astana for the last 10yrs and can say that services planes and routes have all improved.

### Air Astana customer review
Friday night back to Almaty they did brilliantly. Excellent selection of drinks served by staff who knew how to mix them well prepared fresh food friendly and professional cabin staff newish plane comfortable seats  good music selection (I even have to admit I found the crass candid-camera-esk overhead TV amusing too then off the aeroplane and out of the airport and into a taxi in 5 mins max.

### Air Astana customer review
London-Almaty and this airline seems to get better and better. It was streamlined and helpful from check-in to arrival. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful and did everything possible to make my journey pleasant. It took me a short while to work the seats but I slept very soundly when I had. There is plenty of space and it was an extremely comfortable way to get to Kazakhstan.

### Air Astana customer review
3 flights over 2 weeks (Almaty-Astana Astana-Almaty Almaty-Delhi). Computers at check in down no assigned seating every man for himself. Quite tall had reserved exit row was told to "stand at the gate" to be the first one on to grab the seat. However they boarded 20 people into coach ahead of us and the exit rows ended up being filled by families with kids. Changed ticket received confirmation via email arrive at airport to be informed "Yes we sent a confirmation but you needed to come to our office to get the ticket. Upon informing them that they sent the e-mail at 10 pm and the office would be closed they informed me I should have driven from central Astana to the airport to do it. Entire day wasted in Astana airport eventually placed on a late afternoon totally packed flight. Guaranteed exit row instead given tiny seat with zero leg room. Food absolutely dreadful. Staff spent most of their time sitting in the entirely empty Business Class section watching movies and telling passengers on the full flight not to use the Business Class bathroom.

### Air Astana customer review
Atyrau to Almaty - friendly service with right amount of attention 3 meal choices excellent legroom great selection of music. Most comfortable.

### Air Astana customer review
Business class from Almaty to Bangkok. The comfort and service was of highest standard and compared favourably with airlines with better reputations.

### Air Astana customer review
Amsterdam to Atyrau return – one of the most expensive flights per mile of any routes worldwide by any operator so you might think the flight would be special. Old aircraft substandard in-flight entertainment (the overhead TV monitor in my section not working and others with poor picture from what I could see) cramped full flight 2 of the 3 meal choices not available by the time the meal cart got to me all the wine with the meals gone by half way down the cabin bar service once per flight and grudgingly given using cheap local (to Kazakhstan) versions of spirits mixers and wines by unsmiling cabin crew.

### Air Astana customer review
Moscow to Almaty. This was a good flight it departed and arrived as schedules and the luggage was offloaded efficiently at Almaty. There was a slight hiccup with the check-in and I did not get the seat that I had pre-requested however I finished with a better seat. Flight service perfectly adequate and I was spoken to in English when they realised I was not a native Russian speaker. I had no problems on what was a comfortable flight.

### Air Astana customer review
Bangkok to Almaty. Very full flight and a booking error in my row which resulted an upgrade to Business Class. Food and service quite friendly with some preferences being given to those who had paid full business class fares. Seats were comfortable recliners and I was a little surprised with the legroom. Service was good and the English better than I expected. Economy class gives value for money but I think that Business Class does not.

### Air Astana customer review
GUW-ALA in Y and ALA-URA in C; both flights on older and somewhat stuffy 757s which however have generous legroom in economy and plenty of space in business. Seats in business are rather tired but still comfortable and service is very good; Air Astana FA's are always professional and friendly. Good food both in economy and business. Flights operated on time. Overall this again was a good experience and I would recommend using KC rather than other domestic carriers (which are to be honest very few in Kazakhstan).

### Air Astana customer review
URA-PEK via ALA return in Y. Checked-in online but offered a better seat at the airport which is nice of check-in agents. Domestic legs on newish A319 with plenty of legroom in economy. ALA-PEK on rather tired B767 with ancient bulky ceiling TV-sets and stale interiors but the flight and service very good. Had seats 29A+B for myself (exit row seats) on both flights with huge legroom. Special meal delivered as requested. ALA-PEK-ALA are the night flights so service was unobtrusive if you like which is good for couple of hours sleep. Excellent experience with Air Astana (although no competition whatsoever in the local market therefore fares are quite expensive.

### Air Astana customer review
Dubai-Almaty-Ust-Kamenogorsk-Astana-Dubai. Later part of May - beginning June 2010. Flight to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty not too bad or unpleasant considering I was en route already for 25 days (spending 18 hours in horrible Dubai Airport). My suitcase was damaged by rough handling. The flight Ust-Kamenogorsk to Astana was not bad either. Astana-Dubai flight started with a hiccup - since the customs people did not know where Namibia is and I was looked at very suspiciously despite having a private Visa and being with my Kazakhstan wife. The flight was very unpleasant - seats the most uncomfortable for such a flight! Attendants not interested in making the flight a wee-bit more comfortable. Prices not too bad - however flying to the destinations I need to go to there is no alternative to compare. Being the national airline there is much room for improvement.

### Air Astana customer review
I never had much of an issue with this airline. Ppolite staff food very reasonable a good selection of drinks and in-flight entertainment. On occasion the flights can be late but this is more due to the weather and the odd mechanical hiccup however this has improved. You may find this airline very expensive (Amsterdam to Atyrau) with 50% saving to be had via other routings. These comments relate to trips Amsterdam to Atyrau Atyrau to Aktau and Istanbul to Atyrau over the last 3 years.

### Air Astana customer review
I flew to Bangkok from Almaty December 2009. We had trouble at the beginning. Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that. Very unprofessional attitude. Later on cabin crew were helpful and friendly food was OK good classical music channel to listen airplane relatively new clean very small legroom though for a tall guy.

### Air Astana customer review
A terrible business class lounge. I had to pay for everything except water and cola. They have launched a web check-in service but do not have a terminal to print the boarding pass at the airport. I find it rather uncomfortable due to the fact that you can't often find a printer when traveling on business trips. On my last trip I've checked-in online printed my boarding pass but I have learned that my seat doesn't exist because they've changed the plane. I've found it out only when I was onboard. Maybe not so terrible but not too good.

### Air Astana customer review
I recently flew Air Astana from Almaty to Dubai and return and I must say I was impressed with the level of service. We were late out of Almaty but that was not a real problem as the service on the plane was professional. The seat pitch is okay for the 4 hour or so flight to Dubai as is the food. Entertainment was via overhead video units but it was fine to view. No problems with disembarking in Dubai. Equally the return flight was good leaving Dubai at 2300 - good food and service on board.

### Air Astana customer review
GUW-AMS B767-300 Business class. I have to say the service has greatly improved. The seating is classic but very spacious. The plane is aging but clean. The onboard service is fair to good and IFE surprisingly diverse. I checked no for "value" for money because this ticket costs double the price of a twice as long flight on CX or AF.

### Air Astana customer review
Have flown several times on Almaty - Bangkok route. Whilst not at the level of top airlines I had no problems at all. Flights on time. Food OK. Planes relatively new and clean. Happy to continue as is quickest route for me and no complaints.

### Air Astana customer review
GUW-IST-GUW A320. Check in smooth and the flight was on time. The plane was a new A320. IFE was limited but this was a 3.5 hour flight. The onboard service was adequate for a medium haul economy class flight. No complaints except for the incredible rise of prices on Air Astana International flights. From Kazakhstan we do not have much choice of airlines and Air Astana is still the only one with a descent safety record so I prefer to use it despite the ever increasing prices.

### Air Astana customer review
The comments about this airline mostly relate to their international flights and I understand that they offer a good service there. It's a different story on their internal and regional flights. I booked on-line for the short hop return from Bishkek to Almaty. It seemed like a good idea at the time but proved to be a disaster. The airline changed their schedule without informing me their records apparently said that they had "tried to contact me" - I'm not even sure how. I turned up at the airport and waited for 5 hours assuming that it had simply been delayed for that time only to find out that they had moved me not to that flight but to one 20 hours earlier. The Air Astana agent acted as though he hadn't seen an e-ticket before claimed I hadn't paid for the outward journey or maybe hadn't paid at all - really any excuse to not allow me onto the plane. I had no alternative but to go back to Bishkek and travel overland the next day - all at my own expense of course. The return flight had been similarly moved but a local agent helped me out to properly arrange that one and got a refund for the outward journey. I complained to Air Astana as my non-arrival had seriously thrown out the plans of my hosts in Almaty not just mine. No answer. I complained again only to receive a fob off reply that they regretted this but they weren't going to do anything further about it and hoped that I would fly with them again: I doubt that very much. I've given 1 rather than 0 as the Almaty to Bishkek "return" flight itself wasn't bad. Their ground service and support in these regional centres very much needs to upgraded to the same standard as their flight experience.

### Air Astana customer review
Air Astana is right up there with other non-mainstream airlines who do more to please than most. Great service great food an interior decor and outside livery that have a quality design. Air Astana customers include many oil industry personnel who have flown often worldwide and positive comments are often noticeable among passengers. Agree with a previous comment about FAs who are very pleasant. Service to Atyrau has improved leaps and bounds from the days when a worker cigarette in mouth and large hosepipe in hand used to bang the hull of the plane to talk to the pilot about refuelling. The airport is still a bus station though.

### Air Astana customer review
Almaty - Atyrau - Amsterdam in Business. Seats are comfortable although not lay flat and space is more than enough. Their duvets are perfect. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Food is good service is second to none. Aircraft was clean and flights operated on time. On the ground staff are very helpful. However the Business class lounge is severely lacking in facilities in Almaty. Not even free drinks. In Atyrau there are no Business class facilities at all! Terminal facilities generally in Atyrau are severely lacking. Its not possible to get any refreshments in any way shape or form once you are in the departure lounge. Thankfully if you are just transiting through Atyrau to Almaty or vice versa you're not in there long. All in all very pleased with service its just a shame that terminal facilities let down the rest of the service. Sort that out and its 10/10! Keep up the good work.

### Air Astana customer review
The have good cabin crew quality of food is good. Their fleet is new enough and I know from some sources that they do their best to provide safety and best service. Sometimes it seems that the prices are too high but if you order tickets via internet you will get a discount especially on trips with some promotions. But this service is worth to be paid.

### Air Astana customer review
Moscow-Astana-Almaty return. First sectors a 3.5h night flight and wasn't really crowded. I had a row for myself so laid down and had a sleep. Unfortunately after 1h they switched on the lights and served some food. I tried to continue my sleep. As we were delayed and as I didn't have an absolute proper Visa it took me a while for immigration. Searching my bag was easy even I was late and the belts already stopped. Air Astana had some helpful staff there and got my Bag from the luggage room in a minute. Finally I didn't catch my connecting flight. But the rebooking to the next Astana-Almaty flight worked without problems on this Airport. On this flight they served breakfast that was OK. ALA Airport is hell. Staff (even Air Astana check- in) is nearly not speaking English and to get to the domestic check-in you have to have a print out of your ticket as they don't know what an e-ticket is. Staff in-flight was always kind and helpful and had a good English.
