### "luggage is overweight"
Don’t book this airline if your luggage is overweight (33 lbs for checked, 22 lbs for carry-on). They do weigh your carry-on. My carry-on was over their limit by little less than 10 kg, and they charged me $137.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
This is hands down the worst airline I have ever come across as far as customer service is concerned. They have zero effort in helping a foreign customer. Yes. The flights are cheap but there it stops. Flight to Japan was ok but the seat I had purchased was completely inadequate. Have never sat on such a tight and uncomfortable seat. Fortunately the flight is short - only just over 2 hours. It is the situation with the return flight which is giving most concern. All week I tried to purchase extra luggage so can take my shopping back (their so called Biz ticket which allows more weight is not available it appears for any dates). The “FlyBag” fare only allows 15kg. Trying to add more turned out to be impossible. The payment is declined every time! I tried over several days. I contacted the card issuer and they said no problem at their end. It is the airline doing this. The customer service emails reply the same response constantly and not giving any real solution. Some email replies come in Korean. The chat is hopeless. They just leave the chat when you get to a certain point. So finally (after 4 days of trying) reached the 24 hour booking time limit after which you can’t add luggage. Now you will face charges at the airport which will be several times the cost of the fare! There seems complete unwillingness to offer any real customer support and one suspects it is designed so that the customer ends up having to pay the extraordinarily expensive charges. I travel to Japan once a year and Shizuoka airport was an attractive idea as it is small and thus customs etc are a breeze. But never again with this airline. I have flown low cost before but this is the first airline you feel is out to rip you off completely. Avoid this airline at all cost.

### “left us feeling deeply disappointed”
We booked our flight on first week of November 2024 going to Jeju Island. Jeju airlines has only one flight option. This airline offered is only via Gimhae international airport (Busan) about 10hours layover/transit from Busan to Jeju Island. Since our flight to Jeju Island is Visa-free. At the time we fill out every detail on their website there is no option regarding visa acquisition at all. Despite the fact that they send me an email confirmation of my upcoming flight. Still, this airline did not advise me to secure a Korean visa. Still, the ticket doesn't specify that I must need a Korean visa. On the day of our flight, I make a call to the airlines to check in. This is the time I knew that I must have a Korean visa. Jeju Airlines left us feeling deeply disappointed as they did not inform us that we needed to obtain a Korean visa. We are only passengers in transit from Busan to Jeju. We are a group of four individuals who want to have a vacation on Jeju island. This airline causes heartbreak that will never be healed. Although we travel to South Korea frequently, we regret that we are losing our desire to do so.

### "friendly and helpful crew"
We flew Jeju AIr which is South Korean Low cost airline again. This time from Bangkok to Incheon(seoul) back and forth. The check-in from Bangkok was smooth and the ground staff was very nice and kind enough to arrange wheelchair for my wife who has probem with the legs and difficulty in walking. the staff also arrange the front section seat for us which we were very appriciated. The plane was OK and the seat was quite comfortable compared to other Low coat Airline. The cabin crew were nice and friendly although they did not serve us water as before. The plane was delayed due to the late arrival of plane from Seoul. Overall the flighy was smooth. On the flight back to Bangkok, we experienced a very kind and helpful youmg female ground staff who arrange wheelchair for my wife and change the seat to the front section. the flight itself was OK. The cabin crew were very nice and kind although threre was no water serving. The flight was a little delayed due to traffic congestion. Overall Jeju Air is quite  good Low Cost Airline although there was no food and beverage serving (you can purchase noodles, snacks, coffee and drinks on flight) and no entertainment but the best thing the Jeju Air should be pround of was their nice, friendly and helpful crew both ground and cabin crew.

### "Keep your bag underweight"
They charged me 81 KRQ for overweight charges that was more than the tickets I purchased. Keep your bag underweight. They have lower requirements than the US.

### "I was late for my flight"
My original flight suppose to be departed at 11:50, and was delayed to 1:12 (13:12). I arrived and try to check in and was told too early to check in; come back 45 minutes before flight depart. I came back 1 hour before flight departed and was in line for 15 minutes which meant I had 45 minutes time frame. Staffs at the counter told me they are closed and I was late for my flight, and not helped me to find a flight to Seoul. I finally have to book the cheapest flight and paid for checked in luggage's. Other alternate flights would cost more than 400 usd per ticket with total of two travelers, and travel time with connection time would be more than 10 hours. This travel route cost me too much money (extra tickets and luggage’s cost)

### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified |   Terrible airline. If you are a foreigner travelling to Korea, do not book with this airline. I had booked a round trip from Busan to Jeju as a first time visitor in Korea. Not only did the staff of this international airport speak English, but the employees did not seem to know what to do with bookings made by their airlines to third party booking agencies. I had missed my flight due to them not vocalizing what the correct time was to appear at check in. They did not try to help me find any alternative flights and maintained “we don’t know”. The staff seemed annoyed if you asked any following questions regarding your reservations and I had to communicate solely through Papago. I was unable to book any alternative flights. If you are a foreigner travelling to Jeju, I would not recommend flying with this airline.

### "will never take JeJu Air again"
Boarding was easy and rather pleasant. Once seated, it was very cramped hence economy. But cabin was hot and stuffy. I figured the air will improve once we took off, but it never did. While in the air and have reached cruising altitude and speed, the cabin crew quickly sped the refreshment cart by without a word of instructions as to items for purchase including water. I am American and non Korean therefore do not read/speak Korean. 4.5 hour flight from Cebu to Seoul and no water in a hot cabin is not safe. My husband needed water for medication. One of our traveling mates had gotten up for the toilet and I asked him to get my husband a cup of water. Our travel mate had a extremely hard time getting a cup of water. He basically had to firmly insist before getting a half cup of water. This is unacceptable. I would have purchased water had I had been informed. If we, (party of 4) can ever avoid it, we will never take JeJu Air again.

### "Total inflexibility"
Not Verified |   I had booked my ticket without using my full middle name (only middle initial), so the woman at the counter refused to allow me to board because it did not match my passport middle name. I showed her multiple proofs of purchase and other forms of ID, but they would not allow me to board without buying a new ticket for $255 usd (originally was $95). Total inflexibility and stinginess, not to mention poor service and mediocre standards.

### "good flight both way."
We flew Jeju Air which is Korean Low cost airline for the first time. The first flight was from Bangkok to Seoul and the second flight was from Busan to Bangkok. The check-in at Bangkok is quite good and smooth but check-in at Busan is not smooth as the ground staff was not friendly and seemed to be inconsiderate. Both flight was ok and the seat was not bad for low cost airline, not so cramped and leg room is good though we flew over 5 hours. Cabin crew were friendly eventhough they served us only a cup of water which is understandable. Both flight was not delay and the flight from Busan arrived ahead of schedule. Overall it was a good flight both way.

### "Why put windows on a plane"
Why put windows on a plane if it means we have to close them the entire flight? And above all, not having them reopen at the time of landing is a big lack of safety in the event of a problem. Pourquoi mettre des fenêtres sur un avion si c'est pour nous obliger à les fermer tout le vol ? Et surtout ne pas les faire réouvrir au moment de l'atterrissage est un gros manque de sécurité en cas de problème .

### "it was pretty impressive"
Not Verified |  This was my first time riding jeju air. It was pretty comfortable. The seat was wide compared to other low cost carriers and there was descent legroom. There was no in flight entertainment on board. For a short flight, I think it was pretty impressive!

### "Jeju Air denied me boarding"
Jeju Air denied me boarding without providing any reason at the counter. They just returned my passport and said you cannot board this flight. The flight cancellation cost me 800 USD and after multiple calls to Jeju Air Korea call center, they gave me Ministry of Justice phone number and said for understanding the reason for denial of boarding you need to speak to them directly. The ministry of justice number had only Korean speaking staff and could not understand me. Most horrible airline experience. Staff was absolutely unhelpful.

### "service was poor beyond belief"
I checked in as normal at the desk because for whatever reason, online check in, or the console check in wasn't working for me. The member of staff assigned a seat which turned out to be right at the back of the plane. It was strange, because i was the only foreigner on the plane, and nobody else was seated on this back row. On the back row, the seats do not recline, and the arm rests do not fold up. A very uncomfortable flight, but i thought nothing of this until my next point. The cabin crew acted as if i did not exist. I watched as they offered everyone else water and other things, but when it came to me they'd ignore my existence and walk by. This made me feel horrible. It was a 6 hour flight, no meal was provided. Not even a snack. I understand this is budget but this is a joke. I'm a frequent flyer all over the world, this service was poor beyond belief. Do not recommend.

### "Very disappointing service"
Very disappointing service, especially at its home base, ICN. Checked in online the day before departure and still arrived at the airport 2+ hours before departure (which would be before 6am), and found out that there was basically no "benefit" at all for the extra effort the previous day. I still had to go through the endless wait (the queue was so long that it completely filled up the massive check-in area at ICN and still "seeped" out into the corridor area). One might wonder that the queue was probably because some of the machines were out of order, but no, the queue was really just to drop checked luggage via super-slow machines. In short, the airline was basically not allowing any non-premium customers to be served by humans, just by self-check-in kiosks (for those "lazy" customers who dared not check in online the day before departure) and by self-bag drop machines which were absolutely lacking in number and seemed to confuse the customers all the time. What happened after the stressful bag drop? Simple. The flight was delayed by 20+ minutes which snowballed into an overall delay of 40+ minutes when I finally landed in FUK (considering that ICN-FUK is supposed to take ~80 minutes from gate to gate this delay is horrible). I ended up almost missing my self-arranged connecting domestic flight despite a generous self-secured transit time of 2.5 hours thanks to the massive delay caused by Jeju Air. Paid $300+ just for a short roundtrip ticket between ICN and FUK. Completed online check-in the day before and still arrived at the airport 2+ hours only to find out that checking in luggage is something to be punished at Jeju Air by an endless queue, and had to wait in line for 30+ minutes just to drop my pithy bag. Then found out that the flight was going to be hugely delayed and almost missed my domestic connection 2.5 hours apart. Jeju Air only offers 15 kg as your base checked luggage allowance. You have to purchase its "Flybag" tier ticket to get any checked luggage allowance and even after that it is still only 15 kg. Even Peach, the super-cheap LCC in Japan offers 20 kg. All the other services were just as expected. Mediocre seat pitch and comfort even according to low-cost airline standards, okay cabin service (not that they were bad but they were not that great either), limited food & beverage options and no inflight entertainment and cabin connectivity. Given the short flight distance, however, I guess the nonexistence of any inflight digital stuff should not be negatively judged upon Jeju Air.

### "I will definitely recommend"
Clark to Seoul. Smooth flight on Jeju Air and I am impressed. I had to think twice on booking because Jeju Air has a bad review and most of its customers were left unhappy and unsatisfied on their flight. So we took the risk and booked. On the flight day we are  expecting to pay for our baggage as the website says our ticket doesnt have a free baggage allowance. Usually, LCCs allow their passengers one check in baggage per person. But in the airport, we were three. The check in agent checked our bags for free - 5 pieces! The flight was very smooth. Though the attendants were not always present on the cabin. They just served the free water before landing. I will definitely recommend.

### "Worst experience ever"
Jeju to Hong Kong. The airplane size and all other things are understandable because of the cheap price. For our flight from Jeju to Hong Kong, we've noticed that that trip doesn't include checked-in luggage so we are okay if we need to pay extra. But after browsing through their website, there's no placing saying about how the luggage will be weighed and charged. At the counter, I asked about how the policy is different from what we saw on the official website, they just ask us to pay no explanation. While we were fixing our luggage overweight problem because we do not have enough cash or visa cards, we don't want to affect others so we moved aside. Worst experience ever.

### "they didn’t put any effort"
Jeju to Seoul. I realize my passport was left on the compartment after I came out from the arriving. After 2 hours I went back to the front desk airline and give them my flight details with the sit no in order for them to search. Very fast they told me my passport was not there. It give me the impression they didn’t put any effort to go and find the passport and the frontline was very rude. I will not board this airline again as front desk and others colleague didn’t show any courtesy and professionalism at all.

### "refusing to give us a refund"
Not Verified |  My wife was flying in from the states to meet us there at the counter. My two children and I were at the counter, I spoke with two agents, told both agents that me and the children are flying even if my wife doesn’t make it in time. They told me to wait over to the side and I came back to the counter twice to check in. Both times they told me to wait. I waited so long, we missed our flight. We had to book four last minute flights with Peach Airlines. We went to the counter for our return flight and those were canceled. No one emailed, texted, or called to let us know our flights were canceled. It was Jeju’s fault we missed our flight and then they canceled our return flight without telling us. We had to purchase 4 more last minute flights with Peach Airlines. Jeju is refusing to give us a refund.

### "a great airline"
Not Verified | Osaka Kansai to Seoul. Very good flight. The menu was easy and cheap. Staff were friendly. Not only on the plane but the check in staff and the boarding staff. They could also speak English. Still would prefer Asiana more than this but Jeju is a great airline.

### "website is so unusable"
Not Verified |  Fukuoka to Busan. I didn't even manage to travel! I only tried to book a flight but their English language website is so unusable that even after providing my credit card information, it gave me a message in Japanese and then returned to the home screen. Was the second time I tried to purchase but the website was created by a bunch of infantile rodents who wouldn't know the definition of customer satisfaction and user experience if I threw a dictionary at them. Absolute joke and a waste of time.

### "the plane was very dirty"
Seoul Incheon to Tokyo Narita. Cheap ticket and wasn’t expecting much but the plane was very dirty and tired looking. My seat back tray had clearly been used as a kids colouring book at some point on a previous flight and was covered in long stripes of multi colored crayon. I didn’t purchase any food on the flight so I didn’t need to make use of the tray so not a big deal though. The seat pocket and the sides of my seat were utterly gross, caked deep with crumbs, food fragments and assorted gunge that was all a bit nasty. No entertainment screens but there were in flight radio channels available which I didn’t use as I had my iPod to listen to as usual. The seats were a bit cramped with my knees touching the back of the seat in front (I’m 6ft tall so nothing particularly new on an LCC flight). When I put my bottle of water in the seat pocket I had to sit at an angle so I could fit in the space as well. The flight itself was smooth enough, the cabin attendants were polite and friendly and we got to our destination without any delays of troubles. Not the cleanest plane I’ve ever been on but we got from A to B cheaply

### "disappointed in the customer service"
My family and I recently flew Jeju Air from Seoul to Osaka on Tuesday May 7. I was incredibly disappointed in the customer service that was provided to us at the check-in counter. We were five adults traveling from the United States, with five check-in luggage. After she weighed all our suitcases, she said that we were 6 kg total overweight. By then, she had already put all our luggage on the conveyor belt, and they all had left the counter, then asked us to pay 60,000 krw. None of us even had any carry-on baggage, and could have easily taken out our duffle bags to carry 1 measly kg each. We had no choice but to pay the fee, when she had multiple ways to handle the situation. When we boarded the plane, I saw everyone with 2-3 carry-ons each all stuffed together to look like 2. I was incredibly upset by the unfairness of our treatment. I tried to contact the airline and they asked us for more details of our flight, then ignored me. I point out that the tray table on one of our aisle seats was broken. They are a "budget" airline for a reason. Oh, other minor things, they didn't even offer us water, you had to ask for it. What a joke.

### "unfair treatment for foreigners"
Seoul Incheon to Manila. Yes to budget but no to their baggage policy and I suggest it should be changed. They do not allow combined baggage! We are a family of 4 with 60kgs of total bag allowance. (Note: The only available flight at the time we purchased it was their Special Fare). We only used 1 big piece luggage and a back pack for easier travel since we have senior citizens with us. Our big luggage exceeded 5kgs and they insisted that we separate it so we obliged. But here's whats unfair, when we got to our gate waiting to board, the ground attendant approached us and said that the plane's overhead bin was a bit small for our hand carry bags (2 standard cabin baggage size with less than 4kgs in weight) and asked us that we check-in the bags instead. Since we saw a lot of bags already tagged for check in, so we said yes ok, maybe it really wont fit (so, we thought! ), but when we got on the plane all their local citizens had their hand carries with them, bigger than our bags putting it in the overhead bin! Hello unfair treatment for foreigners like us.

### "I will not recommend them"
Seoul to Manila . I'm traveling alone with my 3 year old daughter from Incheon South Korea to Manila, Philippines. I know we had 15 kgs baggage each but I prepared a combine luggage for both of us since I'm traveling alone. Given my situation, they asked me to separate our luggage because it is their policy even though we did not exceed 30 kgs. I cant carry my daughter with two bags. They are inconsiderate for mothers traveling alone. I will not recommend them nor taking another flight to them.

### "try and avoid this company"
Macau to Seoul as a long holiday trip around Asia. I don't make airline reviews a lot, but I must do it for Jeju Air because of it's terrible customer service ever seen. Starting from a long check in with only some Jeju Air customer representative are visible at Macau Airport. Our flight was delay with no explanation from the airport which was making itself a 2 hour delay. As Jeju Air is a budget airline, you must pay for everything including changing seat, but then we boarded an old plane for an uncomfortable 3 hours and 30 minutes flight to South Korea. Overall for this flight include seat was broken, legroom uncomfortable, no free food and drinks and nothing. The only positive thing was their onboard staff which was friendly. But please try and avoid this company to avoid disappointment and fly an alternative airline if possible.

### "couldn't do online check in"
Be aware you will waste hours on their website and downloading their app on your phones in hope to online check in but this will not happen. And their customer service is non existent. First flight with them was Hong Kong -Seoul, I couldn't do online check in so at the airport counter i inquired about this, and i was told that "Hong Kong is to blame, that Jeju has problem with Hong Kong regulations but i will not have this problem when flying from Seoul. I am now trying to do online checkin from Seoul right now , my flight is to Tokyo tomorrow and after wasting my time to fill in all the details etc and still cannot do online check in. If you cant provide online check in service then dont waste peoples time. This is ridiculous, very disappointed and will never fly again. On board service was appalling also, the flight attendant with a tray and tiny cups of water would walk so fast and without looking at the passengers I didn't manage to ask if i could have one of those tiny cups of water.

### "not allowed to combine luggage"
. Our flight from Cebu to Incheon was cancelled at the very last minute and there is no clear information when the aircraft will arrive. All we can hear is announcement in Hangul. I think you should educate your staff to speak English as well since you flying customers of different nationality as well. Another disappointment was when we are flying back to Cebu, we are not allowed to combine luggage and check-in one luggage for me and my husband with total of 28kgs (limit each will be 15kgs) saying it has to be one piece for me and one for my husband. We approached the manager duty in Incheon and asked why we are allowed to fly in Cebu with only one check-in baggage of 19kgs and she is not able to explain. She just insist we should put our belongings on separate checkin baggage. It is very inconvenient to move your things from one luggage to another specially when you are in the airport.

### "one of the worst airline"
Cebu to Incheon. By far one of the worst airline we've experienced. I traveled with my wife from Cebu to Incheon. We we're delayed from Cebu to Incheon. They accepted our 1 piece check-in baggage that is around 19KG and we have 30KG allowance combined. However, they did not accept the same check-in baggage from Incheon to Cebu. They strictly said that one piece check-in should only weigh 15KG or less. They are not organized and they don't have 'Customer Service' at all. I even speak to the Manager in Charge for Jeju Air in Incheon Airport and they didn't seem to know how to provide Customer Service. They can only offer you a free water for a 4 hour + flight. I have tried JinAir before which is also a budget friendly airline but they are far better than this airline. Stay away from Jeju air if you have the chance.

### "worst travel experience to date"
Seoul to Bangkok. This was the worst travel experience I've had. I was planning to go to BKK. I flew Delta with the intention of transferring to Jeju to complete the trip to BKK. I paid for a ticket the day before and thought everything was fine until I landed in Korea. They tried calling me en route there (23hr flight couldn't answer) then sent me an email on the day I landed saying my ticket was cancelled due to technical issues. As I was boarding they denied me my initial flight, then said I had to pay another $500 in order to go. I only had a certain amount of money budgeted to make BKK a great experience. I had to use that money to get to BKK. They said they would give me a full refund but that money wouldn't show up in my account until a week later. I love to give everybody the benefit of the doubt but long story short Jeju Airlines completely screwed me over because of their incompetence and "technical" issues. I wouldn't suggest anyone fly with this airline. My worst travel experience to date and I travel a lot.

### "plane clean, friendly attendants"
Flew Jeju Air on the quick 1.5 hr hop to Osaka from Seoul Gimpo. If flying to/from Japan/China/Taiwan, Gimpo Airport saves hours of time over Incheon - less people and no wait, so you don't have to arrive hours early. As it's a short flight, LCC is perfectly acceptable. Departure was on time, plane clean, friendly attendants. Even passed around free cups of water during the flight. They will also fill your water bottle for you. No major delays or problems for the short flight. Very simple. Normal cloth LCC seat but not painfully tight like say Cebu Pacific or Air Asia. I'm 180 cm 120 kg (5'11" 265 lb).

### "not good value for money"
Flew Jeju Air from Seoul to Saipan. Queuing for hours in Incheon (Seoul) airport. I almost missed my flight although I was at the airport 4 hours prior the departure time. The matter is that as a holder of foreign passport I can't use check in kiosk. An airline's staff should verify that I'm in possession of all necessary documents to go to US territory. The flight itself was quite smooth, but all window blinds should be closed (maybe because of North Korea, I don't know). There's no meal but you could buy some beverages and snacks (a very limited assortment) Considering that my one way ticket costs almost 300 US$ it's not good value for money.

### "offer free water and kind service"
My first flight with Jeju Air from Seoul to Kota Kinabalu. They're a low cost airline, but they still offer free water and kind service. The attendants are friendly, courteous and don't look overworked. As it's a low cost airline, the plane is older but you wouldn't know. The inside was kept clean and in good condition. I booked an exit seat to have the most room. If you book exit row, book Row 16. Row 15 is an exit row, but it doesn't recline.

### "clean cabin, friendly crew"
Cheongju to Jeju with Jeju Air. Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Efficient budget airline, quick boarding, checking in was quick and easy. On board - clean cabin, not very noisy, friendly crew, just half a cup of juice for a short flight (about 40 min), on time. Short on leg space. No entertainment.

### Jeju Air customer review
My wife and I were on flight from GMP-CJU and CJU-PUS last June 2013. We were very much satisfied with the on time performance ground and on board services. Although they were budget airlines but their services were as good as the full service one. Surprisingly we were not charged for checked baggage as the other budget airline in south east asia did. We were with 738 aircraft for the fist stint but old 734 for the later one. Snack were provided still.
