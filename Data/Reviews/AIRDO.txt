### "excellent customer service"
My flight with Air Do was a great example of Japanese customer service. Being an All Nippon codeshare flight, I was connecting from another ANA flight that unfortunately ran late, and my connection was already only 25 minutes, the tightest theoretical connection that ANA allows. My flight to Fukuoka arrived at a remote stand, and they already had a van with a concierge (best I can describe it) waiting with a sign for me. They whisked me away and drove me right to the gate, with just 2 minutes to spare. My bags also made the transfer as well, with them having their own luggage cart drive them right to the plane. As for the flight itself, the plane itself wasn’t in the best shape, being an ex-ANA 737 that was at 19 years old and definitely showing its age. I was able to get the bulkhead seat and had the entire row to myself. I’m a tall guy and leg room was no issue. Recline was great considering they’re a budget airline, and they had the usual drink service with a choice of green tea, coffee, and apple juice. Their inflight shop has some cool items too, I got myself a little plushie of the airline’s polar bear mascot. One downside of this flight was that we arrived at a remote stand at the farthest end of Sapporo airport, having to take a 15 min bus ride to get to the terminal. Other than that a good flight, but excellent customer service!

### "Cabin crew was really professional"
Flew with AIRDO (a low cost airlines owned by ANA) from Tokyo Haneda to Hakodate. Flight was on time and full of passengers who were en route to observe the cherry blossoms in Hakodate. Cabin crew was really professional, friendly, and attentive. Legroom was good, seat was comfy, cabin was clean. Soft drinks (water, apple juice, tea, orange juice, coffee) was served to all passengers even it was a low cost airlines. Both of take off and landing were smooth.
