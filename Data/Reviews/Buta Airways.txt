### "Never buy tickets in Buta Airways"
Not Verified | We bought tickets before the Pandemic and can't have our money back since then! Since that time they write to us that we need to wait the regular flights to start operating. According to their website, they have been already flying all regular routes. Never buy tickets in Buta Airways.

### "their service is very low level"
Tehran to Baku. The prices they offer are very reasonable, however, their service is very low level. Nothing is interesting about Buta Airways, but for a short flight from Tehran to Baku it was not a bad option.

### "practice is misleading"
Not Verified | Baku to Ankara. Baku to Ankara. Buta Airways charge 25 euros for carry on luggage if you have budget class tickets. This practice is misleading. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### "25 euros for carry on luggage"
Baku to Tblisi. Buta Airways charge 25 euros for carry on luggage if you have budget class tickets. This practice is misleading. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### "definitely the best Low Cost Carrier"
Baku to Kiev with Buta Airways. I have to say after travelling for 10 years this was definitely the best Low Cost Carrier I have ever flown with. On time and sharp. Plus you get free water and a free sandwich. But saying that, for a 500ml beer is 1.5€ and a pizza 2€. Incredible value you money. I had flown them for a 55min flight, so was interested to see what a 3.5hour flight would be like. But it was absolutely perfect.

### "Everything went smoothly here"
Tbilisi to Baku. Everything went smoothly here. Boarding was quick and on time. We were pushed back on time, which also meant the flight left on time. It was only a short hop of 55mins. I will see how they are again when I fly 3 hours plus on my next flight. Overall No issues. Airline very smooth and would recommend.

### "Hand luggage is not included"
Kazan to Baku. It's not really a low cost airline, because the cost is not low and quality is even lower than a usual lowcost. But I had no choice. Hand luggage is not included, it is made clear on their website. But the problem is that you can't pay for the hand luggage on their website, you have to pay at check-in counter. And they force you to pay in different currency using their crazy exchange rate, so you will overpay for it a lot. The reason, as they explained it, it is because they need to check your bag (size and weight) to see if it will fit. Can't they allow to pay for it online and deal with overweight bags at the airport for extra cost? My bag was within the limits, but I had to pay more. Surprisingly, seats were pretty comfortable and spacious enough for tall people. They even gave a free sandwich. But tea/coffee was not free. Anyway, I can't recommend to fly with Buta.

### "a very poor experience"
Baku to Tbilisi. I had 2 terrible experiences with Buta Airways. First flight was delayed 3 hours for no reason. Then at check-in, I was fined for not checking in online, however there is no mention on the ticket or confirmation email anywhere that you need to do online check-in. I asked for a window seat and was given an Aisle, when I asked to move onboard (as the flight wasn't full), I was told it would cost €25! They also don't allow any hand luggage, apart from a handbag or laptop bag. Not even a plastic bag! Now my return flight is also delayed 4 hours. All in all, a very poor experience.
