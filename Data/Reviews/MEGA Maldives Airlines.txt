### "never going to fly them again"
Delhi to Male. First of all business class in MEGA Maldives Airlines is pathetic. Smaller seats the same as economy, just more leg room but no leg rest. They provide no lounge access and top of it they have no in flight entertainment. Its a waste of money if you fly with them in business class. I am never going to fly them again or recommend anyone.
