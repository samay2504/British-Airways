Smartavia Reviews

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Murmansk to Saint Petersburg. Scam of an airline, our online tickets showed that we have luggage allowance. When we arrive, their system says we don't. Spoken to our trave company who have again confirmed the luggage allowance and luckily refunded us the 5900 rubles fee. I would never fly with this airline again.

### " airline is very good"
Saint Petersburg to Samara. The airline is very good. The cabin is clean and comfortable and with this always promised food and friendly staff. As for the baggage allowance, things are even better, the baggage allowance is 30 kilograms.

### Nordavia customer review
Arkhangelsk(ARH) to Tromsoe(TOS) with a stop in Murmansk(MMK). Fast and easy check-in and boarding. Decently comfortable and rapid security check. Aircraft (Antonov 24) has seen better days but was OK for a short flight. Cabin crew polite and professional. Got served drinks on the first leg to Murmansk then snacks (selection of meats with bread and piclkes) on the way from Murmansk to Tromsoe. Departure and arrival according to the timetable. Luggage arrived OK. Overall experience - fine apart from the high price.
