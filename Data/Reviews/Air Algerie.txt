### "Worst cross-ocean flight I ever had"
Worst cross-ocean flight I ever had. Issues we had: - They lost our luggage - They do not offer to pay to deliver our luggage, and asked us to pay UPS to get it delivered to us. No facilities at all in Algiers Airport, hence terrible experience during connection. For our return trip, they changed our flight without a reason, and forced us to wait at Algiers Airport for 9 hours for a connection without giving a viable alternative.

### "Plane very dirty"
Almost no announcements in English during flight. Plane very dirty, like not cleaned for decades, decaying 737-600, couldn't eat the suspicious snack given. Online check-in is actually not available for Air Algérie flights, as you need to have your ticket printed in the old fashioned way. Staff were friendly and professional but can't make it better with the airline they're working to.

### "The most dirty airplane"
The most dirty airplane I’ve been in, gum sticked to the chairs, drops of dry dirt everywhere, the table is dirty also something was poured on it and wasn’t cleaned.

### "flight attendants were all very friendly"
Not Verified |  Very nice cabin, comfortable seats and good entertainment systems. The food tasted very good and there was enough food for the flight length. The flight attendants were all very friendly except 1 steward. (Plane: 7T-VJA, Date: 8 July 2019).

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified |  Paris to Oran. Very bad service for an extremely expensive price. The plane cabin was dirty, the seats uncomfortable. The cabin crew were incompetent and very haughty. Take this airline only when absolutely necessary. If you choose to spend your vacation it is a very bad choice. Unfortunately this company puts our country to shame

### "checked in luggage was lost"
Amman to Barcelona via Algiers. I would not recommend this airlines at all. During my trip from Amman to Barcelona through Algiers, all my checked in luggage was lost, and it has not been found since. I submitted two claims, but the airline never got back to me (not answering phone or email).

### "service onboard was excellent"
London to Algiers. There was a slight delay, but the service onboard was excellent. Clean, very nice food and friendly personnel. Very pleased with the whole experience. Would fly Air Algerie again.

### "Aircraft is old and dirty"
Algiers to Paris, the worst airline ever. Aircraft is old and dirty. Flight time was delayed and postponed. The check in process at counter is very slow. The only efficiency thing is their system down time. The staff is not well trained etc.

### "My luggage did not come in"
Bamako to Algiers. A 21:15 flight was delayed around 21:30. This was the first we heard anything. At around 22:30 we were told the plane would take off the next day. We were fed by 23:00. Around 00:00 shuttles started to a hotel. I got yelled at by airline personnel while boarding a shuttle. The last of us got to the hotel around 2:30 where we were dropped off with no information. The hotel was absolutely horrid. The hotel personnel shared no flight information so around noon the next day I asked for a number for the Air Algerie personnel who'd made the reservation. He picked up after about 3 calls and told me not to call back. Around 17:00 we were told to be ready to depart at 00:00. Around 23:40 2 shuttles came. There was a mad, unorganized rush to board the shuttles because there wasn't enough space. I got pushed and shoved but left behind. One shuttle left the hotel without having its door closed. Around 00:30 another shuttle came and I managed to get on. After standing in line at the airport for an hour I got a new boarding pass. I was assured that the luggage that I had handed over the previous day would be on the plane. Service on the flight was fairly decent. Plane landed around 8:00 and took off fine. The seat was absolutely filthy, however, and the bathroom was disgusting. My luggage did not come in. I tried to report my luggage as lost but was told I could not because I had no baggage claim tickets (they'd been taken by the airline when I got my new boarding pass). I was told to come back the next morning at 3:00. I got yelled at again while reporting the luggage lost. Another passenger said that a plane from Bamako was coming in at noon and we should wait so I did. luggage came in around 12:30.

### "Excellent flight"
Excellent flight, good service with hearty meal (starter main course dessert tea and coffee) Duty service on board. A generous pitch for economy class seats. Note the delay at departure due to the closure of Orly airport and the flights diverted to Paris CDG.

### "Very good flight"
Paris to Algiers. Very good flight, excellent catering, clean plane, but crowded. The cabin is spacious for a 737, room for the legs, comfortable seat. Very good meal for a 2 hour flight. The crew is listening. Only complaint, the windows were dirty.

### "service is very bad"
Algiers to Montreal. The service is very bad, actually, there is nobody to whom to talk my flight was supposed to be on Tuesday at 12;40, But we flight at 1830 cause a strike. The food was  inedible. I missed my connection in Montreal to Toronto (knowing I bought my ticket 160$) And for sure, no one from Air Algerie in Montreal to receive us. I spent the night in the airport. I will never ever take this company again.

### "staff are a mixed bunch"
Flew Air Algerie from Oran to Paris. I do not understand where this airline got 3 stars from, 1 should be more appropriate. The cleanliness, or rather lack of, is a major issue. The newer planes especially are already really dirty (food crumbs everywhere, seats are not cleaned and toilets a disgrace). Staff are a mixed bunch, some are friendly but others have never heard of politeness or friendliness. Languages spoken are Arabic and French, you can forget about English. Food is just acceptable, nothing more. Flights are usually not on time (especially flights later in the day). Legroom is, in fact, acceptable.

### "aircraft are old and dirty"
Air Algerie is the worst airline I have flown. Algiers-Ghardaia flight: one flight attendant, not speaking English, smallest pack of cookies to eat. Algiers to Timimoun flight (2nd May 16) cancelled, due to sandstorm - OK, but no other proposal given, had to fight to get rebooked to Adrar, 9 hours at the airport waiting. Timimoun to Oran flight od 4th May 16 - at the airport nobody knows if the aircraft will come and take passengers, not to mention that nobody knows when. 3 hours delay. Of course at the airport you can not buy anything to eat or drink (not even a bottle of water), just sit and wait. Nothing to eat onboard as well, not even peanuts nor cookies. Altogether over 6 hours with no food. Oran to Algiers flight the same day - the same situation. Nobody knows in Oran if the aircraft will depart today nor when. At the time of scheduled departure we took a taxi to Algiers not to risk missing the flight to Europe (fortunately with Lufthansa). Aircraft (ATRs 72 and B737) are old, very used, dirty. The seat covers are sticky of dirt, seat pockets full of old crumbs and rubbish. If you wish an inflight magazine, you should buy business class ticket, as it is non-existant in economy class.

### "will not fly Air Algerie again"
I returned on the flight from Algiers to London Heathrow on the 20th December - the flight was over 3 hours late it was scheduled to take of at 10.20am, however 2 hours later no sign of taking off, no information given for the delay, no refreshments offered and worst no apologies specially since the staff where hovering around passengers like zombies. Anyway 2 hours later a call on the speakers said that all Air Algerie passengers should go to gate 16 for an immediate take off which was at the other end off the airport - everybody rushed to the gate thinking that we will be on air in few minutes. When we got there was a long queue and no sign of the aircraft the staff where sitting there like zombies and there was no explanation offered for the delay - about an hour later a very painful and very slow gate checking process started. Still no information on the delay however by that time it was too late anyway, the transfer to the aircraft was by bus and I waited to the last moment to present myself to the gate desk to avoid stuck in the queues unnecessarily. The waiting in the bus was like for ever and to make matters worst it seems the bus did the tour of Algiers to get us to the aircraft because it was at the other end of the runway. When I got in the aircraft I asked why the delay and I was told it was due to the baggage handlers strike. I asked why didn't Air Algerie offer any information, explanation, refreshments or apologies I was told that even the staff didn't know as they where told to carry on with their duties. Still nobody apologised until take off by the captain which was at around 13.30pm. I have championed Air Algerie over other carriers like British Airways but I am extremely disappointed and to add insult to injury I have paid £50.00 more than traveling with British Airways for the same journey. I can promise you that I will not fly with Air Algerie ever again.

### Air Algerie customer review
My  flight on 1st June from Algiers to Lisboa (Portugal) was a nightmare. The check in was extremely slow and the sequence of spot check was complicated. All forms were in French and fortunately I knew some words, but most of the guests got confused. The aircraft was very old and food was lousily prepared. The toilet was like a public non-cleaned toilet for years. Seats were not comfortable and some could not be reclined. But the captain and crew were nice, particularly since they knew I was from Vietnam and they talked in both french and english nicely. Appreciated when they found the lost wallet of my friend.

### Air Algerie customer review
Lille to Algiers. The flight has been delayed (2hrs), but the Air Algerie's airport workers gave us some sandwiches and soft drinks to apologize for the delay, a good point. The cabin crew were very professional. The aircraft (B767) was clean and in a good shape. The meal was excellent. Tea, coffee, and soft drinks have been served inflight. We landed smoothly at Algiers. The ticket price was good, and includes in it 30kg of luggage. A very good experience with Air Algerie.

### Air Algerie customer review
ALG-CDG-ALG Dep 14/01/14 Ret 21/01/14. Very nice trip with my wife and my son (2 years old). No delay B737-800 sky interior not very clean and the cabin crew are not professional. Very good meals and wine. The price was cheap (450 euros for 2 adults and 1 child).

### Air Algerie customer review
Had a scheduled flight from Algiers to Annaba at 10.30 and a return flight at 17.30hrs. Algiers to Annaba 4 hour delay no explanation no assistance was supplied. Annaba to Algires 2.30 hours delay no explanation no assistance was supplied. Old and dirty planes FA's neither friendly or helpful. Ground staff very unfriendly did not speak English either.

### Air Algerie customer review
Flight Paris CDG - Algiers. Flight was more than 3 hours late and no explanations were given by the Air Algerie ground staff. The aircraft was old and very dirty. Food was still on my seat. Cabin crew were very unprofessional and not friendly at all. Food was ok. Only one toilet was in service. I will never fly again with Air Algerie.

### Air Algerie customer review
Paris to Algiers then to Ouagadougou and back. Overall I found this airline good value for money: they are cheap and offer minimal service. The aircraft's were old but kept in a good state except for the washrooms which were disgusting. Seats were rather comfortable. On the Algiers-Ouagadougou leg 1st class seating was attributed randomly to economy passengers. The meals were excellent even on the shorter Paris-Algiers flights. The food is halal but wine is available. Of my 4 flights only one was late by about one hour. No information whatsoever was given while we were waiting but the crew apologised once we were let in.

### Air Algerie customer review
Nov 1 Algiers-Ghardaia by ATR 72. 1 hrs late departure due to late arrival of the aircraft. Confusing as destination "Oran" was shown at the departure gate. Flight full. Some biscuits water and a soft drink was provided. Announcements in French and Arabic only. It is a domestic flight but on arrival and departure immigration has to been cleared. Return Nov 3 Flight on-time long wait for the luggage in Algiers because of a parking problem. Airline recommended as flying is better than 10 hrs by bus.

### Air Algerie customer review
DXB-ALG. 4 hours delay without explanation and they didn't give us anything for this. The aircraft (A330) was pretty old the bathrooms were disgusting and the plane was dirty! Very poor service on-board and cabin crews are not professional. The food was not appealing. The overall service was very poor!

### Air Algerie customer review
BRU-ALG-BRU. Both flight were late - more than 4 hours on the return flight. Food on board is average. The plane was not very clean and looks old. Personal friendly but not very helpful in the airport.

### Air Algerie customer review
London Heathrow to Algiers on an old 767. Cabin crew are simply not professional food wasn't appealing and toilets were filthy.

### Air Algerie customer review
Frankfurt to Annaba this Summer return. The age of the plane from FFM to Alger was pretty old. The Alger- Annaba flight the same. On the return both planes were new. There was no delay. Service on the ground and onboard is ok. Food was excellent even during Ramadan. Take care at the Airport especially on the way from the international to the domestic Airport in Alger! Don't give anybody your papers except if you are sure they are really officials.

### Air Algerie customer review
ALG-MRS. 3 hours delay and no explanation. Only drinks were offered for this 1hr 10mins international flight. Flight attendants are really not professional.

### Air Algerie customer review
LYS-ORN. Clean and new aircraft FA's could be a little more professional. Nice complete meal. I am used to taking this airline to go to Algeria and it is really improving.

### Air Algerie customer review
ALG-AAE. The flight to Annaba took 1hr and was uneventful. Air Algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good. But service is non-descript and like many airlines of North Africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything. So when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book. Their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights. Would fly them again but as I said it is nothing memorable.

### Air Algerie customer review
TUN-ALG in the new 737-800NG (Business Class) a very good trip no delay good meat (champagne before take off). On time at Algiers clean cabin a very large seat and big space not like Air France or Alitalia in Business Class.

### Air Algerie customer review
NIM to YUL. Planes were new and clean (B737-800 and A330) on time crew was friendly and helpful. I had a stop in Algiers for 5 hours the staff at Algiers Airport were friendly too. A very good experience and the cheapest prices. Reading experiences from others it seems like I was lucky.

### Air Algerie customer review
Algiers to London the flight was fine save for the lack of information in English. Lunch wasnt great and the toilet was messy. Aircraft was a newish 737.

### Air Algerie customer review
I have decided to give up on Air Algerie after waiting nearly 3 days for a flight from Heathrow with 2 small children. The airline is a joke - you have to wait at least 3 hours before they tell you your not flying. We had 2 pay for my 2 young children nearly the full fare and then was told to give up a seat as they had overbooked. I am not from Algeria my husband is though - Algeria is like my second home. I feel that the Air Algerie gives the country a bad name - it should pull its socks up and start following the other airlines.

### Air Algerie customer review
I am an Algerian living the south East of England for last 24 years. My family and I use to fly Air Algerie from London to Algiers about twice a year. The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London. I think Air Algerie provides better food than BA but the FA on the BA flights project a more professional image.

### Air Algerie customer review
The service is a shambles! I have travelled with Air Algerie more than 6 times since July 05. Their systems need to be modernised! No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesn't take alot to make it a good flight! The price you pay is extortionate in comparison to what you receive!

### Air Algerie customer review
I have never encountered an airline where the passengers themselves have to collect the luggage from the runway! This happened to me thrice with Air Algerie: Lyon to Constantine 2002 Lyon to Annaba 2004 and Constantine to Paris 2005. I am afraid Air Algerie had a lot to learn to be internationally competent.

### Air Algerie customer review
What a disappointment! Air Algerie need to improve if their star rating and credibility with other operators is to be upped. My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie. Get a grip on your customer service priorities refurbish the aircraft change the menu provide service with a smile - and keep the cabin clean!

### Air Algerie customer review
I'm an Algerian living in Ottawa Canada. I fly with Air Algerie every two years for my vacation to Algeria. I always leave Montreal or Toronto for some European city and then connect with Air Algerie to Algiers. I also use Air Algerie domestically when i arrive to fly Algiers-Annaba. Flying with them every two years has given me the privilege of seeing the airline grow and IMPROVE. The food is great and plentiful even on the 2h flights from Paris and Frankfurt and the 1h30min. flights from Casablanca. Most other airlines don't even offer HOT meals on such short flights. I find their planes to be quite nice and they are trying to improve them. They phased out the 727s and 732s leaving only the newest and best also adding to it the Airbus 332s. The extension of the International terminal at Algiers gives you a more comfortable and modern lounge/check-in area and hopefully with the completion of the new terminal it will be even better. I find their only problem to be frequent delays. Other than that good service and good planes.

### Air Algerie customer review
Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!)

### Air Algerie customer review
I live in London . I agree with all the negative points said by the people in the comments and I would like to add that it is impossible for people to get through the phone to contact Air Algerie agency in order to book or to buy a ticket - and if we make a booking through internet we don't get an answer that the booking has been accepted or not !

### Air Algerie customer review
Positives : Food quality. Recent efforts to renew the fleet. Crew friendliness Non-smoking restrictions (though I'm a smoker I consider this a plus) Negatives : Delays (too frequent). Transit lounge (poor comfort). Business & First Class lounge (poor comfort as compared to other airlines). Hygiene on board (dirty WCs sometimes even dirty seats). Inflight entertainment (non-existent). Seating allocation (non-existent). Algiers airport duty free shopping and facilities (poor standards). One of the most expensive airline for $ per distance.

### Air Algerie customer review
The Air Algerie fleet is totally renewed they now have brand new A330 on international routes safe and clean all flights are non smoking. The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes. I recommend this airline yet I would like to see them adopt a world class frequent flyer program.

### Air Algerie customer review
What I don't understand is why AIR ALGERIE is not allocating seats when people check in. This creates a big confusion. It is not the passengers fault but it is the airline which doesn't allocate seats. It wasn't used to be like that in the past.

### Air Algerie customer review
My wife and I use Air-Algerie twice a year to go from London to Algiers and we usually use the company for internal flights as well. I can say with confidence that both security at airport and food during the flight are the best in the world. The Fleet maybe a little old but the level of maintenance carried out on the planes must be very high. The service provided by the crew is probably poor but I can assure you that the worst of Air-Algerie is the quality of the passengers. Everyone thinks the plane is his or her so he/she can seat anywhere smoke whenever they are pleased take overweighed hand luggage and use their mobile phones during the flight. I do advice people to fly with Air-Algerie but remember to be a good passenger and you will see how will be treated.

### Air Algerie customer review
My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air France's unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits (economy: 23 kgs!). We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.

### Air Algerie customer review
As it's the only option in Algeria I travel twice a month with Air Algerie and I can’t tell lots of things need to be done within the company itself for instance all Personnel need to have a worthy training to learn how to treat customers to improve their poor service quality.

### Air Algerie customer review
I fly sometimes with Air Algerie and it is not worst nor better than all other flight companies. For the security all the airplanes in world are submitted to the same safety constraints so it is not more dangerous to fly with Air Algerie than to fly with others (All Air Algerie airplanes are from the last generation Boeing or Airbus). And the greater decision Air Algerie has taken is to eliminate smoking in their airplanes. For the delays I think is problem of security which is taken really seriously by Algerian authorities and also because there are simply not enough parking place at Algiers Airport which will be resolved with the new airport.

### Air Algerie customer review
I am an Algerian living in London I used the the service once from London it was the most expensive horrific and time wasting in my life. It was the first and the last it took me 9 hours where it should have taken only 4. I complained to London branch manager but no action followed nor an apology.

### Air Algerie customer review
As an expat living in Algeria I frequently have to use the services of Air Algérie for going on business trips. As a frequent user I can only confirm what others say about Air Algérie. The planes are 90% of the time late the service is miserable and the planes are in a state where most airlines would take them out of service. Only small highlight is the consistent quality of the food which is not refined but good tasting. Air Algérie certainly is part of the Algeria experience but those who are scared of flying may not find this the most reassuring airline to go with. A word of advice as a business traveller - take business class there is a small lounge at the Airport in Algiers where you can at least pass your time when the flight is delayed.

### Air Algerie customer review
I fly Air Algerie on a regular basis - they are habitually late because of security. For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.
