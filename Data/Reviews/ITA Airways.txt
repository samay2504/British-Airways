### "flight attendants were barely visible"
We were ticketed on ITA Airways from Rome to New York JFK and connecting on  Delta from New York to Tampa. We waited at the check-in counter behind another ITA employee who was engaging in a personal chat with the agent. After we interrupted their conversation, the agent called for a security check and our passports had a sticker put on it. She then checked our bags through to Tampa. We were given boarding passes for both the ITA and Delta flights. Security was simple, we are TSA Pre-Check. We boarded the flight and settled into our seats where I discovered my seat had a broken footrest and the metal on the armrest was broken. After takeoff, we were served lunch. No pre-beverage service before lunch. From that moment on, the flight attendants were barely visible until the snack service before arriving in New York. The flight attendants made the usual pre-landing announcement about seat belts and seat backs, however, failed to check on seat backs. As a result, the passenger in front of my wife and a passenger across the aisle still had their seat backs fully reclined. During that time, the flight attendants were in their jumpseats. Prior to landing, I had cleared customs through the Mobile Passport Control App in order to save time for our connecting flight. We went through passport control very easily and then tried finding how to get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4. It was not easy due to lack of signage and construction, but we found it. When we went to the TSA Pre-Check line, it was discovered the Delta passes were not marked as such. The agent in Rome failed to mark them and we had no choice but to stand in a very long line for nearly an hour and nearly missed our flight to Tampa. We are senior citizens (81 and 78) and the experience was exhausting, but we made it to our flight on time. What amazed me was that the flight attendants on Delta were in a aisles more in the short, 2 hour 19 minute flight to Tampa than the ITA attendants in the 9+ hour flight from Rome. That was our first and last time on ITA Airways. Apparently they do not realize that airline seats are perishable products and if empty when the door closes, are worthless. It is interesting to note that there were a number of empty seats on that flight. I'm guessing that number will increase if ITA does nothing to improve.

### "Inflight service was minimal"
They informed me that my flight was cancelled 16 hours before the scheduled flight time; there was a strike of Greek flight controllers. I did informed them a day before at the airport, but they insist that the flight will be operated. They will not change my flight to another day, when my flight cancelled they change my flight to one after 3 days. They promised me to pay one night’s hotel compensation, but at the end I paid 3 night hotel by myself. Ticket office staff at FCO is unfriendly and not eager to help you. Flight was OK, full plane due to stranded passengers. Inflight service was minimal, crew was indifferent just gave us coffee and biscuits. Plane was clean but they have selected baize color at their seats and their carpets which were stained. Bud selection of color. Very small lavatory because they have squished 3 at the rear of the plane

### "one of the small bags was overweight"
Not Verified |  Representative who checked us in for a flight first offered to transfer carry-on bags for free and then told us that one of the small bags was overweight and charged us $160. That bag we could have taken to the plain with us at no charge. Airline refused to refund. Also, tvs were not working on board for many people. no compensation.

### "Extremely disappointing"
I tried ITA for the first time. Extremely disappointing. The steward who was serving me never smiled. Prosecco was not cold. Steward never turned up to ask me if I want any drink. The snack was served with a glass of water. No hot towels. I am not planning to pay a business class seat with ITA and feel I am flying with a budget airline.

### "needs to work on its Business Class product"
The food in Business Class is disgusting, especially considering that Italy is a Food nation. Mainly cheap bread and a disgusting small salad. Another disappointment is that if you book Business Class for the domestic flight you are seated in Economy Class. And this for one way ticket costs at 985 EUR. Complete rip off. The aircraft was new, the seats nice, but the floor full of dirt. ITA needs to work on its Business Class product, current level is inacceptable.

### "Extremely disappointing"
I tried ITA for the first time. Extremely disappointing! The air steward who was serving me never smiled. My Prosecco was not cold. Steward never turned up to ask me if I want any drink. The snack was served with a glass of still water. No hot towels like other airlines

### “did not solve or prevent this situation”
I had a problem doing the online check-in, the website did not allowed me to change the name on the reservation. So both boarding passes got the same name, instead of one for my boyfriend. The company did not solve or prevent this situation. I had to change my travel plans altogether.

### “Days went by without any updates”
Worst customer experience ever and claim not settled yet. Flying from AMS via FCO to EZE on business class. On arrival, it turned out that my suitcase did not arrive. Of course filed a PIR and I was told that my suitcase would arrive the next day. However, there was no suitcase the next day. I tried to contact Swissport (ground handler at EZE on behalf of ITA Airways). Nobody picks up the phone. I tried to contact ITA Airways. ITA now uses an 'artificial intelligence' which did not recognize my spelling and therefore no information about my suitcase. Days went by without any updates from ITA. Of course nobody from ITA or Swissport were reachable. One week later, I was informed that my suitcase was found. In the meantime I made some expenses to buy some clothes and toiletries. I tried to claim those expenses (about 800eur in total) with ITA Airways. First I was offered a cash compensation of 230eur and a voucher of 470eur. That doesn't match my expenses, and I also don't want a voucher since I hardly fly. I stated that clearly in my message. Then ITA offered me a cash compensation of 350eur and a voucher of 470eur. I contacted ITA again and stated that I am not interested in a voucher and I only want cash compensation. After that ITA only offered a cash compensation of 350eur..., on which I replied that that doesn't cover my expenses of about 800eur. After that, ITA remained silent.

### "how well ITA handled this"
On our return from our Christmas break, we sadly had a long delay in Milan Linate in transit due to the inclement weather in the UK which meant poor visibility at many airports, and especially in London City where would be landing. At first this was frustrating as we weren't told about the delay until through passport control and at the tiny non-Schengen gate area after essentially having our boarding pass scanned for boarding. The previous flight had been cancelled already and we could have waited in the lounge as status holders, but the lounge is in the Schengen area before passport control. However from then on I was surprised how well ITA had handled this - after an 90 minutes it became clear conditions in London weren't going to improve for the day, so ITA escorted us all through immigration via bus to departures where they arranged accommodation for the night. During all this we got an automatic email with our new flight the next morning. After a short wait at the check-in counter our names and room requirements were taken down, given new boarding passes and within 90 minutes we were able to head to our hotel near to the airport where a room and dinner was provided. The flight the next day operated on schedule. Other passenger who we met who couldn't be accommodated on ITA were accommodated on BA flights which I thought was impressive given they are competitor and in a rival alliance. I was very worried initially but impressed in the end how well ITA handled these irregular operations and staff seemed to cope well - this gives me a lot of confidence to fly with them in the future as they made it very stress-free. Recommended.

### "relatively good value"
These were our outbound flights to Sicily to visit family for Xmas which we had booked over 7 months in advance but as usual ITA had changed flight times, in this case cancelling our connection from Milan to Palermo which meant a 6 hour layover in Milan Linate. This made our overall journey time very long for what is a short haul destination. We luckily have Executive status with ITA and lounge access, but had we not this would have been even more tiring and uncomfortable in what is a very small airport. Also despite there being no lounge in London City, ITA give no dining credit like BA for their top tier status holders which feels poor of loyalty. Onboard we were lucky to have fairly new planes on both sectors. The A220 that are used on the London City sector is an excellent plane with great leg room and I appreciate the 2 seating row on one side of the plane which is good for us as a couple. On the Linate to Palermo sector we had a new A320neo with ITA's new interior scheme which was nice. Complimentary onboard snacks and drinks could be better. And cleaning of plane interiors needs to be done to maintain these fresh planes. Overall a very mixed bag, but they remain our preferred airline to Italy at the moment against very poor competition and provide relatively good value.

### "the worst airline experience"
Hands down the worst airline experience I have ever had. I have Elite Plus status with SkyTeam and while I do not wave it around I do expect a few basic courtesies. ITA offered none at the human level. At check in, the agent said one word, "Passport? nothing else during the process. Asking which way to the gates I got a head nod in the general direction. Boarding was a shambles. The harried gate agent had no control, boarding passes were scanned then we were sent down a flight of stairs and told to wait, on the stairs for 10 mins or so and the enclosed area stank of fumes, on the ramp I was directed to the rear stairs, I pointed out I was in row 7 and still told to go to the back where I was fighting like a salmon upstream to get to my seat. Service was a tiny cup of water and a little bag of dusty snacks. The flight crew didn't want to be there, very unfriendly, hurrying to get through the process and hide for the rest of the flight. Toilets on board were no better than festival porta-loos at the end of a concert. The deplaning process was worse than boarding, lengthy wait for a bus, everyone scrambling to get on, packed in tight and a long ride to the terminal. An incredibly terrible experience, will avoid traveling with ITA at all costs and would never recommend this airline - 0 out of 10 if I could

### "pay 25 eur for a seat"
Hyper expensive tickets, for a connection they changed (from 50 min wait to 5 hours wait) without an option to refuse or pick another flight. They put us away from our 3 years old kid, and ask us to pay 25 eur for each leg to change each seat (+ 200 eur in total only if we were to sit together return). We wanted to switch one seat, and of course the person had to also pay 25 eur for a seat, but the staff didn’t engage at all - they asked us to solve between ourselves. So not only we had to pay, but also be in uncomfortable situation. They give you a cup of water and 3 biscuits, with no options to buy anything else. In the past they were known to lose luggage, with difficult to accept reimbursement policy. This time I haven’t checked in luggage, so this trouble is at least saved.

### "will never ever fly ITA Airways again"
One of the worst airlines I traveled, and I do travel a lot. First of all ATITUDE of ITA flight attendants are absolutelly horrible. You have a feeling that they doing you a huge favor averytime you see them. Never ever I met such posh acting flight attendants. Second, beds in busimess class are very uncomfortable, will not go nicely flat, its more of bumpy type. Third, customer service, over charging you for a business class and not having your seat available is very common thing at ITA Airways. And last but not least, food quality is lower than an avarage, which was a big dissapointment, since I have not expected it from Italians. I hope I will never ever fly ITA Airways again

### "check in staff ruined our experience"
I had one of the worst experiences with this company. The check in counter staff made some very basic mistakes with our visas and couldn't understand instructions or documentation. This meant we almost missed our flight, we spent 2 hours at the check in counter with no explanation or discussion. The staff member was so rude she refused to look at us when she spoke. It's such a shame that their check in staff ruined our experience of Italy. The service inflight was okay.

### "got my luggage after 3 days"
Not Verified |  I had one flight with them in business class and they blew it totally. First a 90 minute delay out of Frankfurt into Rome with no real reason. Then on the flight two stewardesses in Business who were more chatting than anything else. When I told them about my concern missing my connection they informed me that someone will be waiting for me at the gate which was a lie. No one did so I did rush like crazy to my new gate at another terminal. When approaching the gate I was told I am the last passenger. Inside the plane I asked the steward about my luggage and he tried to calm me down as everything will make it. But I requested the purser and she tried to enquire with the ramp again without getting any answers. What should I say, luggage did not make it to Bangkok. So I had to go to lost baggage and usually one would thing that the luggage should arrive the next flight (next day). Not with ITA Airways it took 3 days. Trying to reach out to the baggage claim email was useless as it is a full mailbox and no one will respond. Using the claim form on their website is a waste of time as well as no one will respond. Luckily I got my luggage after 3 days in Bangkok and I had to purchase clothes and toiletries and I have no idea yet as to how to claim these.

### "stopped flying out of SFO"
We had purchased tickets to fly non-stop from SFO to FCO. Flight was to occur on 5/11/2024. When we arrived at the airport not only there was no flight shown it turns out the entire airline stopped flying out of SFO (into or out of) on 27 Oct 2024. Did we receive any notification? No. Did they provide us any helping acquiring another flight? No. They said they were not partners with other airlines. They did offer a full refund however we had to spend more on Swiss, then another ITA flight to Naples; paid for additional cab fare, and received less refund from various transport (Flexibus, Flight from Catania back to FCO). I do not ever plan on taking ITA Airways as their ability to inform people on their changes is inefficient.

### "I will avoid ITA Airway"
I was travelling with a friend and wished to buy the tickets together but were told that it was not possible because I was carrying a suitcase and he did not. We were told that we could request to sit together at check in. This worked without any problem on the way out, but on the way back we were told this was never done as seats were attributed automatically. This person was therefore either lying or incompetent, what was clear was that he had no intention to help. I had a very small carry-on roller (about half the size of the usual cabin luggage), in which I was carrying delicate ceramics bought during the trip, as well as important medication and my laptop. An announcement was made that there was not enough space within the cabin and that a number of carry-ons would be put below deck. This only applied to about half of the passengers, so when the flight attendant came I explained the contents of my small bag and asked to be allowed to keep it in the cabin. She was rude to an astounding extent (never had such an experience before in any airline), she shrugged her shoulders and said she could not care less about my request "non me ne importa niente". The worse part is that all the persons behind me in the queue got to keep their luggage in the cabin, even with much larger bags than mine (only the first half of the queue were asked to put their rollers below deck, and I was the last of those). She could have just be kind enough to skip me and ask one of the passengers behind if they minded. The result was that I entirely emptied my roller luggage, gave it empty to be put below deck, and took all of its contents in a fabric bag to the cabin!I found no less than two empty spots in the compartment above my seat, where I placed all that I carried. In short to whole situation was absurd and a waste of everybody's time, and lacked any kind of courtesy, logic and humanity. It was a very sad experience and I will avoid ITA Airways unless there is absolutely no other option.

### “Customer service was terrible”
Customer service was terrible. Flight attendants were rude and not attentive. Seats were uncomfortable. Food was dry and tasteless, and we had no snacks between meals, or in other words, we were served food again after 7 hours. The experience was very unpleasant and I hope to never travel with them again.

### "proposal inadequate and disrespectful"
Not Verified |  In August, during a flight with ITA Airways, one of my suitcases was damaged. I submitted a compensation request and, after months of waiting and several requests, I received as compensation a 75 euro voucher to spend on a future Alitalia flight. I find this proposal inadequate and disrespectful, given that my expectation was to receive a replacement for the damaged baggage or sufficient financial compensation to purchase a new one. I believe it is unacceptable that Alitalia chooses to offer a voucher, instead of acknowledging responsibility for the damage with direct compensation, effectively forcing me to spend further money with your company. Ad agosto, durante un volo con ITA Airways, una delle mie valigie è stata danneggiata. Ho presentato una richiesta di risarcimento e, dopo mesi di attesa e diverse sollecitazioni, ho ricevuto come compensazione un buono di 75 euro da spendere su un futuro volo Alitalia. Trovo questa proposta inadeguata e irrispettosa, dato che la mia aspettativa era di ricevere una sostituzione del bagaglio danneggiato o un risarcimento economico sufficiente per acquistarne uno nuovo. Ritengo sia inaccettabile che Alitalia scelga di offrire un buono, invece di riconoscere la responsabilità del danno con un risarcimento diretto, costringendomi, di fatto, a spendere ulteriori soldi con la vostra compagnia.

### “didn’t try to help in any way”
Not Verified | This is the absolutely worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of booking with. We booked round trip tickets from Barcelona to Rome but were unable to make the flight to Rome due to being trapped in Valencia because of the devastating flood on October 30, 2024. This airline cancelled our round trip tickets because I didn’t call to inform them that we wouldn’t be able to make the flight to Rome. They didn’t try to help in any way, and certainly weren’t prepared to refund us for any part of the flights. Considering the cause of missing the flight was a natural disaster that we were trapped in, the airline’s behaviour is disgusting, callous, and utterly atrocious. DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE. Horrible customer service from a horrible airline.

### “amazing product: please take care of it”
I had a A320 neo to Rome and a brand new A321 to Dakar. Ground staff in Rome: well smiling doesn’t cost anything but all ok. Crew was lovely, the food was good and sufficient. Entertainment system nice but very limited options. Now the aircraft is only 6 months old and it seemed like 20 years. 1 bathroom inop! I really hope the crew blocked it for them because if not… ITA you have an amazing product: please take care of it! You could become again my airline of choice but please teach your staff what service with a smile means and maintain your equipment I was in the emergency row! Good legroom.

### “staff was very hostile to me”
Not Verified | Worst experience ever. 1) I couldn’t check in online because apparently checked in bags needs to be checked in 7 days before departure and had to pay double price for my luggage. 2) 1 of my luggages was left in Rome and was told it would be on the next flight the following day to YYZ but never did, called them about it and staff was very hostile to me, emailed but nothing positive came out of it. It’s almost 2 months now and my luggage is still not recovered neither have I been compensated.

### "if you have low expectations, you'll be happy"
Lounge was fine (as it should be in their HQ) - nice selection of fruit and pastries - got a cappuccino from the machine that was mysteriously hard to find tucked away in a corner - realized later that everyone orders these from the bar (meaning the queue for the bar can get very long). Food on the flight was sad - some egg dish that looked very old and hard (didn't try it), so I stuck with more fruit salad. The seat belt sign never came off on a 2+ hour flight through completely calm weather - when I asked the flight attendant when it would come off, she airily replied that I could go to the lav whenever I wanted - forget about getting a drink refill! Really lazy and I felt bad for the folks in the back who probably never got to stand up for the whole flight. Luggage came off quickly so that was good - if you have low expectations about the flight itself, you'll be happy!

### "what a disappointment"
My mom usually travels economy when visiting us in the US. Since it is a long-haul flight, and she is getting older, we decided she should travel in comfort of business class. So, we bought ITA business class. And what a disappointment it was. So much so that it stressed her out and she asked if we could change her flight to another airline even if it was going to be economy. It started with the very first leg. The flight took off at 3:00am and there was no water, tea, coffee or breakfast service for next 5-6 hours, which is very unusual. My mom finally asked for something so she could take her medicine. The service staff was indifferent and when the food was finally served, it was cold and very mediocre. The food in the second leg was equally bad and service no better. My mom is of slight built and not a big eater, and she got off the final leg hungry. This was the ITA business class experience. Yesterday, she left to go back, and we made sure to pack her food just in case this the norm on ITA. Yesterday, when I took her to the airport, we were waiting for the wheelchair service for 45 minutes before they came. Just keeping my fingers crossed that this return journey is better than coming to the US.

### “Cabin crew was friendly and efficient”
Not Verified | R/T Chicago O'Hare-Rome Fiumicino on two well-worn A330s. Flights departed and arrived ahead of schedule. Seats were standard coach seats with 17-inch width and 31 or 32 inch pitch, pretty much the same size as on every U.S. carrier, extremely worn but not uncomfortable. Cabin crew was friendly and efficient, food was mediocre at best (heartbreaking for an Italian carrier), IFE was limited in scope but still more than adequate for the length of the flight. No problems with luggage check-in or pickup. The ONLY true negative is that attention to the lavatories was pretty much ignored, and by flight's end they were out of paper supplies and pretty much a wreck. Would I fly ITA again? ABSOLUTELY.

### "been a complete nightmare"
I started my journey with high hopes, having booked a business class ticket from Miami to Rome. However, what I encountered was utter chaos from the very beginning. Upon arriving at the airport, I learned that they had canceled my ticket simply because my dad and I share the same name despite having completely different birthdates! The staff at the counter treated us like we were the problem, displaying a level of incompetence and indifference that is truly shocking. It took over an hour of frustrating back-and-forth just to resolve this ridiculous issue. When we finally made it to the gate, they had the audacity to inform us that one of our “business class” seats didn’t even lie flat. Seriously? That’s the whole point of paying for business class! The lack of communication and professionalism was infuriating. Upon arrival in Rome for our return , I was hit with the bombshell that my return ticket was canceled—again, without a single email or notification. ITA Airways didn’t even bother to inform me! With no more business class seats available, I was left with no choice but to fly back in economy. To add insult to injury, I had to pay for seat selection, despite already dropping a significant amount of money on a business class ticket! The entire experience was a complete disaster: my food was inedible, and the flight attendants acted like I was an inconvenience. Now, I’m fighting tooth and nail to get my money back. ITA Airways has been unresponsive and dismissive throughout this entire process, leaving me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a customer. This experience has been a complete nightmare.

### "seats were given to someone else"
Pre booked specific seats due to medical conditions and paid for those. Upon check in - our 3 seats were given to someone else and we were given exit seats by the bathrooms towards middle of the plane. 9+ hours traffic to the bathroom where people were practically sitting in my lap, stepping on my legs, standing not in the isle but at my seat all night long. One of the bathroom doors broke - 2 crew members were fixing it for an hour while line to the bathroom got even worse. Bathrooms were dirty, smell was everywhere. Customer should not have issues especially if specific seats were chosen and paid extra TV was not working at the seats we were forced to sit.

### "against their no refund policy"
On the day of my flight I checked in and I purchased 1 checked bag for my flight, because for some reason I thought checked bag meant carry-on, which cost me $160. I did not mean to add the checked bag and at this point I was already in the airport and figured the people at the bag check-in could give me a refund for my mistake. When i arrived at the check-in i informed the person that I mistakenly purchased a checked bag to which she said there would be no problem if I called ITA Airways and requested a refund. Note: I never checked in any bags since this purchase was a mistake. When i got to my gate I sat down and called ITA support. The person on the phone told me I would have to submit a ticket so I did. A few days later, while I was in Albania, they got back to my ticket request stating I needed to call for this kind of request, great now I had to wait 6 days until I could call because I didnt want to waste more money calling overseas. I got back to the states yesterday, and today I called to request my refund again. They told me no and said its against their no refund policy. I understand the no refund policy is for protecting themselves against people who want to check in a bag but decide not to last second (which is also stupid), however $160 is a lot to throw away for no reason on a mistake.

### “bad service and horrible food”
This is one of the worst airlines. I purchased premium economy figuring that the extra $800 one way was not worth the cost. It probably would not have been given this review. I did try to upgrade to business class but my 650 euro bid was not accepted for the return flight oct 5, 2024. Departed Miami to Rome, Sept 7. Had an aisle seat which is what I prefer. The recline seat was very uncomfortable as it only reclines to a point where your legs dangle with no support. In a short while this became uncomfortable for me and I needed to revert to original unreclined seat. The crew on the outbound fed up a poor actually garbage meal with a glass a wine and then disappeared. I was unable to sleep at all during this outbound flight. Was told that premium economy received the same food and service as business class. If this were true, businesses class extra cost was not worth it. The return flight Oct 5 was also bad. We apparently departed the gate about an hour late. Every flight I had been on previously the captain would advise such and usually say they would try to make up most of the delay with faster speed or tail winds. The food on the return was not fit for human consumption. They had me down for a low fat diet which was certainly incorrect. They would up giving me what they said was a goulash meal. I could not even chew the meat.4 There was a piece of tubular intestine about an 1" long in this mess. This was garbage food perhaps fit for a dog. It took about 11 hours from Rome to Miami. Way too long. I think this cheap company was cruising at a very low speed to save fuel. When we finallly landed it took about 30 minutes for the jetway to attach to the plane door so we could finally disembark the plane. This is a bad company providing bad service and horrible food. I will never fly them again unless I have absolutely no choice.

### "outrageous charge for one bag"
Not Verified | I checked in at Rome FCO airport, attendant was not attentive I ended up checking in an additional bag besides the free bag allowed which was carryon size. She asked for my credit card which I provided and knew there would be an additional charge of $75-$85. I was charged 220 euros which is approximately $243 US dollars once returning home, I called the airline customer service with no resolution, the first rep put me on hold to look into my situation and just transferred me to the customer service survey which I rated the lowest due to no help or resolution. The second rep was still of no help and told me I needed to file a claim for this outrageous charge for one bag, now it is a waiting game and will be calling my credit card to dispute this insane charge. Looking at their website the amount I was charged was for people whim check 3-6 bags. If this is not resolved I will not be flying this airline in the future. There is no point of this airline having customer service as they do not assist or resolve issues.

### "no way to appeal for a refund"
The first leg of the flight, from Rome to JFK, went well. But ITA Airways failed to schedule enough time to go through the process of clearing customs, collecting bags, getting to another terminal at the airport to check in bags, and get through TSA in order to make our connecting flight. Besides the time delay to get through all of that, ITA made things more difficult by using the ITA Airways letterhead on the boarding pass we were to use for our connecting flight on Delta Airlines. The TSA agent at the Delta Airlines security entry point denied us entry, saying "There are no ITA flights here! Even though we showed him that the airline code was for Delta, but when he saw the ITA logo he would have none of it. We did attempt to exchange our ITA boarding passes for Delta passes, but by that time we were too close to boarding to be issued another boarding pass. The TSA delay wasn't the main issue, however, it was the lack of time to get through the overall process that made us miss the flight. The more frustrating part of all this are the barriers that ITA Airways puts up to prevent customers from addressing issues like this. Because if the flight that was missed was a U.S. domestic carrier (Delta), then ITA wants nothing to do with it. They say to take it up with Delta. And yet clearly, in this case Delta Airlines had nothing to do with our missing the flight -- so of course they would say that this wasn't their problem. And it's not. It's ITA's fault. But there's no way to appeal for a refund, or get any satisfaction, other than to let the flying public know to beware ITA Airways, especially if they're planning on sending you through JFK airport!

### “Of course they lost our baggage”
Not Verified | This is THE worst company that I have seen. 1) first the flight was delayed nearly two hours. 2) we missed the connection flight. 3) they did not let us check in online, so we were about to miss the second connection flight (scheduled at a later time) 4) Of course they lost our baggage. 5) on our way to Rome, they CANCELED our return flight. We will miss the wedding of our best friend. The staff is incredibly rude, not helpful at all. DO NOT choose this company for your travels in Italy.

### “rude customer service”
Not Verified | If this keeps one person from using the airline it is worth it. Slow, late flights, rude customer service. It was not a language barrier they were this way to everyone. Like you were bothering them that they had to assist you.

### “8 months later I still have no resolution”
Our baggage was delayed 3 days and ITA Airways said they would reimburse clothes/toiletries purchased during that period. In fact they are required to do so by international law (Montreal Convention) and European regulation. 8 months later I still have no resolution. NEVER count on ITA Airways to do the right thing…even if they said would and are required by law.

### "return flight was a nightmare"
I my wife and 6 year old son spent over $ 6,144 For return flight to Europe from Toronto Pearson airport. Our flight out was fine. Our return flight was a nightmare. The plane was outdated and our seats were next to washrooms which made me and my son sick (we couldn't check in online so we had to go at the airport to do it). Our food was inedible. Seats were tight. When we arrived, after picking up my checked in luggages, I realized that 1 of the luggages had a broken wheel and the other one had a dent. When trying to make a claim the representative of ITA Airways and the manager said that they could not give me a P.I.R code so I could make a claim online. When I asked to talk to someone else, he said I'm the manager of ITA in Toronto.

### "no option for online boarding ticket"
First red flag: there was no option for online boarding ticket, so whilst it had been paid for, it was not available. I was informed that I would need to collect it from the terminal. I realized with that inconvenience that I would need to be ready to collect my ticket early. My flight was scheduled for 16:30, and I arrived around 1.5 hours early, specifically at 15:02, to collect my boarding pass. However, upon checking the terminal, there was no one at the ITA service desk. I walked around and around asking other terminals agents if they knew where I might inquire about my boarding pass. After 15 minutes, the time was 15:17, and I found a general airport service desk worker, who was kind enough to call ITA’s departure gate and inquire about why there was no one to assist. The worker told me that ITA had closed the service desk and all workers had moved on to the gate and “they were not going to help”, which I heard as clear as a bell on the other phone line. Not a single explanation given. The service desk worker gave me ITA’s customer service number, which I called; after 6 repeated calls in an attempt to get through to someone on the phone call, a representative answered and told me that because I arrived at 15:30, they would not reopen the gate. Despite my numerous attempts to explain that I arrived well before 15:30, the customer service representative continually repeated “I am sorry Ma’am but as you arrived an hour late to the terminal, which was after 15:30, there is nothing they are willing to do”. I quickly realized the futility in attempting a resolution for this issue, after spending several minutes trying to communicate with the representative, who seemed to still miss my argument. Given the prior service shown to me already, I assumed she was deliberately being obtuse. I attempted once more to explain how she misunderstood, at which point she hung up the phone, which I know is what happened, because a recorded survey prompt asked me to rate my customer service. I remained alone with no help. Here are the Cliff Notes: I did not get my boarding pass because ITA’s workers refused to assist with providing me my physical copy. Do not under any circumstances, book with ITA Airways. They are exceptionally rude, lazy, and clearly dishonest, additionally to their customer service being beyond a joke. If there is remotely any other option, save yourself and go with that other option.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
The absolute worst experience of any airline possible! Hour late boarding, hour late taking off with zero explanation. Missed the connecting flight in time by a hair because of the previous delays. Normally airlines with the same company connecting flights wait for a little to allow some late passengers on, especially when it is the airlines fault! The connections desk staff were rude, unhelpful and favoured Italian speakers or Italians in general over any one else! Italians kept cutting in line and none of the staff challenged them! Had to wait in departures for another 4hrs when I’ve already done a 19hr journey from my home. Got given a 10€ voucher which didn’t cover half the price of burger/chips/bottle of water! I will avoid this airline at all costs! How they are still on business baffles me but I well and truly hope that they go into administration.

### “the worst experience I've ever had”
Not Verified | This was possibly, no definitely the worst experience I've ever had on an aircraft or with an airline. Getting onto the plane which was over 20 minutes late with no explanation was a joke. I had to check my wife's bag through due to lack of room on the plane. Then he hands me my boarding passes and my connection flight has no gate number. Yay for me. Not normally a problem. I should have almost an hour till the connecting flight. Oh wait the plane is 20 minutes late. When I got on the plane there were people with 2 bags everywhere. On take off something fell off the plane! The flight crew had to get someone's phone who was videoing the take off and take it to the captain! Lucky everything turned out fine. Now I get to the airport, the urgency of people to move is so much more noticeable when you are late. At this point we were desperate to get to our connection to Venice. Any ITA employees I could find had no clue whatsoever where to find our flight that by rights should have taken off already. Literally got yelled at by a guy on boarding desk when I tried to ask for help. Just wanted to know where a help desk was. He assured me he was very busy at his empty desk and couldn't help me. Luckily we're in an airport so he got to keep his teeth. Finally found our gate, also late, also no explanation. I suppose they were waiting for the late plane to show up. Now we're sitting on the tarmac a solid 50 minutes late still loading the slowest people in the world. Long story short. If I never have to again I will not ever be using ITA again.

### “bait-and-switch tactic is deplorable”
I strongly advise against booking with ITA Airways due to their misleading and consumer-hostile practices. My recent experience was nothing short of infuriating: I initially purchased Economy Lite tickets and later spent an additional $400 to upgrade to premium seats. Despite this significant investment, I was shocked to discover that I was still bound by the restrictive Economy Lite terms and conditions. When I needed to cancel my flight (over a month in advance), I was offered a mere 6% refund - an insultingly low amount considering the total spent. Even worse, ITA Airways refused to offer credit for a different flight, leaving me with virtually no options. This bait-and-switch tactic is deplorable. Customers reasonably expect that a substantial seat upgrade would come with improved terms, but ITA Airways uses this misconception to their advantage, pocketing large sums while providing minimal flexibility or value. Such practices should be illegal. ITA Airways should be ashamed of exploiting customers in this manner. The airline industry already has a poor reputation for customer service, but ITA Airways manages to sink even lower. Save yourself the headache, frustration, and financial loss. Book with literally any other airline that respects its customers and operates with transparency. ITA Airways has lost my business permanently, and I urge others to avoid them at all costs.

### "desperately need my luggage"
Worst experience traveling. The flight to Rome was fine, like any normal travel experience. The flight back to Chicago was terrible. First they overbooked the flight so I had to get a standby ticket to “see if they can find me a seat”. After finally receiving a boarding pass, we make it on the plane and fly to Chicago. Once it’s time to pick up the luggage, it’s nowhere to be found. For myself and a whole other group of people. It’s been 4 days and I have yet to receive any update or notification about my missing luggage. Any time i contact the airline (if they even answer) they tell me I need the PIR number to track my luggage. No one that filed a claim at the airport ever received any PIR number. No one has been of any help. I desperately need my luggage. I had important stuff in there, and no one can tell me anything about it. The airline phone number doesn’t even answer.

### "Very disappointing experience"
Not Verified | Very disappointing experience! After my initial flight was canceled, I was offered a much later flight without being informed of other options that were clearly available, probably to avoid upgrading me. I’m really surprised by this lack of transparency and hope that ITA Airways will show understanding and quickly rectify the situation. I just want to be able to depart on the date that suits me, without any additional costs.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. They will bump you off your flight, because they overbook. And then they put you in a crappy hotel, and act like they’re doing you a favor by “extending your vacation “ by one day. Consider a different airline, and if you have to fly ITA, be sure to check in remotely like 3 days in advance, or run the risk of them just giving your seat away. Counter girls are rude, and not one person even said “sorry for the inconvenience

### "decided to leave one bag in Italy"
Arrived at airport early…9AM…Sunday 8/11. Turns out ITA doesn’t show up for work until 10 AM. Once we got to talk to a human, they proceeded to take our bags. Their computers did not network with United Airlines, so they couldn’t provide us our boarding passes for our next flight (Rome to San Francisco) In Athens, they decided to leave one bag in Italy while our other bags traveled onto San Francisco. If ITA is going to partner with United, they need to integrate like Lufthansa and provide access to United Premier services and boarding pass access.

### "must be the worst airline"
This must be the worst airline I‘ve ever used. The staff is incredibly unfriendliy, there‘s absolutely no space in here and as long as you‘re not Italian, they treat you poorly. First time in this garbage carrier and for sure the last. Guys, there are so many good airlines - take them.

### "airplanes are disgusting"
The airplanes are disgusting, stains on the seat. Lots of broken seats, my seat did not recline. The staff have so much attitude. The bathroom lock broke and the stewardess gave me so much attitude like I’m being stupid.

### "impossible to have the online check in"
Worst airline I’ve ever been to. Let’s start with 6+ hours of delay. It’s been impossible to have the online check in, the gate at the airport doesn’t exist and did not appear on the screen. Never had an experience like this, I ran around the airport looking for the right gate and at the end the right gate was under another destination, they did not change the screen. I thought it was a joke, not professional at all.

### “WORST airline I've ever seen”
WORST airline I've ever seen. Tried to check in 6 hours before the flight and I had boarding pass on waiting list asking me to come to the airport, I had to go to the airport 5 hours before the flight (ruined my day while I was in Rome only for a weekend). At the airport I was told that I had a seat but then I had to spend half of my day at the airport while I had other plans. Of course there was a 1 hour delay which made my time even worse. Once seated on the plane I had the crew come ask me for my boarding pass 3 times as if I was able to get in the plane without a check. By that time it was 22h30 and I was too tired to deal again with their issues. If it is the last airline on earth I won't fly with them and I'd rather walk my way than have them ruin my stay once again.

### “I have been pleasantly surprised”
I have been pleasantly surprised by ITA Airlines' service quality. Everything was perfect, from seat comfort to inflight entertainment, Internet connection, onboard catering, and flight crew. The only downside was the boarding, which was chaotic and delayed. I would fly again with ITA.

### "way we got treated by staff was disgusting"
ITA airways you’re an absolute JOKE of an airline. Flew with you twice in 4 days and both times, flights were delayed by hours, making us miss our connecting flights. No help, no direction. Not to mention lost our luggage and no one person could give less of a hoot about where my luggage was or when I was getting it back. They are no help, they simply do not care. I understand somethings don’t go to plan when travelling but the stuff we had to deal with from ITA 
and the way we got treated by staff was disgusting. Will never be flying with you again and any advice to anyone thinking about flying with ITA Airways - AVOID!

### "Friendly crew"
Great flight to Milan with ITA. Lovely new A220, with huge overhead bins. On time departure and arrival. Friendly crew, serving plenty of drinks, including a welcome drink of my choice from the bar before takeoff. Good communication from the pilot during the flights. Only gripe is that the seats are a little uncomfortable in the upright position. No air bridge at either end but the bus arrived promptly at Linate.

### "my luggage was missing"
I was travelling from Tirana-Rome-Toronto with ITA Airways, and i had to pay for my luggage 140 euro while other companies have cheaper price for 70 euro. However, i did pay for all of my luggage and when i reach the final destination my luggage was missing. No one was able to give me an answer regarding to my luggage. I send so many emails, phone calls and still pending. I went back to the airport in Toronto to reach out any representatives of this company and i spoke to a manager. She said someone will contact me shortly but no one has so far. Its been almost 2 weeks now, and still i don't have my luggage at the address that i filled at the delayed baggage report. I'm so disappointed.

### "Continuous delays and cancelations"
Continuous delays and cancelations. Zero help. Zero customer service. There's not much else to write here. Very unacceptable, unprofessional, and anti-consumer.

### "tell you we do not give refunds"
I purchased a last minute ticket for almost 3000 USD. I had to wait to return because my father passed away and I need to wait to sign his inheritance and sell property. When I went to make changes they wanted to charge me so I opened my return ticket and zero funds were given. I do not recommend in particular if you pay a hefty price to be able to make changes and they tell you we do not give refunds and they want to charge you again the price of the ticket (even though it was flexed) to make changes.

### "toilets on the right side were closed"
I was happy to fly on a new plane like the Airbus A350. I got the best seats in economy, slightly roomier and more reclinable while still not premium economy. I was shocked when we realized that we were flying for 14 hours on a plane where all toilets on the right side were closed and not working: the plane was flying with 300 people, on a route of 14 hours, with 1 toilet for the business class and 3 toilets for more than 200 people. Quality of the working toilets was a total disaster after 2 hours: huge queues and the toilets didn't have any water! While I got back to my seat I wanted to get online, but WiFi, which was working on the Rome-Tokyo, wasn't working at all this time. Personel on board were not passing to serve water or any other thing excluded the main meal and the snack just before the landing. Movie selection in flight was limited.

### “I'll never fly with ITA Airways again”
Not Verified |  Lost the connecting flight for 1 minute due to 1 hour delay at the departing airport. Both flights by ITA airlines. The Brussels-Rome flight was delayed for a little over an hour due to traffic and while in flight, the cabin crew mentioned the flight Rome-Athens was gonna wait for us since it was the last flight of the day and they almost always wait in such cases. They also reassured every other passenger who had a connecting flight that they were gonna catch their flight. We sprinted all the way from one side of the airport to the other, regardless what we were told by the cabin crew. The staff at the gate closed the door towards the plane right in front of my face without saying a word. After confronting them, telling them that the attendant said this flight would wait, the one was sorry we missed our flight and the other was being ironic, rude and told me to go to the ITA airways desk and ask for compensation only after I asked for it. They, in fact, didn't wait a second more than the expected departure time - the boarding ended at :40 and it was :41 when we arrived at the gate. I should also mention that while flying from Rome to Brussels with the same airline, the cabin crew informed us that the plane will wait for a family from another flight, it was not even the last flight, it was early in the morning. How could they wait for other people for more than 20 minutes in a morning flight but couldn't wait for about 2 minutes for us to catch the last flight? After waiting a long queue, the staff at the ITA desk told us to go to another desk, didn't give us clear instructions on where to go other than "downstairs, right below here" which resulted in about an hour of running in the FCO trying to find the ITA desk. Asking politely two ITA staff members for instructions at an empty gate, who were chatting and laughing at each other, was no use, since they immediately yelled at us in a very rude manner and pointed their finger to the desk we just left, not listening to our question. A person from the airport staff helped us find the desk, he could speak English fluently - unlike any person from ITA we encountered - and could give us clear directions. Eventually we reached the desk, the staff there were polite and understanding, they immediately gave us new tickets, hotel room and taxi. The next day, the flight was delayed for about 45 minutes because the flight crew arrived late. Unacceptable for a flight crew to be this late. A bad airline overall, most of the staff encountered were rude, misinforming and can't speak English well. From the ironic looks and giggles at the ITA's Piazza di Spagna lounge desk before they saw the business class J tickets, to the flight attendants being ironic and not being able to communicate effectively while serving food and drinks. The other person I was flying with had a very serious allergy to some foods and the attendant didn't really want to cooperate and was being rude to her as she was trying to explain she had allergies. Really sorry for the very few kind and understanding people of ITA we encountered for working at such an airline. Needless to say, I'll never fly with ITA Airways again and even if I got a refund the entire ticket price, can't make up for the whole emotional and physical journey or the lost day in the hotel.

### "connecting flight will wait"
Flight delay on departure. Aviation personnel said lies that the connecting flight will wait the arrival of the delayed flight. Arrive Rome and still aviation personnel insist that we can catch the flight although it is a lie.

### "Stranded in Delhi by Delta & Expedia"
Stranded in Delhi by Delta & Expedia. Reported case to Delta, ITA & Expedia but constantly bounced around. All blame each other! Denied refund for upgrade & no rebooking/support. Was visiting for my father's death anniversary. Social anxiety worsened: Made to wait in airport on trolley calling Delta/ITA/Expedia while condition worsened. Airline refused water for medication. Kind airport employee finally got me water so I could take meds. No follow up from airlines despite complaint. ITA has marked the complaint as completed while I am still stranded in Delhi.

### "said we were on standby"
I booked two business class tickets for my wife and I, and when we arrived at the check encounter they told us that they had overbooked business and were downgrading one of us to premium economy. On the way back they did the same thing but instead of going straight to downgrade they said we were on standby and I had to fight with them for an hour to get one business class ticket and one ticket downgraded. Overall you pay big money for business class ticket and you're not guaranteed to get it stay away.

### “Do not check a bag!”
A newer plane from Palermo to Rome was nice. The older plane from Rome to Florence was standard old plane. However, about 1/3 of the passengers on the flight from time to Florence had their baggage lost. It has been almost a week and no update from the airline. Ok if traveling light. Do not check a bag!

### “Avoid using this company”
In July '23 we left Minneapolis for Amsterdam and subsequently boarded the flight to Rome Fiumicino. On 24 July 2023 we were denied boarding on the Rome Fiumicino - Cagliari flight because once we arrived at the gate we were informed of the overbooking. We were waitlisted for 3 more subsequent flights but were still denied to onboard. Finally we arrived in Cagliari after midnight. This delay caused, in addition to extreme inconvenience for an international trip that lasted at least 6 hours longer, the loss of the possibility of getting the rental car and therefore going to the booked hotel. To overcome this inconvenience we had to stay in an expensive hotel at the airport while waiting to be able to collect the car the next morning. We contested the incident and they responded to us after 8 months offering a refund. Another 4 months have passed and we still haven't received any news. Avoid using this company!

### "boarding was disorganized"
ITA Airways is one of the worst airlines I have flown. Our flight from Catania to Rome was delayed so we missed our connection to Toronto. The staff were very rude and reluctant to help. We were supposed to fly Air Canada back to Toronto but ITA airways rebooked us on an ITA Airways flight the next day. They didn't give us any other option of flight (there was an AC flight leaving at the same time) and basically told us take it or leave it. Eventually they put us up in the cheapest, seediest hotel in Rome and a meal credit for the hotel that provided us with a barely edible meal. When it came time to board, we had to stand on a bus (which sat on the tarmac for 20 minutes before taking us to the plane). The boarding was disorganized and the plane was old, narrow seats, charger didn't work, TV system that looked like it was from the early 2000s.

### "The crew were exceptional"
Check in guy really laid back and allowed us to take our luggage on board. Boarding easy. Big disappointment that they changed our plane from the 320neo to the 320 at the last moment. The food served was not really edible. 3 small dry rolls with undefined filling and a pickled vegetable starter. The crew were exceptional. We had a medical emergency mid air but the crew dealt with it calmly and radioed ahead that an ambulance and medical staff were needed for a women who had taken ill. Bravo to them which is why I am giving them an overall 10.

### “All in all not so bad”
Not Verified | Departure delayed 45 minutes due to the air traffic. A320 fifteen years old but in good conditions. Good legroom, crew not so friendly. They served light beverage. Just one hour flight. All in all not so bad.

### "we were all seated separately"
When booking these flights, we paid additional fees to be able to choose/reserve our seats. However, upon arrival at the gate for our flights, we were told that the airplane had changed, that consequently our seats were changed and we were all seated separately. As we were traveling with two minor children (ages 4 and 1) it would have been impossible to seat the children by themselves. A few passengers on the plane kindly changed seats with us to ensure we had 3 (out of 4) seats together, meaning we had to forfeit the fourth seat we had paid for for my youngest child, who ended up using a lap belt (which we were not supposed to do anyway, because we originally reserved those seats). It is unacceptable that I was made to pay a extra fees for seat selections which were never brought to fruition and that I was forced to forfeit one of my paid seats as a result. Additionally, the aircraft we boarded was extremely dirty with crumbs and used tissues and the screen at my disposal was broken. It is unacceptable to have such a low level of hygiene. Customer service stopped replying to our emails, after mentioning "We provided an alternative solution".

### "certainly use this airline again"
Not Verified |   Both short flights were excellent, leaving on time. The cabin crew were attentive and came round with soft drinks, tea or coffee. Both planes were clean and service on ground and in air efficient and friendly. I would certainly use this airline again.

### “My food was not good”
This is the worst flight experience I have ever had. The crew does not provide water and did not attend the call button. The aircraft was very dirty. My food was not good and they did not provide coffee for me with food even after requesting. I will again take this airline.

### "no records of overbook"
We arrive Rome Fiumicino airport 3 hours in advance for check-in. Upon approaching ITA check-in counter, we were informed that our tickets have been changed from confirm to standby because the airline overbook. We have to wait and see if any seats will be available last minute. Otherwise we will have to take the next flight. As we have a concert to attend right after landing, We need to secure a seat on that flight. Per their staff at standby counter there are couple seats left in business and we need to pay extra for it. Due to time limit, we were forced to pay an extra amount of $670 euros to get on a flight that we originally have a confirmed booking with. We call to complaint but they said there were no records of overbook and only redirect us to file a case on website with absolutely no reply.

### “be nice to be acknowledged”
Brindisi is a small with not so many customers. ITA ground staff will still ignore you when waiting in line. While we were in line the lady running the BDS-FCO flight literally walked away after helping another customer and did not address us while waiting in line. No "I need a break" or "I'll be back in 10 minutes. She simply ignored us. We are nobodies on cheap tickets, but it would be nice to be acknowledged. Maybe she had a bad day? I hope that Lufthansa can introduce warmth, hospitality, and professionalism into the Brindisi ground service operation.

### “stuck in the plane for a half hour to an hour”
Not Verified | Be prepared for all flight times to be extended by a minimum of 2 hours. I flew 4 times in a matter of a week on this airline, and somehow after boarding, we waited to take off an hour minimum after departure time. 4 times. Every single time the pilot blames Air traffic control. Twice upon landing we were stuck in the plane for a half hour to an hour because of, you guessed it, more mistakes from Air Traffic Control. While the time in the air is right, remember to take into account that you will be taking off an hour past departure time at least, and may be stuck on the plane after landing for another hour! All really great when you have a connecting flight! We were supposed to have 8 hours to make our connecting flight (a reasonably long layover) and ended up with 2 and. A half hours (enough time still) but awful. The food is also repulsive and I wouldn’t serve it to a rat in the streets. The flight crew is the one redeeming quality, but sadly not enough.

### "Crews were top"
Both flights ZRH-FCO-ZRH were on time. Crews were top. Seats on the new A220-300 look terrific and the cabin inviting. Seats on the 12 year old A319 need to be replaced, in case that aircraft type is kept in the fleet. But seat pitch on 1A is nice and ensures relaxed travel. I was lucky to have that seat on both flights. Food in C Class was disappointing. Too much bread, too few good stuff like salad, meat, fish or seafood. (apart from the salad, the last 3 were not even served. Italy is the land of excellent food, in terms of that, ITA Airways is a real disappointment. A highlight is the Hangar Lounge in FCO, including food, drinks and excellent coffee.

### "asked for a compensation"
Not Verified |   The airline is terrible. Horrible food, unjustifiable delays, without being provided a single voucher. More than three hour delay, asked for a compensation as per policy, and the request has not been addressed after a whole week. Other low-cost are way worthier than this one. Never again.

### "least amount of utility possible"
When I first heard the name of the Airline, ITA airways, I thought, why not just add the L at the end of it and the name would make more sense. Infact those naming the airline did so accurately because it always leaves something lacking. When I boarded the plane I could tell that the plane was old and slightly used. Not to worry, as I didn’t want to judge a book by cover. I did, however, come to judge it by its multiple equipment failures. I sat in my seat and heard the cabin creaking and squeaking. I decided that my knees crack too once in a while and it’s just a sign of aging. The staff handed me headphones and must have chuckled once outside of everyone’s view as the plugs that they go into are broken. I tried to lip read my movie but then the system went down and It’s struggled to reboot and never came back online. I decided to see if I could get on the wifi to keep myself distracted. I logged on and chose the option to get internet for $15 for the whole flight. Great price, no service. They tease you with a spinning wheel that buffers for the whole trip. No internet. Forget it! I try to put my seat back in a reclining position and it didn’t recline. As I approach the bathrooms, I learn that one of them is out of order. I make eye contact with the others in line so as to establish my turn. They also look like they are looking for moral support. We were united in our struggles and for that one fleeting moment, I had a sense of belonging. A sense that I was not alone in the quest to make it home with the least amount of utility possible on an airline. A sense that I started to understand why ITA airways calls itself ITA. Thanks ITA for giving me sensory deprivation such that I could reflect on the true meaning of life.

### “airline changed our seats”
Great on the way, bad on the return, the airline changed our seats, gave them to someone else and didn’t refund the extra money they cost, they said we could have 4 middle seats and then put someone next to us.

### "Its really a mixed-bag"
We fly with ITA Airways to visit family because after some awful treatment from low-cost carriers during covid, we refuse to fly them anymore, and BA don't fly year round to Palermo. We appreciate that they are an option, and that they offer some complimentary service onboard and the status they have gifted us in their frequent flyer scheme which means we can use priority security, the lounge and priority boarding. Functionally they offer most things any other "full service" airline offers, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired sometimes. The app and website is very buggy, so we we rarely check-in online, and often prefer to do it at the airport as it doesn't really work - the check-in staff at Heathrow to be fair were one of the nice things about the airline, as they were very Italian and friendly generally. Next the lounges - at outstations they use third-party lounges, and at Heathrow this was the extremely poor Plaza Premium lounge in Terminal 4. This is used by a lot of Skyteam airlines now they don't have their own alliance lounge anymore and non-aligned airlines, so you'd think they'd be making enough to provide decent food and drink. Sadly not, the food is the cheapest and lowest quality you can imagine, orange juice is long-life and tastes like something you'd find in discount supermarket, while pastries taste like cheap frozen ones. The decor is filthy and stained and is in need of replacing. Overall a poor choice by ITA. In ITA's own lounge in Milan Linate, it is clean and tidy. Food is generally nice, but not a lot of choice and it is heavy on cheap carbs. They also don't rotate the food very often, we travel a lot with them sometimes to Italy, and frequently the same choice of food we had a month a go will still be whats being offered. The food is also mostly cold, apart from a hot soup (which is tasty generally) and some warm foccacia or pizette at lunch and dinner, there is no other hot food. Lounge reception staff can be sulky and contemptuous, but lounge staff otherwise are nice if not always polished. Onboard is probably where it is ugliest - the planes are old, and badly maintained except new A220's. The worst is boarding and frequently being met with a strong stench of stale urine, that is omnipresent across the cabin regardless of whether you are near the toilet or not. On the flight to Milan Linate it was so bad, I asked a member of the cabin crew if they could do something like spray air freshener, but he came back and said they didn't have any. The complimentary service is one positive and appreciated - the snacks could be a bit better as they are generally dry Italian bread snack for savoury or a crunchy sweet rice canolo, and they don't change - the highlight however is they do offer full soft drink service with lots of different cold juices and hot tea/coffee, the tea is particularly good. Cabin crew are not horrible, but seem unhappy generally. Its really a mixed-bag on short haul overall, but could so easily be rather good with some small effort.

### "attendants never smiled"
The planes was run down with rips in the seatback pockets and entertainment that doesn’t work. I flew a 9 hour flight from Rome to DC. The flight attendants never smiled or said a kind word. They passed meals accompanied by 1/2 a cup of beverage an hour into the flight. 3 hours later they offered another 1/2 cup of water and then they weren’t seen until 1 hour prior to departure to pass a snack. On a flight this long water should be available often. They never circulated to collect trash or check on anyone. The seats are uncomfortable and the toilets were filthy. There was no toilet tissue halfway through the flight. Think twice before booking for a long haul flight

### “steer clear of ITA Air”
I had an extremely frustrating experience with ITA Air, which has completely eroded my trust in their customer service. Over a year ago, I was forced to check my carry-on at the gate, only for it to be lost by the airline. Since then, my attempts to resolve this issue have been met with a startling lack of response and concern from their team. Despite numerous emails to their customer relations (including to the Contact Center Customer Operations Head, Mirko Albanese), my situation remains unresolved. It's disheartening to witness such negligence and disregard for passenger property and peace of mind. The unresponsiveness of ITA Air's customer service—ignoring emails and failing to update me on the status of my lost belongings—demonstrates a fundamental flaw in their operations. This experience not only highlights a serious oversight in luggage handling but also a failure in basic customer communication and support. ITA Air's inability to address a simple luggage issue promptly and professionally has left me deeply disappointed. I would caution potential passengers to consider this service failure before booking with an airline that does not prioritize customer satisfaction or respect for passenger property. My recommendation is to steer clear of ITA Air if you value your belongings and expect a basic level of customer service.

### “legroom is the worst”
Brand new plane, nice lighting and colors. Unfortunately the legroom is the worst of any airline I have flown so far. The seats recline, that would usually be a good thing, I bruised my knee when the passenger in front reclined his seat. No room at all, the flight was really uncomfortable, the slim line seat hard and slim. No Wi-Fi or not working. On top of that, 30 minutes delay (on a 2 hours flight) that was completely dismissed from the captain. Flight attendants completely disinterested and indifferent.

### "Do not recommend ITA Airways"
Not Verified |   Old plane with out of service restroom, they change planes at the last minute. The seating is different then you lose the leg room seat that you paid extra for it and they did not reimburse me. Customer service is not existing. Do not recommend ITA Airways.

### "My food was horrible"
Not Verified |   My food was horrible. My lay flat bed was like laying on plywood and couldn't sleep. No movie selection. Service going not good, coming home a little better. Not enough storage and hot in cabin. Cheaper price but you get what you pay for. Stood inline for 45 minutes in Rome because they couldn't get maintenance to open glass door to plane ramp. No communication.

### "Canceled my client's honeymoon flights"
Not Verified |  Canceled my client's honeymoon flights 3 weeks before they were scheduled to depart. Would only offer reprotection on a flight they controlled - no code share - even though it was clearly a controllable cancelation. Well, they canceled the only flight that day they operated from ORD to anywhere, so they provided zero options other than getting everybody scheduled on that plane into Rome a day late. And refunds, those will take between 45 and 90 days to process, which doesn't work well for young adults who need to book another flight to Europe now.

### "never fly this airline again"
This was the absolute worst airline I have ever flown! Both times the flights were 1+ hours late with no explanation or communication. We sat in business class and I was treated very poorly. I wanted to close my window shade because it was so hot and the steward yelled at me that the sun would move, which it didn't. There were many open seats and since the fasten seat belt sign never went off, I was not allowed to move. Another attendant yelled at me because I put my foot against the front wall since we were in first row. When we deplaned and had to take the bus one of the flight attendants made a comment under his breath and when I said excuse me I didn't hear you he just laughed and shook his head. We flew roundtrip Rome to Polermo. I will never fly this airline again.

### "say they wouldn't pay anything"
When dropping off the suitcase at Heathrow, I was told that I also had to check in our two hand luggage trolleys (which are within the dimensions allowed by ITA, as stated on their website) because the plane was 'full'. When I asked if we could keep them with us as I was worried that they wouldn't make it on the next plane, given there was 1 hour transit time, I was told that was impossible and therefore had to open everything up to take out as many valuables as possible and further hold up the already slow-moving queue. What is particularly frustrating is that normally, if hand luggage needs to be checked in, airlines put a member of staff going down the queue to tell people before they get to the front, so that people aren't held up and those who need to take things out of their hand luggage can do so in less of a panic. The plane was delayed and there was general confusion at the gate about the reason. The aircraft had been changed and it had thrown out all the seat numbers. While I totally understand this is normal, and it has happened to me several times before with various airlines, again the communication was pretty poor - this could have been announced or better still, communicated through a notification on the app. On board, I immediately bought unlimited Wifi only to find out that it didn't work on either of my devices. When I asked, a member of the cabin crew told me that they were offering 30 mins free wifi anyway and there was nothing they could do because "it was working for someone else further down the plane". 10 USD completely wasted. We had to run to get our connecting flight and would have appreciated more guidance about where to go. Due to passport control not letting us pass earlier when we said we had a transit and only letting us pass when they were announcing our names in a final call, when we finally got to the gate, it was closed. Thankfully, the staff member on the gate, seeing the state we were in when we got there, showed pity and got us on the plane. 1 hour is not sufficient when buses from planes and passport queues in transit areas are understaffed and the gate for plane 2 is so far from the gate for plane 1. Only one of the three checked-in bags arrived. I was told to return, at my own expense, the following day to collect the missing bags. I did, but the office closes at 5pm. So again, at my expense, I had to return the day after only to find that the combination lock unit on one of the cases had been damaged and there was a hole in the side of my case. The assistant refused to give me a compensation form because "damage involving locks isn't covered" and told me to write to a complaints address for ITA. I wrote to the address, including photos of the suitcase and a list of everything that had gone wrong. No reply. I emailed again a month later. No reply. Until finally, almost 3 months later they replied to say they wouldn't pay anything because didn't get a property irregularity form before leaving the airport. What was I supposed to do? Put a gun to the head of the assistant who refused to give me one? No compensation for time wasted, petrol to keep returning to the airport to get my missing cases, and no compensation for money wasted on wifi that didn't work. Absolutely appalling service considering the price paid for the tickets. Do yourself a favour and fly low-cost - the service is the same, if not better. The only positive - some of the cabin crew are lovely.

### "flight was very comfortable"
The flight was very comfortable, in a well designed cabin with a lovely and efficient crew. On this domestic one hour morning flight coffee and soft drinks were offered, which definitely is far more what many big European Airlines offer, even on longer European routes. Finally, we left five minutes early and arrived 10 minutes ahead schedule.

### “Horrible customer service”
Not Verified | Horrible customer service. They cancelled my FLR-FCO flight which I needed as a connector to CDG due to "weather" (it was not raining or even windy). When I asked for a refund, they refused to compensate me for the cancelled flight because they claimed their offered bus ride to Rome was sufficient (I needed to get to Paris, not Rome). This airline stole my money and did not provide the service promised. Never EVER fly with them. They are just awful!

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  I was travelling long distance with a baby and confirmed with the airline the booking of a baby bassinet the day before the flight. While checking in they told me it was overbooked and there was nothing that could be done. I was advised to call customer service who refused to either cooperate or let me speak to a supervisor so I emailed customer service who replied to me today, 3.5 months later and got my gender and name wrong. The inbound flight was on a plane which hadn’t been renovated, where two of the toilets were broken and which still had ashtrays, it was like time travel. I will never use this airline again.

### "customer service was poor"
Very frustrated with having purchased seats with extra room and having them changed to worse seats prior to the flight. Additionally on one leg of the flight me and one other passengers television did not work. Overall customer service was poor. Difficult to get an extra snack. Felt like I was taken advantage and treated differently because I was an American. The lady next to me was Italian and when asking for snacks they brought her 5, when I asked they said no. They did not accommodate for my television and were overall rude. Additionally I paid $30 for internet that was awful.

### “customer service is the worst”
Over my many years of travel, I have never experienced an airline of such poor quality. The customer service is the worst I have experienced in an airline. The policies are created to take advantage of customers and unfair to the point of manipulation. The agents are located in Albania and have no interest in helping travelers properly. The flight was the most basic I’ve ever experienced and mediocre. The food was the worst airline food I’ve tasted. My advice to the reader is stay away from ITA, even if you need to spend more at a different airline. Also, the movie selection sucks.

### “No response from emails”
We flew one way from Athens to Barcelona. The flight attendants were rude and did not appear to want to work. My new suitcase zipper was ripped apart when I picked up my luggage and my husband had to Jerry-rig it together to hold until we got to our hotel. We were traveling with a group so I didn’t have time to find the ITA office. I immediately submitted a email to their customer service email with pictures ([email protected]). I could not locate an actual report form on their site and requested 2 times to have one sent to me. I received an auto reply that they received my email and were working on my case. Since September, I have emailed and called numerous times for an update to resolution. No response from emails. I have been on hold for over 30 minutes before a customer service representative answered, only to be told either someone was working on it, or being hung up/ disconnected from the call. I would not recommend this airline for any travel and I see they have started US- Europe flights.

### “I didn't accept the snack offered”
The flight attendant working on the section where I was seated, during snack service, while distributing crackers and napkins, she sneezed, covering her nose with her hand. She didn't clean her hands, didn't put on gloves, and continue distributing snacks and napkins (!) with her bare hands she had sneezed on. On that flight I didn't accept the snack offered.

### "my Luggage got scratched
The staff at Delhi airport were rude and my Luggage got scratched and one wheel was broken. Will never travel again with this flight.

### "no clear resolution or apology"
I took Flight AZ404 from Rome to Frankfurt, scheduled from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Upon reaching the baggage claim, I was shocked to find one of my checked bags missing. I went to the Lost and Found counter at Frankfurt Airport to report the incident, but there were no ITA Airways or ABS representatives present. I spent three frustrating hours searching for help at the airport to no avail. Subsequently, I filled out a lost luggage report on the Frankfurt Airport website. On the morning of February 19, 2024, I returned to the airport hoping to find my luggage. It wasn't until 1:30 pm that I finally located an ABS staff member to complete the Property Irregularity Report. The staff member assured me that my luggage was in Rome and would be transferred to Frankfurt for me on the next day (February 20, 2024). I also emphasized that I was a tourist and would only be in Germany until February 21, 2024, so I needed to find my luggage soon to catch my flight back to Vietnam. The staff member affirmed that I could receive it promptly. On the evening of February 20, 2024, my luggage was still not received as promised, so I filled in information about the items in my luggage and sent it by email. However, I received no response. When I checked Worldtracker for information about my luggage, the status only said, "Tracing continues. Please check back later," with no new updates. On the morning of February 21, 2024, I went to the airport to return to Vietnam and inquired with the ABS staff from the previous day. The staff member, after leading me around the airport in search of my luggage, then told me, "Your luggage is not here; I don't know where it is. You need to wait" This response was completely different from what he had said on February 19, leaving me confused about the actual status and location of my luggage. Upon returning home, I continued to send daily emails in the hope of getting support, but all I received were auto-reply emails with no feedback. Nevertheless, I had to cancel my planned itinerary and reschedule my return to Vietnam in order to stay in Frankfurt to address the situation. Originally, my flight back to Vietnam was scheduled for the 19th February. However, I had to change it to the 21st February to search for my luggage. Unfortunately, I still haven't received any information about my case from ABS and ITA Airways. Today, February 23, 2024, I decided to call the hotline of ITA Airways (international number) and received very irresponsible answers like, "We are not Lost and Found; if you want, go to Lost and Found to inquire" (I mentioned that I am in Vietnam and cannot go to Lost and Found in Rome or Frankfurt), "We have checked, and your luggage has not been found; you have to wait. When I asked how long I had to wait and what would happen if my luggage was lost, they replied, "I do not know. My lost luggage contains all my essential personal items, and its absence significantly disrupts my daily life. I am deeply disappointed in the customer service provided by ITA Airways and ABS, as no clear resolution or apology has been offered.

### "my checked bag was damaged"
I paid for extra legroom but they changed the type of aircraft on my outgoing leg from NYC to Rome and I ended up in a window seat with a chair that had a broken spring. On my return from Rome to NYC, my checked bag was damaged when the zipper was pulled off the large outer compartment section and contents were lost. ITA has not responded to emails with documentation of my ticket and my baggage property irregularity report. Because they did not respond within the 21 day period, my attempts at continued follow-up have been ignored.

### “It is very disappointing”
Not Verified | ITA Airways lost my luggage in route to Rome. I get that this sort of thing happens once in a while, but they took a very long time to get it back to me. I was forced to buy new clothes while on my trip, which is fine if they were to reimburse me, but they haven't. I have called and emailed them numerous times and they have not gotten back to me at all. It is very disappointing.

### “the worst customer service system”
Not Verified | This airline has the worst customer service system of any Flag carrier that I have ever flown! Calls are directed to Albania and the agents are rude and unhelpful. I had called to change my route from LAX-FCO-LAX and add a FCO-NAP leg on the outbound. They will not honor ANY of the SkyTeam partners FF programs. Our Delta Skymiles was rejected BC Delta (and none of the Skyteam airlines accepted this airline as a code share partner. The Google Flights was showing the total fare to be even lower than the original itinerary, but upon numerous tries, every LAZY agent told me that it would cost me-wait for it-$4000 more to book that itinerary! I will avoid this airline. Now to the Business Class cabin and service. The lounge was nice but mediocre. Bar staff were arrogant. Boarding was chaotic they had two doors open on the aircraft but were only boarding EVERY class passenger together through one door! When asked from FA, he said the first door was for catering supplies even though there was no such sign for any catering supply! The only positive was the BC cabin. It was a new aiplane and the seats and surroundings were large and comfortable. I will NOT fly this airline.

### “total lack of professionalism”
Not Verified | Rome, 16th September 2022: boarding time was at 15:30 and departure was supposed to be at 16:05. We stood in the boarding corridor and every 15 minutes we were told that the boarding pass control was imminent. Two hours standing up and at the end we were told that the crew had difficulties to reach the airport. We arrived in Zürich when it was already night. Snack: a micro bag of peanuts (the alternative was a single biscuit) and a fake fruit juice (lots of water and preservatives: really disgusting!). But the most horrible thing was the total lack of professionalism and politeness, a lot of rudeness, antipathy, long face and incapacity of smiling of the stewardesses. Double standards in not returning a greeting to whom they were not considering important.

### "One month later, and no refund"
Not Verified | My flight was cancelled and the company did not give me a proper alternative so I was entitled to a refund. One month later, and no refund. The ticket was over USD 1500 and, yet, no refund. I tried to reach them, nobody answers the email, the telephone does not work. Really bad customer service.

### “staff gave us no concrete information”
As usual on ITA which can't get away from the bad history of its predecessor, flight was over 2 hours late. Not even a cup of water I was offered. On boarding gate members of staff gave us no concrete information. Tried ITA help desk at the airport after announced long delay and for ZERO surprise there was NO ONE at the desk. ITA is just dreadful in a whole.

### “they lost my brothers luggage”
Not Verified | The staff was nice enough but on our return flight they lost my brothers luggage, this piece had all his gifts and clothing he brought with him, on a once in a lifetime trip. We have called emailed and was told to wait the 65 days for review. No one has contacted him we also get a person in Albania who states they are aware? Aware but what are they doing. It seems to be an internal problem? We would love for anyone to call back to make restitution no one contacts my Brother or his wife. We are making several complaints to the Department of transportation. I will never fly this airline or recommend to any one.

### "lost my suitcase for 2 days"
They lost my suitcase for 2 days with all my belongings. They caused me expenses because I arrived in Italy on vacation and I had to buy toiletries, clothes, etc. They made me waste a lot of my vacation time and money. I have been demanding a refund of the money that belongs to me for 3 months and the airline does not respond to emails. The airline is a complete fraud. I also had a lot of problems with them at the airport.

### "not have vegetarian meals on board"
Very uncourteous staff for no reason at all. Does not have vegetarian meals on board. Please avoid it if possible. The reviews across the platforms reflect the same experience I had.

### "no one has responded to my emails"
They lost my bag and when you call their customer service line, they hang up on you. I was trying to fix my name in their system but it wouldn’t allow me to do so online, so I had to call where I was hung up on 5 times. I have sent emails asking for compensation and proof that my bag was delivered, but no one has responded to my emails in 3 months. Make sure to bring carry on only. They do not even deserve a 1 star review.

### "ITA will not refund anything"
Not Verified |  Do not fly this airline. If you have to make any changes to the ticket, or if you need to talk to customer services for any reason, please know that they transfer you to a handful of people in Albania. Nice enough people, but 100% incapable of helping you in any way. They "contact managers" and come back and say that nothing can be done. Then there is nothing you can do. I have never encountered worse customer service with any organization in my life. I booked a Business Class ticket ($3000), had to change the outbound date because of a medical emergency - I still wanted to fly their airline, so they changed the ticket and charged me $500. Then I received an email that the change was void, and my original ticket was back in place. I then had to purchase tickets on a different airline to get to and from Florence. ITA will not refund anything - not even the $500 they charged me for the change (that they then voided). I have spent at least 6 hours on the phone with ITA over this issue. They now have given me an email address to send the information to, but said that it will likely take weeks for anyone to get back to me, since there is a huge backlog. Wow!

### “such a run down plane”
Not Verified |  Shocked to see such a run down plane. With extremely poor cabin lighting. The food served was pathetic. Its perfectly fine to be proud of the national language, but with the majority of passengers being Indians, it makes sense to have a couple of cabin crew who can speak Hindi. There is an obvious language barrier resulting in frustration from both sides, although more from the cabin crew.

### “Absolutely appalling service”
My inbound flight has been delayed and moved to another airport and my outbound flight has been cancelled, ruining my business trip. I applied for a compensation from the company shortly after my trip in September 2023, and have been ignored by them since then. I haven't got a single reply to my numerous emails, and every time I speak to the company representatives on the phone, they say that nothing can be done to escalate my request and I should wait for a reply. Absolutely appalling service.

### "they did not allow me to cancel"
Not Verified |  Do not be a fool and fall for the ITA upgrade offers. Unfortunately, I made an offer, which was accepted. About 3 days before the scheduled flight I decided to cancel my upgrade, since I had been explicitly told that the airline allows cancellations up until 24 hours before the flight. But they did not allow me to cancel. I called 3 times, always connected with someone in Albania who simply said the upgrade could not be cancelled; they steadfastly refused to cancel it despite my willingness to offer proof that the policy was "up to 24 hours prior" the flight. I also emailed ITA and provided proof of the message I had received when I first upgraded. They refused to cancel it. This mistake cost me an unnecessary 1,200 dollars. I feel swindled by ITA and will never fly with them again. The food was subpar, the entertainment system was the same as coach, and mine was not working properly.

### "the flight was perfect"
I want to thank Riccardo and the people at the counter for helping me, my husband and my baby. We arrived very late, but Riccardo (at the phone with the gate) assisted us, smiling, very quickly but without pressure. The system gave us very distant seats, but at the boarding we found an entire row for all three of us, so the flight was perfect. I was terrified to do the entire trip alone with my 6 months daughter.

### “professional cabin crews”
Not Verified |  ITA Airways offers good quality for affordable prices. Brand new aircrafts, on time flights, excellent lounge (Hangar with superb coffee) at FCO, professional cabin crews and enough food in Business Class. Did 6 flights with them in the past months and all were on time. From ZRH to FCO I definitely prefer AZ over LX.

### "Thanks to Geanina and Joanna"
Not Verified |   ITA Airways saved my trip from becoming a disaster due to a delayed connecting flight with another airline. Thanks to Geanina and Janna in Miami for helping me find a solution. Best airline I have ever flown with, thank you ITA Airways for doing everything possible to resolve my issue by going above and beyond.

### "attendants were very unfriendly"
Terrible airline from start to finish, please go elsewhere. The only good thing I can say is that the flight left and arrived on time, everything else was awful. The airline operates like a low cost budget airline. The baggage policy is insane. They don't allow any free checked luggage unlike most other international flagship carriers. You're limited to a personal item and a carryon under 8 kgs which is 17.6 pounds. It's extremely difficult to pack that light especially considering taking into account the weight of a rolling suitcase. My friend was charged $140 because his bag was 9 kgs. The desk agent adamantly refused to let him repack his bag and put things in his personal item. The planes were dirty and gross, the seat cushions were falling off the seats. The flight attendants were very unfriendly and disappeared the minute after the meal service concluded for the rest of the flight. Also, there website is terrible and hard to navigate. Wouldn't fly them again unless it was insanely cheap or I had no other option. RUN.

### ITA Airways customer review
Not Verified |  Marco at check in was great and patient. He was very nice to my family and children. Spoke very well in English. Boarding the flight was fast and easy. Great process with children.

### "Like the Good Old Times"
Flying with ITA Airlines from Miami to Rome, we were fortunate to be greeted by Marco, who provided excellent customer service—attentive, courteous, and efficient. Working with him was a quick and easy experience. Like the Good Old Times! !

### "Staff is so kind and fast"
Not Verified |  Perfect service from ITA Airways staff. In particular to Marco her service was truly appreciated. Staff is so kind and fast. I was very secure since the very beginning.

### "I would much prefer to have my bag back"
I would not recommend anyone take this airline especially if you are checking a bag. Myself, my fiancé and our best friend were taking the ITA Airway flight from Rome to Turin. We did everything we were supposed to and checked our bags. Well needless to say that my bag with everything in it, all of my favourite clothes, shoes, makeup, and a South African Rugby World Cup Rugby jersey that can not be replaced did not make it to Turin. I took all the steps that were needed to try and get my bag back but of course emailing them is a lost cause, all they do is email you back with a case number and you don't hear anything after that. It has been over two months and I have not received anything from them, nothing not even a sorry. Of course, I would much prefer to have my bag back but it does not look like that is going to happen so I would like to be compensated for my bag with everything in it.

### "Don't fly with them"
ITA scammed me and my family out of 5 business class seats from Miami to Rome totaling over $19,000. There was an air traffic control strike the day we were set to arrive and we had to fly earlier but they had no availability. We flew another airline and figured we would just use the credit next summer for our vacation only to find out afterwards that they only allow rebooking within 12 months of booking not flight date as we were told. Don't fly with them.

### "It was an awful experience"
We flew ITA #631 on October 6 and ITA #630 on October 19 in premium economy. The lack of customer service by the flight attendants on both flights was shocking but even more so on the daytime flight from Rome to Miami #630 on October 19. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and then once we boarded, we sat for an hour with no announcement from either the head purser nor the captain until people complained. Once in the air we were immediately told to lower all the window shades for the entire flight of 11.5 hours during the day. Once the dinner was served the flight attendants disappeared never once coming through the premium economy section to offer something more nor to pick up garbage. The Flight attendants were unfriendly, rude and went out of their way to do as little as possible. It was an awful experience and as much as I love Italy it was a great disservice to the Italian people that their national airline treats people paying good money so disdainfully. I will return to Italy shortly but will never fly ITA again but will choose the other airlines flying the route even though I will have to stop and change flights.

### "no refund and no compensation"
My flight got cancelled less than 24 hours before departure. I had a course to attend, and suddenly found myself needing to book an alternative flight in a hurry for the next day. I had to take a 4 hour train ride because of this. I had paid an additional amount to select my seats as well. As I was already going to take a train from Ancona to catch my first flight in Bologna the next morning, I couldn't get on the alternative flight they offered at 7 am the next morning. I opted for a refund. The lady on the phone then refused to refund the extra money for the seats I booked, as "they had offered me an alternative booking which I refused". I refused the alternative because it was physically impossible for me to reach this alternative booking, due to their lack of notice in time. The refund for the ticket itself was supposed to take one month. We are now more than a month later, and I have received no refund and no compensation. This is an airline that thieves your money and refuses to pay you back. Customer service emails go unanswered. Do not waste your time with this airline. Fly a trusted airline like Ryanair or easyJet instead. Even if they aren't great.

### "ITA is very basic"
Not Verified |  In order to fly ITA you must first relinquish all knowledge and control regarding previous flights, customer service and working websites. ITA is very basic. You'll buy your ticket, get a receipt like you might for a croissant, and show up at the airport for your flight. There is no reminder or online check-in. For the most part, the website doesn't work. I actually wondered if I'd been scammed and called to confirm I had a scheduled flight. I was transferred to a call center in Albania and it was confirmed that I just show up to the airport. I purchased the flexible flight so I could switch my times and dates if need be. There is no point in doing this since the website is unusable. You really have to be ready for nothing to go wrong. The flight itself was great. I showed up. There was no line. The plane wasn't full. I had an aisle to myself. The food was barely edible, but who flies for the food? I slept. It was direct. There were about 16 movie options so download some. The service was nice if minimal. We left on time and landed on time. No troubles with baggage. But should you need to do any kind of communicating or changing of flights...good luck.

### "Flight cancelled less than 24 hours before departure"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled less than 24 hours before departure. I immediately follow their instruction to get the compensation (as defined in the Europena Commission ruling Reg. CE261/04) and in 5 weeks they didn't even reply. Talking to the call centre was useless as they ask you to write to the same address that I wrote to and "wait for an answer".

### "forced to pay $140 for each bag"
Not Verified |  The airline also claimed to have had no record of the fact that I paid for checked bags when I originally made my reservation. I actually made reservations for three passengers on the same reservation and for two they claimed no checked bags were purchased. This was mysterious to me. It didn’t make any sense that they could see one checked bag for one passenger, but not the other two. I was told that possibly it was a computer glitch. I didn’t have my itemized receipt with me and actually questioned whether or not I made the reservation correctly. As a result, I was forced to pay $140 for each bag which is the fee for same day checked bag service. It was either pay the $280 or leave bags in Boston while I flew to Rome. Once I was able to research, I obtained the itemized receipts which clearly showed I paid $70 (this was the fee when making the reservation in advance) for each checked bag. I submitted a complaint on September 7 and as of October 28, I have received no response despite multiple follow ups. The customer service team claims there is no possible way to contact the complaints department directly. Avoid this airline.

### "responsible for monitoring the flight status"
Not Verified |  We were issued boarding passes. We did not know that we were responsible for monitoring the flight status board. We were informed that our flight involved getting on a bus to be dropped off at the aircraft. There were 4 gates in the entire airport we could have gone. If they would have informed us of this, things would have gone without incident. We waited in the large seating area with a baby Grand piano. We waited and waited. They called our names on the PA, but their English was broken. 30 minutes before our flight, we looked at the board. Our plane was finished boarding 5 minutes before we arrived. The agents stated our flight was gone and that we needed to buy new tickets. They wanted another $700 for a flight leaving the next morning to Zurich. Never again. Do not fly or book with ITA.

### "I don't recommend them"
Not Verified |  I flew my family roundtrip from Miami to Rome on ITA airline a couple of weeks ago and cannot fully express just how poor the experience was. The planes, both to and from Rome, were absolutely filthy, The seats were stained, dirty, worn, and broken. The cushions are so worn it was like sitting on a concrete bench for 10 hours. Seat cushions were separated from their backing, curtains separating business class were hanging only by a few eyelets, again shockingly dirty and stained. The food was of such poor quality we chose not to eat it. The deciding factor was the salami slices with cheese cubes that were visibly old (not aged) as if left in a hot environment for a day. I attempted to watch a movie on the entertainment center but the sound quality was so poor the dialog was unintelligible, this occurred on both flights and with all four members of my family. The only time I was a flight attendant was during the meal service or when they passed out cups of water. When you land in Rome, you exit the plane onto the tarmac in a corner of the airport, Shuttles commute to the terminal. Some folks had difficultly climbing down the steps with their carry-ons and of course there was a mad rush to be first on the shuttle. Half my party was schedule to fly home after a week, ITA notified us of an hour and a half delay a couple of days in advance. However my party was still going through security in Boston as their connecting flight (booked as a single ticket through ITA) left without them. I called ITA but they were of no assistance saying they weren't responsible and pointing the finger at their partner (Delta) and Delta pointed their finger at ITA. Meanwhile, I (still in Rome) had to scramble to find a hotel ($440 for a comfort Inn near Logan) for the night, without luggage, so they could be put on a flight the next morning, all the while concerned about them being in a strange city without me. The only reason I chose ITA was their direct flight from Miami. In hindsight, I would look for another airline and happily wait through a layover. This was my first and last experience with ITA. I don't recommend them.

### "they have still not responded to my complaint"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this airline. My flight booked for August 2023 was cancelled by ITA in April. Their offer was to reschedule me to an earlier flight which I could not make. I requested a refund and was told in May that I would receive a refund in 30 days. When no refund arrived, I telephoned again and was told that refunds are issued in 30-90 days. After more than 90 days, with still no refund, I telephone again and an Albanian call centre claimed the refund was approved on May 12 and I was told to make an email complaint. I sent copies of documentation and ITA issued a complaint number. After four weeks since my submission, they have still not responded to my complaint. From a previous review, this would seem to be a common practice by ITA to cancel flights and keep the money. Do not book this airline.

### "my daughters seat was broken"
Not Verified |   By far this was the worst and most costly airline I have ever flown. Before boarding we were told that my daughters seat was broken (in business class), and that they were attempting to repair it. We were also told that she would receive a refund for any inconvenience she experience. We boarded the plane to find the sit fixed in an upright position, with the attendants seemingly not aware there was an issue. When one of the male attendants attempted to adjust the seat, he could not, and so he called another attendant. They manually had to put the seat in position for take off, and again we were told that my daughter would receive a refund due to the inconvenience she experienced. Once we were in the air, she was unable to put her seat in a recline position, and they again had to manually position it, each time she was out of her seat she was not secured in her seat belt, and so her safety was at risk. Since this was an overnight flight, the business class seat should have reclined to a bed, and of course it did not, again it took the attendants several minutes to manually put it in recline, again she was out of her seat belt. In the morning after being awakened, the seat again would not go to upright position, necessitating a 30 minute wait for this to be corrected, and my daughter sitting on a reclining seat without the seatbelt on. These problems in addition to a staff that clearly was unhappy and who therefore provide minimal service, none with a smile or customer service attitude, cold food, thrust in front of us, and no extra amenities offered to ensure our comfort. Her seat cost $2,000. The safety issues cause by her not being belted, the poor attitude of the staff, the amenities, or lack of them and now three weeks later the failure by ITA to respond to our request for the refund we were promised, demonstrates why this company is doing so poorly, and why one experienced most would never use them again.

### "very nice way to start our vacation"
Not Verified |  I cannot pass the opportunity to thank one of your employees. We were greeted at the Miami ITA ticket counter by Carolina. She had a big smile, and was professional and friendly. She made our experience there very pleasant. This was our first time encountering someone so positive and wonderful at an airport. She took the time to give us tips on what to do on Rome and know a little about all the members of our party. A very nice way to start our vacation.

### "Absolute rip-off"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled the night before departure with a supposed replacement the following day. Would have lost my transfers / accomodation / connections as a result. Had to book on another airline Air France - excellent, and tried to contact ITA to refund as they cancelled the flight. Have had no reply from them for a month and have a completely head in the sand tactic to avoid reimbursing for a service they didn't supply. Honestly, avoid this airline and save yourself a lot of frustration. Absolute rip-off

### "rude hostesses"
Toilets on board out of order, rude hostesses, call centre not responding, dirty seats and the icing on the cake, by "vegan meal" in 2023 in Italy they mean a micro sandwich with a lettuce leaf. A shame! On my flight there were several tourists with this shameful meal.

### "Never flying ITA airways again"
Never again. They cancelled my flight without notifying me, and stuffed everyone into one plane. The whole operation is worthless and demeaning. Never flying ITA airways again.

### "worst airline I have used"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I have used. The flight was late which is usually understandable for various reasons however, this is just poor organization and coordination. Because we were late we missed our connections. And are now delayed two days because ITA rebooked on another ITA flight which was also late. The planes are awful - they get a 1 or less rating. The customer service at the gates, on the planes and in ticketing were awesome - these people will likely look for other jobs because they have to put up with to much because of poor management.

### "My luggage never showed up"
I took a quick flight from Palermo to Milan. I paid for checked luggage. My luggage unfortunately didn’t make it to Milan. I told the ITA representative at the airport I was flying home in the morning back to America. My luggage never showed up. I was given a PIR form. I emailed several times and have only been given case numbers but not one representative has actual follows up with me. It was been 21 days now. I've also called the numbers on the PIR form and from Italy website. I get “keep emailing.” “We don’t deal with that but can’t tell you who does.” Now the airline is ghosted me. I feel like an ITA stole my suitcase and isn’t taking responsibility when I paid to have it checked. Iv spent hundreds of dollars trying to replace things that were in there

### "almost a month now and still no response"
I arrived to JFK August 23 from Rome and didn’t find one of my luggages, and I have so many important things in this luggage. I reported this right way and it’s been almost a month now and still no response. I email them every day and still no response.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever! I purchased two tickets from JFK to Rome. The tickets included two checked-in bags. When I got to the airport all of a sudden two checked bags were not included. The ITA staff at JFK are so rude, it is unbelievable. I called ITA customer service so many times and was told there is nothing to do, you cannot speak to anyone, and it doesn't matter what you say I have to deal with it! I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life. To be told to deal with it. I will never fly ITA again and be sure to spread the word.

### "arrived to the door 10 minutes before departure"
I have flown quite a bit and I have never had such horrible experience. We arrived to the door 10 minutes before departure and they refused to do anything to help although the flight was visibly there. I tried to explain that gates had changed last minute so upon notice I ran to the right gate next to where we had been waiting. The attendants were extremely rude. I genuinely wish I’d gotten their names. They refused any help at all and called the police on us when we were trying to get answers as to why this police is so strict unnecessarily. I had to book another flight AND a return flight because the “no show” policy cancelled both flights. I tried to call on the phone, and talk in-person and they brushed me off and didn’t take it upon themselves to resolve the issues in any way. When trying to book another flight they completely threatened to call the police again because we were demanding to speak to a supervisor urgently! One of the ladies in the front desk on the ITA Airways in Rome did this. She said “If you need the police here again, I will call them”. I felt horrible to say the least. I will never fly with them again.

### “communication was extremely poor”
When Lufthansa was flying with no problem, ITA Airways cancelled all the flights due to wet weather. Instead of going home on Friday and passing weekend with family me and my colleagues will sit in Frankfurt hotel and work until 3pm. Nice... Needless to say that communication from ITA Airways was extremely poor. An SMS they sent was saying that our flight was delayed until - they really sent an SMS with gaps where the expected time shall be. Avoid at all costs, because even if you save on your flight you pay much more with your time and side expenses, like taxis, car parking, etc..

### "Avoid at all costs"
Our overnight flight from USA on United Airlines was delayed. We were at ITA check in counter at 8:55am (with 6 other passengers) and they did not allow us to board the 9:20am flight. I was informed that we were considered a 'no-show' for this flight when we were in fact there. When I tried to check in for the return flight, I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled and 'someone' would call me back with information on a new rate I had to pay. I was never informed that my return ticket had been cancelled, in fact, I continued to get emails encouraging me to make an offer to upgrade. Nobody called me and I was forced to find a different way to get back to Rome for my international flight. I had to pay for hotel stays and other travel arrangements because of this company's incompetence. Avoid at all costs.

### "highly recommend this airline"
Not Verified | Our flight was on time, our luggage arrived immediately, the cabin was clean, the crew professional and accommodating. It was the largest of the Airbus planes. I read all the poor reviews and hesitated to take this airline but it couldn't have gone more smoothly. I highly recommend this airline, and will use them again. Grazie.

### "met my expectations"
ITA Airways met my expectations". I traveled from Milan LIN to Paris CDG and vice versa on board an A319. Really efficient service, both flights were on time. Cabin and ground staff are friendly and attentive to customer needs.

### "There is not enough legroom"
Not Verified |  There is not enough legroom for a guy which is 172cm. The plane is dirty and the crew is very rude to me. Food and beverages are poor, and the flight was delayed with one hour.

### "Horrible experience"
Stay away from this airline, constant delays and cancellations. Horrible experience. Don’t book them and don’t even try to be nice to the flight attendants they will still treat you poorly. It was such a pain, one delay after another. My flight got canceled two times and delayed many times. Stay away customer service was awful very unhelpful and very rude.

### "most disappointing flight experience"
Not Verified |  This was my third time to Athens, and this was the most disappointing flight experience ever. First, the ITA flight from DC was delayed twice. Therefore, our connecting flight to Rome was missed. ITA then booked us on the last flight to Athens even though there was an earlier flight listed - I guess that flight was fully booked. We were in the airport for hours upon hours. During this long layover the ITA staff was not helpful or courteous. When we finally made it to Athens our luggage was delayed. We missed our driver who was booked to take us to our hotel because we were busy trying to locate our luggage. We then had to take a taxi into Athens and arrived at the hotel at 3:00 AM. We were told by ITA that the luggage would arrive the next day on the first flight from Rome. We took the bus to the airport, needless to say the bag was not there. The next morning, we had to catch the ferry to Mykonos without the luggage! Still staying positive we continued island hopping and having fun. We did not retrieve the luggage until the day before our return flight to the US even though ITA contacted us 5 days into our trip. We had no way of knowing that they had contacted us and certainly unable to get the luggage because of island hopping. Upon our arrival home I began the process of filing for lost baggage compensation. This has also been an intense experience! I have contacted ITA many times however, they have not been helpful or provided assistance. ITA has not proven itself to be supportive or helpful to their passengers. When I contact them at the e-mail addresses listed the response state that the message is undeliverable, also I am assigned a new case # every time I contact them. I have followed the procedure that ITA posted for delayed luggage but have not been successful. Please note, I will not be traveling with ITA! Y

### "Zero communication with customers"
Flight was cancelled, OK can happen, after that, chaos, no one of the company new what was going on. Zero communication with customers, tried to ask what I could do next and they try to end the conversation. Lost a 2 k flight because they couldn't reorganize themselves. Shocking company. Strongly to avoid

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. We had a 1 hr layover in Rome, but our first flight got delayed 30+ minutes. We ended up missing our connecting flight. The flight departed at 1:30 and we got to the gate at 1:30 We then got put on the next flight at 5:30. We boarded to the news of a 30 minute delay, and then while on the flight, they announced an extra 35 minute delay due to us having to wait for connecting passengers. Ridiculous!

### "Very unprofessional"
Not Verified |  The organization in the check in is awful. All the flights together not respecting the lines and the people waiting for more time Furthermore asking an information to staff about a email that said my flight was in late, she was rude. And, later other colleague attached me like I need to check my phone and screen and not bother them with all the info for other flights. Very unprofessional and she even speak well Italian. L organizzazione al check in era pessima. Tutti I voli erano misti e senza in ordine preciso, scavalcando chi aspettavo da piu tempo per Una mancata procedural diversa per ogni volo. Inoltre , chiedendo un informazione riguardo una email ricevuta che avvisava di un ritardo l hostess é stata a dir poco non gentile! Ed oltretutto, dopo la sua collega mi ha parlato contro sostemendo che dobbiamo controllare i computer e i telefoni senza disturbarli e chieder domande per altri voli. Non é stata affatto professionale e non parlava nemmeno bene Italiano.

### "ITA Airways is falling behind"
I used ITA Airways multiple times but after this summer never again. ITA is supposed to be competitive with pricing and offering a good service, maybe it was in the past but not anymore. Online platform is terrible, I got charged twice when trying to use my points. Customer support is not existent. Service on flight is the worst I ever had, even a Spirit domestic flight was better than ITA Airways on international route. Hostesses are very rude and they barely speak English, food is low quality and scarce. Restroom small and  dirty. Seats are uncomfortable and small, compared to competitors aircraft. There in no doubt ITA Airways is falling behind.

### do not recommend this airline""
Not Verified | My company book a flight with this airline twice, their aircraft is old. I was on the trip going Rome to Bari, and the staff is not really accommodating and not a professional. Especially the ground staff, I do not recommend this airline, even they sell cheap flights still important to think about comfort of your travel.

### "book any other decent airline"
Don't book flights from London City Airport with this airline, both my inbound and outbound flights were cancelled on very short notice, with absolutely no helpful or informative communication of any kind. Airport staff shared that they are cancelled on a regular basis. If the fare/ticket prices charged had been at a 'budget' airline level then fine, you take your chances for a cheap price. This is not the case with this airline, but their service unfortunately is at the cheap budget level - and their ticket prices are at a much higher level. So save your time, energy and patience - and book any other decent airline in the same price range who will deliver the commensurate service - as this airline cannot deliver even the base line professional service for the prices they charge.

### "I wouldn’t recommend ITA Airways"
I wouldn’t recommend ITA Airways. Food was really bad even after requesting special need for my son and mother. We had itinerary from BOM-DEL-FCO-SFO, First one with Vistara who charged for 2 extra bags and then DEL-FCO-SFO. Delhi ITA counter charged ridiculously high $240/bag for 2 bags for us while online said $100 for extra bag. I tried booking online 2 days back it was showing $100/extra bag but didn’t work, some error, so called ITA reservations number they said check at airport. We had one change for elder son early return, & we added 2 extra check in baggage, which caused lots of confusion, extra/double payments to Vistara & ITA. Also 1 bag left at Rome for both of us, came back next day as home delivery..

### "just lost a business class customer"
ITA Airways just lost a business class customer. I was comfortably sitting on my business class seat (A2) when, before the take off from Rome, a flight attendant came to see me with and asked me if I were so kind as to swap seats with said mum who wanted to be closer to her children (actually, preteens). Could I say "no"? Of course, I felt compelled to say yes (I wonder what terrible risks those kids are going to run in Business Class). Could the ITA Airways crew have told that lady to stay put and not inconvenience another passenger, since her children were going to be perfectly fine? Being a solo traveler does not mean that I belong to a lower category than mums with a whim for a better seat. The lady did not even say “thank you”  and the children excuse is really lame. In fact, the “kids”, apparently 10 and 12 y.o., were sitting at A3 and A4. The mum was sitting at A5. I was sitting at A2. Clearly, she just wanted a better seat. At mid-flight my new seat had mechanical and electrical failures. The crew had to operate it manually for the rest of the flight. Since they could not fix the problem. It appears ITA Airways needs to hire better engineers and technicians. After landing in Tokyo Haneda I went to the ITA Airways desk at the Departures floor to lodge a complain. The Japanese employee I talked to, Rika-san, was very kind and professional. Anyway, in the future I will fly with airlines which do not second the whims of a passenger at the expense of another and have fully efficient business class seats.

### "There are far better options available"
A Nightmare with ITA Airlines from delays to discomfort. My introduction to ITA Airlines was nothing short of a nightmare that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. From start to finish, my experience was a masterclass in frustration, discomfort, and outright incompetence. Let's begin with the first trip, which was delayed for an excruciating four hours. As if that weren't bad enough, the delays resulted in me missing my connecting flight. The ensuing chaos at the airport was like a scene from a disaster movie, with passengers scrambling to find information that the staff seemed utterly incapable of providing. Tickets were eventually issued a mind-boggling 17 hours later for a different flight, and any hopes of a smooth travel experience were rapidly diminishing. Fast forward to my return flight from Rome to JFK, and the misery continued. The plane that awaited me was a relic from another era, and it showed. The seating was unbelievably uncomfortable, as if the airline had decided that human comfort was an afterthought. The entertainment system, touted as a source of distraction, was a complete disaster. None of the screens worked, leaving passengers to stew in their discomfort with no distraction whatsoever. The navigation system was equally non-functional, leaving us in a state of cluelessness about our whereabouts throughout the flight. The pilot's lack of consideration for passenger comfort was painfully evident. The flight itself was a rollercoaster of turbulence, with every bump and jolt serving as a reminder of just how little the airline cared about our well-being. The landing was the icing on the cake – a horror show that felt like the plane was dropping from the sky like a rock. The lack of finesse and the rough impact left me gripping the armrests in fear for my safety. In conclusion, my experience with ITA Airlines was nothing short of a disaster from beginning to end. The delays, missed connections, uncomfortable seating, malfunctioning entertainment system, and the pilot's disregard for passenger comfort all combined to create a travel nightmare that I will not soon forget. If you value your sanity and well-being, I implore you to avoid Dala and ITA Airlines at all costs. There are far better options available that won't leave you traumatized and regretting your decision to ever step foot on one of their planes. In the end, my harrowing experience with ITA left me questioning how an airline representing a country with such a rich and prestigious food culture could possibly offer such substandard fare. It's baffling to think that an airline associated with a nation known for its culinary excellence could fall so spectacularly short in providing even a semblance of decent food to its passengers.

### "delayed for 1hrs 15 mins"
The flight was delayed for 1hrs 15 mins so I couldn't get the connection flight. I went to the ITA counter to reprotect my ticket, but they denied our request and told us to wait for about 2 hrs. Finally they denied our request and I took my ticket from myself for the next day. I asked them at least they can arrange accommodation for one night, they refused.

### "They lost our luggage"
They lost our luggage (5 out of 10), promised it will be delivered in two days at our hotel, then on the website it says four days,  now its six days and we have to take a taxi to go 20 min away in another village to have it. And its not over =! We have to spend half of our hol=idays without our clothes..=

### "Absolutely the worst airline"
Absolutely the worst airline. Within a week we have experienced 4 flight cancellations, deplaning after boarding due to technical reasons and endless wait times in airports for flights that do not take off. They ruined our trip to Italy.

### "caused us so much trouble"
When I wanted to check in they asked me if I had an ongoing or outward ticket for my final destination. I told them that I did not. I was traveling to Bali in Indonesia. They made me buy a ticket out of Bali. Wifi at the airport was slow and I almost lost my flight. Had the staff looked at my documents, which they did not although I handed them in, they would have seen that I did have an ongoing flight out of Vietnam. If they had done their job properly they would not caused us so much trouble and the extra expenses.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified | Worst customer service ever. Not only 2 hours delayed, it also comes with an attitude from staff. Waiting inside the airplane for hours then all you get is a cracker or biscuit, and recycled flat coca cola. You can clearly see the staff use previously opened bottle of coke and serve it for the thirsty customer. Flight is not cheap and all they spend for all customers is not even 20euros worth of juice and crackers. All you can hear is salty or sweet. This is not the end of the issue, our flight is a transit direction Tunisia. The second flight is also late but god knows how long this is going to be. At the moment while I'm writing this it is delayed by 1 hour and will see how long it will actually take at the end. Worst airline ever, highly not recommend!! Been using the same airlines every year since it use to be called Alitalia now they changed the logo and that is about it. Do no recommend. Pay more and take other competitive companies who actually try their best to accommodate. Do not travel with this company if you have kids. Very bad!

### "lack of customer service"
My flight from Rome to New York JFK International Airport was delayed for almost 3 hours in Rome which led to me missing my flight from New York JFK International Airport to Las Vegas International Airport. I went to speak with ITA Airways staff about the situation with many other people who have missed their flight as well. They wrote names on a piece of paper and my name was written on that paper and claim that the list of our names is sent to the hotel. Including the address of the hotel which is Hilton hotel and the directions on how to get there. Plus some of other customers who have missed their flight like me where provided a copy of the list of names. But I was not provided anything. By the time we reached to the hotel. The hotel staff informed me that, he does not see my name. So the others got their rooms and I was not. Than the staff suggested that, maybe the ITA Airways staff send my names to Hampton hotel close by Hilton hotel and said I should go there and check. I walked there and I was informed that, my names was not there and those who were got there rooms already. So I was stranded and helpless and it's shows that ITA Airways didn't care about my situation. Because, no help provided for me by ITA Airways and my flight from New York JFK International Airport to Las Vegas International Airport is going to be next day from July 26th, 2023 to July 27th, 2023. It's was my bad experience and that's not a good customer service for me to consider ITA Airways in the near future due to their lack of customer service.

### "name change not changed company culture"
Unfortunately the name change has not changed the company culture. My flight was scheduled from Athens to Florence and back, from 20 to 24 July. Firstly, leaving from Athens airport they give me my tickets in paper form at the boarding gate, supposedly an error, but this triggers a mechanism where it seems that I did not travel with my original boarding pass, canceling my return flight. I was never notified that my return flight ticket was canceled and neither the website indicated that. Upon talking to their support they finally realized that I was indeed in the flight and reversed my tickets, only to realize they mistakenly reversed my ticket from Rome to Athens in a wrong date, forcing me to spend the night in Fiumicino as there was no time to change the tickets again. The ticket counters in both in T1 and departures were overflown by passengers like me with only 1-2 women trying to support a queue of 20+ people.

### "communication with them has been non-existent"
The flight itself (FCO - SFO) and service was not bad but dealing with them about my 3 lost checked-in luggage has been a nightmare. It has now been 12 days since our luggage has been lost and our communication with them has been non-existent. Upon arrival, they did not have an agent to deal with lost luggage. We were provided an email to contact by their contracted luggage service with no luck. After multiple emails (6 to be exact) to the airline and the contractor, we stopped by the airport again to file a report at the counter (lucky there was someone there). So far, all email addresses that have been provided on the airline's website have been non-responsive. Their customer service number is answered in Albania and they will re-route you to the email addresses on their website. There are no supervisors available to talk to. I have filed a complaint with US DOT and Channel 7 News "7 on your side" and they have been very helpful. Again, if you don't check bags in, not a bad airline, otherwise, I'd stay away from them.

### "Worst airline I’ve ever experienced"
Worst airline I’ve ever experienced. Everything they do is so slow, from check in, to baggage drop, to boarding, to take off to disembarking and to baggage collection. The way they handle your luggage is disgusting. I had a brand new suit case that looked 10 years old after it was handled by ITA Airways. Before take off they dont walk around and tell people their seats must be up for take off, they don’t care. There is no mid flight refreshments. Even the baggage collection took 45min-1hour. Every other airline was getting their bags before us.

### "Worst customer service experience!"
Not Verified |  Worst Airline I ever used. Everything is very cheap. Worst customer service experience! They don't write ordinary bills, so don't use them in any case when flying for business! The customer service simply ignore you, when you have a problem. I have never experienced something similar before. Just terrible! Don`t support them and don't fly with them. Some airlines better don't use.

### "refusing to wave the fees on the luggage"
We bought a ticket from One Travel that includes a free 23 kg per ticket luggage for an international flight, it also says it on ITA. When we checked in they said that this is not the case even though it says so on both websites, luckily the man from delta realized the mistake and waved it, but for our return flight, they are refusing to wave the fees on the luggage and making us pay for something that we were told was free.

### "never fly with ITA Airways again"
A huge disaster. We bought a tickets with relatively comfortable connection of an hour and 45 minutes. The airline changed the time of the flight to 30 minutes later, so we were left with a connection of 40 minutes. My father who was flying with me is 85 years old. I called the airline in Italy saying that my father is 85 and asking to be changed to an earlier flight from Palermo or a later flight from Rome. Both flights exist, but the airline wanted to charge me for the change. They told me to try through Travelocity, the site through which we bought the tickets. Travelocity wrote an e-mail to the airline explaining the special circumstances, but the airline refused again. The day of the flight we explained the situation to the agent at the check in counter; she said the only thing she could do to help was give us both boarding passes and requested special assistance to be able to change flights faster. We asked to be placed in seats closer to the exit, she refused. She did not know the gate for the second flight. When we got to the plane, we told one of the flight assistants and she just said they would wait for us and the flight was on time. The flight was delayed 40 minutes: exactly the time we had for our connection. When we landed, the flight assistant asked for the people who had asked for special assistance to stay seated until everybody had disembarked. Of course, we could not wait. We ran to find out on a monitor our gate, because no one helped us, although we asked for help to several ITA employees. When we got to the gate no one was there; we thought it had left because I got to the door to check if it was closed. Suddenly, a very grumpy ITA employee did not ask if we needed help and just started to scream at us why we were at the door. I explained and she did not say that the flight was delayed, she just continued scolding. After a while she said the flight was delayed. Then she called us from the counter and asked why we had requested special assistance “because this assistance is only for people who cannot move”. I explained we asked for assistance to change flights faster because the connection was tight; not because we cannot move, and that we did not wait for it because it did not make sense that we had to hurry, but we had to wait until all passengers disembark. We will never fly with ITA Airways again. We travel a lot and I had never encounter such a disorganized airline. Actually, it is the first time I take te time to write a bad review of an airline. The worts.

### "delayed EVERY SINGLE DAY"
Please don't take this company. We made a Flight to Tokio - Rome and then Rome - Madrid. In the international fly, Tokio Rome, they starved us to death, and in 15 hours of flight offer us only 2 meals that can barely make a dinner for a child, and the staff was rude. In the Rome - Madrid fly, they assure you that you will take the flight but, but they dropped us in the international airport, and when we ask about or delayed flight, they said to us: "Run if you want to take it" and then we and other 30 passengers need to run all the way to to the other side of the terminal because the flight was going to fly away without us. Also, this flight, the Rome - Madrid flight, has a delayed EVERY SINGLE DAY, I make this timetable, every time it was supposed to fly at 21:25 UTC +1 08/07 - 22:02 09/07 - 23:06 10/07 - 22:03 11/07 - 22:46 12/07 - 23:01 13/07 - 00:22 14/07 - 23:50 15/07 - 23:53 16/07 - 22:54 17/07 - 22:10

### "restrooms were absolutely filthy"
Worst trip of my life. The airline has 0 organization. First, going to Tokyo was very uncomfortable. The seats are terrible. I understand we flight in economy, but we still paid quite a lot of money for a trip to be comfortable. In 13 hours of flight we were served food ONCE. Several hours later they gave us a snack that won't even satisfy a 2 years old. Then coming back from Tokyo was even worse. Again in 14 hours food was served twice, the quality even worse than before. The restrooms were absolutely filthy right starting the journey (which means they didn't clean them at all) And what made me write this review is not all the previous said but the fact that our flight was delayed by 1:20'. That means that we wouldn't make it to Rome before the next flight leaves. In Tokyo we were told that the flight will wait for us, and they did, but we had to run and rush through all the airport of FCO, a woman even fell down and had an injury, we had to go to a whole different terminal because ITA Airways couldn't think about leaving us closer or plan better the trip. We made it but at what cost. We even had to go through a security check (which is ridiculous, we are in a connecting flight). We had such a terrible time I'll be traumatized by this company for the rest of my life.

### "do not fly with them if you can avoid it"
Simply the worst customer experience. I booked weeks ago and chose seats for myself and my colleague. As a Volare Executive Member my seat choices are free but I had to pay for him to select seats. On both legs of our trip today, our seats were randomly changed with no explanation or regard for us being moved from window/aisle to center seats (one of us on each flight). The gate agents could not have cared less, or been more rude or dismissive, And this is how they treat their frequent fliers. It’s hard to tell if this Arline is actually this bad at customer service, or just generally this stupid. Either way, do not fly with them if you can avoid it. Any of the low cost airlines that operate inside Italy far exceed the experience with ITA.

### "we will certainly never fly ITA"
Was rebooked by Delta onto this ITA flight after a sudden cancellation, and a day of turmoil trying to reschedule our return home. Arrived at FCO hours in advance to allow for a sufficient buffer of time. The actual check in and baggage check was quite easy, although they did not open until 11 AM. Waiting at the gate, the boarding process was a chaotic mess, as if this was the staff's first time with such a procedure. I was pleasantly surprised that the premium economy seats had sufficient legroom, and reasonably comfortable. I did pay twice for the extra room, which will be disputed with Delta. The cabin seemed acceptably clean, although quite hot. The weakest links by far of this trip were the flight attendants, food, and deteriorating cleanliness of the bathroom facilities. The flight attendants were unnecessarily short, in some cases, downright rude, and condescending. Given a meal choice of chicken or pasta, evidently, I made the egregious error of asking (politely, in Italian, mind you), what type of chicken/accompanied by what. The flight attendants couldn’t be bothered by such a trivial question, preferring instead to make snide comments to one another, (“Chicken is chicken.” “It is Italian chicken.”), even going so far as to laugh rudely at my expense, casting a comment about Americans in Italian, which they thought would not be understood, but was. Completely unprofessional, and unnecessary. When doling out beverages, you would think they came from out of pocket. Half a paper Dixie cup of warm Diet Coke, and when asked for a refill of tepid tap water, you’d think I’d asked to borrow money. The food was absolutely terrible-bland, flavorless, stale bread, etc. Several steps down from cafeteria fare. The bathrooms sank into squalor over the duration of the flight, to the point where passengers from the premium and economy classes did their best to make it past the gauntlet of hostile flight attendants to use the business class facilities. This was the only time you saw a flight attendant. For six solid hours, no refreshments were given out. On one rare sighting, my wife asked an attendant if she could please have a Diet Coke; she was dehydrated. Of course, the reply was, “No.” Simply appalling. Trying to deboard the plane, passengers were blocked by someone attempting to restock the flight kitchen. Based on this experience, we will certainly never fly ITA. They cast a negative impression on the very welcoming and caring people of Italy.

### "Worst Airline for travel"
Worst Airline for travel in my experience. I booked my ticket way in advance for my engagement and on the day I'm at the airport and only to find out they don't start working until 12 midday. Then there was an issue with my flight which I still don't know what the issue was and my flight was delayed. I told them I have a connecting flight and was planning my engagement where friends were waiting on me. They couldn't guarantee me my flight for that time so I had to cancel the engagement. They are now telling me that I'm not eligible for reimbursement.

### "Awful experience"
Not Verified | Awful experience, don’t recommend this airline. Firstly we’ve been told at check in desk that there is no sits available due to overbooking, but as a result we got the seats for our flight. Then air company forced me to check in my luggage, what I didn’t want to do as I bought the tickets only with hand luggage to leave the airport quickly. The maximum stressful morning, If you want to enjoy your trip, chose another company

### "flight started as a horror show"
I was forced on this flight after American Airways canceled my original one and stuck with them. The flight started as a horror show. 2 and half hours on a plane with little air conditioning while they fixed a technical issue. Communication in English was terrible. They'd rattle off a couple minutes worth of sentences in Italian and then in English give us a couple words(usually lies) and hope for the best. The food was really gross. All the drinks were extremely scarce. When we landed after a 12 hour flight, we were told to wait 5 minutes for the gate to open. It took more like 45 minutes. They had a rule where landing and take off needed all windows open? Unfriendly attendants. One especially was blocking an aisle and actually making everything worse when trying to board. Missed my connecting flight because of delays and got stranded because of them.

### "flights were a chaotic affair"
I'll start with only positive: Airplane from Rome to San Francisco was clean and comfortable. Cons: 1. From New Delhi to Rome, the aircraft was clean but old and the entertainment system was terrible. seats were just OK. 2. Food was terrible. the worst I've ever had on any international flights and I've flown many, food served in these flights was tasteless and inadequate. 3. Lost baggage: me and several co passengers has missing baggage and I am still waiting to hear from airline. 4. both my flights were delayed. 5. Boarding process was completely missing and boarding on both the flights were a chaotic affair.

### "We have had no assistance at all"
Not Verified |  NCL booked the flights for a cruise. Arriving in Paris we had missed our connecting flight because of delays in Houston. We needed to get to Rome and so Air France put us on ITA which left late and we could not make the ship in Italy even with all the effort. Arriving in Rome, Luggage and my Aunts electric scooter was lost. Yes - we filed a claim for missing luggage and scooter. This was on July 5, now 3 days later no response. We had to stay 2 nights in Rome paying for a hotel, pay for a flights to Athens to meet the Norwegian ship. Spent 1 night in a hotel, which we paid for and meeting the ship in the morning. I have made many calls and my travel agent, working from the U.S. has called and sent many emails to many departments. Very early in the morning (before the lost baggage office opened in Rome - FCO) I was told by ITA bags were there, but I could not be helped and the flight left before I could get my luggage. Still trying to get our luggage and my Aunt's electric scooter which we were made to check with luggage and not at the gate. We have had no assistance at all and was told by the airport personnel in Athens that ITA lost baggage department does not answer the phones, which myself and my travel agent can verify. They are not good at replying to emails either. Everyone was Rude and offered no help, not even for my Aunts electric scooter which she needs to get around. Recommendation ... Stay away from this airline, pay a little more and keep your luggage.

### "My bag never made it"
Not Verified |  Flew from Palermo to Munich, connecting through Rome. My bag never made it, although my husbands bag and daughters travel cot arrived. Was told to contact Aerogate, not ITA, to lodge the missing bag claim. Along with 4 - 5 others on my flight. 24 - 48 hours passed, no contact from ITA, rang them and they referred me to world tracer link. Which had zero updates on information on the location of my bag. I was told to wait another 24 hours, it's likely they would update it. 4 days later, I leave Munich for Australia. No bag, no word from ITA, no update. When I ring from Australia, after 8 days of missing my bag, they say again, check the World Tracer link. When I explain it's been a week, they tell me to email them about my missing suitcase. I don't understand why no one from ITA will talk to me, and give me some information on the process. So far, it's been nothing. I've sadly had to lodge with my insurer, as ITA have given me no response. and Nothing meaningful in regards to my bag and where it is.

### "Worst airline I’ve flown with"
Worst airline I’ve flown with. Arrived at airport nice and early. Got to the gate on time only to be told that they have overbooked the flight and we got denied boarding. They did get us another flight two hours later but we had to go via two stop offs. Arrived at destination 12 hours late. Airline only wanted to give me £500 in compensation. I declined and said I want compensation for a days holiday missed and a days rental for accommodation. They declined. They don’t care about you as a customer or person. They are just in it for the money

### "service on board is okay"
Rome - Tokyo. The journey was a little less than expected (12h and 10 min). The food on board was decent. The toilet was clean although only 1 out of 2 (where I was seated) worked. The service on board is okay. The hostesses are very nice, but I noticed that (at least in my case) they don't go above and beyond to help you, if you ask for something, they don't give a 100%. A major criticism goes to the website: awful, I don't find it functional at all. I wasn't able to reserve seats until check-in and I never knew why. So in order to buy them I had to wait for the online check-in - obviously at that point the choices were few and I had to pay the most expensive of the economy seat (49 euros). The luggage all arrived at their destination. We had an economy fare which allowed us to bring 2 checked bags of 23kg. Attention: for breakfast they will give you, among other things, a ham sandwich if I'm not mistaken, if you don't eat it on board, don't bring it with you.

### "Appalling customer service"
Appalling customer service! I arrived at the airport and when I tried to check-in for this Royal Jordanian Airlines flight I was told that they had cancelled my ticket and re-issued it for a day earlier! They did not communicate this change to me. ITA ground staff were unfriendly and unapologetic. I managed to get on a flight departing at a similar time but with one stop rather than direct. Wrote to ITA Customer Service / Complaints but yet to receive a response.

### "Overall horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. Will never fly this airline again. Plane seats were extremely small. I pulled a muscle attempting to get out of aisle seat to use the dirty bathroom. No toilet paper. Seats were taped together. Armrest was also taped and seat in front of me was also taped together with silver tape. Which meant to me that it was an older aircraft. Attendants were rude and never saw them again after going by to pick up garbage one time. We originally paid for early pick of seats, then got back of plane seats which would not be changed. Overall horrible experience.

### "delayed for two hours"
Don't fly with ITA. The staff is rude and disrespectful. My flight was delayed for two hours without any communication. Its the worst flight on my entire life

### "Stay away from this airline"
Not Verified | We flew from JFK to Rome. I have NEVER had a worse flight in my 60 years of life, including those with babies and toddlers. When we got to JFK, we were told that our flight had been cancelled (and changed for 10 minutes) without ANY communication whatsoever. We were informed that we no longer had seats. We finally got on a flight. After having previously paid for seat selection, we were seated in the last seats of the aircraft. There was ZIP ZERO legroom and seats did not recline. My husband's ears were ringing after 8 plus hours of sitting near the engine and I had sciatica for days afterwards which is typically not a problem. Staff was rude. Water was provided in dixie cup sizes and attendants appeared irritated when customers requested drinks. We had to file a complaint after arriving home to receive the money back that we had spent for seat selection. No ITA EVER again. Stay away from this airline.

### "not recommend ITA Airways"
During my flight to New York, ITA Airways damaged my luggage. Once in New York, we see the luggage and open a ticket with people from the company, hoping to be refund for the damage received. No one tells me that I have to open a ticket through mail within a week from the event in order for me to be possible to receive a refund. most definitely would not recommend ITA Airways. It is not a good company to fly with, their website almost always doesn't work and it is never clear what you have to do before, during and after your flight.

### "worse service compared to lowcost airlines"
Uncomfortable seat with a reduced leg room, delayed flight, unfriendly ground and onboard crew, reduced inflight beverages. Slightly worse service compared to lowcost airlines.

### "flight was delayed 2 hours"
Horrible boarding drill. The flight was delayed 2 hours, and nobody cared to keep the passengers posted. Not even the gate's monitor was updated! We all stood in line for more than 1 hour without knowing what was happening. I'd expect to be communicated why there is a delay and when the boarding process will start. Communication is not an accessory. When they started boarding, the process was terribly slow. Once boarded, we learned that the airplane (back from the previous route) was late. Still to determine why and who would be held accountable. Food was not acceptable. I cannot understand why getting a decent meal onboard is so hard. The procedure to hook up to the internet was lengthy and muddled. The onboard service was just adequate.

### "integrity and customer service means nothing"
I forgot my duty free as I disembarked flight AZ247 from London to Milan in over head storage over seat 14F. When to lost and found at the arrival hall and after a few enquiries by the staff, l was told that the duty free bag has been found. It contained a bottle of martini wine and another bottle of Baileys. I was advised that some we meet us at our onward flight gate to Naples to hand it over to me After waiting for nearly an hour and my flight was now boarding, the lost of found staff appeared and told us that she’s not been handed the duty free item and it now could not be found. My guess is that someone has decided to take an item that doesn’t belong to them, an item sealed with receipts. Please avoid ITA airways. It might be cheap, but integrity and customer service means nothing to them.

### "most appalling customer service"
Appalling from the time we booked are seats. We paid extra for seats with additional leg room and specific seats numbers - we did not get due to a change of aircraft … the oldest aircraft I have ever seen. Spoke with customer service before the flight and was told to speak to the person on the check-in desk in regards to a seat change to honour the extra money we had paid. The check-in person was not able to help, but assured us that we would get a refund if we just sent a ITA Airways and email attaching or tickets. We have done this however to date after 30 emails ITA Airways will not honour the refund. The most appalling customer service I have ever received. The plant was very basic and looked like it should be retired. Never will I fly with them again!

### "a broken airline can get worse"
Unbelievable how a broken airline can get worse. Alitalia went bankrupt due well known reasons, ITA airways is the same rubbish with a different outfit. Like every state owned company one can only expect disappointment. If wasn't enough having my original flight cancelled and accommodated on a later flight, this flight was also delayed. Needless to say every ITA flight were either cancelled or delayed. Shame for Italy having its flag on a joke company like this.

### "Old and bulky seats"
What's the point of rebranding a decayed company if all old issues remain the same? Old and bulky seats I used to see on a 727. Charging premium fares and delivering low cost/poor quality services. Definitely going bankrupt again.

### "selfish and regressive"
This poor review is to be shared with their poor agency Trip.com but ITA Airways deserves this feedback due to their lack of customer support. We requested a refund for our flights as my partner was hospitalised and we were unable to make the trip to Europe at all. Naturally, I logged my flight cancellation case with Trip.com and after fulfilling a tall request of medical certificates and 10 days of waiting they told us that refunds due to medical reasons are not possible based on the airline's policy. Yet when I contacted ITA Airways they conveniently said the decision lies within Trip.com. When I confronted them, they both unempathetically rejected our cancellation request without legitimate reasons. ITA Airways closed my case without responding to my question on refunds policies - despite the official medical certificates issued, stamped, and signed by the public hospital and GPs, which they requested in the beginning. Trip.com also refused to waive the change fees and even when I decided to change the ticket, they did the most minimum effort to help with the details of my change, i.e. baggage, etc. Air Europa, Vueling, and even budget airlines assist me with at least a token of appreciation of my trust, some waived me fees, check my insurance, give me advice on how to get my money back and ITA Airways is not even a budget airline! It is Italy's national airline, the flag carrier of Italy as Wikipedia says but it fails to represent the great nation that international travellers are always eager to visit. Unbelievably selfish and regressive in today's business, leaving the future world nothing but literally ruins to see. Within the 19 days of our visit to Europe, I planned to spend 12 days in Italy. In my new itinerary, I plan to see Italy for 4 days.

### "the worst airline ever!
By far the worst airline ever. They changed both flights with more than 10 hours without informing us. The contact center was unfriendly and useless. They change your seat, after check in, even if you paid for it, from extra leg space to no extra leg space. Suddenly we didn’t sit next to each other. Paying for the seats was hell on itself, with a horrible site which errors all the time on the weirdest places. You can pay for ideal, but afterwards that’s suddenly not allowed. The return flight they changed my seat to again a space without extra leg space not next to my partner. I called 4 times about it. They said they will fix it but they didn’t. The leg space was horrible, I had pain in my legs the whole flight and we also were snatched at bu the cabin crew to put coat and small backpack under our seat. Even though there was no room for it and we had no trolleys. The airplanes were old, not clean and the staff on board and contact center were unfriendly. And we had one hour delay on both flights without any information. We thought we booked with a respectable airline.

### "cabin crew were not that helpful or engaging"
Not Verified |  I had to take this flight as an Emergency replacement flight, was expensive €504 one way Milan to London. The plane was basic, interior from 1970's, seat was uncomfortable and small. Ticket said Air Italia however the plane we boarded said German Airlines? I am 6ft 6 and had to be jammed against the window as suitcases were were put in extra seat, no effort was made to assist me despite asking and the cabin crew were not that helpful or engaging.

### "an overall terrible experience"
They are rude, boarded late, pushed late and gave an overall terrible experience. We have been waiting 2 hours for our bags now and keep telling us it will be another 10 minutes. I would never fly on them again.

### "Contact centre doesn’t care at all"
They changed our away and return flights without informing us, with more than ten hours. We had to contact them to change it to other times. The system to arrange your seats is horrible. Errors all the time, online check-in didn’t work for one of us, which even the contact centre isn’t able to solve. You're not allowed to pay for seats via iDeal, even that is optional on the ITA site. They change your seats all the time, the day before I checked, and suddenly it’s changed and my partner and I are not sitting next to each other even though we paid for our seats. Change is suddenly not possible anymore. On one of our return flight we had the same problem. The website gave errors. We contacted the airline three times. They promised they will arrange it and the didn’t. We flew away and return sitting apart from each other even that we paid for seats next to each other and with extra leg space. Contact centre doesn’t care at all. The worst experience ever with an airline in my life!

### "inconsiderate and sometimes, rude"
This was the first and the last time my husband and I flew with ITA. The only thank you goes to the captain and pilots for a smooth and safe flight. The rest of our experience was below lowest expectations. The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours and there was no information either on the timetable or at the gate. The crowd was just standing for all that time. The food was horrible, drinks ordered only once. The flight attendants (at least in Economy) treated people like dirt. They were inconsiderate and sometimes, rude. I had to clean filthy tables myself, etc., etc. Italy is our favorite country in the world, and it is a shame that ITA represents Italy so poorly.

### "the food was simply awful"
Domestic flight was ok, only slightly delayed. International flight from Rome to Buenos Aires was some 30 minutes late. Entertainment was working perfectly, but only one recent movie was available (the same of the flight I had taken more than 20 days earlier to Rome). Staff was nice and generally willing to help. However the food was simply awful. I travelled with my wife who asked the low-salt option, so we had the opportunity to taste two different menus. Both were very poor, clearly the worst we have ever tasted on a flight, which is even more surprising given the quality of food in Italy, the country that this airlines is supposed to represent. Wifi did not work.

### "service not even Economy level"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever! We booked through Delta Airlines (which is great) and had this partner thrust upon us. We paid for Business Class but the service provided was not even Economy level. We flew from LA to Rome and then back again. There were many flight attendants but once the meal was served and cleared away, all the flight attendants stood in the galley and weren't seen again until the next 'meal" (8 or 9 hours later). They never circulated through the cabin offering juice or water, let alone a snack. This happened on both flights. We've flown Business Class to Europe on other airlines and expected the service to be comparable to those other airlines. On the way home, we sat on the plane for over an hour past departure with no one offering an explanation or an apology. We had a connection in LA that we almost missed. The flight crew was totally unconcerned about anyone but themselves. The food was mostly inedible and they should be ashamed to call themselves Italian after the glob of dough with congealed cheese that they served as Pizza Margarita. I would rather walk to Europe than fly this airline again.

### "worst customer care"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever! Poor food, worst customer care. They lost our luggage and nobody is looking for it! It is been 5 days with no response already! A real nightmare! I strongly recommend do not fly with them!

### "impolite and incompetent"
Cabin crew was very impolite and incompetent. I was traveling for business in a two day trip from Athens to Palermo. Returning back they no space for my luggage and they force to give to them. I explain that I have my laptop inside along many papers and I wanted to work during the flight. They didn’t care, they force me to carry my laptop without protection (no extra bag) and when I ask for their names they threaten me that I will not allowed to enter and police will take care like being a criminal. If you can avoid ITA airways pls. Do so for your own good.

### "had my flight changed 5 times in a day"
Not Verified |  I've had my flight changed 5 times in a day, constantly extending the time of travel with a terrible service and with the company's representatives showing a lack of care with the customer and knowledge of the absolute impunity of overbooking, canceling and rearranging traveler to worse and worse conditions. This is by far the worse travelling experience I've had in my life. When are these companies going to be held accountable? No matter how much cheaper it may seem, ITA airways is not worth it.

### "Food was just terrible"
Not Verified |  Booked via Delta. Throughout the flight from Milan - JFK. Approximately 25 students socialized in the plane aisles and passengers asked flight attendants to ask them to be seated as they were partying throughout the flight. No one could sleep. I had noise cancelling headphones and still could hear them throughout the nine hour flight. Food was just terrible. Inedible. Waiting to grab food at JFK but we have been now delayed on runway over an hour. What is wrong with this airline and the staff.

### "Staff surly and uninterested"
Worst airline ever. Leg room so poor I could not sit without knees crushed into seat ahead - I am 173m tall. Staff surly and uninterested unless downright rude - shouting at clients. Never again

### "Staff professional, food mediocre"
To attend a wedding on Saturday December 17, 2022 my wife and I flew code-sharing Delta-ITA from PBI to MXP via JFK on Monday December 10, 2022. Delta was 30 minutes late arriving at JFK but the PBI Delta gate agent had advised us to just walk from Terminal 4 to Terminal 1, which we did in about 10 minutes. ITA had our reservation in their system but not our pre-entered documentation, which they entered again. I had paid extra for aisle seats 15H&J for a comfortable trip in the A330-200, which was full. The window seat next to my wife has a large entertainment box on the floor restricting seating. On the aircraft my screen jammed in Japanese but my wife's was fine. Staff professional, food mediocre, drinks steady and sufficient. Toilets exemplary. Upon arrival at MXP no luggage so we made our claim with an ITA agent there. Our Air Tags told us our luggage sat in Delta's JFK Terminal 4 for a few days, likewise at MXP. Anyway by Friday morning we did not have our formal clothes for a reception and a wedding. So we purchased the necessary toiletries and formalwear. Ironically my suitcase arrived later that day and my wife's on Sunday prior to our return. Total cost for the clothes and toiletries about $US1500 refunded to us by ITA after we sent the claim with receipts. For that they deserve 5 stars. The incident free return trip to MXP to PBI via JFK was in the same ITA aircraft to JFK half empty. Delta was late to PBI.

### "Extremely expensive and inflexible"
Extremely expensive and inflexible airline. I made an error in making my booking and rather than see it for what it was ITA took every opportunity to extract the maximum income out of me. They did this with relish (Ryanair would have been proud) showing no empathy or compassion or understanding whatsoever. An airline to be used at one's peril. If you book ITA book with them eyes wide open!

### "Zero customer service"
Zero customer service, zero respect, absolute rudeness. I am writing this MONTHS after - so it's facts talking, not in-the moment emotions. Crew made every effort to not notice that you are trying to get their attention - especially that I was in the window seat next to 2 people fast asleep (stuck). When making a simple gesture to get the attendant attention I was scolded and insulted by degrading me. I am a very polite and respectful person with a smile so go figure. Food was bearable, but disgrace considering how Italian food is the pride they take in it. I landed into Rome silently crying. NEVER AGAIN ITA! shame on you.

### "saying that it is not their business"
They canceled one of my flight connections to Vietnam, thus canceling my entire trip. They offered me a refund, I accepted, and four months later (after long waits and endless calls in which they assured me that the refund would arrive soon) not only have they not given it to me but they are saying that it is not their business. They're waiting for me to get tired and drop the subject, but that's not going to happen. I will take legal action if necessary. Me cancelaron una de las conexiones de mi vuelo a Vietnam, cancelándome así todo el viaje. Me propusieron un reembolso, acepté, y cuatro meses después (tras largas esperas e infinitas llamadas en las que me aseguraban que me llegaría pronto el reembolso) no solo no me lo han hecho sino que están diciendo que no es cosa suya. Están esperando que me canse y que deje el tema, pero eso no va a ocurrir. Tomaré medidas legales si es necesario.

### "Extremely disappointing"
BCN-FCO-VCE in business class. Extremely disappointing. ITA has no agreement with BCN to offer business class customers lounge access so one important perk gone, ITA in name is a SkyTeam member but you can't earn frequent flyer miles for other SkyTeam programs and you receive no alliance elite benefits so another perk gone. Aircraft are crazy old and in disrepair, seats terribly uncomfortable. On the FCO-VCE leg no difference in snack or meal than economy. So in the end what's the point? On the positive side both flights were punctual and the crews were professional. It's cheap for a reason.

### "Extremely disappointed"
One would expect an improvement in service but all that has changed is the name and for some airplanes the exterior color. Extremely disappointed by this so called new airline. Beside the lack of will to work by their staff (same old Alitalia staff ) and still using these worn out ugly Alitalia outfit toying changes to improv . Seats are old leather is worn and not comfortable. For their most loyal customers lounge visit in Rome airport is a real letdown, and surely not the experience I had while enjoying their lounge called casa Italia in Rome airport. Service is restricted and no self service. The only positive was my visits to the diamond lounge in Brussels airport. a real Belgian gourmet lounge. I will not fly this airline aain, I would rather fly low cost as I have last week with a direct flight to Belgium (Ryanair).

### "not a good experience"
My wife and I traveled from PMO to BOS and when arrived we got our luggages and noticed that two luggages were damaged. One luggage was missing the wheels and broken handle and the second luggage was severely damaged, cracked in a few places and all scotched taped around to hold it shut. We exited Customs and we went to file a claim on the damaged luggages. We were in line and we got pulled out of line and we were told that a Representative from ITA Airways is on her way please stand away from the line. We waited about 15 minutes and a representative came and gave us a business card looking piece of paper that had ITA AIRWAYS- damaged bags- and their email a US telephone number +1 877 793 1717 and Italy + 39 06 859 60020 and email: [email protected]. She specifically told us to call or email the number of the card and file your claim. We followed instructions as directed by the agent of Ita Airways. I send in all the flight information and a copy of our itinerary and lots of photos from the airport and photo from when we got home. Ita Airways sends us an email all apologetic and they are denying our claim because we didn't file a claim at the airport. ITA Representative told us to file vie]a email. I feel that we got scammed. ITA Airways is scamming their passengers by this method and not advising the to file the claim. We are very upset about this. We had to buy new luggage so we can continue our trip to Bahamas after spending the holidays with family in Boston. This will not end here. Its fine I spent over 250 dollars of luggage and this airline cannot accomodate passengers for the damage that they have caused. This is not a good experience with this airline. We will never use them again.

### "will not fly with them again"
During a recent trip (November 9, 2022) from Florence Italy to New York my luggage was damaged beyond repair. Upon clearing customs and retrieving my bag and noticing the damage immediately went to a claim kiosk to document the damage. I received a claim number and received information to contact ITA airways. I have since been in contact with ITA via email, and telephone several time trying to get compensated for my loss. To this date January 4, 2023 have not had this issue resolved after giving them all of the information (including pictures) they have requested. The only contact I have received are stock emails confirming my contact with them. I am very displeased and will not fly with them again if given a choice.

### "Very cramped seat pitch"
Both legs with aircraft still in Alitalia livery. Good safety procedures and good crew. Very cramped seat pitch, unacceptable also for one hour flight. Free light and hot drinks. They need a makeover, but all in all not so bad.

### "food was a good standard"
Not Verified |  A good Business class flight but for a 14 hour flight I only slept for 2-3 hours. The crew are not overly friendly but seem to be efficient and pleasant. Seemed eager to please but small talk minimal, don't expect the friendliness of Virgin for eg. The food was a good standard, with 1st & 2nd starter (pasta course) along with a main course although desserts disappointing. Dinner & breakfast served with snacks on offer such as a rustic pie There were a couple of points to note: 1. Window seats offer a lot of privacy but I sat in 8A which was missing a window 2. Seats are very hard leather with no mattress topping, I had to use a spare duvet to make is softer but still wasn't comfortable enough 3. Quite a bizarre layout with the Business toilets - you have to walk through the galley where the crew rest and prepare the food. Quite an awkward as they may be having a group chat and you feel like you're disturbing every time you use the loo!

### "extremely unpleasant experience"
Don’t fly this airline. From leaving my luggage on the tarmac during a downpour thus saturating the books inside to the lack of ticket transparency and flight delays this has been an extremely unpleasant experience. I should have flown Ryanair who despite their faults is transparent with ticket prices and has managed not to soak my luggage.

### "Pathetic experience"
This is my experience with ITA airways on which I flew today. I booked my tickets using ITA airways website which showed a connecting flight from New Delhi-Rome-Barcelona. The layover was 50 minutes and my flight from Delhi to Rome got delayed by 40 minutes. We landed at 8:40 AM There was no preference given for unboarding the flight for people whose connecting flight was just 20 minutes hence. The flight attendants could not care less. There was no one available outside the gate to help us guide for the immediate onboarding for the next flight. Had the ITA attendants been mindful of such urgency which was created due to delays by ITA airways, so many people would not have missed the flight. I was given the next flight which was 5 hours after my missed flight and all that was compensated was a snack meal coupon. No lounge services to rest after a 9 hour flight and a long delay in arrangement of the next flight. Pathetic experience. The staff is unconcerned about the customers.

### "overbooked, the money taken"
Not Verified | I WOULD GIVE IT A 0 but I cannot, so I give it a 1. Worst call center, we bought a plane ticket on flight that was overbooked, the money taken, the flight is still available on ITA airways website for other people to get scammed. Would never recon and to go by this company, you cannot contact anyone and cannot solve any issue with them.

### "horrible customer service experience"
Horrible experience so far. I had a flight at 8 am that was cancelled the same day at 00:30 am without any explanation. I asked now through several tickets, why it was cancelled but so far no answer. What a horrible customer service experience. This was my last time, 7 hours before the flight an unexplained cancellation is not acceptable. I have not seen any money so far too.

### "Worst airline in Europe?"
Flight AZ0074 from Rome to BCN. 14.11.2022. Worst airline in Europe? Maybe. They took cabin luggage from almost all non Italians and put them down in the carrier with the excuse that the airplane is full. Above that, all luggage were thrown from the entry level of the aircraft to the airport ground, this is the reason a lot of them appear broken. No respect. No dialog. Very sad that Alitalia ended up like this. Will never fly ITA again.

### "I’m very, very unimpressed with this company"
I’m very, very unimpressed with this company. Never in my life have I experienced such disrespect from a company. Let alone an airline. Be very careful with your decision if you are considering this company because if something goes wrong they have absolutely no respect for there passengers. Misplaced luggage seems to be an occurring problems I’m seeing others having as well as myself with this company. The funny thing is they don’t actually have a line to call for this kind of issue (misplaced/lost baggage). So you have no other choice but to email them where they will give you a case number. They will “search” for your suitcase for 45 days it has now been 90 days and I still don’t have a response. Please avoid this company if you don’t want to end up in this kind of situation.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Their ground staff in ATH inexplicably split our booking (1 adult 2 children) and on the return sectors could not do web check in, leaving one child on a separate booking. So no web check in possible. Phoned customer service (located in Albania) and they could not rectify. Ground staff in EZE could only give seats together for first leg, we had booked 3 seats together, they messed up, no one cared. The planes had dirt on seat pockets on every sector, seats and tray tables were dirty, the food was poor quality and little on the FCO-EZE. On the EZE-FCO (night flight) the ceiling lights were left on for the last 6 hours of the flight. No child meals and no amenities for kids (though they should be provided as per booking and as advertised on their website). On the FCO-ATH they took one of our hand luggage, because GS said we had too many and the flight was full, but we had only 2 carry ons and 2 small backpacks to be placed under seat, and had boarded first! Their website is basic and pretty useless to find info about your booking.

### "Absolutely horrific and atrocious"
We are flying out of Rome to NY to connect to LAX. We were not told about a delay until we were already at the airport with our bag checked. The airline sent us to a far corner of the terminal to get information. There was nobody there. The next gate over we asked for help, they sent us all the way back to the help desk which we'd passed already. The "help" desk told us that the flight was delayed, they couldn't do anything about it and had no answers because, get this, the flight wasn't officially delayed yet. They said come back in 30 minutes to figure it out. We asked if there were options and they said no. Never once checked flight logs, never once looked to help. We come back, they tell us the flight is delayed 3 hours and now we're going to miss our connector flight. Is there anything we can do? They shrug. We asked for an upgrade. No. We asked for a row to ourselves as my wife is pregnant and they've greatly inconvenienced us. No help. No answers. Will we make a connector in NY? Do we need a hotel now? Who knows! Certainly not the two horrible women at the "help" desk who, instead of offering any sort of assistance, scolded me for not doing more for my pregnant wife. Absolutely horrific and atrocious. Not to mention, our inbound flight was delayed due to a strike nobody told us about either so they messed up both our flights with no warning. Use ANY company besides ITA.

### "the most unprofessional occurrence"
I took an ITA flight from Madrid to Tirana via Rome. I am, writing this to report the most unprofessional occurrence regarding the delayed or rather, non-delivery (arrival) of my luggage which was checked in at the Madrid airport on 1/9/2022 and upon arrival at the Tirana airport, my luggage, much to my horror and dismay, did not arrive with my flight destination being Tirana. I thus completed an irregularity report. I would point out that we arrived in Tirana in on 1/9/2022 with over a three-hours delay. The consequences were dreadful. My return flight to Madrid was on 18/9/2022. When I arrived at the airport in Rome, I had less than 90 minutes until my next flight but I decided to go to ITA´s office in spite of the limited time I had, to enquire about my missing luggage. I was told that they didn’t have any news & that it did not appear on the system! This, in spite of me being in possession of a reference. I then proceeded on my own volition toward the lost and found office at the airport where, I found my luggage without a tag. Unassisted by any staff, whom when I said that I had a connecting flight, STILL made no effort to help me. Time was running out whereby I almost lost missed my connecting flight to Madrid. This was truly disappointing, and absolutely unprofessional! In today’s world, with all ‘the state of the art’ security and technology available to you as a large ‘prestigious ´airline, it begs the question how such an organization not only completely loses or misplaces a passengers’ luggage, but worse than that, to have their staff handle it with such apathy!? Stop just for a moment if you would, to consider how you would feel if this had happened to yourself or a member of your family? I have no doubt that you would be just as, if not, more upset than I am! I went back to the airport over a period of three days but my luggage still did not reflect on the system There was also no news or indication of where my luggage was at all, and little to no effort was made by ITA airways to assist me! After three days with no luggage, I was forced to buy purchase some clothing and requisites as I had planned my itinerary to first go hiking to the north with a motorbike and then to take a cycling tour around the south. I did not have any suitable clothing to go motorbike riding, hiking or cycling. This all happened because ITA airways staff had simply not bothered to look for it or find it.

### "entire flight including the return was cancelled"
Having had an issue and missed the first leg of a long and expensive trip from Miami to Cagliari in business class, my entire flight including the return was cancelled without a chance of reschedule or refund of over $5000. I emphatically discourage anyone thinking to use this horrible company. I am saddened by the worsened state of the main airline of Italy.

### "unprofessional and unreliable airline"
Very unprofessional and unreliable airline. I called almost 2 months before my flight to get premium economy seats with leg room because my parents have trouble sitting in regular economy for long flights. The agent assured me they got me the premium seats and sent me the invoices and seat numbers. But when I arrived at the airport, after over an hour waiting in line to get my boarding pass (they don't even have kiosks), they told me that they gave my premium seats to other people and could only give me regular economy seats. They then told me they could not issue a refund there and that i had to call and complain to the airline to get a refund for the premium seats I paid for. I will never fly with this airline again and advise others not to either. You can never be sure that you will get the seats you pay for.

### "Awful behaviour from the cabin crew"
Athens to Rome. Awful behaviour from the cabin crew. Impossible to understand announcements in English. I'm 1.85m and the seat was too small even for a 2h flight. Snacks were good but the beverages less than mediocre

### "a really disappointing flight"
This was a really disappointing flight. The plane  was extremely old and not clean. I am a huge clean freak but even this didn't disturb me as much as a remark made by one of the flight attendants. I asked her to please retrieve my carry on which was in the overhead compartment. I had my 3 year old toddler on my lap who I had been trying desperately to keep calm and sane for the duration of the flight which is why I requested assistance. If you're the parent of a baby or toddler on an 8 hour flight, you'll understand how stressful that is! Anyway, this flight attendant responded, "that's not my job. How incredibly insensitive. I've had travellers offer help just because they see me travelling alone with a young kid and it definitely wasn't their job! It truly was the worst flight I've ever taken to the states from Europe. The staff overall was mediocre in their "human contact" and the food was not edible.

### "crew was rude"
Not Verified | The crew was rude, they closed all the shades on a day flight from Rome to Boston - served lunch and we never saw them again. No water to be found after they all disappeared. The seats and window plastic were broken and falling apart. Sad but true the staff, except for 2 people in business class, were rude and arrogant. They charge the most for their flights and they are the worst. I would never fly them again and have canceled my return flight because I did not feel safe on such an old plane with a disappearing wait staff. Do not even mention the food - I was deplorable. The plane was dirty and broken down inside. The chairs did not move, our movie screens were broken and well, it was horrible.

### "certainly fly them again"
Not Verified |  We flew from Catania to Paris CDG via Milan LIN on ITA Airways. While for the most part everything is still branded Alitalia, we found both of our flights perfectly nice. Check in at Catania was smooth and the agent was friendly. Note: There is not an ITA lounge in Catania which is actually a larger airport than we expected. We did use Priority Pass to enter the one lounge available. It is small and not worth the stop. However, it was a place to escape the rather crowded airport. The flight from Catania to Milan Linate left early and arrived early. Cabin Crew were friendly and attentive. Service was minimal in Business Class with just juice, water, soda offered along with a bag of sweet or salty snacks. The flight was just short of 2 hours so we were surprised that there was not a more robust service offered. Connection in Milan Linate was very easy. We had some time (about 70 minutes) and did visit the ITA Lounge. It was very nice with plenty of staff and not overcrowded. There was a full bar with all the offerings along with a nice selection of foods. Instead of self-serve food, there was an attendant that plated your requests. This was nice as to not have multiple people hovering over food and using all of the utensils, etc. Boarding for the flight from Milan Linate to Paris CDG was done effective and efficiently by bus to a remote stand. Boarding was from both the front and back of the aircraft which worked well. We left about 10 minutes early and arrived about 15 minutes early. Service on board was again very good with lunch served. A bit surprised as this flight was just short of 90 minutes. Warm panini, salad, desert, etc. along with wine. Overall, the service was very nice. No inflight entertainment or WiFi on either aircraft. Arrival in Paris CDG was easy and a short walk to baggage claim. Both bags arrived without issue and timely, just 15-20 minutes after landing. Overall, I hope ITA continues to improve where Alitalia seemed to give up. Would certainly fly them again.

### "They are useless in every aspect of their service"
I would urge significant caution using ITA Airways. I've flown over a hundred times without incident and every step of my first experience with them this week (forced due to a medical emergency on the part of my wife) was an unmitigated disaster. The check in agent at Palermo did not know what an indirect flight was. The attendants didn't organise people boarding, sitting or the volume of hand baggage, leading to total chaos at boarding and, ultimately, passengers still standing, holding bags and trading places as the plane taxied for take off. The attendants were still completing the safety announcement as the plane began taking off. When we arrived at Lisbon (Portugal) after our connecting flight, it became apparent my luggage had not arrived and, when I checked it with the lost luggage team, the representative told me he'd never before seen a case where a bag does not even make the first scan. They are useless in every aspect of their service.

### "Worst experience ever!"
Worst experience ever! They lost my luggage for 5 days and ruined my entire trip. 2 weeks has passed and no matter how many emails and calls I make, no one responds nor takes any responsibility for the financial loss and damage that has been caused. Save yourself and do not ever travel with them as they have no manners nor professionalism at all!

### "a great experience"
Not Verified | Boston to Athens via Rome. I was worried after reading all of the poor reviews, but our experience with ITA Airways was great! Nice staff, normal airplane food just like any other flight, luggage all made it, all flights were on time. Overall, a great experience considering we were traveling from the US to Athens on three different flights.

### "ignored for 6 weeks"
Milan to London. What a complete Mickey Mouse airline! First of all the plane was old, the ones with just 2 seats on either side, the cabin crew were wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans and white trainers, this just doesn’t look professional, the whole point of a cabin crews uniform is that they stand out if there was an emergency! Then when I get to London they lost my bag, I didn’t get in back until 2 days later, as all my toiletries and make up was in it I was told to go out buy what I need and keep the receipts, I went to Poundland and Superdrug to make it cheap for them even though all my make up was really expensive! I sent the receipts in, I got ignored for 6 weeks! Then receive an email to tell me they won’t be refunding me! What an absolute joke! I hope they go bust and they most likely will with this kind of customer service!

### "The worst of the worst"
Since I didn’t had a good experience in my flight in with the ITA airways (aircraft was old, with seat falling apart, poor food quality, old entertainment selection) I wasn’t expecting so much from my flight back and I thought that couldn't be worse than what already experienced!! Unfortunately I was so wrong! The worst experience I ever had with an airline, so disorganized! The flight started with 2 hours delay from scheduled departure. From the check in point you can feel that they are operating so wrong, just 1 line for 2 different flight NYC and LA with 3 hours apart one from the other. So there were people who were in a hurry to leave because boarding would start in 30 minutes, mixed with angry people because their flight would leave 2 hours late. More staff outside the booths chatting with each other then staff doing check in and you could see them leaving their position to go for a cigarette break in the middle of all this crazy situation. But this is only the beginning. If you were lucky enough when finishing your check in for NYC you had 2 extra hour on top of the 3 that is required for international flight to spend inside the airport( since in Rome there is a ITA airways lounge they should invite the guest of the delayed flight to spend time there at airways expense for apologies for the inconvenience!!) waiting for the gate number to show up. So on today flight September 11 2022 all passengers waiting the extra 2 hours had the news that the flight was delayed an extra hour when was already boarding time and must of guest were already in the line. If you think this is everything you are wrong!! The airline asked (10 minutes before the 3rd rescheduled boarding time) to change gate number because there weren’t able to fix the issue with the airplane. We had, my family and I ( 2 kids 3 and 6), take everything with us again, take the train to a different terminal, go through check point again because we were directed through a connection gate. When finally at the gate we had to wait another hour before start boarding - the aircraft wasn’t ready and we had to wait another 20 minutes in the ramp after boarding. This airplane was newer than the previous one but they added and extra chair per row so 9 instead of 8 in same space, basically the chairs are smaller and space now is more limited between chairs - not comfortable for a 9 hours trip. Food, entertainment and service very bad as previous flight. They didn’t had the door for the gate and had to wait another 30 minutes on the plane after landing! The worst of the worst.

### "Pleasant crews, orderly boarding"
Not Verified |  Fine, no-frills flights. Pleasant crews, orderly boarding. Usual coffee and biscuits for European hops. No complaints, other than we had to stack for ages before landing at Naples. Not ITA's fault. Checked bag arrived too.

### "definitely the worst airline"
Not Verified |  I have been travelling for over 50 years and can honestly say this is definitely the worst airline I have ever come across. My bag did not arrive and no attempt was made to locate it. Call centre in Albania is appalling, it makes no difference what language option you choose they are unhelpful and completely useless. On two occasions they took my number and promised to call back, but they never do. Reading other reviews it’s also obvious their baggage handling companies are also useless.

### "my checked bag never made it"
I flew ITA Airways and my checked bag never made it. The only phone number for US citizens to call re-routes through Albania and after literal two-hour waits on hold, all they offer is to email the complaints department. ITA doesn't even have a baggage office in the US! I have a claim ticket and even a code that my bag is stuck in Roma but have no way to retrieve it and no one at ITA Air to talk to about it! Airlines with respect and professionalism would contact you and assure you it will be on the next flight but ITA Airways just passes the buck, call the only number and be told the only thing you can do is email complaints. Email complaints and they do nothing. No baggage office for ITA Air at the airport so they say you have to check your airport's lost and found but lost and found says that's only for when people are departing and accidentally lose something; not  for incompetent airlines who can't reliably get checked bags safely to their final destination. It's coming on two months now.

### "I was treated badly on board"
Not Verified |  It’s been a nightmare honestly. I was treated badly on board and my flight were delayed and my bags were lost. Not much to say apart from I’ll never set foot on an ITA Airways flight again and I would not recommend it.

### "customer service is very poor"
Our luggage was lost during our trip to Italy by ITA airways. We had to pick the bags up from Rome Airport two days later costing over $100 round trip in cab as they could not deliver. We were without any clothes or toiletries for that time and had to purchase items to get by. We were advised but ITA to save receipts and submit for reimbursement upon being back home. Our trip in Italy was 3 weeks long. When we returned I spent time on the phone trying to get our reimbursement started which took time as their customer service is very poor. Once I finally got their claims email they replied back stating we broke the 30 day claim window. They said there is nothing we can do. The plane was also old, not very clean, and the amenities were reminiscent of the 90's.

### "joke and disaster of an airline"
Not Verified |  ITA airways is a joke! They lost our baggage due to pure negligence but are taking no responsibility. There is no structure in place or process in place for you as a customer to be able to communicate with anyone or rely on anyone to follow up your case. The one number we were given is just a call center for reservations and have no power to do anything. All they do is check out a website called world tracer which we have access to anyways - I don’t need them to do that. They are not following up on the actual case or looking for my bag. They gave me a bunch of emails to send emails to but surprise surprise - no one is responding to my emails. Not their complaints email, not the ‘bif@ita-airways’ and not the compensation ‘reclami@ita-airways’ email. Nothing. Zero support zero customer service - and when I call it’s zero compassion- as if I am burdening with my call for my bag that they lost. I explained that this bag has everything I packed for the holiday all of our clothes all our toiletries and all of our medicine. Even if the issue is with the airport - the least I expect is for the airline to follow up on my behalf. But no they gave me the number of their baggage handling partner so I can chase them myself. Why should I contact your partners? And when I did call they DONT answer. No one answers! Absolute joke and disaster of an airline.

### "Just terrible service unfortunately"
Terrible. They lost my husband’s luggage and have not even bothered to update our location address. We email - they do not reply. We call - they either change up after waiting 1-2 hours on hold, or, they say that it’s the wrong number. We have been given 15 different numbers, no one helps. Over 500 pieces of luggage lost and sitting there at Naples airport, but ITA Airways were chilling and laughing behind the counter. They also said if they find it they have to open it to confirm it’s ours - what century do we live in? We have our tags on there, they have the flight codes and stickers on there. Lies. How terrible! They also did not allow us to sit together. They were running almost 2 hours late with departure due to lack of time to put luggage on board. I saw my husbands baggage on the floor outside and when speaking to a staff member, they laughed and said don’t worry it will come on board. Clearly not. Just terrible service unfortunately.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
I additionally booked seat at emergency exit and lounge entry when i booked this flight. I paid eur378,67 for the flight plus extra seats and eur35 for lounge entry. I received a receipt for only the flight 326,67. I did not get my seats and i did not receive any voucher for lounge entry. I called the service desk many times (during 3 days aproximately 15 times) they promised me every time to take care of it and to search for the money. The only thing i could do is to book again and pay again and hope it works out. Nobody called me back and i did not receive the seats in the end and of course i could not enter the lounge. Ita airways does not send me any answers by email. This is definitely the worst airline I have ever used. I will not use them again ever.

### "Comfortable if slightly old cabin!
No complaints. Comfortable if slightly old cabin with black leather seats. Courteous staff, basic food and beverage served at no extra cost, plane departed on time and landed ahead of schedule. Linate airport was very quick and easy to navigate.

### "I don't think this company knows how to run an airline"
Not Verified |  We had two flight segments scheduled on ITA, one from Munich to Rome and one from Rome to Brussels. Our Munich to Rome segment was cancelled and they put us on a later flight, causing us to lose 1/2 day in Rome. Then our Rome to Brussels segment was cancelled and the the flight they rebooked us on was impossible for us to make, causing us to have to switch to a different airline. I don't think this company knows how to run an airline. I have flown hundreds of times and been bumped maybe 2x in my life and with ITA I was bumped on both flights I had with them (100% cancellation rate). I will never fly this airline again and neither should anyone else.

### "The worst flight experience"
The worst flight experience period. Gate customer service was very rude. I paid $ 1400.00 for round trip yet despite being international flight I had to pay $80 for one bag. I am pre-TSA but when I asked them to add it to my boarding pass at gate they simply said “since we are new we can’t add it” so on very busy day at LAX I had to go through regular security line. To make matter more fun the lost my bag so I had to go everything shopping in Rome. Today after 6 days and two trips to Rome airport and dealing with the most uncooperative customer service there I got a call from American Airlines in LA that my luggage is there. And the funny part their tracking website still says they still are looking to locate my bag. There is no customer service number and no one to contact. Avoid this airline by any way possible. By the way the service, food and entertainment on the plan gets 1.5 stars out of 10 at best.

### "no one deserves that treatment"
My wife and I used Ita airways service to fly to Italy. Unfortunately once arrived in Milan the nightmare with Ita Airways started, one of our checked bags was lost. We went to denounce the loss and we found out that many other passengers that flew on our same flight had the same issue. After a very long time we were able to have the written documents of the loss, and they told us in writing about what to do and who to contact in case we didn’t received information about the lost luggage after 5 days. Well, this is when the nightmare started, we tried to call all the numbers that were available on the notice, but no agent ever answered, only a robot that for many days kept telling us that they were still looking for our luggage, in the same time we tried to send also emails to the email address provided on the denounce document but we received right away the reply stating that the inbox was full and that nobody could read our email, you can imagine our frustration, we had some gift for the kids and my wife’s clothes, we kept calling but no answers and at this point 10 days of our vacation were gone, after that the robot that used to answer stated that the luggage was been found and that was sent to Malpensa, to the lost and found office.l I was super excited they found our luggage, and when finally I was able to talk to a real agent this agent told me that the luggage was not there, at that time my frustration came out and started complaining about the service I was receiving and and at that time the agent answered me “I wasn’t supposed to even answer your call” and hung up. I don’t know if I will ever find that luggage but I am sure of one thing, I will never fly on ITA Airways again because I can accept that they can lose a luggage but I can’t accept to be treated as we got treated, no one deserves that treatment from a public company Customer Service.

### "ITA Airways is actually worse than Alitalia"
ITA Airways is actually worse than Alitalia which is saying a lot. I know from experience as a frequent flyer on Alitalia over the last 20 years. My ITA flight was cancelled and rescheduled several hours later allowing me to be in Milan for 1 hour before returning on a business day trip. When contacted for a refund as the ticket was completely useless, the airline placed me on hold for 30 minutes only to come back saying they could not refund me as I purchased my ticket in the Netherlands. This is absurd as it was purchased directly from their website. I was given a number to call in the NL, which did not exist. When I called back, another 30 minute wait, I was told to write a complaint to an email address, that did not exist and came back to me undeliverable. I managed to find the proper complaints and refunds email addresses on their website and explained my situation. I received a reply 5 days later telling me to call the very same customer service number I had already spoken with. Truly the most insane runaround I have ever experienced with an airline. The worst and most ill informed customer service possible. Astounding that absolutely no one would help me, address my request or even care to rectify the situation. I was passed along from person to person who had absolutely no intention of helping me. My ticket was cancelled and not refunded by ITA airways. Be warned, ITA Airways is an appalling company and should be avoided at all costs.

### "I had a decent experience"
I had a decent experience. I was expecting the worst based on reviews since I had booked it before reading reviews. They served us every couple of hours. We were fed two meals and snacks in between. I did get tired as it was a 14 hour flight so I stood in the back for sometime and nobody complained. They had snacks and simple drinks in the back for you to self serve as well. My baggage was not lost, I had no problems with overweight issues, and everything went smoothly in my opinion. Things could have been cleaner I will admit. And a charging port would be great as well. Entertainment wasn’t bad, I watched two movies. My only other complaint was no Wi-Fi offered.

### "Dreadful experience"
Dreadful experience, but they’re the only airline flying the route non-stop. My first experience was trying to pay for seat selections and checked baggage. Their website forwards to Alitalia, so unless the website language is set to Italian, the transaction does not go through. During one attempt, I was charged to my credit card, despite the transaction on their website showing an error for “time out”. It took about three hours to figure out how to pay for seat selections and checked bags. When it came time to check in, I noticed that my seat selection I had paid USD 75 was not applied to my ticket, so called the help desk. After waiting on hold for what felt like an eternity, I was told there was nothing they could do, as the plane was full, so to email their complaints team for a refund. I did that over a week ago now and have received no response, so just filed a dispute with my credit card. I then found out that the airline doesn’t participate in TSA Pre-Check, so had to wait over an hour at security even though I have Global Entry (which includes TSA Pre-Check) for the specific reason of avoiding long security queues. Once boarded, I intended to use the WiFi do work for business purposes in order to not fall behind, but soon discovered the WiFi was not functioning and did not function throughout the entirety of the flight. Meals were small and insufficient in frequency. We were served two small meals once the course of the 12-hour flight. Snacks were kept at the rear of the plane, and given how many passengers frequented the snack bar, it would seem many people agreed with my sentiments. The service I experienced with ITA Airways was a sorry start to what would ultimately be an absolutely incredible holiday. If Norwegian still flew transatlantic flights, I would have much preferred to fly with them.

### "unacceptable, unprofessional and unworthy"
Absolute shame of an airline. Sold tickets, then proceed to cancel your flight a month after, doesn't offer any kind of commercial gesture, and can't rebook you on another flight from the same alliance (pretexting they can't get tickets for other airlines). For a Skyteam Platinum frequent flyer this is just unacceptable, unprofessional and unworthy of a "national" airline.

### "They were of no help"
Not Verified |  Horrible, I do not understand why Delta did a partnership with this company. They need to get rid of it. I am a platinum medallion member of Delta and had a duplicate booking with ITA. I spoke with the ITA staff at the airport who told me to call a number to void a booking and receive a refund, it was a Delta operated flight and I had two exact bookings. They were of no help.

### "lost my checked luggage"
They just lost my checked luggage and it is disappeared since 7 days. No one replied to any email, they don't pick up the phone and I am running out of my prescribed medicine. I hope they will come up for all the extra costs I am having now and I hope they start to feel any responsibility for my lost luggage. Sadly I can't give less than 1 star. It's a shame and I am really shocked this airline is like this.

### "don't fly with ITA Airways"
This is by far the worst flying experience I've had in my life and I've flown with some smaller companies that don't have access the the Rome Airport like infrastructure but still better at handling passenger flights, baggage handling, consumer service and just a nice smile and just being a decent human being. The Rome Airport is huge but the ITA airways and Alitalia people working in it are not in line with their job descriptions. Very lazy and long awaiting times just to get to ask a question at any desk. The company itself (ITA airways) have the most delay times of all time (fact proven) my four flights with them have been delayed at least 1,5hour each. Which makes you loose other connecting flights that are in time, and therefore lose your luggage. Had the experience, even though I've tried and talked to many people from the company to make sure it doesn't get lost. Bottom line, don't fly with ITA Airways and save your money you won't have a good flying experience.

### "just decided to lose the ticket"
Terrible company - do not buy a ticket. We've bought a ticket and tried to rebook the date of the flight. It is impossible to do so on the website - the option just doesn't work. It is impossible to call the airline - the call is being dropped, even though I called in at an appropriate time. We just decided to lose the ticket and book with another airline at another date.

### "worst bed I have encountered in any business class"
The only real reason to fly business class on a long route is to be able to sleep on the plane. Impossible on this flight, I was awake the whole time. The seat did go down to perfectly flat, but it was so narrow that I couldn't sleep on my side and so lumpy as to be uncomfortable in any case. By far the worst bed I have encountered in any business class. The food and wine were OK but just OK. The entertainment system had a very limited selection, and the categories of "live news," "classic movies," and "world cinema" were all non-functional. Best aspect of the journey was the flight crew, who were nice, forthcoming, and helpful. Note also that I was sent an SMS and an email shortly before the flight left, both of them listing the same incorrect gate ("23C", which does not exist at JFK Terminal 1 - the correct gate was 4).

### "never experienced such humiliation"
Flight out was without any problems, flight on time, staff very welcoming connection without any hassle London to Rome AZ207, then Rome to Algiers AZ802. Flight return  one issue which i am quiet concerned the lady from ITA Airways at boarding gate in Rome for the flight to London after desk check in our way to the plane asked for our passports my wife and mine and carried on with very embarrassing questions because we felt singled from other passengers. She was selecting by look and clothes yes so she asked us from which country we come from, my answer was from Algiers, then she asked my address in London then my Job, despite our Passports where both British citizen so i believe this is because we were not of European look. I have ever never experienced such humiliation.

### "worst airline I ever experienced"
The worst airline I ever experienced. Nothing deserves above 2 stars and no words to describe. I regret I did not read feedback before I booked my tickets.

### "Absolutely disgraceful in-flight experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely disgraceful in-flight experience in business class. Plastic glasses, no champagne, no gin and tonic and then no white wine. Offered cheap prossecco which then ran out. To charge this money and not offer a fully stocked bar is unacceptable. The salad was disgusting. Worse than this at check in the agent told us the business lounge was at gate e41 so we went miles to get there and as my husband is registered disabled this was quite a long walk. We were told at the lounge that ITA didn't have use of this lounge but we had to go back to gate 11 - miles back. so we sat and waited at gate e44 for an hour and a half when we could have enjoyed the business lounge had that agent given us correct information. This was such a poor experience. I left a complaint with the purser who said they didn't have much loaded since the pandemic? If the cabin is full, you stock a full bar and provide a good meal maybe even some italian cheese and biscuits. Not even a hot towel. Poorall round.

### "Appallingly bad UI/UX of the website"
Appallingly bad UI/UX of the website and the whole booking process. Barely usable on mobile, showing irrelevant information (“if you're entering the USA” - I was on a flight to Milan, ita). Email system is prehistoric. Just awful.

### "Chaotic, incompetent organisation"
Chaotic, incompetent organisation from start to finish. Ticketing purchase: only a single email confirmation, unable to check in online. Upon our return (Rome to Ams) one of us had been deleted from the reservation completely without any explanation. Took over 20 minutes to resolve at the check out desk. No explanation was given Boarding (Rome-Ams): passengers were asked to board but had to wait almost 40 minutes in the corridor leading to the airplane with no explanation given. Passengers included pregnant women, small children and elderly. There were no refreshments or anywhere to sit. The quality of the airplane and seats was fine but I would not recommend this airline to anyone!

### "It’s so third rate service"
After arriving comfortably in Milan, I was thoughtless to any issues upon my return to Amsterdam 2 days later. How wrong I was when my travel company called me day 2 to ask if Id cancelled my return flight as I now had no return ticket to Amsterdam. Needless to say not my doing! It appeared just my ticket cancelled for the return as flight still listed as available. That said it was not possible to rebook a ticket (I tried out of curiosity) indicating flight cancelled but without any communication from ITA Airways. Luckily it flagged with my travel company. They had tried to reach ITA Airways to clarify but nobody answered any listed phone line! My travel company was as equally annoyed. It’s so third rate service. I’ve had to buy a new ticket back on another airline. I’ve left it with my travel company to follow up with the instruction of never fly this airline again. There appear to be no guarantees that when booking a return flight with ITA Airways they will honour any the booking and moreover will tell you what they’ve done.

### "crumbling technology"
Milan to London. Utterly pathetic website, broken technology, shambolic customer service. This is like a company trying to operate in the 21st century using a 1980s platform. The flight manifest I got emailed even has a dummy Stockholm flight on which says "PLS NOTE THIS IS NOT A FLIGHT SEGMENT - ONLY FOR TECHNICAL PURPOSES. PLS IGNORE" This was the warning sign of an airline that has crumbling technology. I've been trying to get my boarding passes for 2 hours now for a flight tomorrow. I try and log in to the website, which refuses to show me any other language than Italian. I fill in a load of unnecessary details with my home address, passport number, date of birth, etc, etc (which they already have) then find out it will only give me a boarding pass if I pay 80EUR for seat assignments. I don't want seat assignments because this is a criminal surcharge. I phoned them to explain this and find a) they are all working from home because unlike the rest of the world they have not moved on from covid, b) 4 of the 5 people I spoke to sounded like they are working on the moon so I could not communicate with them (the problem is not at my end for sure), the fifth person who did sound like they were actually working and had a decent phone connection said I should be able to download the boarding passes from the website, because my seats are assigned. This is not possible from the website (and I do know how to use an airline website), which says "seats unassigned" so they tried to email me the boarding passes. They can only issue one of five! The system does not work and I need to phone back tomorrow. This is an abbreviated summary, it really is a fiasco that I am too tired to write the full details of. What an unprofessional airline, with technology in the dark ages, they should be embarrassed.

### "follow same bad way that Alitalia was doing"
I tried to do the check in online for my fly but this was not possible so, i call customer service and, i discover that my flight was first changed for previous day then that fly was cancelled. ITA never inform me and my travel agency about flight changes and cancellation. I asked operator to re-route my fly with other airline but operator say that she was not allowed to do this then she say that was possible to fly from Cairo to Rome but for next fly from Rome to Trieste, the same was for next day and that hotel cost at Rome was at my charge because ITA company policy is not to pay hotel even when they are at fault. I have informed the operator that ITA is an European company and should follow the passenger right rules but obviously she cannot do nothing. ITA show an extreme bad attitude that follow same bad way that Alitalia was doing without care about passenger. Really disgusting service. Finally I have call my travel agency to issue a new return ticket with another airline.

### "ITA Airways did not want to help me"
My direct flight from Brussels to Milan was cancelled without telling me why. ITA Airways proposed to fly from Brussels to Rome and from Rome to Milan. A trip that takes many hours. This was not acceptable, so I asked for a refund. The travel agency involved did not want to refund me fully because they wanted a "service fee" of €30. I contacted ITA Airways three times to refund me fully and directly, but ITA Airways did not want to help me. Considering the cancellation and the way in which ITA Airways communicates with me, I have decided to never fly with ITA Airways again.

### "Staff was professional"
The new Alitalia, but why change the name? Now they have to spend $50,000 to repaint each of their aeroplanes! Very pleasant flight. Staff was professional and the agents at Linate & Fuimicino were especially kind. I didn't have the proper face mask and was directed to a shop to purchase one. They sold me one, but it turned out to be the wrong kind (why would they sell a face mask that is useless on an aeroplane? ), but the gate agent fished a proper one out of her purse and gave it to me - I am so happy to learn that there are still kind and gracious people in the world. Food was okay, entertainment was limited, seat was as usual uncomfortable for me (I have a bony behind and need more cushion), but all went smoothly. Interior of aeroplanes are very attractive. One very strange aspect - usually stewardesses disappear into the galley to gossip with each other and check their bidding sheets, but Alitalia has something novel - they have a canvas tent hanging over some oversize chairs for the inflight staff to hide themselves in. What will they think of next to avoid contact with the public? Have always been please with Alitalia not matter what they call themselves.

### "it was a good experience"
This was part of a return trip from London to Catania and back. All was smooth and on time, arriving ahead of schedule. Unfortunately Alitalia lounges were shut and there weren't agreements with other lounges (including at Heathrow). Fast track was available though. An orange juice or water was offered on boarding and staff were generally friendly and helpful. There were a few lulls on the earlier flight from Heathrow but service was solid on the way back to London. A meal was offered with warm bread, a reasonable pasta dish, salad and tiramisu. I went for prosecco to drink and was offered several top ups. A limoncello was offered as well after the meal which was a nice touch. The aircraft was still in Alitalia guise though I could see the changes slowly happening on others in Milan. All was in reasonable condition with the interior. Whilst not up with some well known airlines, for me it was a good experience. Hopefully the airline can keep it up for others under the new name.

### "Absolutely awful service"
Absolutely awful service. Refusing to change booking without paying again the same amount or higher price. Refusing to refund tickets. Charges for pets in cabin are double the price of my ticket. Website says any changes are free but they don't care and still charges exuberant amounts. Disgraceful company.

### "they still don’t reimburse me"
Bought 7 tickets for a flight on October 24th 2021. Few weeks before our flight they sent me an email saying the flight is cancel and I should contact immediately the customer service which I did. Now few months have passed and they still don’t reimburse me. I have to call every week and every time there is differeNt answer. Its so stressful, if you have other option never take this airline.

### "shame on you!"
For a short break to Rome I chosed to buy 2 return tickets on the ITA Airways to show my interest in flying this new airline after Alitalia bankrupty. Wrong choice ! Due to the current evolution of the virus and as a proud member of a medical team involved in the COVID19 vaccination process, I've had to cancel this trip and I asked ITA for a full refund after I was invited to do so by a very friendly ITA Representative by phone back on Saturday DEC, 10. I did send to ITA proof of my duties as requested by the ITA agent. Then, 2 days later I've received 2 phone calls by ITA and their final answer to this request was : only taxes will be refunded. I've even asked for a voucher for future travel .. no way! By refusing to refund these tickets ITA clearly demonstrates his intention to make money on this dramatic crisis: shame on you!
