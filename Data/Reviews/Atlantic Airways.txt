### “seat was very comfortable”
Boarded by air-bridge on an A320N with very good condition, crew was very friendly. Legroom was plenty and seat was very comfortable. We departed on time. Soon after departure they offer free coffee and water, and buy food from a menu. Captain made announcements of the flight path. We had a great experience with them.

### "a perfect start to the vacation"
Copenhagen to Sorvagur return. Wonderful experience, many smiles by service team, multiple drink refills, decent in-flight entertainment via own device and very smooth flight into Faroer. An excellent value for money and perhaps one of the last remaining airlines in Europe that treats customers as many did in the past. I got the impression that the team liked their job and were happy to welcome everyone on board. We pre-ordered delicious snacks and very comfortable seats. Flights were on time and a breeze, a perfect start into the vacation and back home.

### "a very good flight"
Copenhagen to Vagar in the Faroe Islands with Atlantic Airways (RC453). A319 aircraft. Friendly check-in, received baggage tag and headed to the gate. Flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin. Nice colors and comfortable seats. Lots of legroom actually - was very surprised. On-time take off and 2 hours to the Faroe islands - soda, water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced. Inflight entertainment was just the flight-map but had my DVD's to watch. Landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain, but the landing was good. Parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet, but that is how it is there. Bags off in a reasonable amount of time. Oveall a very good flight and for the price a good deal.

### "Comfortable seats, clean aircraft"
I had two flights with Atlantic Airways. Flight Bergen- Faroe Islands and Faroe Islands to Copenhagen one week later. Both flights on time. Comfortable seats, clean aircraft, good food, friendly service. I will flight with Atlantic Airways again with pleasure.

### "very pleasant"
Copenhagen to Vagar (Faroe Islands), and the Atlantic Airways A319 was still quite new and had the feature of mood lighting (which you don't see on many European short haul aircraft). The cabin layout was very nice. The food was simple, but good : a nice little wrap, salad with fresh salmon, bread and little mini-Rittersport chocolate. Very surprised that only 45 minutes after the meals / drinks service they did a second drink service (a full aircraft on a 2.05hr flight!). The service was friendly and the lady who served me was most charming. A simple short haul flight, but very pleasant!

### Atlantic Airways customer review
The short journey was very pleasant, the staff were very friendly and the food on-board was excellent. I would recommend them to anyone flying to the Faroe Islands.

### Atlantic Airways customer review
I have flown Atlantic Airways numerous times between the Faroe Islands and Copenhagen. The flight attendants are some of the best around and they consistently go out of their way to ensure that passengers have a good experience. The new Airbus is more comfortable than the older planes. The airlines offers free alcohol and above average coffee. Food however is below average.

### Atlantic Airways customer review
Small company but very friendly and efficient staff. All passengers treated as business class travelers even though Atlantic Airways only offers one class (economy). Small planes (Bea 146 and Airbus 319) but the comfort is all right for the short trips between Scandinavian countries Faroe Islands and Britain.

### Atlantic Airways customer review
Flew to Vagar Faroe Islands. Smooth flight lasting 2 hrs 15 mins each way. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Seats comfortable and spacious adequate storage space for inflight luggage. Free snacks served as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

### Atlantic Airways customer review
Flew on Atlantic Airways from Copenhagen to Vagar and return on economy on a BAe 146. A safe and smooth flight considering the north atlantic winds! Crew friendly and efficient and nice leather seats with an acceptable leg space. Would definately recommend this airline and would fly them again.
