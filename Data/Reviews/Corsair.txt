### “customer service remains highly unresponsive”
I had an extremely disappointing experience with this airline's customer service. I attempted to modify my flight, and due to a glitch on their website, I was erroneously charged three times the correct amount without receiving the ticket change. Despite submitting a complaint on their site, the automated response indicated a 4-week wait time for a resolution, which was particularly frustrating given that my flight was scheduled within that period. Resorting to calling them, I encountered additional charges for making inquiries over the phone. The waiting times during each call ranged from 10 to 20 minutes, leading to substantial financial losses due to the incurred call fees. To date, I've spent 40 euros on phone calls alone and have yet to receive a refund of 1500 euros. Despite assurances during each call that a refund would be processed within 72 hours, 17 days have passed, and there is still no sign of my money. The customer service remains highly unresponsive and has failed to address my concerns adequately. This experience has been nothing short of frustrating and unacceptable.

### "the worst ever trip I had"
I used this airline the first time for a long distance trip, it consisted of a 15h flight with one stopover on a small island before reaching the destination some 2h flight apart. on the way in, the aircraft changed route because of a medical emergency onboard. This resulted in a 4h delay and the cancellation of the trip to our final destination. the problem is that the English speaking passengers were never informed, they were in an airport with little to no English speaking personnel at night try to figure out which way to go. On the way back, after checking in and spending a morning waiting we finally realized that the flight was cancelled and that we had to go to the airline box to find out what next! In a nutshell two out of 5 working days wasted, connection flight arrangements wasted without compensation and much of our plans ruined as due to the lack of feedback we had little time to try and fix things. This was the worst ever trip I had. To top it up when we disembarked for the last time (ever) from the corsair craft we collected our luggage completely drenched in a foul smelling liquid so much that the contents needed to be washed several times. thank god there were only casual garments in the case.

### "only sometimes gave communication in English"
I had intercontinental flight from Montreal to Paris. Crew only sometimes gave communication in English, mostly in French which not everybody speaks. Accept that, there is a problem with their website I couldn't the download boarding pass or send it to my email. In aeroplane touchscreen doesn't work.

### "nicest transatlantic flight I've taken"
This was the nicest transatlantic flight I've taken and I've been traveling to and from Paris a lot. It was a very large and comfortable plane. The flight attendant who took care of us was delightful. The seats were very comfortable and went almost completely flat for an actual sleep. The food was even decent. We flew back on Air Canada, which was fine but I was sad it was not the same as the way out. I will try to fly with Corsair on my next trip in October. Thank you!

### "this flight was an absolute disaster"
The shortest flight of 50 minutes turned into a ruined vacation, thanks to Corsair and the incredibly incapable staff of Sint Maarten airport. First we were checked in and made to wait for hours, without any communication or information on our flight. When we finally made it to Guadeloupe we were 4 hrs late. Then half the plane did not get their luggage, and there were people connecting to Paris. No help from PTP staff either, they just showed us the number of lost luggage service on the wall and told us to call it. My bag is missing for three days now. Yesterday the plane arrived from Sint Maartens but my bag was not on it. This kind of company can only be evaluated on the fact that the pilots safely landed the plane and we made it in one piece, because everything else about this flight was an absolute disaster.

### "Corsair probably won't disappoint"
Not Verified |  Paris to Miami. I was skeptical about flying Corsair after reading very mixed and less-than-stellar reviews, however, I was pleasantly surprised. Our trip (I traveled with my adult daughter) took place during the second week of March 2020 and the Corona virus drama. Check-in at MIA was uneventful. Since it was not a sold-out flight, we each sat in a different row. OK, so the airplane had the look and feel of a discount airline: narrow, thinly padded vinyl-feeling seats, however, legroom was pretty decent and the movie selection wasn't terrible. Food was pretty bad in terms of quality and variety, but I paid $400 RT, so I won't complain. Flight left on time and got us there ahead of schedule, so perhaps my bar is set pretty low, but I was a happy camper. For the flight back from Paris to Miami, we were scheduled for Monday, March 16 2020 .. on Thursday morning I find out about the whole travelers ban, and all sorts of red lights start flashing. I try to call Corsair to move the flight up and their telephone system is terrible. Prior to to leaving Miami, I tried calling them to ask a couple of questions and all the calls were greeted with a pre-recorded message from a call-forwarding system. A day later, all I got was a message that seemed to be recorded by someone at home. That was a very off-putting experience. Similar situation when trying to call their Paris number: calls were repeatedly immediately disconnected. Until the receptionist at the hotel suggested I call the "3917" number (how is a tourist supposed to know that?) at like $0.40 per minute. I was finally able to speak to a representative, who very courteously listened to our situation, took my information, and promised to call me back to let me know what could be done. An hour later she called to let me know that our departure had been moved to Friday, March 13, so Corsair gets major points there! Check-in at Orly went without a hitch and since we were only like 60 passengers in an A330, we had room to spare. This was a different A330, fabric seats and 9 abreast instead of 8 (narrow!). I moved up to the Economy Plus section .. besides a little more legroom and the fact that they recline a little more fully, I cannot understand nor justify the price differential. The seats are the same width and just as thin as those in economy. Flight left about 45 minutes late due (we were told) to immigration issues with a passenger. Cabin crew was attentive, polite, even happily served me an extra couple of lunches when I asked mid-way through the flight (I was starving! ), and had bottles of water, juices and soft drinks on the galley counter to serve yourself whenever you were thirsty. So no complaints there. Overall, we got our money's worth plus plus. If you're looking for something of the caliber of Lufthansa Premium Economy or Business, then you will not be satisfied, but if you're looking for an inexpensive flight that gets you where you need to go, the Corsair probably won't disappoint.

### "Overall good experience"
Not Verified |  Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre. Overall good experience, decent food, friendly service on the inbound flight. Outbound all of the crew disappeared at night, difficult to get something to drink. Some security concerns upon landing in Paris. Crew didn’t check the cabin at all,two teens sleeping in lie flat position until touchdown! No one to wake them up, no one to remind them to put their seat in an upright position, never saw that before . Seats are ok but angled lie flat.

### "friendlier than American Airlines"
Not Verified |  Miami to Paris Orly. We bought our ticket with Corsair because it was $500 cheaper than other airlines, and to our surprise the food and service was friendlier than American Airlines. The airline left on time. We had a one hour delay in our return flight, but that was OK. The seats are like other airlines and food was actually tasty (compared to other airlines) staff was friendly and spoke English. The inflight entertainment was very limited .. and some movies wouldn't work .. so plan to download some movies on your cell or tablet. We really have no complaints. We will fly Corsair again. Thank you for making a flight to Paris a good experience and an affordable one.

### "will never ever fly Corsair again"
Paris Orly to Miami. This airline is terrible. I bought these tickets because they were cheaper and now I know why. First of all, my flight to Paris was canceled with no notification, email, phone call or text from anybody that works at this airline. I had to find out when I got to the airport. On the way home, we went through hell to get onto the plane. They charged us $200 for bags, which I tried to prepay for but I couldn't find any way to do so online. What kind of international airline doesn't give you any free bags? Then, we weren't allowed to take on any carry-on bags, really? We were harassed because we had too many bags (2 bags for 2 people), while people in front of us were going on with two to three bags a piece. A worker claimed that they were "laptop bags". I will never ever fly Corsair again. I will spend twice the money to fly any other airline that exists.

### "don't care about their customers"
Paris to Miami. Unfriendly, only speak French and try to avoid speaking English. They don't care about their customers, you get very little to drink, no English films apart from 1 or 2 if your lucky. Out of date, Tv screens don't always work.

### "Good service in business class"
Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre. Good service in business class. 2-2-2 layout. 12 business class seats in total. The outbound flight was quiet, so each business class passenger had two seats on his/her own. Food was good though I thought they served the 2nd meal a bit too late as I was getting a bit too hungry. Inbound flight business class cabin was full. Service was a bit more hurried but was still good and acceptable. There was only one toilet in business class and at times there was a wait as several passengers from premium economy were coming forward to use the business class toilet. I have no problem with this but Corsair should probably have 2 toilets in the business class cabin if it is too be shared with premium economy. The music albums in their entertainment system were surprisingly shocking. I did know any of the artists and I happen to follow French songs/music. For a French airline not to have any mainstream artists like Matt Pokora, Shy'M, Amel Bent or more seasoned stars like Julien Clerc (who happens to have connections with Guadeloupe as well) is quite surprising.

### "more than pleasantly surprised"
Thanks to an exceptional deal to the Caribbean I had the chance to fly Corsair, a french-based leisure airline. Coming from a neighbouring country I had no clue what to expect and planned on being on a typical holiday flight with minimal service. I was more than pleasantly surprised and had a very enjoyable flight to the Caribbean and back. Check-ins in Orly and Fort-de-France were a breeze, staff on the airline very attentive and full of smiles. Perhaps thanks to the very civilized french holiday crowd the flights were relaxed and quiet. And we were treated with a full meal and drinks of choice (including decent french wine) and snacks before landing. All in all, an outstanding flight experience, which I will gladly repeat at any given time. Highly recommended!

### "seating quickly uncomfortable"
Paris to Pointe a Pitre. Cabin very densified. I chose duo seat for more space. Standard seating comfort but rather quickly uncomfortable. The cabin, dating from 2012, is aging rather well. IFE: old generation and not at all reactive. The touch works with the nail but you have to be patient as the reactivity is bad. The catering is just ok. The quantities are minimalist, even for the eco, the taste is correct when the search for originality is totally absent. The snack (2 brownies) before arrival is a petty joke. FR: Cabine très densifiée. J'ai choisi siège en duo pour plus d'espace. Confort d'assise standard mais assez rapidement inconfortable. La cabine, datant de 2012, vieillit plutot bien. IFE: d'ancienne génération et pas du tout réactif. Le tactile fonctionne avec l'ongle .. mais il faut être patient tant la réactivité est mauvaise. Le catering est tout juste correct. Les quantités sont minimalistes, meme pour de l'éco, le goût est correct quand la recherche d'originalité est totalement absente. La collation (2 brownies) avant arrivée est une blague bien mesquine.

### "airline is value for money"
Not Verified |  Old Boeing 747 aircraft, but clean and enough legroom. Entertainment is very average, but this airline is value for money - what you pay is what you get. I paid round trip 11 hours flight to the amazing island of Reunion 630$, its very good price and cannot complain. Corsair offer solid product, the food is bad on board, but many airlines that offer higher rates, serve bad food as well. Clean plane, good and friendly service and offer enough drink during the flight include wine.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
Paris to Réunion via Mauritius. If you are not French or you don’t speak the language you’re in for a really nice surprise. Nobody in no position will know more than 2-3 words that barely make sense. Somebody was feeling sick so we had to make a forced stop in Rome. I had no idea what was going on. Needed a lot of power of deduction when trying to speak to a flight attendant to understand what was going on. They said we were to get off to refuel just to keep us on the plane for 1 more hour so that we find out that we were not going to proceed to our destination but surprise go back to Paris where nobody knows anything and again nobody bothers with English. We were sent to a hotel after a long wait and cold shoulder treatment (in French of course) after being ping ponged around between check in and their desk where nobody knows when the flight is or what’s about to happen. They put out another announcement and guess what only language they used saying to meet outside for the bus (lucky for me I was one little bit attentive in my French class in high school). One lady at their counter said and I quote “we don’t know probably at the beginning of night “ referring to the flight to take us to our destination. How are they going to give me my days of holiday back when they can’t even point me in the right direction for the mysterious hotel. Avoid this airline at all cost!

### "Not what I expected"
Montreal to Paris. Not what I expected and paid for. I have been flying with Corsair almost every summer for the last few years in Grand Large. I was appreciating the extra space at a price similar to Air Canada full fare economy class, and Orly and not Roissy arrival (more convenient for me ), A1 passage at Orly with the lounge. Surprise: during the last trip, no light purple seats. It was full flat bed but not working properly. Surprise: the crew did not speak french, barely English but Portuguese, and service was almost non existent. They dont work for Corsair, they work for Hi Fly - an unknown Portuguese charter line based in Malta. There was a few real Corsair employees on board but not enough. The turbulences were bad that day and I was crossing my fingers that the pilots were more competent than the stewardesses and that the plane was in working order. As the interior was more East Asia style than european, I did my little research and it was an old plane for SriLankan Airlines. The food was good in Grand Large. The entertainment system was a joke: less than 10 movies. Lucky us we had some on our I Pads (loaded for a Rouge flight). Probably the last time I fly with them. They are reconfiguring their Grand Large for a real business class with beds, decreasing in half the number of seats and likely doubling their prices. Note: for those flying to Orly, massive construction until 2019 (linking Orly Sud and Orly West) with a lot of gates missing and plane transfer by buses.

### "end up on a charter plane"
I paid and book several months in advance a flight with the company Corsair and to my disappointment I end up on a charter plane of a Portuguese company flying from Montreal to Paris. Why pay for Corsair flight at a full price to end up on a foreign charter plane. Entertainment onboard only has old movies that I have seen in flight on other routes several years ago. No relation with the one that is posted on the Corsair site. Moreover the French leaves a lot to be desired on board. My mother tongue being French I myself had difficulty understanding. I call this stealing customers and this is the last time I would travel with Corsair. Pay the price for Corsair and finish with a charter company called Hi Fly, no thanks.

### "getting worse year after year"
Reunion to Paris. Corsair's service is getting worse year after year. Whether it be communication or service. Much of the information provided on the website is inaccurate. The company boasts daily 7am-10pm hotline for frequent users, I called at 8.30 only to hear a message saying they were closed. I sent messages on social networks and never got a decent reply, let alone help. I need to buy more luggage for my trip, the webste announces a total 9 pieces allowed, and the opportunity to book up to 4 from the website, but you actually can book only 2. Onboard the meal was honestly the worst ever (they never are very good in aircrafts but that one was inedible). I even advised a friend who was flying with them a few days later to bring his own meal and am planning to do the same for my return flight. I've been flying to France about 2 or 3 times a year for 10 years and never had such a bad meal before. The tactile screen was old, scratched, and not very reactive, which led the person behind me to push the buttons quite fiercely - it moved my seat and prevented me from sleeping since the screen is attached to the seat in front of you. And while leaving the aircraft, a hostess physically pushed my friend instead of asking him to use the path where she required him to go.

### "first and last time flying with them"
Montreal to Paris Orly. Corsair postponed my evening flight to the next morning. They refunded me 17$ Canadian, saying they only refund expenses incurred before the flight. I asked their customer service to direct me to their policy which I didn't see on their website nor on my boarding pass/booking confirmation, and they stopped responding to me. I live in Canada, and their call centre hours, 9 am to noon France time, make it impossible for me to call them. First and last time flying with them.

### "flight was excellent"
Paris Orly to Saint-Denis, Reunion with Corsair. Very disappointing lounge at Orly Airport, poor food, only bread and cheese and nothing refilled. Plenty of champagne and wines etc. The worst was the very dirty carpets. This didn't look good for our first Corsair flight. The flight itself was excellent, with lovely food and drink and very attentive staff. Looking forward to return journey on 21st November.

### "kind and helpful staff"
Very comfortable flight. The flight departed in the evening and a full meal (bread, cheese, 2 warm dish options, desert, water) with complimentary wine (of good quality) was provided. Arrived early morning in Paris, before arrival breakfast was served. Also, additional beverages were distributed twice during the flight, after the meals. Kind and helpful staff, reasonable legroom and the option to select a seat for a small fee. Inflight entertainment was OK, but very French oriented (just like the messages from captain and crew, delivered in accented and rapid English) The airport at Point A Pitre only uses French for the announcements. Luggage delivery at Orly took quite a long time, but unclear whether the airline is to blame. Overall, a very comfortable economy class experience. If you don't understand French though, you might struggle a bit to understand the announcements etc.

### Corsair customer review
Flight SS927 Pointe Pitre to Paris Orly Dec 13 2013. Due to a technical problem the flight was cancelled. The problem is the total confusion in handling the problem dispatch of passengers information for a flight on the next day. The confusion was worse on the 14th and obviously the personnel in the airport is in dire need of training and requires competent management. The flight was supposed to depart at 18.50. At 21.30 while in the plane we were told the pilot finally had to go back to the airport with a few crew members in order to sort things out: 7 passengers were on board who were nor supposed to be while 7 others should have been aboard and were not! Not withstanding the problem of their suitcases to be sorted out!

### Corsair customer review
Flew Montreal-Orly round-trip with a TGVAir connection on the outbound leg. Outbound was on the 747-400. Cabin had been remodelled. Seating is a bit tight but the seats are well-designed and were fine for a 6 hour flight. Crew on the outbound leg was superb - professional and friendly. Food was mediocre but edible. Passport control upon arrival in Orly was quick enough but I waited for over an hour for my bag to arrive leaving me little time to catch the shuttle to Massy. Return flight was on the A330-330. Seating was the same - sufficient. Food on the return was much better with a really nice wine. Crew was not quite as cheerful but they did their jobs well. The price for these flights was outstanding. I would recommend Corsair without hesitation.

### Corsair customer review
Paris Orly to Montreal return. The business class fare (classe Grand Large) is less than 1/3 of that of a regular carrier. Ok the seats only recline to 130 degrees but the 2/2/2 configuration of their brand new A330 is definitely better than the 2/3/2 which Air France provide in their B777! Excellent food and drinks wide choice of entertainment courteous friendly and efficient service who could ask for more ? ! The only slight disappointment was the badly designed footrest which does not make much of a difference. All in all a very pleasant experience.

### Corsair customer review
Paris Orly to Forte De France dep 22/10/2013 flight SS0924. Return 29/10/2013 flight SS0925. Super airline. Check-in very easy online then printed boarding card then dropped baggage at airport. Total checkin time at airport 10 mins. Boarding was easy do it by children and elderly first then seat number. Big aeroplane. Comfortable chairs reclining with legroom. Inflight entertainment very good and the food was adequate. Staff offered exceptional service going out return journey they were adequate. Great value and more for the money.

### Corsair customer review
Our flight from Montreal to Paris was a great experience and an example of superior customer service. When we checked in at Trudeau I inquired about TGVair. The person at the counter was quick to give us tickets for the shuttle between Orly and Massy TGV. She also put priority tags on our bags so that we would get them as quickly as possible when we landed. That was the case and we were in plenty of time for our train at Massy. All tolled it took us an hour and ten minutes from the time we touched down to sitting at the train station. Now that is efficient. There was a little waiting before boarding that seemed unnecessary and the food is not that good but edible. One thing that they do is serve children first which was fantastic for my 4 year old son. The ticket price is unbeatable and I would challenge anyone to find a lower price for Montreal-Paris in July. I will definitely be using this airline in the future.

### Corsair customer review
Purchased 2 tickets in Grand Large class from St. Martin to Paris round trip. Nowhere in the options displayed are you told that you leave from Grand Case airport in St. Martin. You are not told that you change not only planes but airlines as well in Point A Pitre Guadeloupe. Passengers should know these facts before they purchase their tickets. We rushed to Grand Case to find out that the flight we were on had been cancelled. This left us with 4 hours to kill in SXM and a 30 minute connection in PTP. Luckily our luggage made it. We will not travel on Corsair again if we can avoid it. The service on board was not the best. The seats left a lot to desire their video equipment and headsets are old fashioned. The food was not that great either.

### Corsair customer review
First time on this airline was quite hesitant at first but price was too good to let go. Flew from Montreal to Paris and back on 747. Checked in luggage and had a carry on. On the way to Paris - sat on upper deck On the way back lower deck far back on an aisle seat. Both flights on time (Paris flight was actually early). No trouble with luggage. Food was decent with excellent staff. Overall very nice experience - would definitely recommend.

### Corsair customer review
My wife and I flew business class to Paris from Miami this past month. We found the service to be excellent. The lounges at both airports were spacious well stocked and service personnel to be friendly and very helpful. While we had not heard a great deal about the airline prior to our trip we were quite impressed and would certainly utilize it again in the future.

### Corsair customer review
YUL-CDG. First at check-in I had to wait but staff were friendly. VIP Lounge crowded lots of food choice drinks. and computers available. Was not hungry but soup cheese sandwiches all available. Boarding was chaotic they asked families with children first and Business passengers to follow. What an awful experience had to queue for a long time after children. Very old 747 cabin and plane staff in Classe Grand Large friendly. Nice IFE system with many choices of movies but we had little space. Food was tasteless and I wanted to sleep. Baggage delivery was quick. Corsair needs to update the planes and the Classe Grand large.

### Corsair customer review
Montreal-Paris and back with Corsair was a very poor experience. It is very much a child friendly airline so very noisy throughout the flight. Food not so good and the service was average. My problem is with the airline changing aircraft's without any notice beforehand and therefore my seat reservation. I found out at check-in at which point nothing else was available and I ended up in middle seat as the aircraft was full to capacity. Very long return flight-9 hrs including wait for take-off lane in Orly (45 mins) and another wait for parking lane at arrival in Dorval (45 mins). Orly airport is a nightmare: conflicting info long lines with little management confused staff unmanned desks and uncooperative staff.

### Corsair customer review
Corsairfly Miami-Orly roundtrip was a good experience inflight tourist class both ways. Seats as comfortable as could be expected (on Airbus) food was okay. No movie on overnight flight to Paris but that was a good thing as the cabin was very quiet. Check in at Orly is a nightmare as was security.

### Corsair customer review
Booked online no problems - Paris Orly to Montréal return in "Grand Large". At Orly - the checkin service very poor - they said there were no window seats so I took an aisle - once at my seat - the attendant said the whole row was free! Went to board the plane early boarding for "Grand Large" and was told by the staff/person at the gate that the "Grand Large" section was not ready and I had to wait. Finally after waiting 30 minutes I asked another person at the gate and she said there was no problem to board. All the luggage of "Grand Large" did not make it - arrived 4 days later.

### Corsair customer review
I recently booked a flight from Montreal to Paris with Corsairfly and up till yesterday I was happy with their customer service and price. Last night I went onto their website and I entered my reservation number (wanted to see if I have a supper on flight or not) only to find out that the seat reservations that I had (purposely reserved early to get a good seats) was completely discarded. The company decided to use a smaller plane from a 747 to an Airbus and because of this I now no longer have my seats available to me. I now had no choice but to recontact the company myself only to have them advise me that I have to choose seats over the wing - the only ones left. They never contacted me and I can only imagine what sort of impact this would of had on me if I had found this out on the day of my departure. My group reservation would have been scattered through out the plane. I am aware that the seating is not guaranteed  but come on! I am disappointed that they didn't even try to remedy the situation nor did they apologize.

### Corsair customer review
ORY to SXM and return via PTP. Excellent flight confortable seats good food and drinks services during the flight. Inflight entertainment very good. Staff quality of service rated very good. Ticket price unbeatable !

### Corsair customer review
Paris-Havana Business Class. They call their Business Class Grand Large - a mix between regular and charter flight. Excellent service attentive cabin crew tasty and large meals. Drink service during the whole flight. The seat and the inflight entertainment not so updated as other airlines but better service than Air France and fare is more than half less.

### Corsair customer review
Paris-Orly to Antananarivo return. The staff in the airplane was friendly too. But it seems they were just too busy and it took some time until they came after I pressed the steward-button. The service is nothing special but fair. Food ok and filling. Compared to other airlines that I took before (eg. Emirates) the entertainment is quite poor for such a long flight. The confirmation of the flight back took ages and the lady in the travellers agency (I am not sure whether she was Corsair employee; everything was done by phone) was neither able to speak english nor interested. The way back is via StDenis where all passengers have to leave the airplane (it needs to be cleaned after the trip from Paris). Even if passengers just go in transit they have to pass a security check that takes ages (it is only one checkpoint for all transit passengers). The flight to Paris was as described above all luggage survived (Whereas HLX managed to brake it on the short connecting flight). The arrival at Orly is almost at midnight what can make it difficult to get help on the airport or a hotel. The big advantage of taking CorsAir is the luggage limit of 30kg for the big luggage and the lower price compared to other airlines (at least at this moment). There was no reason to complain about staff I have seen them nicely taking care of parents with babies. Not really good is the comfort entertainment system is poor.

### Corsair customer review
Paris Orly to St Martin West Indies. Check-in staff disinterested. Aircraft an ageing 747 with very cramped seating and no inflight entertainment screens. Food was disgusting cabin crew impolite and inefficient. Thank God the aircraft which should have brought us back went unserviceable and after a four-hour wait without info two British aircraft including a 747 arrived to carry the passengers Corsair would have put into one! I have flown with most European charters and can unreservedly say Corsair is in a class of its own for low quality.

Paris ORY to La Romana (Dominican republic) Economy class going and business class for coming back. At the airport for the two flights check-in and boarding were quick and organized and there was no delay (rare for a charter airline). The plane was a new Boeing 747-400. Seats very cramped food disgusting but cabin crew professional and friendly. Coming back I was in business class which is located on the upper-deck : seats were comfortable with a personal screen food good and service nice. I think the business class of Corsair is not a business class like Air France British Airways or Singapore Airlines but better than Air India or Air Mauritius. Price was only 150 euros more for one flight.

Corsair A330-200 YUL-ORY / ORY-YUL. I didn't know what to expect from them as I had never taken any charter flight before. YUL-ORY. We took off 2 hours late because the aircraft arrived late from Paris. The flight was fine even though I was traumatized by how cramped the seats were. The crew was friendly and the food was good. ORY-YUL. Now that was a complete nightmare. We were supposed to takeoff at 11 am. We took of at 6 pm without any explanations. I had the emergency exit seat this time so the flight in itself was good. Will I ever fly again with them? only if I absolutely have too. I give them 4.5/5 out of 10.

### Corsair customer review
We went from Paris to Pointe à Pitre/Guadeloupe. Let alone the very poor ORLY airport's service (information desk not occupied no signs nobody wants to help you finding the right terminal). On the plane: Seats very cramped food poor films uninteresting. But as the seating space in AF to Réunion to which we are accustomed is not a bit better we took it. Our (direct) flight back was cancelled and brought forward by 3 hours what we learned by chance (!) reading a note on the hotel's pinboard. The plane was very untidy when we got in. And it was not a direct flight; we had a stop- over of a full hour in Fort-de-France (we had to leave the plane and amused ourselves in the duty- free shop) but at least the plane was cleaned there. Result: We started two hours earlier than we had planned and came back to Paris one hour later and were almost too late for our sequel flight from CDG to Frankfurt. Fortunately there seems to be an understanding between AF and Corsair and so even before we landed we were informed that we need not worry: AF was already informed about our delay (thank you staff!) and was willing to book us on the next flight which was eventually not necessary because we got our luggage early and caught the bus by running. Well as we saved 400 EUR for two persons on that flight in comparison to AF and as we know know what we possibly would have to expect we would try Corsair once again.

LAX-PPT not bad. The food was just as exceptional as AF but the FA's were much friendlier and more humorous very attentive to ones needs. And the fare US$590 cannot be beat. The 747 was interesting-looking; a giant set of red lips painted on the side with the word "sex" on the landing gear door. Only problems were that there were long departure delays and the seats while comfortable were very cramped together. If they still flew to Tahiti I'd definitely fly them again.

CRL on Paris to Fort-de-France and return and my worst flights so far. The flight from ORY was delayed of 9 hours without any explanations. Then we had to wait for two hours in the plane after boarding (which was a rush). Their 747-300 are fit with 580 seats (90 more than AF) that's are very cramp and old. I was lucky enough to get a seat in the upper-deck just after the biz class so I had a lot of legroom available but this was the only attract of this flight. The food was horrible and the crew was very rude and only seemed to be interested in getting their break. The way back was horrible (although our flight was not delayed) because of an old 747-200 with even more cramped seats and rude flight attendants (some have even kept their sunglasses during the flight!). I hope no foreigners use this carrier because it doesn't give a good look of France.
