### "experiencing the exceptional service"
On one of my recent flights, I had the pleasure of experiencing the exceptional service of a remarkable cabin crew. Their service made me truly appreciate what it means to go above and beyond in offering warmth and professionalism. This cabin crew was not just doing their job—they were truly caring for every passenger, making everyone feel like they were being treated with the utmost attention and respect. From the moment we boarded, the crew greeted each passenger with sincere smiles. Whether they were guiding us to our seats or answering questions, they were always patient and considerate, making everyone feel at ease. Despite the long flight, they maintained a cheerful and relaxed attitude, making the time pass much faster than expected. Throughout the flight, the crew’s service was even more impressive. During meal service, they paid close attention to each passenger’s needs and even proactively asked if anyone required additional assistance. What truly stood out was the crew’s high level of professionalism. As we prepared for landing, they didn’t rush to tidy up or prepare for descent. Instead, they walked around the cabin, gently reminding passengers to check for any forgotten personal items, ensuring nothing was left behind. This cabin crew, with their genuine smiles, attentive service, and professionalism, made this flight truly exceptional. I’m grateful for this outstanding crew, who made my journey both pleasant and reassuring.

### "staff were excellent"
Excellent flight, great room and staff were excellent. Little English is spoken. I had originally booked Hainan but they cancelled initial booking and booked me to Capital. Very limited entertainment and glad I had a book

### "The service was top-notch"
I recently flew with Capital Airlines from Qingdao to Beijing and was blown away by the amazing service, especially from my flight attendant, Xizi. I don’t speak much Mandarin, but Xizi went out of her way to help me out. She took the time to explain the food, drinks, and entertainment options, making sure I was comfortable and well looked after. Overall, I had a great experience with Capital Airlines. The service was top-notch, and I’ll definitely be flying with them again. Highly recommend!

### "I am thankful for this!"
I take this airline from Hangzhou to Lisbon 8th May. The food is good taste and various. I have stony insomnia problem, and i did not pay attention and lost my sleeping medicine into rubbish. I told the air hostess, she is warm-heart and patiently helped me search the rubbish patiently almost taking 3-4 hours, and finally searched my sleeping medicine. I am thankful for this!

### "Cabin clean and tidy"
Flight attendants hospitality service careful consideration. I hope the Wi-Fi on airplanes will be better in the future. Cabin clean and tidy. It was an unforgettable journey

### Beijing Capital Airlines customer review
Overall quite satisfied with this flight. The service of the flight attendants was very good, very attentive and thoughtful, which made me feel their attentiveness and warmth. The cabin seats were a bit hard, the entertainment system was partially out of order, the movie selection was relatively small, the route was long, and there weren’t enough movies to watch. I am quite satisfied with everything else and would recommend this airline to my friends. 对本次航班整体比较满意。乘务员的服务非常好，非常细致周到，让我感受到了她们的用心，非常温暖。客舱座位有点硬，娱乐系统有部分的故障，电影的选择类型也比较少，航线时间长，电影不够看。对其他方面都比较满意，会向朋友推荐这家航空公司。

### "terrible is the plane meal"
Lisbon to Beijing. The most terrible is the plane meal, the worst of my flights. Although the various conditions on the plane are not satisfactory, the only thing that is worthy of being the service of the crew, who are warm and thoughtful. But if the next time there are other options, I would not take this flight

### "were in excellent service"
Beijing to Xiamen. I used  Capital Airlines flight from Beijing to Xiamen, and I felt that the flight attendants were in excellent service. Although the meals is a sandwich, the taste is quite good, that my son ate three. I ordered coffee, my wife drank tea, which is very traditional Chinese. The plane arrived 30 minutes late, but it arrived on time, which pleased me. It is worth mentioning that, in front of my pocket, there is an tablet computer, there are many videos and movies, it is very convenient. The only problem is that carbin crew sells souvenirs during the flight, but it's understandable that airlines want to make more money. On the ground, Hainan Airlines owns the T1 terminal in Beijing, and the Capital Airlines is a subsidiary of Hainan airlines, so it is also at t1. Boarding pass, checked baggage, boarding is very convenient, the terminal is also very clean.

### "flight was pretty painless"
I took the overnight Beijing Capital Airlines flight from Phuket to Sanya. It was mostly empty, maybe 30 people on the entire plane. They gave me a sandwich but did not have black coffee though. Only coffee with sugar and milk mixed in. The flight was pretty painless. I had to check in at one terminal and then take a shuttle bus back to another terminal to enter the gate.

### "not informed of flight cancellation"
Departed from Singapore and arrived in Beijing on 01 August 2015 at 1440hrs. To avoid missing the Beijing Capital Airlines flight as planned to depart at 2110hrs the same day, we went to the Information Counter at Beijing Capital International Airport to confirm the terminal for boarding. We were only aware and informed that the flight has been cancelled upon checking at the Information Counter. From the flight booking details, it was clearly stated one of my company’s contact number and email. However, the airline did not ensure that we were informed of the flight cancellation. After checking at the Information Counter, a phone call was made to Beijing Capital Airlines to re-confirm the cancellation of the flight and to find out why we were not being informed. No answer was given. In view of our original arrangement in Hulunbuir, we also check with the Beijing Capital Airlines on the next earliest available flight to Hailar. However, all flights to Hailar was fully booked due to peak season. And we were informed by the airline that the earliest available flight was on 05 August which affected our original plan greatly. To minimize the delay to Hulunbuir, we have no choice but to source for alternative flight from another airline, having the earliest available flight on 04 August. According to our conversation with Beijing Capital Airlines's operator, the airline was able to refund our tickets. After made a request of the Flight Delayed Certificate and ultimately we received it after we come back from our trip. Reason stated in their certificate is cancelled due to aircraft adjustment. We were required to write-in to request to claim of our refund and follow-up by some other procedures. However until to-date, we are yet to received a reply from the airline. We find no other way to make our request and was like being ignored. No follow-up action by the airline. I hope someone able to assist on the matters.

### Beijing Capital Airlines customer review
Was unable to find much about this airline in terms of reviews except that it is a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines. My family and I flew with them today from Chengdu to Lijiang China. First impressions of the A319 were good. Aircraft looked reasonably new and was clean. We had fine weather flying across the mountains to Lijiang which made the flight quite comfortable. Was on time leaving and arriving.
