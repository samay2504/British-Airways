### "it was delayed by almost 1,5h"
I had a morning flight and it was delayed by almost 1,5h without informing customers. When contacting their staff, they were not giving any excuses or solutions but were more busy playing with their phones. I lost my connecting flight to Germany and when contacting customer relations for reimbursement, they told me they did everything they could, it is not their fault.

### “said I needed to show my return ticket”
You might pay a little less, but they will be very attentive about finding ways to charge you for everything. They measure your bags and suitcases, check that you don’t have anything you haven’t paid for (even baby carriers). On my UIO-LIMA flight, everything went quite well, but on the LIMA-SCL flight, it was a different story. Even if you ask for water, they’ll only give it to you if you pay for it. But something very particular happened to me. They didn’t let me board the flight because they said in Lima that I needed to show my return ticket from Chile to Quito. They say that they’re ‘clear’ about this on their website because they tell you ‘if you’re traveling to Chile as a tourist, remember that according to immigration requirements, you need to have a return flight. Make sure you meet this condition before your trip.’ I had my return ticket, but it wasn’t clear that you have to present your ticket before boarding. Since the internet at the Lima airport doesn’t work well (only WhatsApp), it wouldn’t let me download it, and they didn’t let me board. They left me there, saying they’d bring a letter so I could leave the airport, but it never arrived. I had to go to immigration and ask them to force JetSmart to send me the letter. Then I waited until 3:30 am for their doors to open (they obviously opened later, around 3:45 am), and they didn’t know how to solve the issue in any way except asking me to pay the fine for being rebooked on the next flight. They said they didn’t have agreements with other airlines and that the only way was to pay the fine. Zero empathy. Think twice before flying with JetSmart. You might save a few cents, but it’s not worth all the obstacles they put in your way to get you to pay a little more. They even charge you for the boarding pass if you don’t have it printed but they do warn you on the website. A terrible user experience, just a low-cost façade to charge you wherever they can.

### "Overall a good experience"
The flight was good and we boarded and landed on time. It's a low cost airline so there were no snakcs or anything included but it was only 2 hours long so I didn't feel the need to buy anything on the flight either. The crew was nice and I paid to upgrade my seat and sit by the emergency exit to have a bit more legroom, that was only about 8 dollars. Overall a good experience!

### "Only one staff, gone for 2 hours"
Many people were waiting in line at the airport to check in. There was only one lady at the counter. She took her belongings and left. Everyone continued to wait, and nobody served them. She didn’t say anything to anyone. I caught up with the lady and asked when she would come back. In 2 hours," she responded.

### “Unfriendly crew”
Unfriendly crew, A320 was new and clean. Flight was on time. Crew was unfriendly and strict. No inflight service you had to buy menu. No IFE, for a short flight they are bearable but a medium-haul flight I would not choose.

### "unable to sit together"
Not Verified |  My husband and I booked our flights at the same time but were unable to sit together because we didn’t pay extra. This seems to be a new trend with airlines that is quite an appalling money grab - like travel post COVID isn’t expensive enough. We asked again at the desk before boarding and were told this is because they are a low cost airline. But the seats are obviously chosen distant from each other by their system. This is after they changed our flight twice and cost us extra by having to travel to a more distant airport. We tried to take their option to change the flight but their website is horrendous and we couldn’t.

### "charged for check-in"
Not Verified |   It was my first time and last time flight with this airline. We wanted to pay for luggage in website and they didn’t accept the card and they charged for check-in because their website didn’t let us to do that and also they charged us for carry-on and also didn’t take from us.

### "staff on board was agreeable"
The flight was correct but the check-in was horrible, very slow , disagreeable people especially at Santa Marta airport. The staff on board was agreeable and the plane was on Time.

### "first and last flight on this airline"
Worst airline customer service in the world. The trip has one stop. I was required to get my luggage at that stop and wait to check in that same luggage until their arbitrary deadline of 2 hours before the 2nd flight. They have numerous arbitrary rules like this and do not care how illogical the rules are nor how they inconvenience customers. This is my first and last flight on this airline. Also, even buying the most expensive seats still meant no reclining seats and they are hard (barely cushioned)

### "the worst flight"
Absolutely outraged with my first and last experience with JetSMART. A simple round trip flight to Bariloche from Buenos Aires with the whole family (2 adults and 3 little girls) was the worst flight. They change the time and airport of one of the sections of the trip, which implied an additional cost of almost 70 thousand pesos in taxis and 1 day less in the destination chosen for the family vacation, Bariloche. The seats on the flight are oversold that is, I arrive at the airport with the whole family from Brazil and they tell me that “there are no longer seats available on the plane”, and that we will have to wait for all the passengers to board to find out If there are places left for us we will fly. They charge for online check in and to reserve seats. Suddenly the credit card with which I paid for the flight is no longer accepted for check in payments. Plane and seats totally dirty.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |   Horrible customer service with no basic morals. With a flight delay and all responsibility being denied, not even a simple sorry or solution given. Seems like what is cheap results to be expensive and this airline is the proof of that.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  JetSmart has horrible customer service! I had booked flights from Medellin Colombia to Lima, Peru through Flight network and when I got (from Medellin w Avianca) to Cucuta in Colombia to connect to Lima, JetSmart claimed I didn't have a flight booked from Cucuta. To make my connecting flight they insisted that I had to buy a new ticket (double the price I had paid for the whole original trip) and had to pay in cash. Or I could book it online and their system didn't let me use either of my credit cards. I had to phone a family member to use their debit card and book the ticket. No one would help me or give me the time of day and I'm still fighting to see some of that money refunded for somehow cancelling my flight from Cucuta - Lima without any notice or addressing of it. I keep receiving their automated response e-mail saying they will contact me within 72 hours and it has been over 3 weeks of not hearing anything back after requesting help several times. Not impressed.

### "I cannot get my money"
Airline changed itinerary and offered a refund to original payment method, which I applied for. Was told it takes 2 months to reach back into account. Called after two months, was told it is being processed, to wait 72 hours. called again, was told it will be another 72 hours. Called again, was told a voucher was sent. did NOT want a voucher, nor received one. All emails from company arriving in Spanish. I do not speak Spanish. Representative tells me to use Google translate. I am told I cannot receive refund, only voucher. I applied for a refund January 4, 2024, it is now March 9, 2024, and I cannot get my money! I am being told a voucher was sent but I did not receive or ask for a voucher.

### "No solution offered"
Cancelled flight. No solution offered. Cost of lost connection exceeds 5000 BRL. Rude and unprofessional service. Solution for food and rest is outrages. Burned bread and horrible accommodations.

### "worst airline and customer service"
DO NOT touch this airline! They will cancel your flight, refuse to refund you then leave you with no choice but to take a voucher which does not even cover a third of your costs! An absolute disgrace and without doubt the worst airline and customer service in existence!

### "Everything was fine"
Not Verified |  I would like to express my gratitude to this company. Our flight cancelled because of some complications. I have never been treated this way with any other company. Cancelation definitely didn’t bother me. They provide us with I think it was 5 star hotel. All the staff was so nice and respectful. They provided breakfast and dinner at the hotel. In the morning they have taken us from the hotel to the airport. Just everything worked out so well for me. Thank you so much for all the care you showed. Also the flight was comfortable. And we got on time. Everything was fine about the flight.

### "Terrible service and customer service"
The flight was delayed for more than 6 hours, they broke my suitcase, leaving it completely unusable, since they tore off a wheel along with the plastic, creating a hole in the plastic. They took 3 months to give me a response and the solution was a gift card of 4,000 Argentine pesos, which today is equivalent to 2 dollars. When the suitcase has a price of 80 dollars. Terrible service and customer service. El vuelo tuvo un atraso se mas de 6 horas, me rompieron la valija dejandola totalmente inutilizable, ya que le arrancaron una rueda junto con plastico, generandose un agujeo en el plastico. Estuvieron 3 meses para darme una respuesta y la solucion fue una gift card de 4000 pesos argentinos que hoy en dia equivalen a 2 dolares. Cuando la valija tiene un precio de 80 dolares. Pesimo servicio y atencion al cliente. el

### "charge u$60 for the baby carriage"
I was travelling by Jetsmart from Brazil to Chile with my pregnant wife (7 months) and our son with only 2 and a half year. I bought 3 tickets and 2 luggages. The leg IGU-SCL occured normal unless 4h of delay. In the return they decided charge u$60 for the baby carriage. Terrible experience all ground staff very rude and unprofessional. Definitely not recommend this company.

### "nothing for free during the 4h flight"
I couldn't fly with them during the departing flight (GRU->SCL): arriving at the airport, the screen said the flight departure time was delayed by 1h30+, so I stayed on the VIP lounge until the time specified on the flight screen. It was wrong. When I got to the gate, flight was already gone. They didn't even apologize for the time being wrong on the airport screen, saying it was "my fault and I should have trusted on the ticket". It took us more than an hour to find their office on the airport, because they didn't have any indication whatsoever. On the return flight, while waiting at the gate, some woman from the airline come to us and asked to see the ticket, immediately saying that we would have to pay for the carry-on luggage "because our seat wouldn't accomodate it". We had already paid for that, they should have done better. She didn't double-check our ticket before I asked her to, but when she did, it was there "carry-on luggage: paid". Seats were terrible, non-reclinable, and there were no inflight entertainment. There nothing for free during the 4h flight.

### "sheer disregard for passengers"
My experience with JetSmart Airline in Peru was an absolute nightmare. The airline's reckless overbooking led to a complete disaster, as they callously replaced my ticket at the counter with no regard for my plans. The lack of communication and sheer disregard for passengers was appalling

### "never fly with this airline"
Not Verified |  If you do not check in and pay for your bags and seat before going to the airport they will charge you double the cost to do so at the check-in window. On my flight from Lima to Cusco I tried multiple times to pay in advance but the website would not allow me to finalize payment. When I got to the Lima airport I explained this and showed my attempts. They understood and allowed me to pay the online rate. Conversely, when the website would not allow me to complete the payment transaction and I explained the issue at the check-in window on the Cusco airport they ignored me and I ended up paying an extra $100 USD more than I would have had their website functioned properly. it was explained to me that the fees had just recently gone up a day or two prior and that in Lima they had charged me the full rate. I find this very hard to accept given that I only paid $30 USD in Lima and $200 in Cusco. I saw the agent I was dealing with giggling with the agent sitting next to her while she was dealing with my issue. Very untrustworthy. Would never fly with this airline.

### "100 euros extra for our luggage"
They take every dollar they can take from you. We had to pay 100 euros extra for our luggage because it was 2cm too long. Finally got a receipt. The luggage was allowed as hand luggage, but for 100 euros / 400 Peru soll extra. Easy earning model. You will also be placed completely apart. If you want to sit next to each other, you also have to pay extra and that is only possible with MasterCard. For me this is the last time with this company. Elke euro die ze kunnen nemen van je nemen ze. We moesten met ze 2e, 100 euro extra betalen voor onze bagage omdat die 2cm te lang zou zijn. Uiteindelijk wel een bonnetje gekregen. De bagage mocht toch mee als handbagage maar wel voor 100 euro/ 400 Peru soll extra. Makkelijk verdien model. Verder wordt je helemaal uit elkaar geplaatst. Wil je naast elkaar zitten dan moet je ook extra betalen en kan dat alleen met MasterCard. Voor mij is dit de laatste keer bij deze maatschappij.

### "never provided refund"
Purchased a flight from CLO-PMC via SCL. Had to purchase this in separate one way tickets. The second leg was canceled. The replacement flight would not allow us to meet our connection. We had to purchase an alternate flight from SCL to PMC. Jetsmart call centre indicated they would provide a refund. However, they then started to ask for banking information and kept on stalling and never provided refund. This element was problematic the actual flight that we did take was on time and checked luggage was not lost

### "worst experience ever"
This is the worst airline I ever used. In the last three weeks I had two problems with them on two different flights. Firstly, they charged me USD$65 for a checked baggage on a short distance flight in spite of their website saying "from USD$13.50". I bought it online, not at the airport. The second problem I had with them was, that they left me at Bariloche airport saying that my ticket has been cancelled in spite of me having my boarding card on my phone! I paid for a checked baggage too and it's all gone. I had to buy another ticked for a late flight and I lost my hotel reservation I had for that night in Buenos Aires. I spoke with them for 30mins on the phone and they were not listening at all. I will never ever use this airline in the future. The worst experience ever.

### "Very poor service"
Not Verified |  Very poor service. 3.5 hours of delay, no compensation. Will never fly again with them. There was no reason given for the delay, nor were they open for any kind of compensation.

### "value for money was great"
Puerto Montt to Santiago. The value for money was great. We got cheap tickets but the processes were all very efficient. No long queues, fast check-in and very friendly staff.

### "very poor service"
Not Verified | Lima to Santiago. Cheap airline but very poor service at the gate they will make sure you pay more for bags. If the plane is empty and you want to change your seat. You cant. Usually always late by 1 hour. There are advantages of paying less but then be ready for the torture. My friendly advice. Don't travel. Pay more and be happy with other airlines

### "really bad experience"
Mendoza to Salta. I had a really bad experience with Jetsmart. First of all, they delay and don't inform customers about what's going on. And second, I flew from Buenos Aires to Mendoza with only a backpack. That was fine, but for my surprise, when I continued my journey towards Salta, they forced me to pay extra $57 due to the size of my backpack, which was the same I used in their previous flight, and had no more than 5kg. I have also used the same backpack for flying in low cost carriers around the world and have never had a problem. In sum, the delay and have very different standards in each airport. Avoid it if you don't want to have surprises and extra expenses with this low cost.
