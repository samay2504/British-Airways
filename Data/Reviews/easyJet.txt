### "no stress at all"
Our aircraft had a technical issue, when we were waiting to board, in the finger. We were asked to go back to gate. Captain met us there very quickly and explained everything. 15 mn later we had a new gate (just close-by) and a new A319. Easyjet took less than 20 mn to transfer our luggage from one aircraft to the other one. We arrived with a reasonable delay in Nice, and with no stress at all. In these situation, that may happen to any airline, you realize what is a reliable company. And Easyjet proved to be one.

### "smooth and comfortable"
Not Verified |  The flight was very smooth and comfortable. The cabin crew looked quite rushed. The only bad thing about this flight is that when boarding some people at the front got on at the back and put their bags in the middle of the plane. We ended up being late because of that. It was EasyJet’s fault because they should have told the passengers. Overall, good flight.

### "the service was good"
Not Verified |  Overall, the service was good. The flight was on-time. The seat was fine for a 2 hour flight. The legroom was actually quite spacious. The tray-table still had a bit of dust and food on it but it was a good flight.

### "the most unreliable airline"
Not Verified |  EasyJet is the most unreliable airline I’ve ever dealt with. Cancelling my flight last minute with zero accountability completely derailed my entire travel route. The lack of communication, support, and professionalism is nothing short of shameful. Their handling of the situation was pitiful and amateurish—like they have no clue what running an airline means. You’re left on your own to figure things out while they hide behind automated messages and empty apologies. Avoid at all costs if you value your time, money, and sanity. This isn’t just bad service, it’s a total joke. Never again.

### "a lot of our clothes were damp"
On April 16. 2025 my partner and I flew from Nice to Paris France and upon departure it was raining. When we arrived at our destination and unpacked, we discovered a lot of our clothes were damp. There is no way both our suitcases could get water in it from sitting on the tarmac while waiting to be loaded.

### “they put me on their last flight”
They changed my flight by 2 hrs and 50 minutes. They had options to fly me at a time close to my original itinerary, instead, they put me on their last flight. When I asked to be put on a flight closer to my original booking, they demanded that I pay ticket change plus fare difference. So, they screw me over, but it’s going to cost me almost the full fare again to fly a time that's not even what I booked? I believe that they do this on purpose in order to extort customers. Why did they put me on their later flight if they could have easily put me on their next flight? Why do they not involve the customer on this involuntary change?

### “Their entire conduct was unnecessary”
I was stopped to check the size of my bag. I have used the same bag time and time again, it was purchased as a cabin bag to be within the size limits and I have measured it myself. I was shocked when the bag didn't fit in the sizing box. I explained that it has always fit before (including on the way out) and asked for someone to use a tape measure on it. My request was ignored and I was threatened that I wouldn't be boarding the plane, so I had to give in and pay. I have taken photos of my bag to show that it is within their given sizes and sent to to their customer service. They have responded to me, ignoring my evidence completely and just reiterated that the bag needs to fit into the holder. There is no mention of the fact that it is actually within size and their sizing box is incorrectly assembled. Also, I am autistic and to be dragged out and threatened that I wouldn't be getting on the plane, in front of all of the other passengers has caused me to have anxiety issues and take medication for it. I wasn't the only person that mentioned how rude the staff member was to them. Their entire conduct was unnecessary. I don't believe that one instance should impact on the reputation of the company, so I went to try to sort it with them first, before leaving a negative review, but it seems like their customer service is just as bad.

### "An excellent short flight"
An excellent short flight, with great onboard service from a friendly & attentive cabin crew. Leg room was ok and the seats were comfortable enough for a short flight. Overall a good experience and good value.

### "they have denied compensation"
Sat 7th Dec we sat in departure lounge for 4 hrs with no information from 6pm. Eventually we board @ 11pm and told we are being diverted to Madrid to change crews. A hour later we are told we are being booked into a hotel in Madrid for the night and flying home in the morning. Then the story changed to the hotel has been cancelled and were booking you into a hotel in Gran Canaria, go collect your luggage and meet us. At 12.45 a EasyJet rep told us " we cant get you a hotel, goodnight and check your app for your rearranged flight home. We watched the staff leave for there booked accommodation. Unable to find a bed we ended up on a beach for the night. Our rearranged flight was originally for 16.00 but left at 17.25. After numerous apologies from the captain we was offered a free tea/coffee or water as a good will gesture but they had no food left as the plane wasn't restocked. Landed 22hrs later. The biggest disgrace is they have denied compensation and blamed air traffic control /extraordinary circumstances (£520pp) Yet two of us have had different excuses I have ATC report confirming they are not being honest I have ATC report showing every flight landing that evening into Gatwick except only one cancelled was ours, including 14 Easyjet flights yet they said it was passenger safety. Easyjet are a disgrace.

### "earn only good reviews or not"
Delay on flight back to Nice for about 2:30 hours however their aircraft was there, keeping the frustrated passengers in gate without anything to offer and responding nothing and most interesting was sending an email to review their service, whatever I was selecting a reply was coming to me to verify that, you rated the airline 5/5 please confirm that. I don’t know was it on purpose to earn only good reviews or not

### “left stranded in the wrong country”
Buyer beware. Our flight left over an hour late as EasyJet hadn’t procured a pilot. Then towards the end of the flight, due to a fault in their aircraft, EasyJet redirected us from Porto (our destination) to Madrid. They held us on the tarmac for over 3 hours, with no food. The head steward was unable to give us any updates, and when passengers complained and asked to be let off the plane, they were threatened with arrest. Eventually, over 5 hours after we’d been due to land, we were given a choice: EasyJet could return us to London, but couldn’t guarantee any available flights to Porto in the near future. Or we could get off in Spain and make our own way. So for those of us who needed to be in Portugal on time, we had no choice. We were left stranded in the wrong country after midnight. The airport is closed at night, which EasyJet did not tell us, so everything was shut and all nearby hotels were fully booked. As such we had to pull an all-nighter, staying on the cold floor of the check-in area with the city’s homeless, until the airport re-opened and we could board an early onward flight via – of course – a different, more reliable airline. You’d think that after this EasyJet would try to put things right. But like the most immoral of companies, they’ve just delayed the claim, denied having any responsibility, and tried to defend themselves by claiming it was force majeure (i.e. a weather event beyond their control). This is nonsense: every single other flight to Porto landed just fine that day, including flights using the same line of aircraft landing within as little as one minute of our attempt. And their only “evidence” of force majeure turned out to be an internal report they’d made up themselves. So I’ve had to take the matter all the way to my MP and Aviation ADR. Utterly reprehensible behaviour by EasyJet.

### "left my mobile in the seat pocket"
Not Verified |  I flew from Belfast city to Gatwick. I claimed my luggage and exit customs but I found out that I left my mobile in the seat pocket of the airplane. I tried to get back but staff informed me that I’m not allowed to do so and I need to go to EasyJet office in departure and they will be able to assist me I went there and I spoke to a manager on bag drop north. I explained the issue and I told her that my phone is very important to navigate in London and to use apple pay, she gave me a QR code that I need to scan and follow the link fill up the information. I said that I do not have my phone to do so and I left it in the airplane and I asked her if she can be able to contact the crew and go to my seat which was 8B and they will find there. She replied by no and I she can only follow policy and I have to go on the website and complete the online form. I again said  to her that i can't do so as I don’t have access to my device, she ignored my request and turned her back talking to another staff member. I again asked of there anything she can do to help and she said will inform the dispatcher and at the end of the day when they clean the aircraft or if someone handed it over and they found it they will contact me and let me know. She was very rude and disrespectful. I was walking out there and one of the  staff Andrei asked what the issue so I explained the matter, he promptly used his walkie talkie and contacted the crew member and located the phone and they asked us to come and collect it which he guided me and I got my phone back and complete my trip happy.

### "Great flight on Easyjet"
Flew Amsterdam to Belfast International on Easyjet EZY3052 and I found the overall experience to be very good. There was a slight delay in take off due to ATC, however not a a major issue. The onboard cabin crew lead by Clark were excellent and very customer oriented. Great flight on Easyjet.

### “incredibly disappointing and frustrating”
Recent experience with EasyJet at Gatwick Airport was incredibly disappointing and frustrating. Although our travel package included carry-on luggage, we were unexpectedly told we had to pay extra due to their confusing two-size policy for carry-ons. The staff immediately pressured us with the threat of missing our flight unless we paid, which felt unfair and unnecessarily stressful. This approach is misleading, unethical, and should be illegal. It’s clear that squeezing out extra fees is a higher priority than delivering honest customer service. I would recommend paying a bit more with a different airline to avoid these kinds of hidden charges and high-pressure tactics.

### "a very bad experience"
I have had a very bad experience with Easyjet so far. The cleanliness of the plane was very bad. There were chips, papers and crumbs on the floor and on the chair. Both flights I booked were delayed. Because of the delay I had to pay extra costs such as drinks (5.50 Euro), food (16.00 Euro), transportation (39.22 Euro because there was no longer transportation from the airport to my hotel by the time we arrived) and late check in charges at the hotel (35.00 Euro). I understand that a delay has no benefit for anyone, but when I sent an email with the request for compensation for the extra cost the delay caused me they didn't even reply to me. I sent 3 emails, a complaint and a request for compensation but they don't seem to care about the customer. It's sad to see how customers lose interest and are not taken seriously. You try to contact them but they don't answer you.

### “planes were clean and comfortable”
My first time flying easyJet, and I had a good experience! Both flights were on-time, the planes were clean and comfortable, and the crew were friendly and professional. A relatively short hop between London and Sicily. The Captains were good at keeping us informed of progress. I ordered some drinks on board, but no food. Perfectly adequate and I would definitely consider them in the future if the price and route are right!

### "gone down in my estimation"
Not Verified | Just to say that easyJet have gone down in my estimation and here is why. The seat room for even a 5ft 4 teeny like me is visibly smaller that I recall from just a few years back. The seats from people in front every time they move, moves with them, and is more flimsy. Not something you want to see on an aircraft really. The staff (and this is the best bit) spoke so fast over the microphone that you couldn't understand a word they were saying and this on the flight back to London included the CAPTAIN! he spoke so fast, he sounded rushed. His words all jumbled into one bumbling garble of rubbish. Not a good experience. Then at the end of the flight you have easyJet trying to give away £60 vouchers to come back, no wonder you need to bribe people when your captain can't even speak properly. Years ago staff were way way more professional, speaking calmly, clearly and with intent and focus. Then even though we landed on time the steps crew to get us off the plane were 10 minutes late.

### “failed to follow through on their promise”
In May of this year, a friend of mine was flying from Portugal to Madrid. At the last moment, EasyJet cancelled the flight, forcing my friend to cover all expenses for transport, accommodation, and a new flight. That night, EasyJet's staff assured her that all expenses would be reimbursed as soon as possible. After a month of claims processing, in June, EasyJet finally agreed to refund the total amount of €485. Unfortunately, we are now at the end of September, and EasyJet has failed to follow through on their promise. At one point, they informed my friend that they couldn’t process the payment because she didn't live in Europe. I stepped in to help and offered my account in Austria to facilitate the transfer. In August, after more than 50 emails and multiple phone calls, EasyJet contacted me asking for my account details. After several attempts, they were unable to process the payment and offered to use the Remitly platform instead. To my surprise, instead of paying the owed amount, they charged my account for the same amount they were supposed to pay! That same day, they claimed this was a mistake, assured me the transaction would be cancelled, and that I would have the funds in my account within days. It’s now been over a month, and not only have they failed to return the money they wrongly withdrew, but they also haven’t processed the original refund, leaving a total debt of €970! People need to be aware of how EasyJet operates to avoid being scammed. If they promise you a refund, know that they will do everything possible to avoid paying. And if they suggest using a payment platform like Remitly, be on high alert—it’s just another trick! It’s disgraceful that a European company behaves this way, blatantly deceiving its customers. Multiple claims have already been filed in the UK, where this company is based, as well as with consumer protection offices in Portugal and Austria. We hope these institutions will intervene and force EasyJet to pay, as it’s clear the company itself has no intention of doing so. BEWARE OF EASYJET! DO NOT GET SCAMMED!

### "Easyjet performed well"
I booked this flight several months ahead of the departure. I had a very early check-in and as such stayed in the airport over night. The check-in was very easy to do and I found the boarding process efficient. The cabin crew appeared to have good language skills. Although this was short flight, the staff worked hard and at that time of the morning, many passengers bought snacks and drinks. The flight departed promptly and arrived on time too. I found the fare quite expensive actually and will in future use a different carrier on the route. Overall, on this occasion, Easyjet performed well.

### "lack of respect for the customer"
Onboard service is fine but the bean counters at head office are destroying the reputation of this airline. The flight was delayed 5 hours due to 'technical issues' with the aircraft but easyJet have refused to honour statutory compensation. This is really poor and my trust in the airline has been broken due to their lack of regard for the rules and lack of respect for the customer.

### "Horrible people and horrible service"
Horrible people and horrible service. The amount of frustration I experienced trying to talk to them is hard to describe, they try to make more money off you every step of the way. Staff are rude and unhelpful. Spend a few more euros and go with an airline that values customers.

### "a shameful experience"
Not Verified |  Such a shameful experience for the airline. The ground service held up a third of the passengers at boarding to "examine" their under the seat bags. No passenger who was checked left without being fine 58€ for faults that appeared on every single bag. Absolutely made up, only to generate more profit for the airline, as no one appeared to have booked extra luggage. Will never fly with them on this route again.

### "refused to compensate me"
They delayed my baggage and refused to compensate me for the delay. When my baggage was eventually found, it was returned damaged yesterday. Their customer service is very terrible too. You cannot access them easily. It is better to go for other better airlines. They may be expensive but your rest of mind is guaranteed. I will never recommend easyjet to anyone. It is a terrible airline.

### "Never again Easyjet!"
Arrived at 13h at Schiphol to fly at 15h. At 14h Easyjet cancelled the flight. I was there with my son and daughter with an organised programme for a short weekend. We had to book a flight 6 hours later and we couldn't fly together. It was very stressful and there were a lot of problems due to the late and separate arrival at Gatwick. Never again Easyjet!

### "cancel flight at last minute"
Not Verified |   Awful awful airline. Leave u waiting 3 hours, called to gate for 1 hr then cancel flight at last minute approaching midnight. Every time I try to fly with them it's a disaster. No one to talk to. Sort yourself out on the 'app' (that crashed BTW)

### "Italian crew was very friendly"
Check-in was extremely messy due to lack of attention from personnel. probably one of the messiest I ever saw with this airline. It seems that their ground staff in NCE is not interested in complying with basic tasks. Be aware of that. 20 mn for baggage drop. Flight was delayed on taking off, but even more on landing due to Napoli lack of capacity to handle summer traffic. Italian crew was very friendly. On return flight, everything went smoother, with a brand new 320Neo,

### "This was a terrible experience"
Our flight was cancelled on our way home from honeymoon. The only option EasyJet gave us was a different flight 3 days later. We had to arrange our on accommodation in Naples that night and our return flight home. EasyJet are refusing to reimburse are flight home and say we do not qualify for any compensation. This was a terrible experience and we are now £2000 out of pocket.

### "Great flight with easyJet"
Great flight with easyJet. Checkin was easy and efficient with professional staff to assist. Boarding was without any issues and a warm welcoming smile from the cabin crew. Decent legroom onboard these aircraft and fast onboard service from the crew. Regular updates from the pilots about route being flown and weather. Cabin crew were friendly and professional and looked immaculate. Faro airport was busy and bags where on the belt when we got through passport control. EasyJet is always my first choice of airline when travelling.

### “Appalling service”
Not Verified | Appalling service, Appalling price for extras Easyjet are by far taking budget to a new level, they charge for absolutely everything they can, the cabin bag size is a joke and the price they charge per mile is extortionate.

### “I think they did OK”
Not Verified | Plane arrived in Santorini with a technical problem. After 6 hours of confusion we were taken to a nice hotel by the sea and had a good meal in local taverna. We were taken back to airport at 10.30am next morning and waited until 11.30pm to fly back to Gatwick. We were paid £750 for our trouble and have claimed comp for meals. The wait was a drag but overall I think they did OK given that it’s a small island with few technical people or full time staff available.

### “appalling customer service”
Not Verified | This airline is fantastic until something goes wrong. They position themselves as a digital airline: what this actually means is you are unable to speak to anyone and/or everything has to be done online. And despite this being far cheaper and more efficient for them (without any thought about how it affects the customer), they have still failed to invest in recurring enough staff to keep up with demand. All this with the backdrop of a £455 million profit in 2023-4. Great routes, great planes but appalling customer service. No one cares.

### "seemed happy to be able to help me"
Not Verified |   My flight from Edinburgh was delayed several hours. I have never, in all my years of traveling, been so impressed with a group of people! I found out my flight was delayed when I tried to check my bags and couldn't. After finding out and explaining that I was making a connection on another airline in Bristol they immediately moved ne to the next flight, which was leaving before my delayed flight, and got me where I needed to go. They did all of this while being completely empathetic to my situation and incredibly professional. They truly seemed happy to be able to help me! I could not be more impressed.

### "were so happy to help"
Not Verified | I flew this airline from Manchester - Paris and Paris - Manchester as we always use this airline for our Paris holiday in December. And I was blown away by the overall onboard service of the crew. They were so happy to help you whenever you needed them, they were never ever grumpy. They were so happy and energetic the entire flight (even after our midnight landing). If you were to pick an outstanding for a 1 hour flight, DEFINITELY FLY EASYJET EVERYTIME. Even during our wait because they didn't open more than the front door, they wood keep you entertained 10 stars.

### “Never travel with easyjet”
We were supposed to travel from Amsterdam to Prague. But easyjet just played with us. We were ready to get into the plane and sitting at the gate. However, 30 minutes before departure they cancelled the flight without any info and no servise. They also did not answer their line. Never travel with easyjet!

### “they were rude and unapologetic”
They could not organize the line in Milan so even though I had paid for speedy boarding, I was at the back of the line. Then they seemed to have oversold the overhead bin space so even though my bag was just slightly too big and it had fit on all the other easy jet and Ryanair flights. They charged an extra 58€. During the process they were rude and unapologetic. I saw this happen to other customers. So best case scenario is you get what you pay for, most probable case is that they nickle and dime you, and give you an unpleasant experience.

### “poor experience provided”
Would rather fly everyday Ryanair, and I think that says enough about the poor experience provided. Get ready for hidden fees, maliciously designed website and terrible customer service experience.

### “insurance is nothing more than a sham”
Not Verified | June 2024 We were subject to the problems with the power cut at Manchester Airport. Obviously not EasyJets fault however there was zero communication from EasyJet. We were simply told to collect our bags and get out of the airport. I had to get back to the UK to photograph a wedding so proceeded to book a flight later that day via another carrier to London and then hire a car to Manchester to collect my car. This was done safe in the knowledge that I'd taken out easyjets travel insurance so I could at least expect to be insured against the massive cost of getting home. Big mistake. Their insurance is nothing more than a sham. PLEASE LOOK TO INSURE ELSEWHERE and if possible use a alternative carrier.

### "Terrible service on every level"
Terrible service on every level. Constant delays, yet the staff are unhelpful or even apologetic. Rude even. Even when paying more for easyJet plus and speedy boarding, you get no more comfort or better service. Terrible airline through and through.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |   easyJet is by far the worst airline I’ve ever traveled with. To date, I have taken 3 easyJet flights, 2 of which were severely delayed and 1 delayed several times only to be canceled at the time of boarding. Things happen of course but it’s how an airline handles situations when they arise. When our flight was canceled no one at the airport was able to offer any assistance, instead, they direct you to their subpar app. They tell you they have no flights available for days when you can clearly see that flights are available when looking. Yes, they are a cheaper option when booking but are they really by the time you pay for your seat and all your bags? No they aren’t. It seems easyJet's mission is to exploit budget travelers with little or no help when issues arise. It’s so bad with EasyJet that when we got to the airport hotel and explained we needed a room because of a cancelled flight, the person checking in said, “let me guess, EasyJet.” Save yourself the frustration and pay the extra couple bucks to book a reputable airline.

### "my family never boarded"
Not Verified |   Unable to review comfort because my family never boarded. The flight was canceled and no rebooking could be made. Airline was completely unhelpful, not offering a rebooking and left my family to fend for themselves with no hotel and no transportation, in the middle of the night. Just "here's your bags, you must leave the airport". I cannot believe this type of customer treatment is even legal. No live customer service line to call, no offers for hotel, no transport, nothing. Everyone was booking other airlines for the next day from their phones at 4x+ costs. This was my first experience with a cancelation from a "budget" airline, so maybe its normal but I just can't express the stress and fear my family went through. Even better, their "refund" fine print says if you elect to take a refund you can't claim further damages, but they give no options to rebook anything - I just don't know how they can get away with that. A 3 hour bus ride out of the country, hotel, different airport and airline 36hours later was only option I had to arrange on my own and expect I won't be compensated for anything. Could have flow first class on a real airline for the sunk costs I ended up with.

### “Terrible experience”
Terrible experience! Robbers Easyjet. One standard cabin suitcase 72CHF extra. We started to board before the airplane has parked on the right place and all the passengers had got out. So we checked in and waiting at the tunnel corridor to the airplane and seeing how the passengers were passing by. They had no time to clean and tidy up. As soon as all the passengers out and we are in. It's a chaos with hand luggages. People at the front had to look for a place to keep their luggage at the middle or back. When getting out it was chaos. Always late. No idea about the schedule. Everything is stressful and quick there with easyjet. Also safety checks and so on, you showed your residence permit with passport is not enough, they wanted to see visa!

### “Wish employees knew their own policies”
EasyJet is a horrible company to travel with a small child under 2 yrs requiring a car seat. We flew with our granddaughter and family on 5 flights during a 2 week multi country trip. My daughter purchased a seat on every airline because her daughter is under 2 yrs old and required a car seat. EasyJet was the only airline that hassled us about the car seat. At check in they hassled her and told her she could not use the car seat. She explained that she bought a seat for her so she could use the car seat. They finally let her take it to the gate. At the gate we tried to check in early as a family when another family did but they refused us and told us to get back in line. When we finally got to the person to let us on at the gate, they told her she could not take the car seat on the plane. She had to explain again that she bought a seat for her to use the car seat. When we finally boarded the plane, the flight attendants told her that her daughter had to sit in her lap during take off and landing and could not sit in the car seat! This is absolutely unsafe for both the baby and the mom. It is the reason a child under two is supposed to be in a car seat on a flight. My granddaughter was confused as to why she was not allowed to sit in her car seat. She was tired and cried hysterically to sit in her car seat. This experience was distressing to the baby, her parents, to us the grandparents and all of the passengers on the plane. The flight attendants did not come by after take off to tell her she was allowed to get in her seat and just let her cry. She continued to cry and scream until she was finally allowed to sit in her seat. EasyJet's own policy regarding children under two is, "Infants sitting in their own seat will need to use a car seat for take-off and landing, and any time when asked by the crew. Wish the employees knew their own policies!

### "To say I'm angry is an understatement"
I have been flying with easyJet since the days when they only had one plane, and I've always defended them to the hilt. Not any more. Today, my flight to La Rochelle was cancelled as I was sitting in the departure lounge, having made the journey to Gatwick from a considerable distance away. The weekend I'd scrimped and saved for just went up in smoke as an apathetic employee shrugged and said 'ATC'. Another passenger in the same predicament was told the cancellation was due to storms in the area; a quick check of a storm tracker showed that this was a lie. Looking at national media, it would appear that last-minute cancellations have been made across the board over the past 2 days with no sufficient, or apparently honest, explanation. Easyjet have ruined thousands of people's plans. To say I'm angry is an understatement. How is this okay?

### “shameful and totally unacceptable”
What shameful and totally unacceptable abdication of duty for customer care. Cancelled the flight minutes before boarding (why leave it so long to do something you know is going to happen). Then provide almost no support or information, other than a bunch of leaflets in various languages except English. Then wait 2 hours to remove baggage from an aircraft that never left, in dribs and drabs and provide no customer service anywhere, including the baggage hall to answer customer questions. Hiding in the back somewhere. Only to receive a computer-generated email 2 hours after the cancellation telling us what we do, when we have already made alternative reservations and hotel bookings. COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE! And shameful neglect of duty for customer care!

### “not use easyJet again"
Not Verified | Had not flown EasyJet for over a year because of constant delays (and flights cancelled). Tried the airline again with a morning flight to Bordeaux which was close to 2 hours late. This company has no respect whatsoever for their clients. I will definitely not use easyJet again!

### "provide a poor level of service"
Not Verified |   Given the basic fare cost with no hold baggage, speedy boarding etc. they provide a poor level of service in all respects. Return flight delayed by well over an hour with no information from them other than gate to be announced. Then a pathetic excuse about an earlier fight delay elsewhere that shows they have no slack in their operations. A pathetic service from a pathetic airline of what has to be the airline of the last resort when no other options exist to travel. The rating of 1 star is not deserved but it will not register zero.

### “flights were comfortable and on time”
My EasyJet flights from Oporto to Ajaccio were generally positive, with a couple of minor bumps. The flights themselves were comfortable and on time, except for a one-hour delay on the connecting flight from Geneva to Oporto. Unfortunately, there weren't any announcements from the ground staff about the delay, which was frustrating. Be wary of the duty-free offers. They advertise big savings compared to high street stores, but I found the same perfumes significantly cheaper (around 5 euros less) in shops on the main street.

### "monetise the baggage policy"
Not Verified |   EasyJet are scammers. We were never informed of their monetise the baggage policy, until we arrived at the boarding gate, and could no longer transfer stuff into hold cases. My 76 year old wife was charged £48 because her cabin bag, which she has used for years and years had become 1" too long, because Easy Jet decided to cash in by making a new "rule". They have done this, knowing full well, and in complete contravention, of the decision by the European Parliament's Committee, to now enforce a cabin baggage rule made in 2014. The European Court of Justice refers to airlines' varied size and weight standards for hand baggage, hidden fees, and misleading consumers about the true cost of air travel. The explanation given, was that the bag was a flight safety hazard, in the event of the aircraft being evacuated. However, by paying Easy Jet £48, the bag was no longer a flight safety hazard, apparently. The other explanation given was that it would not go under the seat, but would have to go in the overhead lockers, designed for that purpose. Which, of course, was exactly what always happened before Easy Jet changed their rules. Incongruously, prior to take off, cabin crew (quite correctly) ask for any significant items to be stored in the overhead locker. Now, if that isn't misleading and monetising customers, then I don't know what is. Easy Jet may seem like a cheap option. It isn't. If you have a problem, and there are often problems travelling, Easy Jet will do nothing to help you. Better, much better, simply fly with a reputable airline. Superficially, it might appear a few pounds more; but, when you need customer service, you are much more likely to get it.

### "sick to death of this airline"
I have been travelling for 5 years, between Hurghada/Gatwick, approx 7 - 8 times per year. I am sick to death of this airline, but unfortunately have no other option of another direct flight, since WizzAir stopped their flights. I need wheelchair assistance which I always book in advance, yet, I am never provided with the service they claim they can provide. The wheelchairs provided in Hurghada airport are all broken & on arrival 3 weeks ago, I was dumped on a seat at the far end of the arrivals corridor & completely abandoned for 35 minutes, until the pilot & crew came past & asked if I was OK. I explained the situation & they kindly went to find a porter with another wheelchair to rescue me. The porters always demand a tip & often rummage through my purse, dictating to me which notes they will take for this 'free special assistance service', whilst also asking me for some of my painkillers, pens, sweets etc. The porters only provide a wheelchair service after you have queued to get into the airport, queued to have your passport check, queued to get through the first x-ray & bag/body searches, 2nd bag search & checked your bags in. They only wheel you to the gate, not down the gangways to the plane, so you are left standing in queues to board the plane for 30 - 45 minutes. My flight back from Hurghada on Sunday 26th May was delayed for over 26 hours & absolutely no special assistance was provided at all to disembark the plane, when the pilot decided to abort take off. I was left to struggle all the way back through the airport again & onto a bus which drove us all the way out to a hotel in Sahl Hasheesh, then struggle to offload my luggage from the bus & in the pitch black, at 4am, all round the huge hotel complex, to my room. No Easyjet rep made an appearance & I only knew when the bus was coming to pick us up to take us back to the airport, through rumours from other passengers. It is also infuriating that on every flight back to the UK from Hurghada, they never have any food. Only 7/10 flights to Hurghada have food available. I am diabetic & had arrived at Hurghada Airport at 6pm for my 8.45pm flight on Sunday. The 1st delay was apparently due to the plane arriving late from the UK. The 2nd delay was apparently due to a crew member being sick & the 3rd delay, was due to a technical issue with 2 of the 3 plane's communication systems as we were taking off. We were all sat on the plane, on the runway for over 2 hours, with no food or drink, only half a plastic cup of warm tap water each. We reached the hotel we were bussed to at approx 3.15am, but there was no food or drink available. All the restaurants were shut. The first opportunity to drink anything was from the minibar at 4.45am, once I had struggled alone to my room. Still, no food had been provided at all. I was feeling extremely unwell by then & tried to call Reception using the phone in the room, but it was broken. The next thing I remember was waking up at about 12.10pm. I struggled to get up & outside to try to find something to eat. Luckily, I came across a fellow passenger who escorted me to a restaurant for lunch. It was the fellow passenger who told me where the nearest pharmacy was & the rumour she had heard about a bus picking us up at 6pm. Arrived at the airport for our 10pm flight, which was delayed until 11pm. Again, no food on the flight. The excuses for flight delays are usually; pilot stuck on M25, crew sick, plane late in, technical issues, etc.

### “the experience was very good”
Not Verified | I recently flew with easyJet, and overall, the experience was very good. The flight itself was comfortable, the crew was friendly and attentive, and the onboard services met my expectations. However, there was a significant delay that affected my travel plans. Despite this, the airline handled the situation professionally and provided timely updates. While the delay was inconvenient, the quality of the service and the positive attitude of the staff helped mitigate the frustration. I would recommend easyJet but advise future travelers to be prepared for potential delays.

### “Horrible experience”
Horrible experience, I will never book with them again. Very unprofessional and incompatible staff. This company is only interested to take money from people. I highly recommend to avoid flying with this company if possible, their services are absolutely below minimum.

### "extremely pleasant staff"
Differently from previous flight boarding process was stressless. Once again extremely pleasant staff. Two pax decided to deboard, for private reasons. Staff reacted quickly and flight was not delayed thanks to their ability to deal with their hand and registered luggage.

### "choked by the repeated announcements"
Perfect check-in, with no stress. Boarding on the other hand was rather disorganized, as after checking our boarding passes, we were parked in a too small room, not fitted for so many passengers, and only a couple of seats. Plane extremely clean with an extreme friendly staff. Even not a free cup of water was offered. But I was choked by the repeated announcements on selling alcoholic drinks at cheap price. Disembarking in Porto under strong rain, no finger, no bus, not even a protected ladder. We arrived completely wet at terminal after a 200 meters walk.

### "a disinterested lazy crew"
Not Verified |   I normally only leave a review if I have something positive to say. On this flight there is no positive except being transported from AYT to EDI. I honestly can't remember the last time I was on a flight with such a disinterested lazy crew. They did one service after take off at break neck speed then disappeared. Apparently they were having dinner! How long it takes to have a ping dinner and a coffee appears to be at least 2hrs 30mins. They were visible individually when they took it in turns to make the long journey from the aft galley to the front galley only to sit down and read a book. Their attitude was quite unbelievable. If I had to base EZY on this flight alone I'd never step foot on one of their aircraft again. Not that they'd be bothered given their management don't appear to take any comments onboard.

### "easyJet failed to reimburse me"
Not Verified |   easyJet failed to reimburse me so I paid for baggage twice! easyJet should be ashamed of themselves. Happy to pocket customers money for their mistakes. You may think that £60 doesn't matter for being duped into paying for an extra bag through your faulty app, however my one way flight (including baggage) came to approx £270 so an additional payment of £60 through the app equates to a 20% overpayment into your pocket. But the principal stands. I'm a frequent traveller and use many airline apps. And that's why I know what you are doing is wrong. After taking the time to raise this issue with easyJet, twice, and after easyJet failed to reimburse me, I'm going to take it upon myself to try and raise awareness because there certainly is an integrity issue on your part.

### "forced to pay extra 48 euro"
EasyJet is not easy to Travel. I am non EU citizen living in Europe since 7-8 years. Travelled with few more airlines inside Europe. EasyJet was not easy this time. My boarding, passport and visa permit was taken long time to verify and they find the reason on my hand carry to not let pass. Was forced to pay extra 48 euro due to the wheel of the carry the size was not fitted according to their requirements. While I was inside the plane and saw similar types of hand carry and surprisingly was allowed without extra fee.

### “so many people are stopped”
The cabin bag size check at the boarding gate is smaller than the requirements stated on the website, so many people are stopped and made to pay for bags that are supposedly therefore too big! I always carry and tape measure and measured the box, 2cm smaller all round!

### "altogether somehow OK"
Paris to Milano 4th April 2024 on a newish A320. Ticket not cheap. EasyJet has very restrictive luggage requirements, particular the minuscules dimensions permitted. In CDG Airport, the Terminal D is quite remote; it took me an hour to get there properly from T1, including busses, several passport, BP, and security checks, makes transit in Paris a hassle. Requirements for EasyJet to board early and check in baggage VERY early is, unnecessarily, very strict and scares people to waste a lot of time by being in gate area by far too early. Flight was delayed 1 hour. Information provided was sparse and unclear. Delays of ½ to 1 hour is more common on this route by easyJet. Onboard staff professional, announcements were good, provided by a Danish pilot called Andersen. Seats are bolstered, good, but can’t recline. Catering onboard expensive. But altogether somehow OK. Will not refuse to fly Easyjet again.

### "greedy extra charges for hand baggage"
Clean Aircraft, comfortable seats, superb flight attendants. The flying experience was excellent and the service was friendly and cordial. Cabin Crew was excellent in their appearance and duties. The updates from the Pilot and First Officer were frequent and helpful. The bag drop process was automated at LGW, but through a sultry human agent at LCA. In LGW during boarding a member of the ground staff immediately took out the POS machine to charge &48 per cabin bag, even though it did conform to their tight frame contraption. So without checking the bags, she tried to grab £48 per passenger. I think that easyJet has to look into this. In the end we were not charged as our bags did fit within their strict frame. Apart from their greedy extra charges for hand baggage attempt, I would say that easyJet is very very good. Two flights in March 2024 LCA-LGW and LGW-LCA in A320s with winglets (G-EJCV and G-EJCR) Will fly with easyJet again.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. We were forced to pay 48 pounds each for the backpacks which, surprisingly, had come perfectly packed on the outbound flight to Edinburgh. The height of ridiculousness was on the plane, after paying because the backpack supposedly didn't fit under the seat, the flight attendant told me that I had to put it under the seat and I couldn't use the cabin. When asked why I had to pay, I couldn't answer. A shame and an abuse to go get money at no cost. Experiência horrível. Fomos obrigados a pagar 48 libras cada pelas mochilas que, pasme-se, tinham vindo perfeitamente acondicionadas no voo de ida para Edimburgo. O cúmulo do ridículo foi dentro do avião, depois de pagar porque supostamente a mochila não cabia debaixo do assento, a comissária de bordo me dizer que a tinha que pôr debaixo do assento e não podia usar a cabine. Quando questionada sobre o porquê de ter tido que pagar, não me soube responder. Uma vergonha e um abuso para irem buscar dinheiro a custa de nada.

### “pay a little extra for a reliable airline”
Very bad experience. Don't go with this company, you will regret. We were charged for extra baggage on the gate just to hear the gate is already closed. Great, and guess what, they don't want to refund us the money for the extra bag. Really not worth it to bother with them, rather pay a little extra for a reliable airline and don't be treated like this.

### “Do not rely on having food”
Hangry! Do not rely on having food. We pre-booked food vouchers (T&Cs: non-transferable or refundable) for our return flight but apparently only the half the food supplies were loaded at Gatwick which the outbound passengers ate almost all of. So there were no hot meals or sandwiches left by the time they reached us in row 6 on the return flight. Surely if we commit to purchasing food on board then EasyJet should commit to having some available or at least sending an email when plane left Gatwick so we could purchase at airport. Got the price of the voucher back but no compensation for going 12 hours without food. Also embarrassed by Gatwick staff at gate concerning a medical bag and seats have very little leg room.

### "Basic but good"
Not Verified |  Basic but good. Flying frequently with so called legacy carriers occasionally I opt for easyJet when times and prices work out and I am always pleased with my choice. This time Nice to Berlin and all was perfect. Boarding well organized, on time departure, crew active in helping (other) passengers to stow their luggage, arrival ahead of scheduled. Luggage on belt when we reached it. It was the best choice we could make for this route, day and occasion. Thank you!

### "rudeness that was quite disconcerting"
I recently flew from Luton to Alicante on January 30th, 2024, on flight EZY2315 (departure time: 15:25). While I appreciate the efficiency of easyJet, I feel compelled to share a concerning experience related to the boarding process. As one of the first passengers at the gate, I observed an easyJet employee who appeared to be responsible for ensuring compliance with luggage policies. Unfortunately, his approach was marked by a level of rudeness that was quite disconcerting. Whether due to a language barrier or personal demeanour, the tone, body language, and facial expressions used towards passengers were far from the expected standards of customer service. I believe in easyJet's commitment to providing a positive travel experience, and I hope this feedback contributes to maintaining those high standards.

### "everything about them is just cheap"
Not Verified |  Outrageous return price from Glasgow to Stansted. Delayed out of Glasgow No information given. No staff at the gate until after the departure time. Got on and off the flight without as much as a hello. Crew just looked straight through customers as they got on and off. Dirty, dated cabin. Enough to deter you from eating or drinking on board. Tray table sticky. On my way home today (one week later). Can't check in early apparently. Be warned there are no seats if this happens and none of the the phone charging points worked on the day. If you have your boarding pass on your phone you're in trouble. This is my first and last easyJet flight. Definitely not budget prices. BA business class would have cost less. Flying used to be fun but with easyJet it was an ugly, stressful unpleasant experience. From my experience everything about them is just cheap. From my experience definitely not budget prices. They won't be seeing me again on their tired looking aircraft with cabin crew to match.

### "Worst experience ever"
Travelled with Easyjet on the 22/12/23 to go home for Christmas from Luton to Paris CDG. My suitcase was lost then located in Luton, allegedly sent on the next flight and finally found still in London. I never had any update from Easyjet and i have tried to contact them everyday since the 22nd. My suitcase contained Christmas presents for my kids alongside my treatment to prevent my seizures. I have now been off my treatment for 8 days (i’m supposed to take it everyday) I’m flying back to London tomorrow and will probably pick up my suitcase where i left it 9 days ago. Worst experience ever

### "Good service in the air"
Great experience from start to finish. Staff were kind and helpful, both on the ground and in the air. Flight took off broadly on time and landed slightly early. Good service in the air; the cabin crew were efficient to get through the full cabin twice with the trolley.

### "Flight was smooth overall"
Busy flight, very full which led to a slow boarding process. However, the cabin crew worked hard to help people settle down and find space for the cabin baggage so that we could depart on time. Flight was smooth overall. Happy to use them again and would recommend to others.

### "thumbs down for service at the airport"
Not Verified |  Flew with EasyJet on flight EJU8629 from Gatwick to Berlin on Sunday 17th December. The flight was perfectly adequate, with the boarding and departure from Gatwick being fine. On arrival in Berlin, is where it fell apart. On arrival at a remote gate, firstly we had to wait over 10 minutes for steps to arrive, and then a further 5 minutes for a bus to arrive to take us to the terminal. Cabin made light of the fact, that they have come to expect this at Berlins new airport. Frankly, if I was paying service fees to the airport, I would be kicking off about the lack of service provided. As a customer, it would put me flying into Berlin with EasyJet into Berlin (flew into Berlin in September with BA and though then had a gate straight away, had to wait 90 minutes for baggie to arrive). Thumbs up for the flight but thumbs down for the service at the airport.

### “Another great flight”
Another great flight with easyJet. Check-in well organised with separate Pluscard desk. Security busy but plenty of lanes open. Boarding well organised with short wait on aircraft being prepared, buses to aircraft from terminal. Warm and welcoming crew onboard. Good selection of fresh options and drinks available, lights put on dim to allow passengers to rest which was good. Decent legroom onboard these easyJet aircraft. Clear announcements from both flight deck and cabin crew. Buses on arrival into Glasgow and immigration was quick and bags on carousel within 5-10 minutes. Always my first choice when flying.

### “flight departed almost 3 hours late”
The flight departed almost 3 hours late, apparently due to fog in Lisbon, then changed to traffic restrictions. Operations shouldn't exist when airports simply can't handle it. One of the cabin crew was rather nervous and stressed out which didn't help, due to the delay passengers get off the plane, then crew needed to check bags one by one with passengers. Everything done professionally but very troublesome. On arrival buses also arrived late.

### "Simple flight, nothing extra"
Flight landed on-time despite late departure. Boarding was too early, so we had to wait in line until arriving passengers disembarked. Cabin crew was friendly. Clean airplane. Simple flight, nothing extra.

### "no device-charging possibility"
Flight delayed for 40 minutes, boarding started and we had to wait in the bus until the crew prepared the aircraft. Slim seats, with extra-payment for larger leg-space seats. Catering only for extra fee - no cash accepted, only card. No inflight entertainment, no device-charging possibility. A low-cost flight which fulfilled it’s job.

### “I will never use again”
Not Verified |  Awful! Flew from Berlin on 26/11/23. After purchasing hold storage space, was told by extremely rude check in staff, that my cabin sized bag was too big and charged €58, despite it fitting in bag measurements guide. Beware! They scam people by including small cabin bags, but have exorbitant charge for having a “large” cabin bag. If you don’t travel often you may fall fowl of this scam. Flight was also delayed, I will never use again.

### "Great experience"
Great experience. Baggage drop was quick, boarding was smooth (speedy boarding was honoured), flight departed on time and landed slightly ahead of schedule. Onboard service was efficient and all staff were friendly (ground staff and cabin crew). Couldn't have asked for more, especially given the great price for the ticket. Looking forward to my next flight with them.

### "boarding was disorganised"
Easy baggage drop at Gatwick but boarding was disorganised. Onboard service was good and flight arrived on time. Seat was cramped and no space for bulkhead passengers to put hand luggage in overhead compartments nearby, so had to store them many rows behind!

### "deceptive business tactics"
Terrible airline with horrible online customer service. My flight from Milan to Prague itself was fine, but it was the issue I encountered a week beforehand which will be the reason I would never fly with Easyjet ever again. I was forced to cancel my flight from Naples to Athens due to an injury I sustained whilst on my European vacation. This flight was not refunded to me despite having purchased their travel insurance they offer when buying plane tickets on their website. When I made the claim they informed me that in the fine print of their terms and conditions, this travel insurance is only valid for Italian citizens. So essentially they sold me a service that they knew would not be valid if claimed by any international travellers. This sort of deceptive business tactics shows nothing less of the poor ethics this company has towards its customers.

### "Never fly with easyJet"
Never fly with easyJet. Horrible customer service in Lisbon. They close their gates 1hr before flight time. So in order to make your flight on time please arrive 3hrs before your departure time. Missed our flight and lady at ticket office was charging us about $300 to put us on the next flight including our luggage price. I told her it’s too expensive so she advised to look online and book another flight. So that’s what I did since it was cheaper and better timing. I arrived to Barcelona to claim my luggage from my missed flight — turns out my luggage was still in Lisbon. Unbelievable. Nice guy in Barcelona did help. Everyone at Lisbon, at least 4 different customer agents did not help at all.

### "Easyjet was ok"
Outbound flight from Glasgow to Faro on 21/10.23 was about 15 minutes late but not noticeable, uneventful flight apart from a young child continually kicking the back of my seat and a parent who didn't know how to parent. Arrived early. Crew seemed upbeat and friendly. Return flight from Faro to Glasgow 28/10/23 was a different story. Faro was a disaster. Check in/baggage drop was at the very far end of the check in desks and was queued out the door. 1 person manning the desk. Eventually someone else appeared then the check in changed to Glasgow and Belfast with just 2 people manning it. The queue by this stage was crazy. Eventually they opened up more desks but took nearly an hour to drop off bags. Next was security, queued out again with only a few channels open. Took a further 25 mins to get through this. Then passport control, once again queued out with only a couple of desks open. I suspect had our hotel transfer not been early we could have easily missed the flight as we only ha a short time after arriving at the gate before boarding started. Flight was ok, apart from the usual lack of legroom and again, though departing a bit late, arrived early at Glasgow. Easyjet was ok but Faro Airport was a nightmare.

### "Charged £48 per case"
Not Verified |   Charged £48 per case at departure gate, because my wheels were too big to fit in sizing box. Never fly with them again.

### “has offered no refund at all”
During flight EZY8035, the 16.35 from Gatwick to Tenerife South on 18th July 2023, the seat (about 13c) of my son was given to another passenger. My son is a full-fare paying passenger (although less than 16 so I am writing this on their behalf). After boarding and takeoff as normal, the seat was momentarily vacated. A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states "The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice. Easyjet has offered no refund at all and closed the case.

### "A very mixed bag"
A very mixed bag. As a party of 4 we each booked and paid for 15kg hold luggage, before departure, I received an email saying we had 23kg. 3 of us had about 10kg and one went for 23kg. bag drop at Bristol was exemplary, machines worked well and helpful staff on standby to assist - no mention of extra fee. Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly. The weather in Bristol cleared, they refuelled and got us there a little 2 hours late, well handled.

### "this was absolutely the worst"
I have flown with easyJet several times in previous years, but this time I had the unfortunate experience of learning about their handling of flight cancellations. First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days. Compared to my experience with other airlines in similar situations, this was absolutely the worst.

### "Pretty poor performance by easyJet"
Pretty poor performance by easyJet at their “focus city” of Naples. Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport’s responsibility rather than the airlines’, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.

### "as awful as it can be"
Absolutely terrible. From start to end the experience with them is as awful as it can be. First, buying a ticket is full of pop ups and weird advertising jumping in your way; glitches and more glitches; their boarding is always last minute; at the entry in the lounge you see the fed up, grumpy, not well-mannered staff; the staff always try to find something on you to charge you extra. On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be £48 extra charge. The only pleasurable person so far was the pilot, could see and hear his positiveness; he was assisting a little the staff in the flight to do their duties; then he apologised to us that he cannot do that anymore as he's got a plane to fly.

### "Another great flight and service"
Early departure from Glasgow. Boarding well organised with Speedy boarding first. Aircraft’s was clean and onboard crew were very professional and welcoming. Some passengers boarded last and kicked up a fuss about bags being further back in the cabin but this was handled very professionally from the cabin crew. Aircraft left a few minutes late due to a slot. Great service provided onboard and clear announcements made from the pilots about route and arrival time. Buses used in Berlin to take us to the terminal and passed through passport control in a few minutes. Bags waiting on belt when we got through. Another great flight and service from easyJet on the ground and in the air.

### “Decent cabin service”
Good flight. Decent cabin service despite the plane being almost full, and landed almost on schedule. Cabin crew were friendly. I would choose to use easyJet again.

### "would have expected some understanding "
From my understanding I booked a flight from Berlin to Milan the day before yesterday. Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet). This is more than frustrating! I would have expected EasyJet to show some understanding for my situation and either let me cancel the wrong booking to find another airline that offers me the right flights at the right times or let me change the flights at no extra fees.

### "incapable of providing me with a receipt"
Not Verified |  EasyJet has zero customer service. This is the second time that I have an unacceptable experience from EasyJet. I added a bag to my trip, paid for the bag, and now I need a simple receipt so that I can get reimbursed by my company. EasyJet is absolutely incapable of providing me with a receipt. I have contacted EasyJet 5 times and they have sent me receipts for my flights, but somehow they have zero financial proof that I added a bag, which means I will not get reimbursed by my company and the charge on my credit card apparently connects to nothing. How are they so incompetent? I've had multiple bad experienced, so I'm done. The cost is not worth the hassle.

### "Overall good trip"
Overall good trip. Baggage drop was quick and easy and staff were friendly. Poor boarding management at Luton airport, however. Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on. Luckily the weather was good outside. During the flight, crew worked hard and service was good despite the plane being full.

### "happy the flight was still going ahead"
Our flight was caught up in the delays caused by the UK air traffic control failure. EasyJet's app was very good in keeping us up to date with the latest status / estimated times of the flight. The app alerted me to potential problems about 5 hours before the flight, when the air traffic control failure first began impacting flights. At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any). At this stage we were all just happy the flight was still going ahead. The flight was full and the staff worked hard providing the trolley service twice during the flight, despite turbulence.

### “ Easyjet no more”
My flight was delayed for almost 3 hours. It wasn't 3 hours was more like 2 hours and half. It almost feels on purpose. This is being constantly happening with my easyjet flights and I'm growing tired, it was the third easyjet flight out of 4 flights this year! But this one just was crazy. It made me loose all the possibility of city connections so I had to take a cab that cost me 70 pounds and took me 2 hours to get. Yet they don't take any responsibility. Enough! Easyjet no more, I prefer to pay 20-50 € more to go on any other company that to ever use you again.

### "Nightmare with a scam airline"
Nightmare with a scam airline. Sitting in the Plane from CFU-BER flight was delayed and could not go to Berlin instead to Rome FCO. In Rome Hotel and lost 1 day of work and lost my connection and had to rebook. I had to spend the night in Rome, lost my international connection for the next day and had to pay for booking another leg one way back to USA. The next day the new flight to BER was delayed again so we made it to Berlin around 8pm and that is a delay of 20 hours. I had to rebook the hotel and flight and was able to fly back to Houston the next day with United. Besides the misery 1 workday lost and expenses to rebook flights and hotel I'm still not entitled for compensation or refund? I will not go into more details about the communication or information in CFU, FCU. Passengers had to run around trying to get any news of info themselves. The financial burden, the 2 day stressful journey and more than 24 hours delay does not entitle me to European Law refunds? I gave up after hours with EasyJet costumer service on the phone and. via email. The conversations were unpleasent and rude with the goal not to issue any refund.

### "more than 24 hours delay"
Sitting in the Plane from CFU-BER flight was delayed and could not go to Berlin instead to Rome FCO. In Rome Hotel and lost 1 day of work and lost my INTL connection and had to rebook. The Rome hotel concierge was smiling when he told me EJ is a regular costumer. The next day the new flight to BER was delayed again so we made it to Berlin around 8pm and that is a delay of 20 hours. I had to rebook the hotel and flight and was able to fly back to Houston the next day with United. I'm still not entitled for compensation or refund? Passengers had to run around trying to get any news of info themselves. The financial burden, the 2 day stressful journey and more than 24 hours delay does not entitle me to an EU payment? I gave up after hours with EasyJet customer service on the phone and via email. The conversations were unpleasant and rude with the goal not to issue any refund. Example it took 2 customer service members to understand my email. To make a longer misery story short...NEVER AGAIN EasyJet!

### "toilets had sticky floors"
Last journey of the day and it showed; there was a strong smell of foot odor in the plane, the toilets had sticky floors. For the first time I saw checks on the size of some passengers' backpacks.

### "experience was decent enough"
Plane was clean, flight attendants were friendly but unobtrusive and the tickets were cheap as can be reasonably hoped for. Leg room was pretty much as expected and a bit of a tight squeeze but it was tolerable given the short flight time of an hour and a half. There were slight delays of about 15/20 minutes but nothing that was particularly notable. It was my first experience with easyJet and I flew without check in luggage and didn’t pre select my seat. My experience was decent enough and noticeably much better than the only real alternative on this route which is to use BA which has always been an absolute endurance test any time I’ve had the misfortune to fly with them. No issues at all and I’ll happily use easyJet again in the future.

### "Flight delayed to next day"
Most awful experience ever. Flight delayed to next day and keeps being delayed when any other company is safely landing at my destination. Never again easyJet

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience with easyJet. 3 hours before our flight we get an SMS that the flight was cancelled. No ground staff offered any assistance or information The only way to find an alternative flight was to get on their app and search for a different flight yourself. We are a family of 4: 2 adults and 2 small children. It was impossible to find any alternative flight on the same day to the same destination with 4 free seats. The app also didn't find any available hotel. Spending a night in the airport with 2 small children is not an option. So we had to find another flight to another destination in another country and pay everything ourselves on the spot. That's not the biggest problem though. The problem is, EasyJet now does not want to take responsibility and reimburse the extra costs, as the circumstances were "out of their control". I understand that bad things happen and flights get cancelled, but as a company, at least offer assistance or reimbursement to those that they leave stranded. I will never fly easyJet again.

### "Delays delays, delays"
Not Verified |  Delays delays, delays. First time I used this airline. Leaving Gatwick and returning. I can understand there can be delays but its the lack of communication that got to me. Why don't Easyjet communicate their problems and solutions so that at least we know what's going on! From what I saw and heard I believe that Easyjet have a shortage of staff problem and that causes all these delays! Customer service is important Easyjet, take care of us and you won't have all these negative reviews

### "deep disappointment"
I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.

### "never going to travel EasyJet again"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight from Amsterdam to London and back. The outbound flight did not take off. When I reached the airport it was delayed by 5 hours and then the board said cancelled. I booked the next flight (a new flight) and went anyway. The return flight was cancelled again (after our being on board for 2 hours) and a replacement flight was arranged on the following day (14 July). I could not afford that delay and took the Eurostar back. I understood that since I did not cancel the return flight I could not get compensated for it. But the onward flight had been a problem with the Airline. I filed for compensation and after 2 days got the message that I was not eligible for it because I did not travel on the flight. A cancelled flight and I was supposed to travel on it. I spent half an hour with an agent with capacity for inefficiency. She took fifteen minutes to grasp what I was looking for. And then she said the outbound flight was Delayed and Not Cancelled. I asked her why the board displayed Cancelled and whether the flight had taken off. She replied she could not say whether the flight had reached London or had taken off, but it was delayed for more than five hours and since I was not on it I was not eligible for a compensation. In the end I gave up. I'm never going to travel EasyJet again.

### "ended up paying $200 just for my bags"
EasyJet is truly horrible. I would never fly them ever again. I was stopped during the boarding of my flight and charged for a cabin bag and that too $58 for a small computer bag. I offered to pay a small fee so I can take it as a cabin bag and they declined, they forced me to take out my computer and carry it in my hand, which was absolutely ridiculous. The reps were unprofessional and would only argue their policy and flat out said if you don’t do this you don’t fly. I ended up paying $200 just for my bags so at the end of the day it was more expensive of a ticket than any other airlines. Not worth my dollars, I would rather spend it somewhere else. Worst airline I have had an experience with.

### "Great onboard service"
Another great flight with easyJet from Glasgow to Malaga and return. Boarding experience was good with pleasant ground staff, boarded on time but slight delay departing due to an air traffic control slot but made up some of the time inflight. Great onboard service with plenty of choice on offer. Cabin crew were professional and helpful. Similar experience on the way back with a delay due to air traffic control issues.

### "axing massively many flights"
Once again, EasyJet has cancelled another flight. This time has been from Rome Fiumicino to London Gatwick. They are cancelling many flights and it seems nothing is happening to EasyJet. They should be seriously be investigated and take the necessary measures to avoid they play with customers. I try to change to another date and customer service by phone were quite unhelpful and little comprehensive. European Union or the right organisation should look into them. Unfortunately, I booked a few more flights with them in the future and I feel really unconfident and stressed thinking about flight with them and would really wish to cancel them receiving the full refund. In fact, they have been in the news saying they are axing massively many flights and ruining holidays thousands of customers. As well, I read on news that their staff are pressured and working over hours. Hence cancellations.

### "customer service was extremely rude"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever, I have to cancel my reservation due a back injury that I'm going to have surgery for. When I informed easyJet of this and asked for a credit voucher so that when I recover from my surgery and able to travel again I can use this to book a flight using the money that I paid for the flight that has to be cancelled. They offered me nothing and customer service was extremely rude and disrespectful. They made numerous lies and insulted me and basically told me to get lost and told me that they was not going to do anything. This is the thanks that I got for years of flying on easyJet.

### "cancelled with no explanation"
The customer service on this airline is disgusting, me and my girlfriend was due to fly today from Gatwick to Larnaca, to get to the airport and all the way to boarding to be told the flight is cancelled with no explanation. There was no staff to explain where to go or what's going on then when we saw an easyjet employee walking past baggage claim we asked what to do to then be told to just go home and ring customer service. During this time we checked other flights and easyjet had nothing till 3 days later that was a 12 hour flight so we booked wizz air to fly the next day, After spending 90 minutes on hold and finally getting through to the most unhelpful employee they must of had in the department I asked them where I send this bill from the new flights to which was £639, I was then told we was not entitled to any compensation not even for our troubles. I just want to add all other airlines were flying out of Gatwick no problems so this was clearly an easyjet issue. This is a 2nd class airline with under trained staff that only care about taking your money, we normally always fly with these and there are always delays but we normally make it to our destination, but as of today we won't be using them ever again.

### "This airline is a complete shambles"
Not Verified |  This airline is a complete shambles! We arrived at the airport, our flight was delayed for 30 mins, We then boarded the plane, when we were all seated the captain mentioned there would be a short delay, due to the tyre needing looked at (which we now know this was just the excuse for not having enough staff for our flight). We sat in the plane for another hour then the captain came back with the real reason why we hadn't moved - we are waiting on new cabin crew coming to the plane and we can't find them! They're in the airport somewhere so please bear with us! Really professional. After 3 hours of sitting on the plane we were then informed that they have found the cabin crew. Cabin crew entered the plane to applause from everyone, however this little bit of joy was not too last. After 5 hours we taxied getting ready for take off then the plane engines stopped and we were informed that our flight was being cancelled! We were then taken from the plane and led through everyone that were awaiting to board other flights like refugees it was embarrassing, when we got to the Swiss port info desk we were then told that easyjet do not have an information desk at the airport anymore, so there was no easyjet rep to explain anything! We were then led to the luggage retrieval belt to wait on our luggage which took a further 2 hours to come out, whilst waiting I noticed young children crying and elderly people so tired and stressed out lying in corners deflated. We were informed by the easyjet app that our whole holiday had been cancelled and we can apply for a full refund (which I'm still awaiting on) and we could claim for compensation. This is were the plot thickens. We got home after 12 hours of stress the next morning I filled in a claim for compensation only to be told a day later that we our not entitled to any because the plane was grounded due to damage on the tyre! Well if that was the case why leave us on damaged plane for 5 hours? This is easyjets legal loophole to get away without paying out compensation claims. I sincerely hope they go bust because in my opinion this company are just about greed, making as much money as they possibly can without a thought of the stress and anxiety that they put hard working families that have promised their kids a great holiday only to have that dream shattered. Easyjet you are a disgrace and I hope that someone/group challenge these unscrupulous people in court.

### "It’s a horrible airline"
It’s a horrible airline. 4 hours before departure they delayed flight and when I was already at airport they cancelled flight. And only one that can offer you its refund. It’s specially helpful when you lost booking on hotel and need to figure out how to get to destination by yourself and buy overpriced tickets!

### "Completely unreliable"
Not Verified | Very poor service. I have had to use multiple times due to being the only option on a particular route but every time my flights have been heavily delayed or cancelled. Due to staffing issues but they lie and blame other factors to avoid paying compensation. No support when flights get cancelled, very poor quality airline. Completely unreliable and with flight cancellations, you'll likely be stuck with no solution and no one to help. Pay a little extra and fly with a different airline or use another airport, it's worth every penny avoiding. Most recent experience, flight cancelled while at the airport after multiple delays (this is the 3rd time of this happening in the space of a few months) with zero support or help, stuck for days trying to travel.

### "easyJet left us stranded abroad"
easyJet left us stranded abroad twice with no money, food, clothing, hotel or way home. They turned off all methods of communication, didn’t answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers. They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven’t been in touch with us at all. They’ve even blocked our social media comments. We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It’s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren’t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help. We went through the airport as normal the next day, and boarded our flight. We were told our flight was full, and therefore only 4 of us out of our group of 8 managed to make it on this flight.

### "mislead paying customers"
A professional disgrace. Blatantly mislead paying customers. Ground staff are oblivious to the term customer service. Delay after delay. No explanation, no apology, just live with.

### "wouldn't want to use EasyJet anymore"
Delay of minimum 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I did the flight from London Gatwick to Cagliari, another hour and an half delay. Last month I flew from Gibraltar to London Gatwick. It was canceled in the last minute. I check on Facebook group and it seems it is quite common on EasyJet this year. They are using always the same excuse. Poor weather condition'. It is a cheap excuse really and an investigation should be opened against the. I wouldn't want to use EasyJet anymore nor wouldn't recommend it so far

### "no mention of compensation"
Not Verified |  I've flown with easyjet a few times before, and never had any problems. Not on 1st June though. At least they told me via the app that my flight had been delayed from 18.00 to 20.50. albeit I'd already set off for the airport. Spent nearly 5 hours in Manchester Airport. Never a pleasant experience, but 5 hours! Apologies from the staff at the gate and on the plane, but no mention of compensation, refreshments etc. Landed at Venice Airport too late for my courtesy shuttle bus or for public transport, and had to get a taxi to my hotel - cost 50€. Got to bed so late that wasn't fit to do much the next day, so day wasted. Now applying for compensation.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. Since when easyJet reduced the size of the bags that we can bring on the plane, seems that the only objective of the people that are working on the on-boarding, is to make money! Shame on you, especially the operators at Napoli airport.

### "Beware of this company"
Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the "delay" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023. This makes a minimum total of €562.99, which I will never give up. Beware of this company.

### "flight landed in a different airport"
Not Verified |  If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as "exceptional circumstances", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so naïve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me. It is appalling to see a company preferring the petty value of my £300 ticket to a longer-run customer satisfaction and good publicity.

### "not entitled to change the flights"
Not Verified |  They canceled my Stansted to Belfast flight, they offered no assistance at all, they handed out a leaflet and left us abandoned. They told us there were no flights for 4 days and its tough. they have canceled or delayed in excess of 12 hours 3 our of the last 4 flights I have been on. They did not highlight the changes in my bookings part of their app. they sent a single email to inform me of the changes. of the changed times of flights half of them were no longer any good to me. I could not amend the flights in the app or my bookings in the website. When I called them to change the flights to times that did work I had to queue for 22 mins to speak to someone, when I did speak to the man he told me he could not change the flights as his system "the tools I am using are not working you will have to call back". I then queued again for 35 mins to get through to someone who then put me on hold for a further 7 mins. she told me I could only change a single flight and then I would have to call back. easyJet sent me a single email changing 12 flights and then didn't allow me to amend to flights that worked for me without 12 queues of up to 35 mins. Eventually they told me I was not entitled to change the flights because they changed the flight by less than 3 hours. I had to pay not only the fare difference but also the change fee making booking a new flight cheaper than changing the flight.

### "the flight was canceled"
Not Verified |  We flew with the family from vacation. Departure should be at 23.10. Check-in for the flight began at 22.10. Departure was postponed for 1 hour. As a result, about 1 am the flight was canceled. The pilots could not fly. No one explained how we could fly away. We settled in a hotel at about 4 am. Then another hour and a half, my son and daughter-in-law on the phone figured out how we could fly away.

### "Delays, delays, delays"
Delays, delays, delays. Always when I use easyJet, the flight is delayed. Now delay 1 hr sitting in the aircraft and don t know how long yet to wait for departure! Late boarding- actually started later then scheduled time etc. Horrible company.

### "They are not trustworthy"
Paid 53 euros to alter my flight due to an announced cabin crew strike in Portugal affecting the day I would originally fly. I have to be in Lisbon on that day since I have a flight connection. They then cancelled all flights for which the strike is due and gave the opportunity to affected passengers to freely reschedule their flights, get an reimbursment or a voucher. In my case, they don't think I should have my 53 euros back on top of 66,99 euros for the original flight, because, as per theirs 'expense claim' reason for not paying: 'The transport claimed is private arrangement as you made changes to your flight yourself so we will not be able to reimburse your claim for transport. It is not a private arrangement, was booked through their website, for another one of their flights, on a day where the Portuguese cabin crew strike is not happening. It only happened because their cabin crew announced a strike in Portugal. I had problems before with them during the pandemic. They are not trustworthy, other low costs work much better than them.

### "follow their rules"
EasyJet is a solid reliable airline in Europe as long as you follow their rules. The app is the best APP I’ve utilised, making flight changes simple. The airport experience is automated as much as is possible, but staff are around to assist and ensure you follow EasyJets rules on bags, sizes and boarding. Boarding is simple with 2 queues, one queue for those who pre-booked a large cabin bag, and a second queue for those who only have a small rucksack/handbag. The flight experience is comfortable and predictable, the crew are polite. The food available to purchase is excellent. Bags arrived quickly. Overall this is a low cost airline, but well organised and rules it clearly presents during the booking process. For cheap point to point in Europe it’s excellent. I would always strongly advise downloading the app as any flight disruption is best managed using the app.

### "the worst airline ever"
Easyjet is the worst airline ever, flight EZY6582 16/05/23 from Rijeka to London Gatwick was canceled after checking in and waiting for the plane at the gate. It is not possible to get information about accommodation or alternative flights for that day, another flight after 4 days was offered - it sounds like a mockery. I do not recommend EasyJet to anyone and avoid this airline if you can.

### "Truly the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Truly the worst airline I have used and I have used plenty of bad ones but this was by far the worst experience I have had in all my years of flying. We were at the airport since 9:30am as we were meant to fly at 11:30am. Just after going through security we were told there was a 1hr delay on the flight tracker. By 3pm we were still waiting with no updates or anything only the flight tracker. Finally the plane lands around 3:30pm and we were able to speak with someone but we were told no flight till 10pm now so have to leave security area. We waited etc 10pm comes and goes now flight saying is delayed till 1am. At about 11pm 1 person comes and tells us flight is now canceled due to staff having finished their flight hours. They made us wait all morning, evening and part o the night before we were told flight was cancelled. I was calling customer service as there were no easyjet representatives, they had no clue what was happening, when we finally spoke to someone at the airport they didn't have a clue either if were even were going to fly the next day or anything. No communication with passengers, no proper updates on what was happening. They had 1 poor representative trying to sort hotels out for over almost 200 passengers. It was just a complete shambles and an utter mess. Will never in my life be flying with such an incompetent airline.

### "Easyjet is not worth it"
Worst airline ever. Staff are rude and random in their “approval” of baggage. Flew in on Aegean - pleasant amazing. Easyjet is not worth it. Pay a small amount more and get better service and free food

### "nothing was clean"
Not Verified |  Do not use this company. Completely unorganised staff, spent time chatting about personal plans. No food available, nothing was clean and easyJet staff in dubrovnik airport absolutely shocking, so rude. Never again, unbelievable the attitude.

### "certainly fly with Easyjet again"
I chose Easyjet only because I needed to fly from Gatwick to Berlin. This is the second time I have flown with Easy jet and both times have been great! Ticket price came with Speedy Boarding not sure how many are allocated each flight. This flight seem to have quite a few. I live in Australia so we don't have this. Once onboard lovely crew and comfortable seats. Flight left and arrived on time. Check in quick and efficient. Will certainly fly with Easyjet again.

### "Staff extremely rude"
Horrible experience. After 1 hour delay I was asked to pay 40 pounds for carrying a plastic bag with 2 items. Staff extremely rude. The plane half empty so no "overweight issues

### "stranded with no help"
If I could give 0 out of 10 I would! Myself and two friends were due to fly back from Prague last April when our flight was cancelled an hour and a half after it was due to take off. There were no customer service agents on site to assist us getting home or finding accommodation, just a text telling us our flight had been cancelled, no apology - nothing! I had to spend money on food, beverages and a hotel room for the night. EasyJet reimbursed me for the food and beverages (the lowest of the two claims I submitted to them) no problem, but when it came to the hotel room they kept rejecting my claim telling me my receipts and invoice were invalid because they didn't have my name on which is ridiculous. I seriously recommend avoiding this company as they clearly don't care about their customers and are fine leaving them stranded with no help whatsoever!

### "crew very professional and kind"
Easyjet is most of the time a safe option. In this instance, the flight was on time, airplane was clea, modern and silent. The crew very professional and kind, as they always are. The only issue, which is valid for most low-cost airlines, was the boarding process, which have the passengers wait standing up on stairs standing by for the bus which will take you to the aircraft.

### "I would advise anyone to avoid this airline"
I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (£49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me £47 for the first flight and £15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around £22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me £85: £22 (initial payment) + £15 (Large cabin bag ) + £48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers. So, I would advise anyone to avoid this airline.

### "worst company with bag policy"
The worst company with bag policy. Even if the luggage was in the dimensions given in the website I got a fine of 48 euros. Do not consider consider to choose this company over a bit more expensive companies.

### "never fly with them again"
I have flown many low cost airlines including Ryanair with no issue, but I have never had a good experience with easyJet. I have flown with easyJet 20+ times but a staff are always rude (clearly not trained at all in customer service) and flights are delayed. This time round was the last straw. Not only was the flight delayed (again), the gate agent was extremely rude and unpleasant. I will never fly with them again.

### "trouble-free journey"
No complaints. Smooth and attentive service . Comfortable seats and food good. The flight left 45 minutes late and arrived 7 minutes early. Luton Airport isn't the best airport but I guess they have to base themselves somewhere so if it keeps the prices down then I will cope. Thank you EasyJet for a really nice, trouble-free journey - I will be back!

### "disturbing experience"
In the end the flight turned out to be ok, but the start was a disaster. We were checked and queued for quite some time, without being able to board. One man collapsed and needed emergency medical attention. The ground staff were overwhelmed and completely useless in this situation. It eventually turned out that the flight crew had to be replaced as the previous shift was already overtime, but no information was given, not a single announcement. I had the impression a group of amateurs were given the assignment to perform the boarding, very disturbing experience.

### "Pay attention when you book a ticket"
Not Verified |  It is clearly stated many times what the allowance is when booking and explained over and over. When you book a ticket, you have a basic ticket with only bring on a small bagpack that must fit under the seat in front of you. If you want to add a cabin bag, you pay for it. My flight was fine, i knew the rules and travelled with only a basic ticket which include the small bagpack under the seat. Cabin crew friendly and buy on board plenty of choice. Pay attention when you book a ticket.

### "Terrible, rude customer service"
They send you online boarding pass, let you feel everything looks good until you get boarding, they start to charge you all you bring, because you have no chance to use checked-in luggage service, be cautious with this airline. Air fare are great because they charge you $48 for a regular carry on, $158 for a medium size luggage and $48 for backpacks or over the arm bags. The only thing included is a kauv type bag or man purse type bag. Terrible, rude customer service.

### "Terrible, rude customer service"
Airfare prices are great because they charge you $48 for a regular carry on, $158 for a medium size luggage and $48 for backpacks or over the arm bags. The only thing included is a kauv type bag or man purse type bag. Terrible, rude customer service.

### "Really rubbish customer service"
Not Verified |  I had paid for an additional bag to take into the cabin. However when I arrived at the gate, they said the bag had to be dropped at the counter. I said that I had made a mistake and that I thought I could take it into the cabin. They said that I should repay (48€) to have it dropped next to the plane so that they could put it into the plane. I had asked, can you not make an exception and leave it next to the plane so that they put it in? She said, no you have to repay and then said, leave it next to the plane so that they put it in. A joke! Really rubbish customer service, always late and dishonest!

### "luggage rules/measures are very confusing "
Not Verified |  The check-in and security check was perfectly fine, both processing and staff. The hand luggage rules/measures are very confusing and are obviously created to make people pay for an extra fee. Also the construction of seats with a frame beneath doesn’t allow regular hand luggage - although this frame (that might be necessary) could most probably have been constructed in a different way. Discussing this matter with the personnel at the gate at Rome (FCO) got very emotional and wasn’t professional at all.

### "never had a problem with any other airline"
Not Verified |  I have always travelled worldwide with my hand luggage suitcase, I have even worked for an airline and I have never had a problem with any other airline. My actual suitcase was brought as hand luggage dimensions requirements, only to find when boarding my flight from Manchester to Ibiza, a man, was standing where we pass with the boarding pass holding a credit card machine and stopping everyone with a hand luggage that didn't fit in which looked like a child size baggage gauge and apparently easyJet don't allow the wheels or handles to be included in the dimensions stated on their site. I wasn't the only one questioning this it looked like an easy money racketeering business going on threatening passengers that they cannot board until they have paid.

### "passengers were simply left stuck"
Flights delayed by over 1 hour and the airline crew decided to leave all the passengers stranded on the aerobridge that connects to the plane. With no update and communication, all the passengers were simply left stuck with no access to water.

### "aren‘t good with their customer service"
I booked a flight to go to my grandmas 80th Birthday and they just canceled the flight. I wanted a solution and the only thing they said was to go to their homepage. The next flight available would‘ve cost 1000 CHF. They just aren‘t good with their customer service.

### "a fee for £39.99 before the boarding"
Unfortunately there is no chance that everything will be as planned with this company. I travelled from Amsterdam to London with a backpack which was fine. When I travelled back to Amsterdam with a backpack and a small shopping bag (bought clothes from the airport) they add me a fee for £39.99 before the boarding because I had too many bags on me. Since I am allowed to shop from the airport, why am I supposed to fit everything I bought in the airport  into my backpack? They told me “I need to pay” and “its not debatable” and the customer service were quite pressing on that. Next time, this company is going to be my last choice over the other flight companies.

### "easyjet don’t care"
Nothing wrong with the flight but rather than arrive at Gatwick north we arrived at Gatwick South. No announcement from the crew or anyone. So there were passengers left confused, late at night, in the wrong terminal with their connections, greeters and onward arrangements screwed up. A simple announcement or warning by the crew would have helped. But easyjet don’t care. And their pricing is despicable.

### "Departing from Amsterdam was unpleasant"
Departing from Amsterdam was unpleasant. The plane was delayed. First, all the passengers were sent down the stairs to the holding area H2, then told to go back up to H pier corridor as there might be a gate change. Hardly any seating in H pier so I had to stand for ages. There wasn’t a gate change so we all went down the stairs again. This meant that I had to put my official EasyJet size cabin baggage into the frame twice. Each time it fitted of course but I had difficulty getting it out again each time. I arrived safely at Luton Airport more than an hour late. The return journey was punctual but at the departure gate I had the same problem with my cabin baggage, the ground steward came across as rather aggressive. There was a long wait on the stairs before boarding. This airline flies me to Luton near to where I need to be.

### "The plane was not clean"
The plane was not clean and the crew threw the garbage (used and dirty tissue paper that was on the seat, under the seat, being rude when alerted. One of the crew members mentioned that she didn't even want to be there working, she wanted to be at home but they called her at the last minute. Avião não estava limpo e a tripulação atirou o lixo ( lenço de papel usado e sujo que estava no banco, para debaixo do banco sendo rudes quando alertados. Uma das tripulantes mencionou que nem queria eatar ali a trabalhar, queria estar em casa mas chamaram-na à última da hora.

### "fight will begin for compensation"
Absolutely disgusted how they simply abandoned myself & a plane load of passengers at Paphos Airport at 11pm  on 8th March 2023, with the instruction of "we have cancelled your flight, you have to find another way to get to Bristol, you have to find your own accommodation & sort your own way of getting there". We had to go and collect our cases & leave the airport. Earliest flight back to Bristol is Wednesday 15th, so another week at my expense as I found a Jet2 flight then. The fight will begin for compensation when I get back.

### "Would definitely recommend"
Not Verified |  Extremely convenient flight times. Departure was also on time. I liked the practice of serving complimentary glasses of water during a national heatwave, despite most of of their American counterparts charging for a cup of water! Seats were also nice and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.

### "Hats off to the team"
Had a difficult boarding due to a mix up with luggage tagging by ground staff. There was also a young couple with 3 children who needed to be sitting together. The flight manager handled all these mishaps excellently and kept updating passengers in a calm and collected way. She also sorted out the family seating very efficiently. Hats off to the team for making our flight so comfortable.

### "flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed"
Not Verified |  It's several years since we have flown with any other airline but easyJet, which I think speaks for itself. We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the "Speedy Boarding" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.

### "Aircraft was clean and good legroom"
Flight departed on schedule and arrived 20 minutes early. Well organised boarding in Gran Canaria with separate speedy boarding. Cabin crew were very professional, friendly and welcoming onboard. Bar services where quick and frequent with everything available that I asked for. After duty free service cabin lights were dimmed to allow us to rest. Aircraft was clean and good legroom, even in standard seats. Clear information given from pilots about route and weather at Glasgow. Bags were on the belt waiting for us getting through immigration too.

### "don't recommend this money-hungry airline company"
I live in London and my family is in Izmir. I fly London-Izmir frequently in the last 2 years. First time ever additional £40 was charged for my cabin baggage that I always use. It is a standard one, I bought it from Samsonite just for flights as cabin luggage. This is definitely wrong what you are doing. My total trip London-Antalya, Antalya-Izmir, Izmir-Antalya, Antalya-London (4 flights) cost me £140 and just the cabin luggage extra charge cost me £40 because it didn't fit into your small (not standard) measurement box. The luggage measurement in their app shows my luggage is ok but in the airport, they charge an additional huge amount. This is not ethical and can't be legal too. I will never fly again with EasyJet and don't recommend this money-hungry airline company.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience. Starting from the start of the journey from the baggage drop, I was asked to pay extra and yet wasn’t informed that I would have to pay extra for my cabin bags. Later, at the boarding I was asked to pay extra and then wasn’t even given an answer when I questioned about the same. Also, the lady at the counter was extremely misbehaved and didn’t talk or attend us well. She was more and more concern about the money being paid, and once we were quoted a specific amount to pay she all of a sudden increased the charges. It’s extremely disrespectful of her and a complete shame on the airlines how they treat their passengers. Are bags were very well going to fit in the required measurements. But still we ended up paying 106€ because no one was INTERESTED in listening and resolving the concern.

### "told by staff that my bag was too large"
I’m boarding an easyjet flight from Berlin to London and just had an extremely unpleasant experience at the gate. I have been told by staff that my bag was too large and I would have to pay for it. When I put the bag in the easyjet own measuring device showing that the bag clearly fitted the allowable size, she refused to look, just demanding that I should pay. Thankfully, a second hostess came by, recognized the error and took us in.

### "Very unreliable airline"
Not Verified | Really bad airline. Rather than provided accurate information eg flight is delayed until x just kept providing an estimate of when the flight is to land. Never ever been on a flight with them that is on time. Very unreliable airline.

### "EasyJet lost my bag"
Not Verified |  EasyJet lost my bag. I had to fill an online form for lost baggage. They gave updates on the bag status for 3 weeks. Post that the status was removed. No compensation was paid. The airline staff was helpful at the airport however they were Ill treated by various contracted service providers of easyJet. Besides this the airport facilities provided by easyJet are horrible. One has to check in ones luggage at the checkin. The instructions on the checking machines are inadequate. These machines fail to scan the bar codes on the boarding passes. The only relief is good and helpful staff but the numbers are too low.

### "refunded 10% of the money"
Not Verified |  Do not use this airline. My flight was cancelled and they refunded 10% of the money and refuse to investigate where the remainder is. For the last 2 weeks they have used delay tactics to send me back to the bank. Even my bank has said they’re delaying the refund. How can 1 of 8 refund transactions go through but 7 don’t. Now Easyjet refuse to investigate it further until I get a letter from my bank saying they don’t have the money. So, either I’m a liar or my bank are apparently? I’m pretty sure this is illegal, delaying a refund like this.

### "impressed with the value for money"
Not Verified | Flew from Bristol to Alicante with easyJet for a quick weekend break, more spur of the moment trip, and was impressed with the value for money and the attentive service received despite the flight being late out of Bristol and not arriving until early hours Sat morning. Seat 1E by the window was clean and with extra space and priority boarding was welcomed. Two drinks came to about £10 which was good considering it was an alcoholic beverage. Really happy flying easyJet and will recommend them 100%

### "I do not recommend this company"
Not Verified |  I do not recommend this company with incompetent employees who only know how to trick you into taking your money. I checked in with my husband and I was entitled to two checked bags and the lady at the check in said that we can get on the plane with the smaller bag and up at the boarding gate another team from this company is waiting for you to collect the luggage once more, it's unbelievable how many thieves there are! The people at the bottom of the check-in prepare the loot for the people at the top who charge you to pay for your luggage twice.

### "crew very friendly and professional"
Not Verified | Edinburgh To Fuerteventura. Very cheap fare. Boarding well organised. The crew were very friendly and professional providing a fantastic service throughout the flight. Would not hesitate to use again.

### "I am very disappointed with them"
Really bad and poor customer service and manage booking system. I had booked two EasyJet tickets for a flight this Christmas from Uk to Spain. I tried to add a selected seat today Nov 26th for one of the passengers, which included an extra large cabin bag and other different perks. Unfortunately, their system when you tried to get one of those selected seats, it does not allow you to continue with the process without buying obligatory another seat for the other passenger even I do not need it. So I decided to contact them by chat to see if they can get me a solution. After expending 30 minutes chatting with the customer service agent, he told me that he can provide me with this service but £5 more expensive than the website price. I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers. But never more, even I was one of the people affected by their famous data breach and never claim anything because I have been using Easy Jet for a long time and always I had good service. But not anymore, I am very disappointed with them and I encourage other people to go for different airline companies. EasyJet never again.

### "Better than other low cost airlines"
While booking it all seems to be a very nice airline mainly because its cheap. I flew from Berlin to Amsterdam on November 18, flight EJU5107 seat 12A (exit row). Immediately I noticed that the flight was seriously delayed. During boarding, the easyJet ground staff is very unclear about who should board first. Nothing was announced either. As a result, it turned into chaos. After I boarded the plane, certain staff seem to speak very bad English. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, this becomes dangerous when there's an emergency and you need to communicate. I have flown with easyJet on a regular basis and all easyJet flights are always delayed (over an hour). Therefore I'm not recommending easyJet, especially for passengers who have a transfer where there is a high chance that they will miss their flight. The good thing is that the seats are very comfortable. Better than other low cost airlines.

### "good transport to get from point A to Point B"
It is a low cost company, and the review must me written according to the services they offer, very bad support on the ground team, was afraid my suitcase did not arrive, a bit confusing boarding, lots of time stranded in the access to the plane. Overall a good transport to get from point A to Point B.

### "great holiday thanks to easyJet"
Not Verified |  Myself, Wife and 12yr daughter old flew with Easyjet holidays to Fuerteventura from Bristol for a week in 29th Oct to 5th Nov. Excellent flights out and back, plenty of leg room also. Flight crew were very good although food and beverages were expensive. Slight delay going out and ATC delay of 45 mins coming back but time was made up with tail wind. As easy jet holiday booked, we each had 23kg of hold luggage and small carry on bag. cannot fault Easyjet especially if you follow the rules and do what you are required to do. Covid certificates were not looked at going or coming back. Passports now stamped in and out of Fuerteventura, just like the old times. All in all a great holiday thanks to easyjet, and all for £1117 all in for the 3 of us.

### "Clean plane"
Please note that since Brexit your purchases on UK economic operators are subject to international processing commission and stamp duty, freely set by your bank and not reflected in the invoice issued by easyJet. The company started operating in Lisbon's Terminal 1, which, despite the general infrastructure of the airport being terrible, is always better than Terminal 2. Clean plane, boarding by bus far from the door (next to Terminal 2), minimally friendly crew, compliant with timetables, with boarding starting one hour before departure. Bus employee at the airport extremely friendly and charismatic.

### "no responsibility for their lack of customer service"
Not Verified | Four people in our tour group made our own reservations for a trip from the US to Paris. The travel day began with the initial flight and then Easy Jet reservations were made to fly hours later to Lisbon Portugal. We landed on time at CDG airport and received notification from Easy Jet that our flight to Lisbon was delayed for 90 minutes. No issue there for us - just a bit more time to stretch our legs. The communication from Easy Jet came in a text. I still have a picture of the text received. We arrived at the gate prior to the original departure time to find that the flight was only 11 minutes late and because we were not at the gate two hours prior to the original departure time we were not allowed to board the airplane. The gate agent would lend absolutely no support. We were not the only passengers that were left that day. We each purchased our ticket and a carry on bag for the flight. There were no other flights from CDG airport available to Lisbon that day which was not an option for us as we had to meet our tour group. We each had to make reservations for TAP Portugal out of Orly Airport - about an hour Uber Drive from CDG. This expenditure cost each of us nearly $400 - the Uber Drive, the last minute flight and the baggage. I reached out to Easy Jet upon our arrival home. The emails have been non-stop with sending our information, picture of the text message received and basic pleading to have our money refunded. We were only issued the tax on the flight which came to $19.06 Euro. We will never travel Easy Jet in the future. We will share our experience to whoever will listen and get the word out that this company takes no responsibility for their lack of customer service and their lack of communication. The deal we received in booking this reservation was excellent so in good faith, reimbursing each of us would not have broken the bank for the company. We are VERY disappointed and do not want anyone else to experience like we did.

### "Was told that I checked in late"
Completely unreliable and dishonest. Checked in for my flight 2.5 hrs in advance. Was told that because I checked in late I couldn’t be guaranteed a seat on the flight that I’d booked and paid for, but they would try to put me on one of the departing flights for the day. When booking with easyjet just be aware that paying for a ticket in a flight doesn’t guarantee you a seat on that flight.

### "it does the job"
As is usual for us Easyjet got us to our destination and back without any great fuss. It's a No frills airline and that's what you get but it does the job. If you follow their rules they are as good if not better than other no frills airline. I would have marked it higher other than for the lacklustre performance of staff at BCN check-in. Been using them since they started and have already booked two flights for next year.

### "rendering the vouchers useless"
Not Verified |  My flights were cancelled flights due to Covid. For this I was issued travel vouchers (listed below) however valid until 31/10/22. However, when I have attempted to apply the travel vouchers to new bookings, the screen reads that I must contact their customer service. Such a thing is impossible as there is no number to contact anywhere on their website, rendering the vouchers useless. If easyJet enable their promise to be fulfilled by extending the vouchers and making them actually usable, I would withdraw this complaint.

### "don't pay for extra services"
Dodgy tactics to milk your money, never pay for extra services, you won't get anything extra. The only good aspect will be low prices if you are traveling alone with small or no bags. I've traveled with them 6 times, the first 2 times I paid for the speedy boarding + cabin bag, but was shocked by the complete chaos in boarding where everyone was boarding at the same time either standard or speedy, and I even couldn't find a place to put by bag (all was taken), had to put away from where I sit although I paid extra for an overhead cabin bag. The next 4 times, I just opted for the standard service as everyone apparently was getting the same service, and used the same cabin bag every time. On my most recent one, the flight was delayed almost an hour, stood in the queue for a long time then when boarding started the employee asked me to get out of the queue to fit my bag in the scale, at this point, I was extremely exhausted and didn't want to lose my place in the queue so told her I will just pay whatever the extra cost to get on the plane. So paid extra money for the same cabin bag which I've been using for the past 5 flights with no issues Bottom line, don't pay for extra services, and don't use this company if you are traveling for business or important appointments

### "Will definitely fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I've flown with easyJet about a dozen times, and always had a good experience. The flight from Manchester to Malta and the return a few days later were again very good. Booking, checking-in and boarding were all straight forward. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and the planes were clean. We took off and landed bang on time. Will definitely fly with them again.

### "suitcase does not fit their regulations"
Not Verified |  They want you to pay more money for the hand luggage, because your suitcase does not fit to their regulations. I was flying with 2 little kids (11 months old) and 3 years old. And I was breastfeeding and at the same time talking to my eldest one. And of course my mask was quite often a bit below the nose and this man was shouting at me. That was super unpleasant flight.

### "cancelled less than 1 hour before"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Geneva to Brussels on 28 august was cancelled less than 1 hour before flying, without giving a reason. We were asked through the airport speakers to find a hotel. No assistance or clarification available. No contingency whatsoever. We needed to purchase new tickets from Swiss for over 600 euro to get home the next day. Reimbursement, if any, is limited on their flyer to be maximum 220 euro. No news yet after one month. No help, no assistance through their UK help line. This is a joke. EasyJet treated us worse than cattle.

### "I will never take EasyJet again"
Worst experience of all. When flying from Amsterdam to Berlin, there was more than 2 hours of delay but they did not give any compensation (drink vouchers), which was stated in the Terms & Conditions. On my way back, there was another delay of an hour due to which was triggered by their technical fault. The cabin crews were extremely unfriendly:  I will for sure say that I will never take EasyJet again.

### "money grabbing management"
First time I fly easyJet, I didn't think to check reviews, we were only going to Glasgow and it is just a quick long weekend. So we didn't care to dig into the airline assuming it is the standard stuff. But boy we were wrong, we took a Friday flight 30th of September EZY885, was supposed to take of 18:05, but only took off around 18:45 or something like that, thankfully, we had nothing planned. Then on the way back on the 3rd of October Ezy6414 @ 9:15, they decided my standard bag was too big for the cabin, because apparently on Feb2021, they shrunk the seats and the cabin size even more, and charged me £24 for it. That bag was half empty, I could have brought a smaller one had I known. Why are they going against standardisation? They actively want to catch you, the lady there could have let it go, it's not like that money goes to her pocket, but some people enjoy letting others down. They must hate their jobs immensely (customer service is difficult, especially with money grabbing management that are paid 6digits compared to people in her level with 1.65bn revenue). My guy friend is 6ft, he had his legs squashed there, I feel terrible, I didn't think he might need leg space.

### "extremely unreliable and very rude and clueless staff"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever, extremely unreliable and very rude and clueless staff, treating people with no respect. We had a delay for 18 hours for a reason they wouldn't tell us and couldn't care less for the passengers - the worst!

### "try to avoid flying with EasyJet"
Not Verified | 4 flights in 5 days. Journey was from Tel Aviv to Lisbon and back. One connecting flight in Geneva and on the return connecting in Milan. Each of the 4 flights had a delay. Each time was another story. Was traveling with a person considered as Special Assistance, but none was provided by the airline at any stage. All in all, EasyJet might be good to fly from one place to another, with no need to connect flights. For us, it was really cheap but had it's price by the time/delays and by the service. We will highly try to avoid flying with EasyJet.

### "gave me absolutely zero alternative options"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 2.5hrs. There was a multiple car crash enroute to the airport so my 30min drive turned into 2.5hrs but I left early enough that I wasn’t worried and that was for the non-delayed flight. I arrived 9 minutes after check-in, they wouldn’t let me in and gave me absolutely zero alternative options. As I frantically searched other flights I found my easyJet flight was 2 hrs delayed so again tried to get on my flight, was told that apparently I missed baggage drop by half an hour, this was 1.5hrs after the check in I had modestly missed, sorry 1.4hr as I was 9 mins late for a flight that was 2 hrs delayed! !

### "the worst customer service"
Hands down the worst customer service I have ever received. Lost our checked in luggage and it took nearly a month to lodge a claim as they dont answer phone calls, avoid responding to emails and in general don't care about their customers. After going round in circles for 4 weeks we finally managed to lodge a claim but had no response since. We will make sure never to fly with this airline again. We have flown twice with them and both times flights were delayed by almost 2 hours without any explanation given.

### "They went above and beyond for a budget airline"
Not Verified |  Highly recommend. EasyJet went above and beyond. We had to emergency land in Munich due to sick passenger on the way back from Sharm to Bristol. EasyJet put nearly 300 of us up in a hotel, arranged taxis and paid for our food all day. The only thing we need to claim is taxi fare, every thing else was paid for. They went above and beyond for a budget airline and didn’t leave us stranded like lots of bigger named airlines. I can’t thank them enough. Staff also went above and beyond. 5 stars to easyJet.

### "beyond disappointed in the service"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight to return from Basel to Amsterdam. This flight was cancelled and EasyJet made no effort to notify me. When I checked in to my departing flight, I saw on the app that the flight was cancelled. I called to have my flight rebooked to an earlier flight and explained my frustration at the fact that no one had contacted me in advance. I was told that my seats would be rebooked for the new flight to the extra legroom seats I had before. The next day I called again to explain that the reservation does not have me in an extra legroom seat as I paid for and asked this to be corrected. The person on the line was not willing to refund my fee as I that would mean I would also have to give up the cabin baggage allowance I also paid for. I explained to him how frustrated this was for me as a customer, and at the end of the call he asked me to hang up on me before he hung up on me himself. This is a poor example of customer service, and if the trip wasn't so last minute, I would ask for a refund and take my business elsewhere. I am not responsible for the flight being cancelled last minute and I made all the arrangements in advance to ensure a smooth trip. I am beyond disappointed in the service I've received and will consider this when making future reservations.

### "still no compensation"
I really do not recommend EasyJet. 2h35 delay on a 45min flight, and still no compensation. This is really not proportional. They kept us waiting without giving any information, in a room without any location to buy food or water. Terrible journey with EasyJet!

### "they tax you 28€ per bag twice"
Worst flight company ever. Flight was delayed. Small carry on bags with the exact size they mention when buying the ticket is not  respected as they oblige you to try to fit your bag in a much smaller box and even if it misses by 0.5 cm they tax you 28€ per bag twice on both your roundtrip flight

### "Will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this airline, after waiting over 8 hours at Rhodes airport, with no information no staff no offer of water, our return flight was cancelled, had to find our own accommodation at 3.30 am and pay for it and the taxi, flight rescheduled for the following day at 4.30 pm. Once again waited around as flight delayed, no information, finally board flight, had to wait an hour and a half for take off on the plane, finally take off, told plane has not restocked with drinks etc. Finally land then had to wait nearly two hours for our luggage to be released. Applied for compensation for my cancelled flight and expenses which has been rejected as it was cancelled for extreme circumstances - ie Gatwick would not give them a landing slot the previous evening. So having spent over £400, in extra expenses due to EasyJet they have paid any compensation, I’m sure they must have to be compensated by Gatwick for having to keep their pilot and staff for longer. Will never fly with them again. Do not use them.

### "Worst airline I used so far"
At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a "Oh sorry sir", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened. It only hurt for a bit, it's not like I want monetary compensation or anything for that, but yeah a cup of coffee could have made it up for almost everything. Worst airline I used so far, don't recommend it, I certainly won't be using it ever again.

### "militant fund raising exercise"
Not Verified |  My paid cabin bag was 1cm too long but several cm below the height and depth limits. However the ground staff would not let me bring it on the plane and it was sent to the hold with a 30 euro excess. On the plane the luggage racks were half empty. This militant fund raising exercise is ridiculous. I had bright the exact Same bag on the incoming leg a few days earlier. Oh, and both flights were over two hours late.

### "I had to pay for the hold luggage"
I purchased 2 tickets and paid for "Standard Plus" . The speedy boarding and hold luggage was included. This was shown on our boarding passes When I arrived at the gate the employee of easyjet insisted that I had to pay for the hold luggage. I showed him the boarding pass showing that I had paid for speedy boarding etc. He said that was irrelevant as his records showed that I needed to pay. As I had to board the flight I paid for this. Following this I found proof of the previous payment and showed him, but he said it was "too late now and I need to apply for the refund.

### "definitely avoid them"
The flight was delayed for 2.5hrs, causing us to miss our bus (which had a 90mins buffer for the original arrival time), we then had to book alternative travel, which cost as much as the flight ticket. Instead of 27e and being home before midnight, we spent 180e+ and were home at 02:30 am. Contacting easyJet to get some sort of reimbursement is a nightmare, apparently getting reimbursement for a delayed flight isn't possible, the reason given, because it was delayed. The delay according to EasyJet was extraordinary circumstances, according to our pilot these circumstances were EasyJet running an overfull schedule that Gatwick could not service, and EasyJet not having staff to service these flights. The impression I'm given by easyJet's communication then is that it's my own fault for having incurred additional costs on arrival because I choose to fly with EasyJet. I used to love EasyJet before the pandemic, but now I, unfortunately, must advise anyone who considers them to definitely avoid them.

### "Customer service is non existent"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed for two hours, when we finally got off the ground I was tired and hoping to sleep through the 1.5hr flight. However, all 5 air hostesses were sat right behind us gossiping loudly. After about 15 minutes I turned around and asked if they could keep the noise down a little, as I was tired and trying to nap after the delayed flight. In response I was met with hostilities, one of the hostesses telling me I'm not in a hotel and shouldn't feel so entitled. I couldn't believe it, and they continued to say nasty things about me and my partner for the rest of the flight. Even when we were leaving the plane they decided to make snarky jokes about my partner to her face. Absolutely no consideration for their customers and even happy to insult their customers in front of them. Customer service is non existent with this company, but if you'd like to be verbally abused throughout the duration of your flight and pay for the privilege, go right ahead. Myself, never ever again, absolutely disgusting.

### "a very unpleasant experience"
I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen). When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled "hands off" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit möchte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gepäckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgebühr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zurückfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly hätte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon verspätet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gepäckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgepäckstück sei zu groß. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gepäckmessanlage passte er von Höhe und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke überschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gepäckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu spät, ich muss zahlen oder das Gepäck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal über die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andrücken exakt die Maße eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine Hände und schrie ,,Hände weg" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben müsse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit dagegen vorzugehen. Insbesondere der Kundenservice behandelt die Kunden hier wie Dreck. Entweder man bekommt als Mail eine Antwort mit Copy&Paste FAQ's oder auf Instagram wird behauptet man könne da leider nichts tun. (Wo ein Wille, da ein Weg?)

### "no space to put bag overhead"
I paid extra for hand luggage bag and front seat. Still no space to put bag overhead. When asked the crew, he was useless and as discourteous as he could. Just pointed me to plane asking to look for space.

### "luggage missing for 8 days now"
Not Verified |  Once and never again. Totally unfriendly check-in, luggage missing for 8 days now, no reaction from easyJet, no one can be reached personally, just standardized mails and tape announcements. Calls itself a digital airline, but can't even find a piece of luggage that has been digitally recorded in the system

### "waiting for the money to be transferred"
Our return trip in May 2022 was cancelled while we were at the airport. I applied for a refund. Refund was approved. Still waiting for the money to be transferred into my account

### "EasyJet have no customer service"
EasyJet have no customer service. I was at the airport early. I had already checked in and all I needed to do was a baggage drop. I was good for time and then EasyJet staff were calling for people to come forward first for the Faroe islands and then for Copenhagen, which allowed them to skip the line and go ahead of me and other passengers. I subsequently missed my flight to Tel Aviv and now have booked with KLM for that evening. EasyJet customer service has been a disgrace to deal with and I wish that after 2 calls to your call centre and emails I was given zero customer support.

### "I won’t use them ever again!"
Not Verified |  Shockingly bad! Just avoid this airline if you care about peace of mind. Their customer service is useless. The only training they have been given is to tell lies, waste people’s time and give meaningless and insincere apologies. I won’t use them ever again!

### "Absolutely the worst"
Venice to Paris. Absolutely the worst. They canceled our flight with less than 24 hour notice, and then had NO one at their counter to offer any assistance. We were told to manage our own booking using their app, which they didn't have another flight for 3 days. Their "claims" department is a joke, no one will return any messages regarding our request for compensation.

### "never use this company again"
Take very good care at online check-in. I had purchased cabin baggage when I bought my ticket. At check in I opted for a seat change. I did not add cabin baggage because I had already bought it. Upon confirmation I found to my shock that my cabin baggage had disappeared. It was no longer possible to change that. Customer service was useless. I was forced to buy hold luggage at an additional GBP 28.49 because cabin baggage was no longer available. This is the worst airline scam I have ever fallen prey to and I will never use this company again.

### "the Worst airline by far"
Easyjet is the Worst airline by far that I have flown. Standing in line here at Tivat airport in Montenegro for 1.5 hours waiting for boarding as the monitors say boarding on time at 1:30pm. At 2:15pm the terminals are still saying on time departure at 1:30! Not a single easy jet rep around to even ask a question. Even easyjet's website says departure at 1:30pm and on time even though it is already 2:15pm. Pathetic is an understatement! Lat time I am flying with these guys.

### "Very uncomfortable seats"
Last time i fly with them. Very uncomfortable seats. Even with extra legroom which i booked. Plane crew even didn't let me to stay with my coat in my legs they said everything must be in the locker, no bag nothing. They are saving on everything. Why did i pay for extra legroom i dont know.

### "forced to pay £24 to check my bag in"
The cabin bag I regularly use on EasyJet flights just didn’t quite fit in the cage. In my opinion the dimensions of the cage were out of tolerance. I asked for a tape measure to check but was told none was available. I was forced to pay £24 to check my bag in and threatened that the flight would leave without me if I didn’t hurry up.

### "No communication with customers"
Milano to Mallorca. The flight was delayed with 2 hours. We were supposed to leave Milano for 20:30 but we took off only at 22:30. The flight was shorter than 1500 km with two hours of delay for European regulation the airline company should have offered us drinks and snacks and kept us up to date with the reason of the delay but nothing of this happens. Our understanding is the airport was missing staff. When we asked to the hostess in charge for drinks and food she answered we left Milano at 22 when it was obvious to everyone it was wrong. EasyJet is always running late, is getting worst. No communication with customers, they rarely respect European regulation on delay - disappointed.

### "No information, no help"
Berlin to Rijeka. Flight was suppose to be at 1840, it said on boarding gates C17, that it was delayed to 2020, at 2020 they told us the flight was cancelled without anything else, somehow we got to know the flight pilots maxed their hours. Unbelievable, how can this even happen they have planning people? Somebody forgot a bag at the gates cause the personal kept yelling go go go, he needed 3h to get the bag, which was just 1 floor higher. Insane. No information, no help. Never fly easyJet again.

### "EasyJet you have earned my money only once"
Worst budget airline that I had ever flown with, irresponsible and rude ground staff, being told I was late to arrive at the boarding gate and denied my boarding, in fact no boarding gate information showed on information board except flight delayed, no English announcement calling immediate boarding and expected those foreign passengers to understand Portuguese. However if compared most of the incidents of flight cancelling seem common for easyJet, I would say at least I still got flight flew back to the destination. Well EasyJet you have earned my money only once, you definitely would not be my option again if choose to fly.

### "Truly awful experience"
Not Verified |  After being delayed by over 2 hours, they were too late and diverted to Nice, dumping everyone in France as opposed to Geneva, Switzerland. Told by cabin crew that we would be bussed to GVA, but only one bus for all passengers on a full flight. Told that there were no more busses and 'find your own way' - at 02.30 and at least a 2 hour drive from Geneva! No taxis available nor hotels. Truly awful experience - I bet the flight crew got hotel rooms. Absolutely no support for over 100 passengers stranded.

### "no cabin crew to operate it"
While waiting for our return flight, 10 min before embarking, the announcement said that the plane was here but there was no cabin crew to operate it and it was unknown when of if one would be available.

### "I cannot praise easyJet enough"
Not Verified |  Sadly I have recently had to cancel my and my husbands flights in September due to me having an ongoing serious illness. Although the T's & C's state a voucher would be offered, I explained that even though you have a year to book your next flight that unlike a heart attack or surgery I will not be in a position to do this week into next year. Although it took me 2 emails and one phone call hanging on for 25 minutes without reply, the 2nd call was answered within 10 minutes and the extremely helpful young man whom I spoke to was very very helpful and discussed this with his managers and they agreed to grant me a refund due to exceptional circumstances, I cannot praise Easyjet enough for their prompt action which has taken a huge amount of weight off my mind. We have always found them an exceptionally good airline to fly with and not experienced any delays. Our last flight was in April just before my diagnosis and it was completely problem free and even landed early both on arrival and return. I would always recommend them above any other budget airline Easyjet you have a big thumbs up and thank you from me.

### "Cancelled our flight"
Not Verified | Paris to Bari. Cancelled our flight without notifying us, offering 0 alternatives. We had a tightly scheduled honeymoon, visiting multiple cities in Europe, lost 200$, because of this. They lost a customer, will never fly easyJet again

### "Customer service is a joke"
Here's a total con by Easyjet. Flight from Glasgow to London is delayed by 2 hrs. Due to depart 9.15 does so at 11.15. We land too late to make next flight out of London. Easyjet insist they have zero responsibility as we arrived 1.35 mins after time published for arrival so under the 2 hrs. They can get away with this by grossly exaggerating arrival time. I wondered why they were saying this short hop took so long, now I know. They are dishonest and bordering on corrupt. We had a horrific time at Gatwick, met with disdain by the most unprofessional person I've ever met. Told to rebook missed flight for 2 days later and pay transfer of £120. No assistance offered and absolutely no sympathy. Stayed in a hotel and flew with TUI the next day. They were wonderful in comparison. We all need to write to the transport secretary instead of Easyjet because they couldn't care less what customers are saying. They keep issuing lies about helping customers as much as they can but this is more corrupt nonsense. Why their staff put up with this chaos is beyond me, they should all follow their Italian colleagues and walk out. I hate to see jobs lost but I'd actually be happy to see Easyjet no longer exist. The people responsible for the current debacle wouldn't suffer of course. Customer service is a joke when you eventually get through and app in no way resembles what is actually happening on the ground.

### "they've permanently lost a customer"
Not Verified |  Webpage to change flight times does not work. Cannot contact by phone. Cannot get response by email. I'm out a hundred quid and they've permanently lost a customer.

### "hopeless that I will get my luggage"
Not Verified |  I was on easyJet flight EJU3737 on Wednesday June 1st 2022. My luggage was lost (and still not found) along with 20-30 other passengers’ luggage. I’m not really sure how the luggage was lost as it was a direct flight from Paris to Tel Aviv. I had to fill out a lost and found report. I was able to “log in” using the report’s reference number and could see that my luggage was not found yet. A few days later I tried to log in again but the report “cannot be found” as if someone deleted it from their system. I tried calling but they keep telling me to call the airports where the luggage might or might not be. No customer service at all. I am pretty hopeless that I will get my luggage, as I haven’t received any info / update regarding where my luggage is or when I will get it. Also seems weird that 20-30 people lost their luggage on a direct flight to Israel. I am traveling back to the USA in 2days so I don’t know if I will ever see my luggage again.

### "customer service is absolutely shocking"
Flew back from Cyprus in April. Flight was due to land at Gatwick, but had to be diverted to East Midlands, due to their being no air traffic controllers. EasyJet explained their would be no coaches available so we had to book taxis to get to our destinations. We were told we would be refunded, no questions asked. It is now the end of May and I have made 2 failed attempts at claiming over £700 worth of taxi bills that I had to pay for, due to there being 7 in our party and no 7 seater taxis available at 2 am in the morning when we arrived, with young children, almost 100 miles from our home and further from our car which was parked at Gatwick! Filled out the claim form and the person had the nerve to say they wouldn't give us a refund because the flight was only 4 minutes late! Have spent numerous hours on hold to customer services with no reply. The level of customer service is absolutely shocking. Won't be using again and will be advising anyone that listens to avoid.

### "every one of them was 1-3 hours delayed"
5 different flights with easyJet and every one of them was 1-3 hours delayed. The people working in the plane were polite but you could see even they were not happy with the delays. The reason why it is not 1/10 is because of the air hostess.

### "bad service at the counter2
Very bad service at the counter. I'm traveling all around the world every year. Never see this. They limit to 15 kg for the check bin Baggage when other company allow 23kilo. They charge me 200 Euro more. For Cabin baggage they told me I had to pay extra 23 Euro per baggage and could not take them in Cabin.

### "Crew excellent"
Not Verified |  Flight left the terminal over one hour late and then was held in a queue for 30 mins. As with my earlier flight there was no hot or fresh food available so my £6 voucher was again worthless. My application for a refund has been ignored (6 weeks and counting). Crew excellent especially the guy in charge who was brilliant in calming a screaming child.

### "no hot or fresh food had been loaded"
Not Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Crew competent and efficient but unfortunately no hot or fresh food had been loaded. The £6 voucher was therefore worthless and my application for a refund has been ignored.

### "luggage for the cabin is charged in addition"
The on-time is excellent, booking is easy. The timing and number of flights per day are good. But Easyjet lost its head since the covid. The luggage for the cabin is charged in addition of the ticket. Flight is shown 40USD, if you take the luggage in the cabin it is 80USD in total. Solution: use Swiss or BA.

### "would rather walk or swim than using Sleazy Jet"
The worst customer service I have ever experienced, thanks for nothing. More like Sleazy Jet. Wasted our whole day and was trying to compensate with bags of chocolate and baby sipping cup size drinks. Couldn't think if should drink or gargle with that drink, Left us in middle of nowhere, they said they will organise transport but no as of high demand they could not arrange any. Taxi cost was 320 euro, 2 hour drive - who will compensate that. Will not recommend anyone to use their services, would rather walk or swim than using Sleazy Jet.

### "difficult to deal with"
Amsterdam to Belfast. I had my flight cancelled from Amsterdam to Belfast on 22nd April. The flight was already delayed and only cancelled while I was waiting in the departure lounge. No one there from easyJet. Just a message to say there were no rooms available, sort yourself out. No flights the next day I booked the Sunday and found a room miles away, used hotels.com was advised to keep receipts for expenses. Sunday flight was also cancelled while I was waiting in departures. I did manage to speak to someone who said he couldn't find any rooms or alternative flights, so again I was abandoned. I kept receipts for food, trams and buses. EasyJet has been very difficult to deal with, initially refused to pay anything as they said my flight was cancelled in February. It was but they put me on the earlier flight which was cancelled on that day. They argued about it but eventually agreed to a refund. They have however refused all expenses despite receipts and bus/tram/train despite tickets/receipts. The Sunday flight is still being dealt with.

### "stopped because of our small suitcase"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Nice. We went from Amsterdam Schiphol to Nice-France without any problem - when back easyJet stopped us because of our small suitcase. Hoped discussions with easyJet employee that our suitcase has not grown during the vacation in Nice! You have to pay - otherwise, we won't let you run away. The company must understand your bread comes through customers.

### "I won't be flying easyJet again"
Not Verified |  Underseat luggage allowance seems very different from other airlines. The measuring box does not appear to match the online description, the special sized luggage purchased or the space beneath the seat. Passengers are treated like cattle, no smile, no please or thank you. The staff seem very bored and overtired I won't be flying easyJet again.

### "Very rude and customer unfriendly"
Not Verified |  We had to pay extra for a suitcase that so-called did not meet the dimensions. Measured at home and was ok. No problems on the way there. On the way back we had to pay extra because the suitcase was too big. The worst is not even the amount of 25 pounds, but the way we were addressed and the whole thing was handled. Very rude and customer unfriendly! We were sent to the side as if we were a bunch of criminals, only because we asked why it wasn't a problem on the outward journey and now it is. Never again will I fly with Easy Jet! I'd rather pay a little more for a little customer service! We moesten extra betalen voor een koffertje dat zgn niet aan de maten voldeed. Thuis gemeten en was ok. Op de heenweg geen problemen. Op de terugweg moesten we bijbetalen omdat de koffer te groot was. Het ergste is niet eens het bedrag van 25 pond, maar de manier waarop we aangesproken werden en de hele boel afgehandeld werd. Zeer onbeleefd, onbeschoft en klantonvriendelijk! We werden naar de kant gestuurd alsof we een stelletje criminelen waren, alleen omdat we vroegen waarom het op de heenreis geen probleem was en nu wel. Nooit meer vlieg ik met Easy Jet! Ik betaal liever iets meer voor een beetje klantvriendelijkheid!

### "our experience was entirely positive"
Not Verified |  Perfectly satisfactory flights. This was at a time when easyJet was getting a lot of media criticism because of cancellations due to staff Covid, but our experience was entirely positive. Rapid bag drop, speedy boarding was fully applied on this flight (not so good on the return, but that was down to the airport using buses for transfer to the plane), the flight left on time and arrived a little early, and the cabin crew were very pleasant. We had extra-legroom seats in one of the over wing emergency exit rows but the standard seats looked fine for someone my height (1.74 m). Space is helped by the thin seats, I was concerned on first sitting down that these seemed rather firm but they must be well shaped because I stayed comfortable for the 3hr50 flight. My only dissatisfaction would be with the price, hence my low mark for 'value for money' - it was £600 each and, even given that it was the start of a UK holiday period, that's pretty eye watering.

### "Staff handled our plight badly"
After arriving into the departure lounge at Amsterdam Schipol airport, our flight was suddenly shown as canceled. Went into phone app and switched to a later evening flight, but app noted we had to have a paper boarding pass. There is no Westjet customer service staff or desk near the gates, and no staff except those at the boarding gates. We went to boarding gate at departure time and staff said should have gone back through arrivals to check in to print pass, and we were creating problems. There were at least 10 passengers in the same boat who asked for boarding cards to be printed. Easyjet cancels the flight then expects checked in passengers to go back to check in then back through security? Eventually a supervisor did print the boarding cards but seemed poorly managed, and of course not a $ in compensation for an almost 3 hour delay. Staff handled our plight badly. The flight was fine.

### "comfort was better than I expected"
Not Verified |  I don't often fly this airline, but the experience was reasonable for a budget operator. As it happened, the flight was delayed by ongoing issues. When we finally boarded, the captain went to some trouble to explain in detail, and apologise which was good, especially as it was not his fault. Ditto the cabin crew. A good way to defuse irritation, especially late at night. Seat comfort was better than I expected. The flight went smoothly.

### "not be using easyJet in the future"
We were due to fly from Bristol to Bodrum on Sunday 3rd April 2022. Our flight was due to take off at 0600. We had booked to stay overnight in Bristol on the 02nd April due to our early start and also because we live an hour and a half away from the airport. We got up at 0300 in order to be at the airport at 0400 as advised by easyJet, I was emailed at 01:07 on the day to be told that our flight had been cancelled, they gave us under 5 hours notice! We decided to go to the airport to see what our options would be, as we were travelling due to a family bereavement. We arrived at Bristol Airport at 0400 to be greeted by a very busy easyJet check in area. I made my way to the special assistance desk as this had the smallest queue. We were approached by a easyJet representative, I explained our situation and we were rudely told that we needed to go onto the easyJet app and to sort it out ourselves, they were too busy to help. I asked to speak to the duty manager, who eventually came over to see me, they explained that we were expected to manage our own booking via the app, after explaining out circumstances and the reasons we were due to travel they agreed to transfer us onto another easyJet flight to Antalya later on that day at 1520, and that we would have to pay for the onward 6 hour road transport to take us to our original location in Bodrum, to keep the receipt and claim the money back as there policy states they are only able to book road transport within the UK and not overseas. We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol. When we boarded our new flight to Antalya we were advised by the cabin crew that the operating aircraft had not been restocked therefore no duty free was available and they had very limited food and drink to sell onboard. All in all a very poor show. Will not be using easyJet in the future

### "charged to put the case in the hold"
Not Verified |  Easyjet state on their website that ‘all passengers can carry on cabin luggage 45cmx36cmx20cm. I bought a case with these measurements (including wheels and handle) but was stopped at the gate in Stansted, asked to put my case in the size checker, and was charged to put the case in the hold. When I challenged the sizing I was rudely dismissed and was told this size was for speedy boarding passengers only. I checked the size of the case once again when I returned home and it was exactly as stated on Easyjet website.

### "Staff have absolutely no idea what they are doing"
Staff have absolutely no idea what they are doing. Inconsistencies in policy, giving inconsistent and inaccurate information leading to more costs. A money making scheme to exploit the customer. Take your business to a reputable company instead.

### "Speedy boarding followed"
Speedy boarding followed. Spacious cabin, quite good legroom for 6’2”. Friendly cabin crew. Clean seat/cabin, selection of snacks. We’d booked one aisle seat and one window seat, hoping that we’d get the row, however someone came along and sat on our row - not the airlines fault. It would be good if you were given a cleaning wipe and small bottle of water to clean down your table and seat before departure.

### "Delayed by 1 hour with no compensation"
Friendly cabin crew. Selection of snacks onboard. Delayed by 1 hour with no compensation. Aircraft felt dark and small, not much legroom (6’2”) - despite other EZY flights having good legroom We had to put our large cabin bags on overhead lockers over seat 14, even though we had upfront seats. Speedy boarding wasn’t followed - we were at the back of the queue.

### "This airline is terrible!"
Not Verified |  This airline is terrible! Cannot communicate with anyone! All hidden behind computers. Trying for 2 days to make changes and its an impossible thing to do! Mr Stelios Hadjioannou its about time you take control of this! I will discard this flight and rather loose my money and fly with a decent airline where we can reach someone to talk to.

### "Shoddy, disgusting service"
Not Verified |  I've just been informed our flights for our holiday have been changed 8 days before we are due to fly. I only found this out by chance as I happened to open their app and saw the flights had been changed as well as returning to a different airport. So now due to the new times we are now losing over a day of our holiday having paid over £1600. No compensation offered! The travel agent had to apologise on Easyjets behalf. They hadn't been informed of the changes either. This was a holiday to celebrate my 50th birthday. I will never fly with Easyjet again. Shoddy, disgusting service.

### "by far the least accommodating"
I've flown easyjet once before and I fly several times a month, they are by far the least accommodating. I showed up to the airport over an hour early and by the time I got to the counter I was refused entry due to being too close to the boarding time? Just absolutely ridiculous, never once in my life have I missed a flight and here I am at the airport having to make last minute arrangements due to the lack of competence easyjet and its employees have. It is also odd considering the last easyjet flight I took did not board until after its departure time causing me to sit at the airport for even long. I'm sure they're glad they got my money this last time though!

### "There is no way of contacting them"
EasyJet lost my baggage and couldn't care less. After 48 hours they only sent one email saying "sorry for any inconvenience", but no updates to where my luggage is or when I will get it back. Should I go to the shop and buy a new wardrobe? There is no way of contacting them, no numbers are manned.

### "Very poor and lengthy bag drop"
Not Verified |  Very poor and lengthy bag drop plus poor gate/embarking arrangements. Took at least an hour to drop bag off leaving little time to use airport facilities at Malaga and gate was just as poorly managed.

### "never had any horrible experience like this"
First time I come across a budget airline that only includes a small backpack as a base. Even the small cabin suitcase allowance is an add on. So we were forced to upgrade to “upfront seats” (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn’t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn’t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed “today”. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away. No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can’t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was “late”. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight. We have taken many other low cost airlines like Transavia and Ryan Air, Jetstar, Tiger, Hong Kong Express but we never had any horrible experience like this.

### "ground staff were among the rudest I've ever encountered"
Expensive and unreliable. Be careful, as the price you see is not the price you pay, which was for our trip, nearly three times more! The airline changed the time of the flight to an hour and a half later, which was then delayed, jeopardising our onward journey and effectively losing us a half day of our holiday - not to mention loss of sleep over the onward connection. The on-board staff were friendly and tried to be understanding, but the ground staff were among the rudest I've ever encountered.

### "cancelled due to the weather conditions"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled due to the weather conditions and they informed the cancellation of the flight just 10mins before flight departure. Instead of helping us get another flight, they told us to go back to departure gate and no one was even there on the gate. And then we were told to rebook our flight online and then we were just told to leave the airport which took around 2hrs due to the security. I saw the departure of so many flights which were scheduled just within 1hrs of my flight. They could have delayed my flight maybe or at least assisted in rebooking but they chose to do nothing. Amidst this chaos, where I was still processing what was happening, I rebooked the wrong flight and I have been trying to contact the customer service but guess what no one is responding. There's no customer service at airport and they don't respond online. Wouldn't recommend the flight to anyone.

### "quick, efficient, friendly service"
Not Verified |  A quick, efficient, friendly service from easyJet. The plane arrived on stand from a previous sector and was turned around in less than 20 minutes! The crew on board were welcoming and a credit to the airline. Only thing which let it down was the slow ground service at Belfast Int’l in unloading but not the airline’s fault. Overall, a great experience. Will definitely use easyJet for my next trip!

### "would absolutely not recommend EasyJet for COVID era travel"
Not Verified |  I was unable to go on this flight due to the COVID restrictions introduced by the German government. EasyJet refused to let me cancel or give me any kind of refund despite claiming that the flight was converted for COVID cancellations when I booked. I would absolutely not recommend EasyJet for COVID era travel, they don’t care about their customers at all.

### "If this is not extortion I don't know what is"
Paid 533 euros, as per proof sent to Skytrax, with one change of dates, for this domestic flight of 01h20m. If this is not extortion I don't know what is. The plane was crowded, there was not enough space for baggage, the cabin was too warm, crew were Portuguese whom have become increasingly unfriendly, unnecessarily formal and even arrogant, easyJet have absorbed TAP's vicious habits in this route and what it seems their crew from 4 years ago. The resuming of flights by Ryanair on this route will put them back on their knees from where they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately they will very likely try to hijack the Regional Government with artificial arguments, which by incompetence, ignorance or dissimulation, they could concede to even more 'support', as if they needed. It is how this so called low cost airlines work. Commercial aviation needs urgent supervision by national Regulators. On a positive note which isn't enough to give them more than one star rating, their telephone support actually works and is attentive, however as per usual with airlines this may change from one day to another.

### "we were refused a flight"
Together with my husband and five-year-old son, we arrived at the airport in advance due to the purchased additional luggage (23kg) We were one of the first to check-in because many people who flew to Berlin at that time had a problem with checking in at the airport by Easy Jet at a time when other airlines (e.g. Ryanair) did not have these problems. Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet. I tried to call customer service to explain the situation. Unfortunately, each of our attempts to connect ended with a broken signal despite no problems with the network. At that time, we bought a next day flight from Manchester to Krakow, we had to perform additional tests on Covid because the previous certificates.

### "very good for low cost airline"
Both flight on A320. Boarding at HEL was chaotic because they were checking the vaccination certificate to passengers that had check-in electronically. At BER chick in was a breeze. Boarding was done with zone system; staff were easy going not creating problems with passengers carrying larger carry-ons. In flight service on menu buy items. Overall very good for low cost airline.

### "all I could get back was my taxes"
I booked 2 tickets 28th Dec on Easyjet, Gatwick to Geneva to go to France for New Year. I booked Easyjet insurance in case things went wrong and I could not go. I am a flightclub member. France banned UK residents from coming to France so now we cant go - we are not allowed. EasyJet will not refund the flights as they are to Switzerland not France. Easyjet are not doing the right thing and refunding flights. I spoke to Flightclub customer service who told me I could have a voucher. But with insurance I would have to call the insurance number to get a refund. After a few days i got thru to Insurance who told me my insurance did not cover governments telling me I couldn't go to their country! I then called Flightclub back who then said no voucher was available as I was flying to Geneva - not directly into France.! So all I could get back was my taxes! If you are in a similar situation please complain as this is outrageous behaviour!

### "not enough check-in personnel"
Not Verified | Flight was OK, but was delayed by an hour because of a dreadful bag-check in. They were still checking bags in when the gate closed because of not enough check-in personnel. We stood in the queue for 90 minutes just to check our bags in watching the flight gate close with no communication from anyone. The rest of the flight was OK, landed one hour later than expected in the end which isn't too bad given the poor start.

### "Very dirty plane"
I used to be a travel freak, nowadays I try to travel only at last resort and do the utmost not to. Airlines have been very proficuous on dilapidating passengers prerogatives and rights, being mostly legally unreachable, with the exception of litigious proceedings. easyJet seats are hard as rock, considerably uncomfortable, resulting in a martyrdom flight. Paid almost 162,49 euros with 3 months in advance for this recent domestic flight in Portugal of 1 hour, 20 minutes and was assigned a middle seat. You are free to take your own conclusions. Very dirty plane outside and as usual lots of dust inside for some reason that I can't explain. I must say, having used them a lot, cabin crew was much more friendly when they weren't Portuguese serving other Portuguese, which in itself is an absolute shame.

### "The cabin staff were very rude"
The cabin staff were very rude. I am a female traveler, who is short had a cabin trolley suitcase. I had asked the cabin staff to give me a hand, as I was unable to reach the cabin baggage shelf. He was very rude, telling me that if I cannot place the bag, I am not supposed to bring the bag. And then there is an announcement, about making the flight comfortable to the passengers in all possible way. This is unacceptable. I would never ever travel again through this flight. I have asked the cabin staff to just give me a hand, which even a fellow passenger does. Along with that, the staff has made a great statement.

### "90% of what I paid is lost"
Due to Omicron, I decided to cancel my flights for December 20th, it is now December 9th. Firstly, there is no Cancel button on the website. The online form does not include this option either. I had to call them to cancel, and even after cancelling they will not confirm it by email: no assurance of the cancellation. Secondly, even nine days prior, I will receive only the tax back. That means 90% of what I paid is lost. Absolutely poor quality process, as well as a totally overcharged penalty.

### "does that mean you must torture us with your rock hard seats?"
I don't have a massive issue with EasyJet, they're one of the most affordable airlines on the planet. But does that mean you must torture us with your rock hard seats? Any flight more than 1 hour gives me a dead backside.

### "Easyjet accepted no responsibility for the delay"
Not Verified |  A flight I took recently was delayed 9 hours which meant staying in the departure lounge for the full duration of the delay. The delay was originally 1 hour, then 2 hours before suddenly being pushed from an 8am till 4.25pm, which also left late. I submitted an expense claims form as under EU law any delay over 2 hours is subject to compensation. The delay caused me and my wife to miss another flight and having to rebook that for the following day, an overnight stay in a hotel close to the airport, and two new PCR tests in order to travel. Easyjet accepted no responsibility for the delay and would not pay compensation for expenses which were booked before the delayed or after, surely there should be some consistency and it is almost inevitable that a 9 1/2 delay will incur further expense from travellers. I will be doing my best to avoid Easyjet going forward as this is incredibly disappointing!

### "Cabin crew far from friendly"
One cabin crew member fell ill and all passengers had to wait outside the terminal in freezing weather conditions for a requested employee from Milan to arrive. The flight departed with a one hour delay but strong winds in Madeira weren't enough to divert the plane. Easyjet flights frequently are more exhausting than they should be. Cabin crew far from friendly. Terminal 2 in Lisbon is a disaster but Madeira airport on its turn is a breeze, it doesn't even feel like the same country.

### "On-line check in efficient"
On-line check in efficient, as well as boarding. Very clean aircraft. Of course, it is still a Low Cost airline with no frills, but indeed nowadays difference with "top" airlines is nearly none.

### "Never again with easyJet"
Never again with easyJet. The deal is never worth it! Standard hand luggage isn't accepted anymore, unless you pay an extra fee of 24 English pounds. Think twice, and choose a different airline and save yourself the trouble of missing your flight or the extra payment while boarding your flight.

### "not be flying with EasyJet again"
Just flown back from Tenerife on flight EZY8704 10th November 2021 - can I just say how utterly rude the cabin crew were not to mention highly unprofessional! Only one drinks service the whole 4 hour flight then watched the head cabin crew member fill her bag with what ever she could from the plane! They basically sat on there seats the whole flight - completely disgusted and we definitely not be flying with EasyJet again - you may want to give your staff some training in customer service.

### "received zero customer care"
On Sat 6th November I had a call from Clare (DHL) at Bristol Airport advising me DHL have identified my suitcase & Iberia took it from Fuerteventura airport to Madrid as it didn't have a tag on it. I previously complained to Easyjet as the horrid lady on Easyjet speedy booking check in at Fuerteventura airport did not put a tag on my suitcase. Clare said she has emailed Iberia & Easyjet, but no one is responding & she doesn't currently know where my suitcase is. Easyjet have not once phoned me to apologise & I have received zero customer care from Easy Jet. Easy Jet are not communicating with DHL at Bristol airport to ensure my suitcase gets returned to me. Easyjet keep using Covid as an excuse, but they shouldnt operate/fly if they cant provide customer care. I actually liked Easyjet before this incident as never had any issues, yet the way I have recently been treated by Easyjet is disgusting.

### "couldn’t fit hand-baggage in the space"
I took a flight from London to Paris because it was cheap, but of course that is only a trap. As soon as I arrived to the boarding queue an employee was checking one by one, with a dataphone and a bunch of receipts, charging extra £25 to everyone that couldn’t fit hand-baggage in the space they reserve for bags. Next time I will definitely chose to travel with a company that goes upfront with the price they charge and offer a good customer experience.

### "Nice crew. Surprisingly good legroom"
Very good! No problem to check in online. No problem to drop baggage (took 1 min). No problem to embark with speedy boarding (but had to put my bag to overhead bin 4 rows behind my row which then delayed my disembarkation). Nice crew. Surprisingly good legroom. Landed on time. Bag on the belt within 10 min. Again, very good!

### "offboarded because the plane was too heavy"
Worst airline ever. Got offboarded on 26th October flight because the plane was too heavy. They offered us money (400€). After we got offboarded they forgot my bag. The support wont give me the money. Will never fly with easyjet again.

### "Easyjet ground staff were completely indifferent"
Not Verified |  We decided to use Easyjet to fly back to the UK from Krakow and arrived at the airport in good time. We flew to Krakow with Ryanair and had all our documentation to hand and everything went without a hitch. We did notice that some passengers did not have a Locator Form but the Ryanair staff simply gave them blank forms to complete and there was not any problem. Our flight with Easyjet proved to be very different as we were returning home we thought that a Locator Form would not be required and there was no early indication of this from Easyjet ground staff. As we were checking in the Easyjet staff asked for our locator forms and bluntly told us to complete them online. This meant filling in a lengthy form and also finding the 2 day PCR test reference number, which we did with some effort and succeeded in checking in just in time. We were last on the plane and others who failed to produce a locator form missed their flight. Easyjet ground staff were completely indifferent. There was no indication given at any early stage which would have given us time to leisurely complete the paperwork. This was in marked contrast to Ryanair staff who made the flight effortless for everyone.

### "desperate to get out of that airplane"
The rating could have been better if they didn't use terminal 2 in Lisbon which looks and feels like a slaughterhouse and where passengers are made to endure accordingly. Fellow passengers also didn't make the trip any easier. I was just so desperate to get out of that airplane.

### "The incompetence of EasyJet personnel is laughable"
I had to buy 2 more tickets to get back to Ireland. I missed the first flight due to all trains from Victoria being stopped due to a poor soul who jumped in front of a train. EasyJet's policy is you lose the ticket and are required to buy a new ticket. Fine, I did that at the cost of 85 pounds. When I arrived at the gate for the second flight I realized I left my purse at security. The two gate agents would not call security and they would not give me the number for security. Hence I missed another flight at this point it became a comedy show due to the incompetence of EasyJet personnel, this was from the manager to a supervisor to customer service people who are clueless. Long story short me along with another couple who missed the flight because they were held in security needed to buy another ticket. This cost 110 pounds because they failed to inform us that if you don’t buy the ticket with more than two hours prior to the flight you have to pay their exorbitant fee of 110 versus 85. Then it took a manager and two supervisors 30 minutes to print my boarding pass. The incompetence of EasyJet personnel is laughable.

### "excellent flight with Easyjet"
Another excellent flight with Easyjet. Airport was busy but all went smoothly with no delays. Paperwork checked at the gate by very helpful and pleasant gate staff. Flight was full and departed on schedule and landed early in Alicante. First class service provided onboard by the cabin crew, very helpful and professional. Aircraft was clean and the cabin crew made regular announcements regarding face masks onboard. Arrivals in Alicante was great as no waiting about and all the E-gates in use. All relevant information like boarding gate and luggage belt was provided on the easyjet app which is useful.

### "Greedy and unprofessional"
Easyjet cancelled my return trip only 10 minutes after I landed in Milan without any explanation. Most probably they wanted to make sure to get the money of the first flight for then provide a lower compensation. I tried to book the return ticket with another airline but prices were astronomic, therefore my only option was choose the return flight provided by easyjet (for free) and shorten my holidays of over 1 day. It was a long weekend so it meant literarily spending half of the time expected. It was not because they cancelled the flight, but simply because of the very short notification that made impossible for me to find other suitable options for my needs. Greedy and unprofessional. Very upsetting!

### "the worst airline we ever flew with"
This is the worst airline we ever flew with. First flight was 1 hour late without any notification so we were standing for 1 hour and waiting with no explanation at all. The second flight was cancelled 30 mins before departure, it was complete chaos as we had to stay overnight in Italy as they scheduled the replacement flight to be at 7am which meant we had to be in the airport at 5am, this was very inconvenient for us for many obvious reasons. They did cover the hotel expense but frankly the reason we are not happy is because the airline lied about the weather conditions being bad so that we would not be eligible for any kind of flight refund other than overnight hotel stay. How do we know they lied? Simple, other airlines kept flying and the weather in Milan was quite ok, not rainy or windy. Other reasons we were unhappy? We checked in our bag before departure and since the flight was cancelled we had no information whatsoever about where we can get our bag back , in addition to the fact that we didn't have any other information on what to do already 10 pm in a city where we never been before. They only told us to find a hotel and they will refund for which we had to search all over the airport and wait for such a long time to get this information.

### "most kind, patient and courteous"
This morning 26th September I flew BRS to GIB. The staff at check in were most kind, patient and courteous. A special mention, for Rosie who was a credit to the airline helping an older lady through the regulation and rigours of check in. I fly to Gibraltar several times a year and will continue to do so with Easyjet.

### "well trained cabin crew"
100 euros for this 1:20 domestic flight, still almost a third of what I paid on Portugal's disgraceful flag carrier on they way back. Absolutely full plane, well trained cabin crew. Curiously they didn't take the money after I booked, which I found very irregular. They called one day before the flight asking for my 'collaboration' due to their website's error that affected many customer's transactions, a bug they still hadn't identified how it happened. They need a base in Madeira and more routes from the island.

### "staff at the check-in was rude"
The staff at the check-in was rude. As a couple, we were carrying one small cabin luggage that was the appropriate size for the aircraft as outlined on the company‘s website. The check-in staff started a discussion and insisted that we pay additional 29€ for the suitcase. Not only was she rude in the way she conveyed it, she involved other staff to apply even more pressure. In the end we paid, as the staff started threatening us to not let us on board. The general perception of easyjet has never been good. I usually stay away from writing any reviews, however easyJet staff is rude and renders a bad experience. Luckily, I am not dependent on using easyjet, which is why I will not book another flight with you.

### "charged €29 for a handbag trolley"
Upon arrival at the gate in Crete, they charged €29 for a handbag trolley although it's the size approved on their website. Many of the passengers protested, but they were threatening that they would just leave without us, we were forced to pay for 6 persons €174. Funny thing is that when you paid you could take you trolley on board! Never again flying with this airline.

### "really disorganized and quite rude"
Not Verified |  On my last trip in September 2021 the ground staff made my last trip quite uncomfortable. They were really disorganized and quite rude very insensitive with the elderly people that found hard to keep up with the all new technology requirements asked by the local government. They were rude with everyone and it seems that they had no or little training. It seems that easyJet don't really care to train with what seems to be the very basic of costumer care. It will made me think twice before rebooking with easyJet

### "not forceful in enforcing the facemask rules"
Not Verified |  Cabin crew cheerful and helpful. Cabin clean and seats reasonably comfortable for short flights. Disappointed that cabin crew were not more forceful in enforcing the facemask rules. Viewing the 4 rows of seats in front of me, 4 passengers had their face masks below their chin for most of the journey, not even attempting to pull the mask up when the cabin crew were passing, and not once did any cabin crew ask that they pull their mask up.

### "Cabin well cleaned"
Cabin well cleaned, professional crew and on time. However using terminal 2 in Lisbon, seriously downgrades the experience. The duration of the flight was just one hour and 25 minutes but it felt way more, which pretty much sums up the flight. As usual, full plane on this route.

### "they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying"
Not Verified |  On Friday 13th August at roughly 20.00hrs our flight from Gibraltar to Gatwick was cancelled due to fog. After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20! Not only did they treat us like animals and leave us stranded at Gibraltar airport with nowhere to stay, but when we claimed our valid expenses they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying. Next time I fly to Gibraltar I will 100% travel with British Airways.

### "Worst customer service ever"
There was no direct flight options on a daily basis to our destination and unfortunately easyJet was our only option. Knowing that we will have to pay for the baggage! After paying for the baggage, they charged us again for the carry on bags that are always allowed in the cabin (mine at least been to 100 flights at least). This didn’t make any sense, we paid 70 euro for the ticket but ended up paying 90 euro for the baggage (60 for the actual luggage and 30 for the carry on) I never check in my carry on cause of the valuable stuff such as laptop and jewellery. Worst customer service ever. Never flying with easyJet.

### "denied boarding due to a PCR test"
I was supposed to return to London via EasyJet and I was denied boarding due to a PCR test. Although I had checked twice since booking the ticket in June. The requirements changed again so fully vaccinated passengers required a PCR to enter the UK. However, the government requirements also stated that if passengers were fully vaccinated but did not have a PCR test they could enter the UK but would be subject to a £500 fine. The option of a fine was never given to me. When I asked for the customer service representatives name she refused. When I asked to speak with a manager she refused. I have never seen an airline which lacked so much accountability or with lower customer service levels. If you choose to travel with Easyjet and you run into trouble you are on your own.

### "Queues everywhere"
Worst airline ever. Everything is bad actually. Waited 2 hours to just drop the luggage as only 2 desks were open and 8 easyJet flights to handle. Family in front of me missed their flights, as simple as that (with no alternatives of course). Almost missed mine. Queues everywhere. Plane arrived 20min late. Bad service inside the plane.

### "bad service in all"
I decided to give them a chance to support them after the pandemic: flight, car and hotel .. wrong idea, rude staff, bad service in all, endless queues in check-in even with speedy boarding. Never again.

### "I had a covid test from the NHS"
After Easy jet had changed one sided flight time and airport, I got in time to Luton Airport but I was denied boarding by a rude ground staff lady for the fact that I had a covid test from the NHS instead of a private test. That I was fully vaccinated and was only transiting The Netherlands was out of interest to her and there was no consideration of the fact that this was the last flight to The Netherlands that day. We waited for one hour (where I tried to reach easy jet Customer Service who could not help me) until the same lady appeared with a colleague to guide us to the exit with no explanation nor assistance. I could book a different flight to Germany from a different airport on the same day  without any issues. The additional costs of 400 EUR I wanted to claim with easyjet. Up to now I have no response to my claim. They make it almost impossible to receive feedback or comments as all emails come from a "noreply"-address. I am very disappointed and upset.

### "extra £24 for each cabin bag"
I assumed that their baggage policy was not something strange. They did not allow a passenger to bring a normal size cabin bag on board unless one pays for a seat selection which cost £15.49. I am not sure why EasyJet combines seat selection with a cabin bag. There was the option to buy hold luggage which was more expensive as the cost started from around £20. Failure to comply will result in forcing a passenger to pay extra £24 for each cabin bag. When summing up all the costs, the price can be equivalent or more expensive than proper full service airlines.

### "Quick, efficient service"
Not Verified |  Travelled to Belfast and back from Bristol to visit an elderly relative. Both flights on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Flight attendants welcoming and professional. I felt very safe with the stringent covid measures in place. Quick, efficient service - would recommend. Thank-you Easyjet!

### "never fly with EasyJet again"
I will never fly with EasyJet again. In my last trip in the peak of the COVID pandemic in 2020, I had a terrible experience with them with very few measures taken for the virus and I promised to never fly with them again, but this year I decided to unfortunately give them a chance again. The main reason of my complaint now is this appalling, cheap and relentless baggage policy they have. Not being able to bring an overhead cabin luggage without paying extra for it is disgusting. It serves no purpose besides scamming your customers and making the check in less efficient, since a lot of unaware people have to pay 29 euros before boarding to get in the plane, and the suitcase goes to the hold and not even with you on board. The staff in Palma de Mallorca told me I could have paid to choose a seat and get the suitcase, but a lot of passangers had to do it on spot.

### "one month later there is no answer"
The worst experience I had with flights ever! I paid for my ticket, they sent me the confirmation email, I did the check in and they cancelled my ticket without any reason or any information. I realised it at the gate, they didn't let me fly, as a result I lost my vaccination appointment and another 3 flights. They returned my money from the specific flight but of course there is no refund for the others. When I called them they asked me for some very specific bank documents to investigate my case and one month later there is no answer.

### "very punctual airline, cleaned cabin and friendly crew"
If you are not yet vaccinated and would like to catch covid book a low cost departing from Lisbon and you are sure to be on the center of proliferation at terminal 2, a building the size of medium gym. Confusing change of gates, messy boarding and much stress with very hot weather outside. You will have to walk outside and quite a lot until reaching your plane. However, as usual, very punctual airline, cleaned cabin and friendly crew.

### "EasyJet is a superior budget airline"
The ground crew were friendly and efficiently handled the new document requirements for travelling to Italy during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the new EU Digital Covid Certificate. Just a pity that they couldn’t have given better/clearer instructions about the need for “surgical quality” masks before we got to the gate – instead of having to buy a five-pack for five Euros at the gate. Otherwise, from boarding to deplaning, everything was “Covid Clean”. Our 1 hour 40-minute flight from Venice to Paris was on a shiny new A320. The legroom was pretty good compared to other budget carriers and the crew were helpful. The bottom line: EasyJet is a superior budget airline.

### "Please avoid this company"
Please avoid this company. Better to pay 10-20 Eur extra and have good conditions. Please read the other reviews as well. You will be robbed by 30 EUR for your small baggage by the rude personnel before letting you in the aircraft. Your flight will have delays in both trips.

### "easyJet never again"
This has been a challenging and tough year and this summer I though my first experience travelling after two years was going to be memorable. Not only did I pay 80€ for an extra cabin bag that I didn't even get to use and had to get rid of all my cosmetic belongings because they exceeded the ml limit, I had to pay an extra 58€ to get my luggage checked in. The hostess in an arrogant tone told me my baggage was too big. I had already changed my luggage for a smaller one, got rid of half my clothes and it was too big ! Only a small wheel got past the metal box, as deserted as the plane was and given the situation they could have clearly arranged a place for my baggage. And when I suggested to refund the cabin bag or at least reduce it from the price of the cabin bag that I couldn't use the condescending woman said and I quote "You knew what you were doing by bringing this bag, it is your fault not mine". I am filled with so much rage ,anger and even sadness. The way she spoke like I was some insignificant number, just another dumb client enraged me to the depths of my soul. I can't deny I mistakenly thought the baggage would fit in the cabin but there is no excuse for the treatment I was given. In a few words, if you are looking for unpleasant, unfair and arrogant treatment, be my guest and fly with easyJet. As for me, easyJet never again.

### "Their product is quite consistent"
They need more flights to Madeira on Friday nights and Monday early mornings. Still, a Friday flight costed me more than 100 euros. Their product is quite consistent, flights on time, planes decently clean, legroom even though not great, acceptable and reasonable even though it is a shame they are not allowing trolleys anymore. On the exterior though the plane seemed to have been caught in a dust storm and they continue to use terminal 2 tarmac even though passengers leave terminal 1 in Lisbon which results in the need for a cramped bus travel through the airport.

### "great first experience"
First time flying easyJet. Flight departed on time and was quite cheap, only €30. The plane was not very crowded, so I was asked to sit in the exit row, I got a free upgrade! The legroom there was amazing of course. The seats were quite comfortable, but legroom in the normal seats is very cramped. Overall great first experience.

### "Flight was on-time"
Not Verified |  Perfect flight! Ground service was well organized and fast. The crew were nice and available. The seat was comfortable, although for a person with 1.85m height is a bit tight. But, one of the crew members asked me to seat in an emergency exit because it was empty, much better leg space! Great food service, a lot of things available to purchase. Flight was on-time.

### "cabin crew not at their best days"
I lost a flight on Friday evening and they had the better option on the early morning back to Madeira at 160 euros. Its only competitor was charging almost double that. I was very sleepy but it was very difficult to sleep with the cabin lights not deemed. Well cleaned aircraft, again totally packed, with some members of the cabin crew not at their best days.

### "the flights are always too packed"
Their legroom is better than its only competitor TAP on this route, even at the rear of the plane, but the flights are always too packed which I don't like. Cabin crew are professional, however sad baggage allowance if they want to attract customers anyway. Arrived early.

### "make you feel hated and unwelcome"
Their baggage policy is now quite absurd, you can take a box of chocolates in your backpack and that's pretty much it, I witnessed some sad scenes from fellow passengers boarding. Flights were packed, which is not what you want in these times, on my flight back I had the passenger sitting next to me frequently touching my knee and elbow which is insanitary. Although Lisbon airport is operating at 10% capacity, they park remotely and make passengers travel through the airport in overcrowded buses to and from the main terminal. They closed boarding more than 30 minutes before departure at Lisbon, which made for quite a scare but their boarding staff were really friendly and accommodating. Thankfully though, their onboard sales are temporarily suspended and the aircraft looked neat and well cleaned. They definitely need more flights on this route, I paid 307 euros for both ways for flights that are domestic and no longer than one hour and a half. I only use them as a last option which was the case, they withheld money from previous flights that were canceled instead of reimbursing me as they should. Their customer service is virtually non existent and from Portugal there's no free call lines to reach them, you pay quite a big toll. They are now not different from the more miserable low cost airlines in Europe and their motto seemed to have change to something related to how subliminally they make you feel hated and unwelcome as a paying customer. Not for me.

### "I will never use Easyjet again"
Not Verified |  I purchased return flights to Greece last year that were cancelled by Easyjet due to the pandemic. I decided to rebook for this April 2021 so checked online the price before going ahead, and was happy to find out that they were more or less the same price. However when I had to pay the price shoot up by more than £100? I went ahead as I did not have much choice (not offered a refund). I then discovered few weeks ago that they have been cancelled again. Easyjet did not let me know, I had to check my booking to find out. I this time insisted for a refund but Easyjet only refunded me the first payment but for some reasons not the second payment that I made when rebooking. Despite contacting them several times, they gave me a different stories each time and asked me to wait, moving the goalpost by few weeks each time. I have now contacted my bank and initiated a chargeback / section 75 in order to recover my money. Do not wait weeks to get your money back as they will stall the refund by any means. Go to your bank directly and get it sorted before the time runs out and you get nothing except a useless voucher or have to rebook your flights at a much higher cost that they are advertised online. I will never use Easyjet again as they are not trustworthy, stay well away too if you value, your time, money and sanity.

### "The customer service is absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  If I could give a 1* I would of. So we had a flight cancelled on Sunday 2nd August 2020 due to COVID-19 which was fine, we completely understood. So we went to rebook with our voucher today which was worth £278 to find out that the new flights are only £148 in total. So what would you expect? You’d expect that you would have the remaining balance on the website to use again, right? No that’s not the case, I have just spoke to 3 members of staff who ‘claim’ that we just loose the money & they cannot issue a new voucher for the remaining balance. So in total we have lost £130! Now we are expected to pay for our seats & baggage on top. What an absolute joke. Please read this before amending your flight. Please get a full refund, do not make our mistake. We will never ever fly with this company again. The customer service is absolutely terrible & most of the time they don’t even know their own policies. Also we asked to speak to a manager he reply was ‘oh he won’t even come to the phone’ I think we’ll leave it there. Thanks EasyJet for robbing our money during a national pandemic, like we haven’t all suffered enough.

### "I just called their customer services and they were bad"
Not Verified |  As a “cheap” airline goes it’s ok, but I just called their customer services and they were bad! They hung up on me 3 times, had to call again even though I asked to be called back if the line gets “disconnected” again, and ended up being attacked and accused that I was “accusing” them for making a mistake when I never made any comments like that. All I said was that I am sure that there would be a way to use last year’s voucher to a new booking I made because I had forgotten that I had that voucher. And I know that there is a way because I have worked in contact centres and customer service for many years. Of course they could have cancelled the flight waving the fees and on the phone rebook the same flight using the voucher. I know it because companies have such contingencies and supervisors have authorisation for such things. But the representative on the phone was more concerned talking back at me, she got angry, annoyed and rude about me accusing them for the mistake (again never mentioned anything about mistake or verbally attack in any way, regardless if my call was dropped two times), and instead of looking of a way to - customer service - she was too busy checking the policy in order to tell me that easyJet’s policy cannot wave any fees nor can they do anything with the voucher afterwards. Actually when I asked her name she answered me “Oh, ok...” and she was annoyed. Really bad attitude and rude and I should know. I have won Customer Service Awards.

### "they have never let us down"
Not Verified |  Cannot verify the flight because it was cancelled due to Covid. Easyjet website was excellent in allowing us to transfer our flights to September without any extra charges. We have being flying with Easyjet since their inception and they have never let us down.

### "I'd rather pay more and fly with a serious company"
I knew it was a bad company, I mean it’s cheap but you pay the price for it. I bought a ticket in November as I had an event coming up. I was obligated to cancel my flight because of the lockdown. I called and someone said I had to pay to cancel or change the dates. However it is the country that was in a lockdown! I called again until someone made the change for free. I got my ticket postponed to January, however EasyJet changed my first flight to a Friday instead of the Saturday I was supposed to take off. I had to make a change again. I called and explained that I didn’t need my flight anymore as the event I needed to go to was done. They said I can’t have my money back. Ok then I asked for a voucher since I don’t know when I’ll be traveling again. The lady on the phone said I couldn’t have one. I have to pick a random date. When this random date arrived, I wasn’t able to fly. I wanted to make a change again but they asked me to pay 60€ for each flight which doesn’t make any sense as 120€ is 70% of the price I paid for my tickets. Then the guy tells me I could have asked for a voucher! No one can tell you the exact same info and now I’ve lost my money without flying. They don’t even care about their passengers, all they care about is making sure they still have their money since they know they are bad. That’s stealing to me. Anyway, it was going to be my first experience with them. Now I'd rather pay more and fly with a serious company.

### "Easyjet - Difficultjet"
Easyjet gave me problems. I have a flight from Seville to Gatwick on 7th March, I want to change it and it is supposed I would have to pay the change difference. It didn't happen. I tried to managed the booking for the 23rd April, same destination, and there is no fee difference, deduction. I have to pay the whole flight, all the price. I tried to call to customer service but they cannot do nothing. I asked if there is a possibility to speak with IT as it could be a mistake from the website but they said no. I used to fly with them but I am considering not doing so anymore. Conclusion. Easyjet is not flexible and it felt like a theft as he had to pay a whole new flight when they specified only the difference in fare to be pay. Easyjet - Difficultjet.

### "flights were reasonably pleasant"
We flew easyJet twice, going from Gatwick to Athens and back. Both flights were reasonably pleasant, service was alright and food alright as well. When we first got to the airport in Athens and went through check-in, it was fast, efficient and the staff were friendly. Airport procedures were smooth and hassle free. The boarding area was quite busy and few shops and cafès were open. We ended up waiting about an hour when we got to the gate because getting through the airport was more efficient than  expected. The plane was clean but not spotless. The toilets stank a bit and there was a bit of mess in places but nothing to make a big deal about. You needed to pay for food, but the prices weren't too over-the-top. The food itself was OK as well. The choice wasn't fantastic: They had a calzone, bacon sandwich and something else with bacon but by the time they got to the back the calzone was sold out and I can't have pork. I was stuck with the breakfast box, which wasn't fantastic but wasn't bad. Service was OK. There were four cabin staff, all female, and they were friendly enough, but they were all young and wouldn't stop gossiping at the back near where we were, and it did eventually get slightly annoying being forced to listen to the four women banging on about makeup. Seats were narrow and uncomfortable, legroom was poor. COVID procedures were followed, cleanliness was not bad. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but if it's your only option then it's fine.

### "said I had the wrong covid-19 test"
I was denied boarding from this flight, they said I had the wrong covid-19 test even though I had a negative test taken within 72 hours of the flight as stated. I have contacted customer service multiple times to try to get a refund or at least the reason I was denied boarding in documentation so I can submit it to my travel insurance company, but cannot get a response back, except one stating that the reason I was denied boarding was that I showed the test on my phone, which I know to be false because I saw plenty of people do the same thing and be denied boarding and there is no policy on their website on what kind of test to take or that it can't be shown on a phone. I lost a business opportunity and hundreds of euros in accommodation and travel expenses in Spain. I will never fly this airline again, and I hope after continuing to reach out, one day they'll have the decency to give me a legitimate reason for being denied boarding.

### "credit card was refunded the whole amount"
Not Verified |  We were due to fly in the middle of July this year with EasyJet. I was sent an email to say that if we didn’t wish to travel at that time because of COVID I could claim a voucher or change to other flights or if that didn’t work for us to ring customer services team. Of course like many people that proved impossible as it kept me in a queue for about an hour then cut me off. After several attempts I gave up. There are no customer service emails that they read so that proved impossible although I tried the all the email addresses I could find. All were undelivered. I then wrote a letter to Mr. John Leighton who is head of customer services. This was sent recorded delivery to make sure it was received. The letter was never acknowledged although I did request that they kindly reply. There has been no communication from EasyJet about a refund but to my surprise my credit card was refunded the whole amount end of October total of £968. So a satisfying result in this case and I’m delighted that EasyJet refunded me. I’ve never had a problem with EasyJet before and have always been satisfied with their service within so am happy to say we would definitely fly with them again. I do think though that their communication should be far better.

### "customer service staff are rude and incompetent"
Not Verified |  What a ridiculous flight company. Keep cancelling flights and providing vouchers that we will never be able to use. Basically once they take your money, you will never see them back, we are waiting for a refund since May! Their customer service staff are rude and incompetent. In the beginning of year when COVID started, all easyjet employees where putting on Facebook things like "Do not ask for refund, please accept our voucher instead, you will save our company", we (Customer) helped you by accepting this useless voucher but the voucher cannot be used because there are no flights available for our destination and we cannot get the refund either, basically easyJet said "we took your money and you will never see them again". On top of that we are paying another flight company in order to reach our destination. We spend all day on the phone with rude customer service where they refuse to refund the vouchers and they refuse to put in writing, because they are aware of legal consequences.

### "Very poor show"
Booked a flight and had it cancelled due to lockdown, chose to take a voucher so the business would not close down. Rebooked after lock down, and had this flight canceled too, tried to get refund and was told because it was a voucher they could not refund any money. Don't want to see the business go under but they don't help themselves, Very poor show.

### "I am denied the refund"
Not Verified |  If I could give a zero I would. I had booked flights for my daughter and I for summer 2020. Corona got in the way and I received an email stating that I could get a voucher. Thinking that this was my only recourse to recoup my loss, I accepted. Then later they announced that the flight was cancelled and that there was a refund (in very tiny print) available. I asked that it be changed to a refund. Now after over 40 emails making this request and speaking to sales reps I am denied the refund. I conveyed all this information plus the fact that I have moved to a country that Easyjet does not have flights and was told that they will not do anything to change the situation and give me a refund. Effectively keeping my £217.00 and providing no services. What a disgusting company. Don’t use them. I won’t ever use them again.

### "Goodbye easyJet, never again"
First a change of schedule, from a return flight at 13h to 9.15 am. On a short trip to Venice this makes a huge difference. We had to skip our paid breakfast and leave the hotel by 6.30 am. No explanation, no apologies, no possibility of changing the return for the following day. We were then charged 65 euros for a carry on bag, I was told to stuff my handbag inside, pressured by the extremely unpleasant employee and told they would close the doors on our flight, I did not have time to repack, my case is standard but zips large and can look larger than it is, I have never had a problem and nothing was said on the outgoing flight, everyone was allowed to carry their handbag on the flight form Paris. My partner repacked his bag ans wore his raincoats then arriving at the plane we were told there was no need to check it given the flight was not even one third full, Although the easyJet desk employee did not hold a gun to my head for money, they might just as well have. Goodbye easyJet, never again. Covid makes it hard for you, but this is not acceptable, when a flight is full there may be some justification, but not on an empty flight.

### "accused her of taking photos of him"
Not Verified | Although this airline is often the cheapest option, you get what you pay for. I travelled with my daughter from London to Paris, and several people had to check their luggage because there was not enough room on the fully booked flight. This held up the flight, and we departed late. On board, my daughter was taking photos with her phone out the window. An airline steward accused her of taking photos of him, and wanted her to give him her phone and access to her camera roll. My daughter is 7 years old and this was completely inappropriate. I firmly told him no and he continued to argue with me until I showed him there were no pictures of him on her phone. When we arrived in Paris, no one from EasyJet would take my complaint.

### "the best low-cost airline in Europe"
Short domestic flight within Italy. Brand new aircraft, great legroom for a LCC (better than some legacy carriers), polite staff. Left on-time and landed ahead of schedule. Incredibly cheap ticket price. For me, they are the European equivalent of AirAsia: without any doubts, the best low-cost airline in Europe.

### "Disgraceful behaviour"
Disgraceful behaviour from a boarding staff agent. Picked on me and my teenage daughter on our high quality Adidas face masks. Then our bags. Then would not give me his name or allow take our prepaid hold bags. Plane half empty lots of space.

### "a great budget airline"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Belfast in Feb 2020 on Easyjet. It was a hassle free flight and it enabled me to fly direct from the Netherlands to Northern Island. Deplaning in Belfast was very quick. I think Easyjet is a great budget airline.

### "very comfortable flight"
Not Verified | Flew from Belfast to Keflavik on Easyjet im March 2920. It was a very comfortable flight from a very under utilized airport. Boarding was handled efficiently. We did board via a bridge. Did not buy anything on board as I spent three hours in business lounge in Belfast airport before the flight.

### "require a document signed by the parents"
I was lucky enough to have my granddaughter with me this summer, who is now 2 years old. My daughter managed to come after they opened the virus from Switzerland, after 8 months without seeing them. After their stay here, they had to leave to work back to Switzerland a couple of days before me. I was supposed to meed them there after 2 days, so today, I was supposed to be leaving with my granddaughter to drop her back in Switzerland. When I arrived to the boarding door, after waiting some time in the airport, the person in the boarding door did not allow me to pass because they require a document signed by the parents to allow a over 18 child travel with someone that is not his or her parent. My daughter had left me the family book and the passport of my grand-daughter, so that we would be able to travel back to where she lives. Not even having on the phone my daughter and sending me an authorization with a wet signature they let me pass. Now I will have to drive back home with a baby her, leaving her away from her mother for even longer. With all the bad things that happen in this world and you need to focus your time ans resources in avoiding a family to get together during this complicated times. If you decide to take an easyJet flight to save a couple of euros, just pay a little more if you can afford it because in health and well-being they will hurt you more than losing a couple of euros.

### "The cabin was clean"
Gatwick to Lisbon with easyJet. On time departure, early arrival! (These days, the low traffic flux en route and in terminal area helps the schedules). The cabin was clean, the staff professional, and overall good procedures both on ground and in flight.

### "not possible for vouchers to be reversed"
I've used EasyJet many times in the past, but never had to contact their Customer Support until now. We had a flight cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown in the UK. My wife made the booking, and when the flight was cancelled she was emailed saying she could take a voucher for the full value of the flight (no mention of refund), which she did. After a bit of Googling, we learned you had to call and request a refund over the phone, which I did, and the person I spoke to said they'd "reversed" the voucher and applied a refund instead but that it would take up to 3 months to appear back in our bank account. 4 months later and we still have no refund, so I called them back today and they're claiming they have no record of this conversation and that it's not possible for vouchers to be reversed to refunds. As it was done over the phone, we're now at the mercy of their call recording software to see whether they have a record of this call and what I was told - I guarantee that the recording of this call will have been "lost".

### "affordable prices"
Lisbon to Gatwick. Punctual, clean airplane, nice staff, affordable prices. On this journey everything went well, as I am used to.

### "An okay experience"
An okay experience. Easyjet cancelled our flights to the original destination, and their cancellation policy is really awful. You are directed to get a voucher, and need to make aAB7U3Hn effort to rebook to another flight. It's made difficult on purpose. Instead we flew to Athens, which cost us extra for the connecting flight, but you don't want to waste energy with this company, since it will get you nowhere. Now, this alternative flight was very ok. If they do fly, they offer a decent low-budget flight, and are not too picky on the hand luggage. Staff is always cheerful and happy to support every customer. Flights (incl. return) on time, well organized and pleasant.

### "Extremely frustrating"
Last year August we started planning a trip through UK and Ireland. We were very excited. In January we booked our flights to the UK with British Airways and we booked a flight from Glasgow to Belfast with easyJet. In June our British Airways flights got cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 numbers in South Africa have steadily been rising and experts estimate, that the peak will only be reached in September. Since the cancellation of our British Airways flights, I have trying to get in contact with easyJet, to let them know, that there is no conceivable way we can get to Glasgow by the 21st August. All attempts to contact easyJet have been unsuccessful. After two hours of being on line with their customer care line listening to the stupid ring tone, I realised no one was on the other line. I tried their facebook, twitter and email accounts, but could get no response at all. Earlier this year, the easyJet website clearly stated that change fees will be waived due to the pandemic, as long as the changes occur 14 days prior to the scheduled flight. When trying to change the flights tonight (14 days prior to the scheduled flight), however I was charged 228 GBP for the change fee. Please keep in mind that the original flight cost was only 192 GBP. I find this unacceptable. You should be able to contact a customer care line and explain the situation, but I've only had generic responses from robots. Extremely frustrating. If I could give 0 starts I would.

### "firmly asked to remain seated"
Not Verified | Off to a relatively quiet start at Gatwick but social distancing badly maintained, especially at the gate which was a bit of a free for all. Thought that the airport might have allocated staff to run things more smoothly and in a more reassuring way. Wrong! Boarding by row numbers, though, from the back of the plane so no jostling in the aisles. Constant reminders to keep masks on and cover both mouth and nose. Disembarkation also really well organised. We were very firmly asked to remain seated until the row in front had cleared. Very impressive, easyJet. Not so, Gatwick airport.

### "Completely disappointed"
Completely disappointed with the way they managed the COVID-19 pandemic. They canceled our scheduled flight, did not refund our flights back, never answered our phone calls for further details about our flights, and possibly for a change of dates. They also charged us extra money for changing the dates we did on our flights. For a flight with a final cost of 276 euros, we were finally asked to pay 479 euros in total along with the change costs they charged us. In the new dates we closed the COVID-19 problem arose again, we tried again to contact the call center, but in vain no one ever answered us. The only information we have is that they will inform us one day before our flight, if it will happen, which makes it impossible to fully manage the rest of our travel bookings because the company does not know until the last minute whether it will take us to the destination us, without of course giving us the option of a refund or a coupon.

### "a 2 hour wait on the phone"
Not Verified | Had to call 3 times to rectify my flight that's in a couple of days, each time it was a 2 hour wait on the phone which is ridiculous! When I finally got through the first two times, the agents hung up on me! The 3rd time, a gentleman picked up and he was the most helpful agent that I've come across. He was very polite and efficient. I would have given this review a 1 star because of the first two agents but Thoren gave me a change of heart so thank you for handling my inquiry professionally!

### "cash refund a month exactly after flight"
Not Verified | Return flights for our party of four on 4 June was cancelled. I applied for refund on 1 June online and was expecting a long process and a longer wait for refund. I was very pleased when I received cash refund a month exactly after flight was due to fly out. Our party of four have been flying every year with Easyjet for 20 years and will have no problems booking for next 20.

### "I insisted I wanted a refund"
I had booked flights in March, due to covid-19, they gave me a voucher even though I insisted I wanted a refund through all possible legal ways to no avail. Used the voucher recently and have paid at least 70 euros on phone bills. My experience with them this year has been revolting, they try to confuse you, make you wait in line unnecessarily so they can charge you more, everything was terrible from start to finish. I will do my best to keep apart from this company.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience with EasyJet. They do not allow customers to claim for a voucher after they changed the flight departing time. I am still waiting on the phone for 22 minutes and counting, no one picks up and music plays. Emailed them several times with no answer either.

### "Zero stars for the shabby service"
Flight cancelled because of cov19 was understandable. Have been using Easyjet most months since monarchs went under so to support them and knowing I'm going to be travelling when it's possible I opted for voucher. I booked again for 15th July the same day my flight was cancelled back in March. After the check in opened in May I checked in and downloaded my boarding pass but only after Easyjet emailed me a week before to offer me £10 on top of my original ticket price should I wish to cancel or request a voucher. I was happy to book so I never responded. However I heard that some friends of mine who were doing as I booked on different dates had been cancelled again for no reason even though there flights were still on I was getting worried. After I checked in and boarding pass issued I booked and paid hire car payment made for gatwick parking low and behold I checked my flight status I discovered a disruption to my outward flight and after checking it then listed as cancelled. I had not received any contact or email by then. I try to contact customer services and after numerous attempts of an hour or more i got through after 2 1/2 hours, they confirmed that they cancelled flight. The reason was overbooked and anybody flying alone as I was had been was bounced off - my belief is that they are selling seats at much higher prices because of demand and that they could not care about those of us who who tried to support them and are frequent flyers with them. Zero stars for the shabby service and Customer Services are non existent and useless.

### "Would not recommend it"
Today I called easyJet after waiting for 2 months for an answer from them, regarding 2 bookings they cancelled. After waiting for 45 minutes the first time, they hung up on me. I called again, they hung up after 16 minutes. The third time they placed me on hold for 2 hours and 22 minutes, just to hang up on me later. In total I was listening to music for more than 3h and a half. EasyJet can announce proudly that their customer service is even worse than their prices and services they provide! Would not recommend it even to my worst enemy.

### "wholly unprofessional outfit "
Not Verified |  Liverpool to Bodrum. Telephoned Easyjet for my parents as their flight was cancelled due to the CD19 pandemic. They had been trying to get through for over 4 weeks and had lost patience (they are both over 70). I understand that Easyjet are extremely busy during this unprecedented period but the attitude of this company is unbelievably arrogant! The Customer Service rep who I finally managed to speak to (after nearly 2 hours of constant redialling) confirmed that Easyjet have received my parents refund claim but stated that they my parents claim will have to wait up to 90 days to receive their full refund. When I informed the customer service rep that they are acting unlawful stating this and my parents may have to ask their bank to charge back the refund from Easyjet, he said "if your parents do that, they will then owe Easyjet the cost from the banks chargeback and will not be able to fly with Easyjet again"! With an attitude like that Easyjet do no deserve to come out the other side of this successfully and carry on being able to operate. I was flabbergasted. I only hope that customers of this wholly unprofessional outfit remember the way they are currently being treated (awaiting for their hard earned refunds for cancelled flights and services they are not receiving) and go elsewhere. As I stated to the customer service rep (before I left the call), with an attitude like this, Easyjet will be lucky to still be around this time next year! My parents have already experienced bad form from this company (due to being victims of Thomas Cook) last year, they were left stranded in Turkey and had to resort to paying £1200 for 2 return flights.

### "not going to fly EasyJet again"
EasyJet cancelled our flight (EZ-8366) due to Covid-19. Upon cancellation, we were given an option for refund, which we applied for in March 2020. Since my boyfriend is American, he received a full cash refund, whereas I being Italian, received the voucher. We submitted our request for refund on the 16th of March, to which EasyJet responded with an email stating that our request will be processed within 7 working days. Instead, EasyJet waited 6 weeks from the date when we submitted our request for refund. After which they took a further 5 weeks  before issuing me a voucher and my boyfriend a cash refund. I know one thing for sure, I am not going to fly EasyJet again.

### "Shame on you easyJet"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled had the option to change the flight to another date or cancel Or a refund. I decided to change the date which cost me an additional £304 my husband did not realise that I was changing the date and on his laptop looked to book the exact same flights and moments after The exact same flight was £140 cheaper. I sent these details to easyJet with my complaint and I was appalled at their response and excuse. Rebooking are not asking for a refund. Shame on you easyJet

### "They have made it nearly impossible to receive a refund"
Terrible customer service. It has been over 50 days since I requested a refund from EasyJet for my cancelled flight on 29th March. They have advised that I need to wait 90 days for a refund which is just ridiculous. I applied for the refund online before EasyJet revoked this option from customers, they are now claiming that they have a backlog of refunds that were requested online and customers that called into the helpline afterwards were given priority. I will never fly with EasyJet ever again. They have made it nearly impossible to receive a refund. I have tried to contact their helpline 100 plus times and only managed to get through to them twice. This is putting me under an immense amount of stress which I do not need being heavily pregnant and with the current pandemic.

### "They offer me instead a voucher"
Not Verified |  Luton to Faro. You should get your money back. They offer me instead a voucher which I have to use in the next six months. I waited more than half an hour on the phone, spent much money, and later when received the voucher it says at the end of the e-mail I have to call them if want to use it and so pay again the call. I liked this airline but they are acting in a very sneaky way which is deplorable.

### "refuses to refund my money"
Funchal to Lisbon. My flights were canceled due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. EasyJet refuses to refund my money alleging technical issues with the refunds lately. If you buy a service and that service isn't delivered, you should get your money back, that is a basic universal law. They offer me instead a voucher which I have to use in the next six months, however who knows how much time this pandemic will last or if the airline will be operating at all in the future. I waited more than half an hour on the phone, spent much money, and later when received the voucher it says at the end of the e-mail I have to call them if want to use it and so pay again the call. I liked this airline but they are acting in a very sneaky way which is deplorable.

### "won't fly with easyJet "
London Gatwick to Belfast. My flight from London to Cairo was cancelled, and I had to change my flight in order to come back to Belfast on the same day. I checked in, and I paid for my bags. I went to my gate in order to get my flight and at the gate the staff were very rude and extremely vulgar to me. I had my small bag and my small laptop with me. Pay to pass otherwise you won't pass. I told her that I came from Belfast with my laptop without any problem, and she is rudely repeated her message again and when I told her that you are really rude she went mad and she said that. I will call the captain, and you are not going to board. The funny thing is when the supervisor came to solve the problem I asked him to talk privately and he was clearly supporting his colleague without even listening to me as a customer who has a right to explain what happened. And they start to ask me to pay another £110 in order to use the next flight. It is unbelievable when you use easyJet for 7 years and suddenly you have such an experiment with a team that unprofessional. I won't fly with easyJet again and I will share my experience with others.

### "lifted the heights of my admiration"
Not Verified |  I have always found Easyjet an excellent airline to fly with and now after the magnificent effort by the airline to repatriate a family member back to the UK when another budget airline washed its hands of us has lifted the heights of my admiration to a new level. Service like this is second to none.

### "angry how they handled the situation"
Vienna to Basel. Flight got canceled because of coronavirus. I spend 3 days trying to find out how to get a refund but without any luck, you can just cancel it without getting money back. Applications and the web is broken, you can't reach customer service. My first bad review ever but I am really angry how they handled the situation!

### "thankful to the cabin crew"
Marrakesh to Gatwick. With all the disruption that was going on due to Covid-19. I could understand the mess of the ground staff were going through due to the high influck of passengers trying to go home. The handling agent was not good enough in organising themselves to face the situation that made it so hard for the passengers. The airline was your normal low fare airline as usual, the crew were superb in every way including my bad experience with my blood pressure that they helped me with. I certainly am thankful to the cabin crew, I wish them all the best and I extend my great appreciation . We were at the airport 48 hours trying to catch any flight to London, went through hell And the flight crew made us forget the misfortune we got at the airport.

### "rebook without extra cost"
Lisbon to Funchal. The company suspended its operation to Madeira island on the day I had my flight due to Covid-19. It is understandable and I was able to rebook without extra cost although I don't know if circumstances will let me fly on the new date, one month from now, which is disturbing.

### "Good flight"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Malaga. Good flight. Treated myself to an exit row seat, this includes speedy boarding. With the speedy boarding you do have to skip past the normal queue a bit, so don’t be too shy! In Amsterdam Easyjet uses stairs, in Malaga airbridge. Took an okay lunch at a reasonable price.

### "Good flight"
Not Verified |  Alicante to London Gatwick with easyJet. Good flight. Same story about the speedy boarding: with the speedy boarding you do have to skip past the normal queue a bit, so don’t be too shy! In Alicante a combination of airbridge and stairs was used, in LGW airbridge Took an OK lunch at a reasonable price.

### "flight on time, no delays"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Krakow. Wonderful flight to Krakow, lovely caring staff, flight on time, no delays. Clean seating area and toilets. Was worried about the corona virus well explained by the staff. I would fly with this company again.

### "customer unfriendly company"
I had booked on a flight from Geneva to Budapest for a dental appointment. Due to Corona virus my dentist in Budapest cancelled my appointment. I checked on the easyjet site to change the flight. I was surprised to see that changing my flight was more expensive than buying a new ticket for the same flight. I fail to see how Easyjet can justify more than the cost of the ticket for changing the dates of the flight. While the cost of the tickets are reasonable, Easyjet is a very customer unfriendly company for everything outside of the ticket.

### "very efficient and transparent"
Funchal to Lisbon. Flight got slightly delayed due to the French air traffic controllers strike and too much traffic in Lisbon. The captain however made up for this, he was French but still made the effort to make announcements in Portuguese and greeted each passenger deboarding. I thought this was a great gesture, the ones that make a great airline. They are very efficient and transparent, you know you can count on.

### "delayed for 5 hours"
Not Verified |  Athens to Edinburgh. Not only was our flight delayed for 2 hours, but it was also diverted to Glasgow. Reason: French air traffic control strikes. The whole journey was delayed for 5 hours. We're not even sure if we will get a compensation for that! Definitely wouldn't recommend it to families with small children or the elderly. Nothing positive here.

### "definitely do not recommend"
Luton to Tel Aviv. The flight was supposed to leave at 11:05. Boarding opened at 10:15. I bought my ticket speedy boarding for the reason that I could check in easily and rapidly. Once arrived near the busses to enter the aircraft the staff announced a problem saying the crew hasn’t arrived yet. We had to go all the way up to the gate again. I am very annoyed as I am pregnant. Anyways, we went back up and I asked the staff if I could use the toilets, since they couldn’t tell us how long it would take. They wouldn’t allow me because if I leave the gate they wouldn’t be able to guarantee me I would still be on the flight. I told them I was pregnant but they couldn’t care less. When it comes to charging passengers for overweight, easyjet has a great and rapid service! £12 per kilo! But when it comes to helping elderly people or pregnant woman they are the worse. I definitely do not recommend to fly with this company as the staff is heartless.

### "We think you are wonderful!"
During the flight from Malaga to Glasgow, I became unwell, and collapsed. My husband called for assistance, and we were lucky that the stewardesses were super efficient, courteous, kind and proficient, in dealing with this emergency. I have heart failure, with a defibrillator. My husband felt as though we were in good hands, and could relax when Jen and Vivienne took over, to care for me. They did everything they could to minimise the episode, while there was no disruption to other passengers. So, thank you so much, Jen and Vivienne, I wish you, and the rest of the crew, the very best. We think you are wonderful!

### "Perfect experience "
Manchester to Prague. Perfect experience with easyJet. I had an 3kg overweight in my checked luggage and they did not ask me to pay an extra charge. I also had 1 cabin luggage and one backpack and they were ok with it. The seats were very comfy, aircraft new and clean. The pilot was communicating with us throughout the flight.

### "Unprofessional staff"
London to Vienna via Zagreb with easyJet. Flight was delayed, again and again. They changed the gate then made us wait more. People were split up and half of us were waiting outside the aircraft on the runway on strong wind and low temperature. Unprofessional staff and very unfriendly.

### "refused any sort of assistance"
Prague to Milan. Given the coronavirus travel restrictions, airlines refund flight tickets not only for customer safety and satisfaction but also in the name of assisting in not spreading infection. I was refused any sort of assistance whenever l manage to get through by phone (which was only once or twice as their number provided online does not work most of the time) with the ex cuse that "nothing is happening and they fly as usual". My flight is to Milan. Their app barely works, making it impossible to make any booking changes.

### "still waiting they refund me"
Barcelona to Paris. My plane was cancelled due to the strike. They never inform me, and after 2 months and many calls and mails, I am still waiting they refund me for the second flight I had to book. They tell me I will receive an answer in 72hrs, nothing. Very bad customer service.

### "Really good flight!"
Bristol to Amsterdam. Really good flight! Had a couple of bad flights with easyJet recently but this flight was great. Cabin crew were great and very friendly. The Cabin Manager was lovely. Fast and efficient onboard service. Boarding in BRS and disembarking in AMS was quick and easy. Couldn’t find any faults at all.

### "Thank you easyJet"
Not Verified |  Krakow to Bristol. Great journey back from our holiday, staff were amazing and airport even better. Traveling with two kids (8 and 10) I ask if I could upgrade to hand free and was told its not a problem. Expected to pay I was then told that today this will be free of charge, great service. Thank you easyJet, small things that make our journeys better.

### "they are just a money making airline"
Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Marrakech with easyJet. Feels like they are just a money making airline, pinching every penny from the customers. They make rules to suit themselves with no set rules. They were charging £23 both ways for luggage, we didn’t have hold luggage. On the way back to Gatwick they offered to put my luggage in the the hold luggage for free. I wonder how would the customers who paid for their luggage to go in the hold would feel.

### "fair price, good quality"
Naples to Milan. I cannot complain with Easyjet, in my opinion in Europe this is the best airline, fair price, good quality, good pilots and I have been flying with them over the last 10 years, I wish they had a frequent flyer program for loyal customers.

### "thankful for such prompt assistance"
Not Verified |  
I can only thank the easyJet team from Bristol airport for assisting me so well. Due to an over 2-hour delay of my flight from Glasgow to Bristol on the 10th February, I lost the one that was headed to Lisbon, both easyJet flights. I explained the situation to the customer service desk and I was told that the next one from Bristol to Lisbon would only be on Thursday (this happened on Monday). I couldn’t stay in Bristol for that long, it was impossible; there were other flights to other two Portuguese cities the next morning, but they weren’t feasible either, since I had to invest more time and money. I had no idea what to do. I begged for alternatives, asking which was the nearest airport to Bristol and when would be their next flight to Lisbon. The senior manager suggested me to go to Gatwick, since the next flight to Lisbon would be the next day in the afternoon. London seemed reasonable, so I accepted. I couldn’t believe when I was told that all costs, from the taxi to the hotel, would be covered by easyJet. Not only did they book and paid a 2 hour and a half trip from Bristol to London, I stayed in a 4-star hotel in Chessington with dinner and breakfast covered. My flight from Gatwick to Lisbon was also arranged by them. All in all, I am deeply thankful for such prompt assistance, offering to cover these costs and overall turning this nightmare into a good experience.

### "I fully expect to be compensated"
My friend and I travelled on 07 Feb 2020 from Gatwick to Marseille. Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard. I filed a EC261 Compensation Claim and was rejected within less than 24 hours due to the fact that it was an "extraordinary circumstance" due to the air traffic control strike. The circumstances were already known 24 hours before they told us. I fully expect to be compensated.

### "my cabin bag was too large"
Not Verified |  I travelled with a cabin bag from Inverness to Birmingham with no problems whatsoever and I am a Easyjet plus passenger. On my return to Inverness from Birmingham I was accused by a young girl that my cabin bag was too large. I pointed out that I had just flown from Inverness with it but she didn't bat an eyelid but wanted 50 pounds! When I asked for her name to complain all of a sudden the computer didn't work properly so I could board. Total scam as far as I'm concerned. Even so Easyjet on the whole is a great cheap airline.

### "happy with the overall experience"
Belfast to Amsterdam. Check In opened a little early as easyJet normally only opens two prior to departure. Going through security was very fast as they had 3 lanes open. Normally Belfast International airport is renowned for being very slow. I went to the Causeway Lounge and used my priority card for access. The lounge and service is good as there are sufficient selection of food, snacks and drinks available. They also call when boarding is starting and the lounge is located very close to the Amsterdam boarding gate. The boarding process on easyJet is by priority (speedy boarding), but you need to make sure that you are ready as it is difficult to get overhead space to put your hand baggage if you are not ahead of the queue. We pulled back on schedule and arrived in Amsterdam on schedule. You have you want something to eat or drink on easyJet you have to pay, however that is ok as the service is fast and efficient. Baggage came out very quickly, therefore overall I was very happy with the overall experience.

### "professional and friendly crew"
Salzburg to Berlin. It works! I am flying nearly every week mostly Lufthansa, Eurowings and easyJet. A lot of trouble with Eurowings when it comes to being on time and canceled flights. Totally the opposite with easyJet - I had more than 20 flights with them in the last 6 months. No delays, no canceled flights, professional and friendly crew - quite often with a good sense of humor. The prices are super competitive and they also part of an exchange now to make flying more friendly for the environment - already included in the ticket price. With Lufthansa, you have to go to an own platform and it’s complicated, takes extra time plus you pay on top without a tax benefit. easyJet is probably not the best place to work for the employees but it seems they have a good culture and the service is great.

### "A real disappointment"
Flying from Prague to Luton, EZY2252 on Jan 21st, 2020. The scheduled departure time was 20:55 with boarding at 20:25. The day before the departure, both Google and Flightstats indicating that the departure will be 40 min. delayed. However, no such an information was provided by easyJet or Prague airport. Therefore, I was assuming the flight is on time and was ready for 20:55 departure. At 20:25 the boarding has been announced. As late as 20:36 we were told (for the first time), that the plane is delayed. The boarding actually started at 21:20 (rather than 20:25). Than we were sitting in the plane without getting any information as to why we are not moving. The plane departed at 23:58. easyJet demonstrated the disrespect to the passengers. They have known well in advance, that the flight would be delayed but did not dare to inform passengers. They could not care less. We were also not provided any updates on the additional delay in the plane. We were just told they switched the planes. Such a behavior displayed is simply unacceptable and unprofessional. A real disappointment.

### "cancelled the flight"
Paris to Manchester. Horrible service. The flight was told to be delayed by 2 hours first and then another 2 hours and finally easyjet cancelled the flight. Staff were extremely rude and not helpful at all. For every doubt i asked i was just asked to go stay in a hotel they provide. Arranged a flight next day, even that got delayed by 1.30 hours. Never flying with easyjet again. Worst flight experience.

### "no consideration for their passengers"
London Stansted to Naples with easyJet. Typical budget flight, although this time they wouldn't allow my wifes handbag or my small man bag, we had to crush them into our hand luggage. Then a morning flight with people trying to sleep, the all female cabin crew congregated at the rear of the plane and chatted away loudly and incessantly, so much so they kept us awake for the entire flight and even with noise cancelling headphones on I was subjected to their entire life stories! Absolutely no consideration for their passengers.

### "Last time I use EasyJet"
Luton to Zurich. On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ‘room’ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ‘speedy boarding’ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn’t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ‘no, I won’t be getting them’ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous. You couldn’t make it up. It was the sort of shambolic situation I have come to expect from EasyJet. Last time I use EasyJet unless there is absolutely no alternative.

### "compensation was credited"
Lanzarote to Amsterdam was delayed by 3.5 hours due to crew issue. Cabin crew was nice an courteous. Back home filled out the online compensation form for EC261 regulation on the easyjet website. Got a reply they couldn’t fulfill my request because they were not able to retrieve the booking. Called their contact center and a friendly agent sorted it all out. Within a week the compensation was credited on my account.

### "The staff was great"
Gatwick to Glasgow. We are so pleased with the pilot of this flight as we had terrible turbulence and he kept us safe. The wind was terrible never flown in those conditions before. The staff was great at keeping everyone calm.

### "haven’t received a response"
I had a terrible experience with easyJet. We arrived at the airport two hours early waking up at 4 AM. When we arrived the airline Baggage attendant Informed us we had to pay $52 per person for baggage. I informed her I had already paid for baggage in which she stated she did not see it and we had to pay for it again in order to place our bags on the aircraft. We purchased bags, received our boarding passes and then were told after our flight was delayed two hours. I explained to her we have a connecting flight and we will not make it on time because of the flight being delayed. She told me that it wasn’t her problem because it was a different airline.I went to the customer service desk and she stated there is nothing she can do. My boyfriend and I politely asked for our luggage back in which the staff stated she can’t refund us our money back for the baggage. We had to purchase two more flights to get home. I reached out to easyJet Monday January 6 in which I still haven’t received a response 5 days later.

### "Very frustrating experience"
Gatwick to Geneva on 9th January. Very frustrating experience. A crew member was extremely rude and aggressive to me. This is the worst experience so far.

### "a special thank you"
Not Verified |  Glasgow to Luton. I would like to say a special thank you to cabin crew Lisa who was unbelievably helpful during our flight back home. I get terrible anxiety when flying and was having a hard time calming down. Lisa went above and beyond to reassure me and help me get through the flight and even allowed myself and my husband to move closer to the front of the aircraft to ease the motion sickness. Hats off to the pilot for flying so well in windy weather. Would definitely recommend easyjet to friends and family.

### "extremely frustrating experience"
I had a poor experience today flying from Zurich to London this morning at 9:30 local time. I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers. Would not recommend this airline if you are looking for a decent customer experience.

### "the flights themselves were great"
Not Verified |  London to Rome. Many of the poor reviews seem to relate to baggage issues. We followed the website protocol and booked 3 bags into the hold. We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good. I don't think they were overly expensive but another time, we might take our own snacks to save a bit. This was my first experience of easyJet and I really have no complaints at all.

### "allocated a seat in the middle"
Funchal to Lisbon. I paid 411 euros for two domestic one hour and twenty minutes flights and was allocated a seat in the middle at the very rear of the aircraft. Through the flight I heard the crew chatting at the galley. Flight departed and landed on time.

### "My worst flight ever"
Venice to Gatwick. My worst flight ever. My husband and I had a priority boarding and our seat was row 2. However, the crew asked to us and other passengers with priority boarding to use the door at the back of the plane. When we went inside the aircraft the crew opened the front door and the others passengers from the front no longer let us pass. Indeed they were annoyed and angry with us because we blocked the aisle. A lady complained about that - she had seat row 1 - with the two assisting cabin crew but the two ladies ignored her. When we finally reached our seat, there was no longer space in the overhead for our suitcases. The two ladies assisting cabin crew ignored us again. When all passengers was seated and ready to go,  the captain announced a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes and we had to wait inside the plane. The two cabin crew chatting all the time to each other and they ignored everything around them. They didn't do nothing about four-year-old girl screaming, crying during  the journey from Venice to London, included the 1 hour and half delay. When I left the plane I had a severe headache. I don't think this is fair for leisure travellers. And also when their children crying it can be an embarrassing situation for many parents.

### "No free service"
Rome to Nice. My cabin luggage ended up as checked baggage while the cabin is empty. Flight attendant aggressive and disrespectful to me. Flight arrived early into Nice. No free service, no nothing.

### "memorable poor experience"
Lisbon to Funchal. The flight was one hour delayed, the aircraft was smelling badly when I entered it and there was a crying baby next to me, so this flight was a memorable poor experience. I reached my destination with a headache and one ear hurting.

### "AXA insurance not valid"
Bristol to Fuerteventura. I booked my hire car through EasyJet when booking my flight, and I paid for full insurance with AXA through EasyJet. On arrival in Fuerteventura I was told my AXA insurance would not be valid, and that I would need to use their insurance, at a rate of 24 Euro per day. I had no choice to pay 240 Euro plus some other airport charges for 10 days hire. Shame on EasyJet for dealing with GoldCar.

### "had to abandon the coffees"
Luton to Belfast. My wife and I were in the departure Lounge awaiting the notification for which Gate to proceed to. As it was still not showing on the ‘Live’ viewing boards, we decided to purchase a coffee from  Starbucks. Whilst waiting for the coffees, an announcement then came over the speaker stating “Final Call for EasyJet flight to Belfast at Gate 3” My wife and I then had to abandon the coffees and run to the gate. This was very frustrating as we had paid for a service which we would then not receive. Secondly and most importantly, my wife is currently suffering from a severe hip injury which she is in the process of receiving treatment. Therefore having to run was a great deal of discomfort! When we arrived at the Gate, there was still a huge Que awaiting boarding onto the flight and it was very clear the “Final Call” announcement was incorrect. I  spoke to the EasyJet staff at the boarding desk and informed them of the  situation. I asked if it was possible for I to walk back to the Starbucks to retrieve the coffees but they said it was not feasible and I would miss the flight. The EasyJet staff were not at all helpful or understanding. They showed zero sign of empathy. As a whole, I have been totally let down by the EasyJet service and have lost all faith in its customer appreciation.

### "most awful customer experience"
Luton to Seville. I paid for extra luggage to pack my bulky equipment. At Seville Airport it turned out that I was the only passenger whose luggage was lost. All my sports holiday plans were ruined on the first day. I was able to adjust them for the short-term but they managed to ruin it twice. At the airport (I arrived at ~11am), I was assured that necessary forms were filled in and I should receive all further communication by email. I’ve waited for some time - got nothing. Had to go online and manually fill in all the forms again; only after that I’ve got the first email saying “We’ll send you regular updates via SMS and email”. Since that email I have received no info by emaill/SMS in two days and had to call a few times a day to get some info, and every single time repeating all my details. Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they’ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I’ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, “certainly today”. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can’t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I’ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm. It actually arrived at 9pm. To sum up, that is the most awful customer experience I have ever faced. I was stuck in another country without extra clothes, my hygiene items and, most importantly, my sports equipm

### "It was frustrating for everyone"
The outbound flight to AMS was heavily delayed because of a ground staff problems (this time issues with the reservation/boarding system instead of hand luggage). Crew did its best to keep passengers informed but that mainly contained that they did not get any information from groundstaff. Finally after almost 40 minutes the captain left the flight deck and tried to communicate with the staff at the gate. It was frustrating for everyone and finally we departed more than one hour behind ETD. I have to say that I am commuting between AMS and VIE and usually take EZY. Out of VIE there is always a problem with the ground staff and the chance to be on time is little. The return flight was on time. Not much to say about service quality since there is none other than sales-service. Crew on both sectors did their job concerning safety but if you want friendly or assisting cabin crew you better fly with OS or KLM. Do I recommend? Yes because you pay for the transportation only similar to trains and the fares are cheap but do not expect more.

### "could have let us leave the plane"
Gatwick to Athens. Outbound flight EZY8087, flight was delayed by over an hour, long walk to departure lounge, then there was no sky bridge ( a member of the crew said 'We don't always know if there is going to be a sky bridge we can use'), so we all had to walk across a piece of tarmac in the pouring rain, once on board, you had to squeeze past passengers trying to stuff oversized bags into the overhead lockers. The food and drinks were ok, but quite expensive. Inbound flight EZY8088, they only had one sandwich option, and a tiny bottle of water to last three hours, was two and a half euros, (a one and a half litre of water from a mini market in Athens was only half a euro). I had a screaming baby in front of me. Then when we landed, there was an incident with a passenger at the back of the plane, which left us stuck for over half an hour, while someone made a decision about what to do next. They could easily have let us leave the plane. The cabin crew manager kept apologising over the radio.

### "We were so impressed"
Prague to Bristol. We arrived at Prague airport in good time but met delays going through the security. It was more stringent than the outward journey from Bristol. We were asked to remove jewellery and glasses that took extra time - if we had known beforehand we would have been prepared. Apparently the boarding took longer than anticipated and we missed our take off slot and were late leaving by about 40 mins - but weren’t concerned. We were told nearing Bristol that the weather was poor and the pilots did attempt to land but there was a lot of turbulence so they chose to move onto Cardiff airport. The outcome was a short stop at Cardiff to refuel during which the weather improved at Bristol and we eventually landed at our destination about 3 hours late. All through, the flight and cabin crew (Antonio was cabin manager) kept us informed and were calm and encouraging - dealing with a poorly passenger and someone who was stressed, 22 passengers who chose to get off at Cardiff and a subsequent security check of the plane. The crew dealt professionally with stroppy passengers and instilled confidence - especially in my husband who hates flying and trusted in the staff, as did I. We were so impressed we wanted to give positive feedback - thank you to the Bristol based crew and Merry Christmas.

### "Rude staff at boarding gate"
Rude staff at boarding gate. We were flying on 18th December from Luton to Paris My wife has a heart condition and was forced to take stairs when there was a lift there. Apparently we should have requested special assistance when we booked. She is not wheelchair bound, just can’t cope with more than one flight of stairs. Instead of being empathetic, they are rude and shouting sarcasm at us in public. They took our hand luggage at entrance to plane (no one warned us about this prior but they had tagged our bags).

### easyJet customer review
I travelled with easyJet a few days ago from Belfast to London, the staff members on the gate of the flight were extremely rude and delivered a very low standard of customer service. My friend and I were preparing to board the plane, she had a purse like bag and her cabin bag and they said nothing about that but I queued with the exact same size of bag and was told I had to open my suitcase and make it fit in, as my suitcase was very full I couldn’t fit it and didn’t understand the issue as my friends were ok. The staff member blocked us at the door and began demanding £50, yet other passengers on the plane were carrying laptops, suitcases and various other items and my friend had the exact same bag. Another staff member then joined her and began causing a scene and refusing to let us on the plane, pointing her finger and generally being nasty. This was very off-putting with being a regular easyJet customer. Although I cannot fault the staff on board, they were extremely helpful. This is not the first time this has happened, and I find it very unfair that it is one rule for one person yet another for someone else.

### "do not have an Italian visa"
Gatwick to Milan. Denied Boarding. I was travelling from London to Hurghada, Egypt. I had transit in Milan, Italy. They denied me of boarding because I do not have an Italian visa. I show them  evidence that I do not need a visa, but they did not accept it. Another friend of mine travelled in the same situation without any problems.

### "Worst customer service"
Gatwick to Berlin Tegel. Worst customer service I’ve experienced. I’ll never fly them again, they just out to cheat you and make you pay exorbitant amounts for baggage yet they claim to be a Low cost airline. I paid for two small bags and they charged me for luggage at the gate even though I explained that I paid for two bags. The woman at the gate just kept shouting at me. Needless to say at this point I’ll never fly them again.

### "will never fly with easyJet again"
The flight was cancelled 2 days before by Easyjet without offering any refund. They didn't offer as well any alternative way of transportation to arrive at destination, or an alternative accommodation. I had to find everything by myself and I had an important business meeting the day after. In order to arrive on time to the meeting I took a taxi. The taxi was quite expensive (40 Euro) but was the only way to arrive to the destination on time. I asked a refund to Easyjet for the taxi and it was declined. I had the same situation few months before with Ryainair, but at least they booked me on another flight and they refunded my taxi. I will never fly with easyJet again, especially if I have a business meeting.

### "the trip went like a dream"
A huge thank you to easyJet for making my trip to Kraków so easy and enjoyable. I’ve had an operation on my Achilles tendon and, after 6 weeks in plaster, I’m currently wearing a surgical boot. I use a ‘knee walker/scooter’ to get around but mobility is restricted nonetheless. I was a little apprehensive prior to my trip to Kraków but I shouldn’t have worried. EasyJet and their airport services partners (OCS in Bristol and Welcome in Kraków) meant the trip went like a dream. I was assisted at every step throughout the airport process - from check-in, through security, up to the gate and finally on to the aircraft. On arrival in Kraków I was met by the Welcome team who not only helped me off the aircraft, into the terminal and through immigration, but escorted me to the railway station and put me on a train to the city centre. The whole process was replicated on the return journey. We often read criticism of easyJet and their ilk but I really think that people very often only write about their bad experiences. So I just want to balance the scales a little and present a ‘good news’ story. I had a wonderful time in Kraków, helped in no small part by easyJet and their partners. Thank you very much guys - you did a wonderful job!

### "took away my cabin bag"
Valencia to Gatwick. The flight was 20 minute delayed. They took away my cabin bag to put it as a checked baggage. Later, when we got late to London, I had to wait 40 minutes for my luggage. When it finally arrived, there was no train anymore so I had to take a taxi which was really expensive. I tried to call them and the man who talked to me directly redirected me to the website without barely listening to my complaint. I then complained on the website, where I could not detail what was wrong with my flight and they denied my complaint within 2 hours. This is unacceptable.

### "charged me 52 Euros for a bag"
Venice to Paris. I booked 3 economy tickets through an agent and booked 26 kgs of luggage and then another 15 kgs of luggage online before the flight. We had 3 bags first bag 18kgs, second bag 15 kgs and the third bag was 8 kgs which was equivalent or few kgs less than the luggage we paid and booked. They say you booked only two loads of 26kgs and 15kgs each and we will not allow your 3rd bag. They charged me 52 Euros for a bag of just 8 kgs. We felt like as though we were looted.

### "ensuring their rules are standard"
Bristol to Geneva. I came across the rudest, least empathetic airline employee today. After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness. Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

### "was a decent flight"
Bari to Milan. Check in was speedy, but like most budget carriers, they also seek jet-bridge averse which is fine seeing as it probably speeds up their turnaround and lowers overall costs. Priority boarding seems a little more exclusive as it should be. With two door boarding disembarkation, the plane loaded and unloaded fairly quickly, so all things considered, this was a decent flight. Main line carriers are however roughly the same price if you travel with checked bags like I do, so I’d just pick whichever flight has the best time.

### "Cabin crew cheerful and helpful"
Not Verified |  Early morning easyJet flight from Manchester to Malta left on time and arrived on time. Plane was clean, and seats were comfortable for a 3 hour+ flight. Cabin crew cheerful and helpful. And all for under £50.- Fantastic.

### "another disappointing experience"
Not Verified |  I’ve only used easyJet a couple of times. Each time I’m even more disappointed with the service. I was flying from Barcelona to London on the 19th of November. Staff were very rude from the point of queuing till you get on the plane. I was carrying one hand-luggage in addition to my bag and I was asked to pay £60 for such thing and which I refused to do so. Then my carry-on luggage was held from the staff instead of being on board with me when it was supposed to be a cabin bag. Staff were not helpful at all. There’s always going to be an issue with your hand-luggage and without staff to help you. Overall it was another disappointing experience by easyJet in comparison to other budget airlines and I would not be recommending.

### "ticket was extremely cheap"
Vienna to Amsterdam. Flight was sold out and ground staff in Vienna obviously did not observe Easyjet's hand luggage procedure. At the end it took forever until crew could label and offload the carry on luggage of about 20 people. Of course the slot was missed and the delay caused by the ground staff was severe. Crew was unfriendly and everyone who understood Dutch could listen to the purser and 2 crew members when they started complaining about the ground staff, about passengers etc - they really did not care at all. Service was done by showing the bistro card and later the in-flight-sales brochure while rushing through the aisle. It was amazing how badly that crew behaved. I have to say the ticket was extremely cheap and if you see it as a flying bus-service it is all good.

### "you were terrific"
Not Verified |  EZY6254 Lisbon to Bristol. I just wanted to say thank you so much to the cabin crew, you were terrific. I wasn't feeling well and they went above and beyond to help me. Thank you.

### "flabbergasted at this generosity"
Not Verified |  I am writing in praise of easyjet customer services at Gatwick airport. Last week my 2 friends and myself who are all in our 70`s were on an Easyjet flight to Majorca from Liverpool when one of my friends fell ill on the plane. The crew did a great job attending to him but then decided that we had to divert to Gatwick so that he could go to hospital.On landing he transferred to an ambulance and my friend and I had to accompany him to Redhill hospital while the flight continued on to Majorca. After spending 5 hours with our cases he was discharged but told that he could not fly with his condition. As we had to get back to Liverpool we decided to go back to the Easyjet desk at Gatwick to see if they could advise us how we could get back home. After explaining our dilemma to a wonderful young lady, she who arranged a taxi for us to get home which involved a 500 mile round trip for the driver. She then supplied us with two tickets from Manchester to Palma the next day for two of us to continue our holiday. When I asked how much I would have to pay she said that Easyjet would foot the bill. We were flabbergasted at this generosity and we would like to thank Easyjet for their superb customer service and recommend them for future travel.

### "I would recommend easyJet"
Gatwick to Seville. OThe first time that I have flown with the airline and it covers the basics well in terms of luggage size and getting onto the plane quick. Bag size and weights are generous, with people sometimes trying to break the rules and bring more than one cabin bag on board. I was unable to find any locker space on the plane which meant I could put my bag under the seat in front, however, some may not be so lucky especially those boarding the plane last! Overall I was impressed flying with them. The plane was their new A321 Neo aircraft - nice clean plane with comfortable leather seating (no recline, however), lots of legroom for someone like me who is quite tall. There was good space under the seat in front, however, be aware that you might find the seat width a bit weird on this aircraft because they are more narrow than usual so be prepared to rub shoulders with other people! There are actually 2 sets of toilets at the back of the plane (I don't think there are any at the front). I was sitting as part of a group in row 36. Overall I had a pleasant experience. I would recommend easyJet over other equivalents such as Ryanair.

### "Cancelled flight"
Nice to Amsterdam for late November. Cancelled flight but didn't receive notification. I just happened to login to find flight number and noticed the cancellation. Flight booked nearly 6 months ago. I could have booked a flight a long time ago for less, now have to pay more because its last minute. Filed a claim and immediately denied stating “Notification was sent in advance of the cancellation to your flight.

### "cabin manager was amazing"
Not Verified |  Liverpool to Faro. We flew to Faro with easy jet on 11th October with my disabled son we were on the front row seats and unfortunately not long after our flight my son needed changing but he can't walk so unable to stand in the toilet. Katie the cabin manager was amazing she let us go behind the curtain by the toilet lie him on a blanket and pull the curtain round and asked people to use the toilets at the back of the plane until further notice. She provided us with a black bag and disposed of it for us. What was a problem and was a worry to how we would change him turned into no problem and made Thomas happy and comfortable again. The same thing unfortunately happened on our flight back from Faro at 130pm and again the Cabin Manager Collette was as helpful and made our worries of how we would change him go away. Again we were allowed to change him with the curtain round and again they disposed of the bag for us. All my fears disappeared and my boy was once again happy. Easy jet you rock. We will be flying with you again next year. Thank you Katie and Collette for making life easy and for giving my boy some respect and dignity.

### "couldn't be less helpful"
Malaga to London. Truly appalling the bagging system should be rethought severely it is outrageous that a handbag cannot be allowed onto a plane. I do not recommend this airline couldn't be less helpful if they tried. I will not be flying with this business again as it is not helpful or straight forward. However, the flight to Malaga was quite good. The reason is unknown why it was such a hassle to get a simple handbag on a plane

### "have always been satisfied"
Gatwick to Venice. The self service check in at Gatwick was very good. The system was very easy to use and quick. We had hold luggage and a small carry on case which we used the hands free service. This service cost £7 each way and was good as you didn't need to wheel a case around the airport. Although you hand luggage is marked up as priority and is supposed to come off first on the luggage belt, on both our outbound flight to Venice and in bound from Verona our priority case was next to last coming off. So be aware. The flight boarded on time and arrive well before the scheduled arrival time. The flight was good as was the service from the flight attendants who worked very hard and had a smile on their faces all the time. Seats 7a and 7b were fine, cabin clean as were the toilets. No complaints. We have flown Easyjet several times and have always been satisfied with the service provided.

### "my suitcase in broken condition"
My group of 9 people flew from Rome to Berlin with Easyjet. When we arrived at Berlin one of my big suitcase was not found. I reported to the lost and found at the airport and Easyjet online and tried to contact them via phone but they were hopeless and very frustrated is all I can say. 3 days later they found my suitcase in broken condition and most of the valuable stuff were stolen. They took no responsibility of my stolen goods. This made me sick when I think about this trip. Never put anything valuable in your suitcase when travel with Easyjet!

### "excellent flights"
Not Verified |  Tenerife to Gatwick. We have been using Easyjet for years and never experienced anything but excellent flights and immaculate aircraft. Bagdrop is straight forward and both the ground staff and the cabin staff are a delight. We have  no qualms about using this airline.

### "professional and efficient"
Not Verified |  I could not fault my flight out from Manchester to Prague on 22nd October. It departed and arrived on time. The crew were professional and efficient. It was free of hard sell of dubious scratch cards , overpriced perfume etc. Of course it is a low-fare outfit, cheap and cheerful, no in-flight entertainment nor free food, but take a book to read and buy fair value food and drink on board. Some of the shine came off on the return flight on the 25th October. It was delayed some 40 minutes , and no cogent explanation was given Telling us the flight was delayed leaving Manchester tells us nothing. Although the flight itself and the crew were as they were on the way out, it was a late evening flight, and did not get us to Manchester until it was getting alarmingly late to take public transport home. Hence not a perfect score

### "bag in addition to carry-on "
Catania to Bordeaux. Worst Company, rude staff Lacking. Improper Baggage Policy. First and Last Time. They charge anyone who has a bag in addition to their carry-on baggage. Pire compagnie au monde Personnel grossier et impoli Politique de bagages non conséquentes et abusives Première et dernière fois Ils font payer tous ceux qui ont une sacoche en plus de leur bagage à main

### "I could only take one bag"
Gatwick to Lisbon. I am very disappointed with the staff service. As I was boarding, they told me I could only take one bag however on my way to London from Lisbon, I took a back pack and a cabin bag. I questioned why Was I not allowed however the lady warned me that I would have to pay a £50 fee. I had to throw away products that I could not take due to the limit of the baggage.

### "get what you pay for"
Easyjet did the job. They got us from Bristol to Barcelona and back without any great hassle. OK it's a low cost carrier and basically you get what you pay for which suits us fine. We basically look on it as a necessary evil to get us where and when we want to go and easyjet delivers. It's a shame it has to be Bristol airport and not Cardiff where we live but it's a small price to pay to avoid Ryanair.

### "I eventually paid"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Luton. Even though the flight was smooth, the staff at Lisbon airport were rude and arrogant. They wanted me to pay 70 euro to place my hand baggage in the hold even. I said I was not going to pay and that is rather miss my flight. They kept bugging me until I eventually paid to get home. Never flying easyJet again!

### "Efficient and on time"
Gatwick to Sofia. Efficient and on time for both departure and return. Cabin announcements were complete and non intrusive. Aircraft was clean and cabin staff were great for full flights. The purchase on board of wine and snack package was really good. For the money paid for this flight, this was incredible value.

### "upsetting and disrespectful"
London Stansted to Naples. I was very disappointed by one of the crew members of my Easyjet flight to Naples on 13th of October 2019 (flight n. EZY325). I’ve been told, rudely, that there was no more space for my small luggage and had to drop it. I gently explained that I needed the luggage with me because every minute was on the count as I was flying for a home emergency and couldn’t waste time at the airport once in Naples. She kept saying “there’s no space sir”. Then I raised, saying “My dad is dying, and I can’t wait for my luggage. Please just let me keep this with me.” She said “No, there’s no space. Just doing my job.” I’m not here to contest her arrogance, but there was not even a small track of empathy with my request. Like trying to understand the situation and at least try to find a little solution. Even because I’ve seen other people after me with some big bags or small luggage coming to the cabin. So I don’t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It’s your job, not mine. And this is not an isolated case for Easyjet cabin crew, or in general low-cost companies. And I arrived at the conclusion that it’s sad to see tired members of staff not being focused on the customer needs but just on the Company business sides’ how to make more money “squeezing” us like limes. By the way, just for the records, even though the flight was itself late 40 minutes, I spent 20 minutes for my luggage and went home then couldn’t say goodbye to my father.

### "treated like cattle throughout my experience"
London Luton to Ibiza. Where to start, treated like cattle throughout my experience. The standout had to be this nugget, Girlfriend had a small suitcase with a handbag, myself a small backpack from work, flying together, we were treated to an arbitrary one piece of luggage rule by an uptight jobsworth, that some others were not. We simply rearranged our luggage to comply, not being trusted that we would not reconfigure our now one suitcase and one backpack back to the original state with the same content, said jobsworth tried to check in the suitcase, with some protest she backed down. I would not mind but this was a completely arbitrary process that some suffered, others didn’t. Otherwise, you’re typical EasyJet experience, lost luggage before we even took off, causing delays, with everyone having to identify their hand luggage. cramped seating, pricy yet reheated foul food (although I didn’t purchase, seeing what others had, I wouldn’t), staff with a chip on their shoulder. In short, it felt like a grim episode of some ITV 3 reality tv show.

### "unprofessional and unfriendly"
Bordeaux to Hamburg. After making us lose 4 hours on a precious Saturday, the unprofessional and unfriendly service continued without having the need for apologies. The ground service only target was to find further ways how to make us pay more money, even we paid already a lot for their additional services. And again, without feeling ashamed for the hours we were waiting for their mistake and for the fact that we lost whole Saturday! And of course they were not interested at all in the additional costs we faced (e.g. delay in picking-up the car from parking).

### "always had a positive experience"
Not Verified |  Arrecife to Gatwick. The boarding at Arrecife was much improved from the last time. The Speedy Boarding line was clearly marked and queues were polite unlike the aggression I encountered last time from some people queuing in this airport. Boarding was uneventful and I found the exit row seat to offer brilliant leg room for my lanky frame. Seat was leather and a little firm although fine for a 4 hour flight. Trolley service was quite swift and the cabin crew were pleasant and cheerful. Announcements from the captain were a little hard to hear but their frequency was good and he was good at making up the delay and landing was smooth and on schedule. I have always had a positive experience with easyJet and will continue to enjoy my plus card benefits. The aircraft was just over a year old and very smart indeed.

### "regular flight with easyJet"
Naples to Athens. Pretty regular flight with easyJet. They refused to take my hand luggage on the check in counter, but then on the gate, they did not allow me to take it on the plane. The plane boarded on time, however there was a delay. They told passengers it was due to the busy Greek air traffic, however other flights were landing on time (I have to admit though that this August there were a lot of delays in Athens airport). I also wanted to buy food and the crew was not attentive at all. Their service was very slow and when I was to be served, they told me that my order was not available. When I told them that I did not want to purchase anything else, they amazingly found a last piece (after 10').

### "I had a great flight"
Lisbon to Madrid. I had a great flight. This was another airline that I was unsure about but honestly they were fine. I purchased a Plus fare so I could have my carry on suitcase and another small bag (just beware of these types of rules when flying with budget airlines). All of the staff that I encountered were very nice. Would fly easyJet again.

### "none left for vegans?"
Not Verified |  Tel Aviv to Luton. What is the point in having a vegan option if there is none left for vegans? You need to make sure you have enough, a 5.5hour flight without being able to have a meal is not acceptable. You have to remember that non-vegans also eat these options!

### "trust them and their service"
Funchal to Lisbon. Nice gentleman at check-in in Madeira. The flight was very tranquil even though there was half an hour delay. I trust them and their service: that's crucial as a customer.

### "never use EasyJet again"
Gatwick to Rome. This airline creates so much traveller friction that any enjoyment with the experience of travel turns into a day of being ripped off, treated like a person that is baggage size/weight scammer, or liar about bookings. When this trip is finished, I will never use EasyJet again. Their website changed the month of my booking three times when I progressed to the next page. It caught me out finally and I had to the same as two tickets in the same booking to make the changes. I really want to insult this company but they get more of that than they do positive feedback, but what does that mean anymore anyway? When you cost as much as your premium rivals for less than 25% service, your days are numbered. Bring back the days where you pay for a proper ticket and to these destinations that don't have all their routes swallowed by budget bus companies with wings, and let's get proper standards and service re-installed in the international travel business.

### "Thank you easyjet"
Kos to Glasgow. I can’t praise the cabin crew highly enough after my wife was taken very ill. She was looked after by the crew for the 4 hours 30 minutes journey They kept me up to date as I was unable to sit with her even though they had another minor emergency at the rear of the plane. Thank you easyjet

### "Awful experience!"
Oslo to Berlin. Awful experience! Paid for extra luggage ahead of time then was charged $110 for a $60 flight, paid for early boarding and boarded with everyone else. Waited 1.5 hours for our luggage as we saw it sitting on the tarmac. Customer service is just a run around. Simply awful!

### "crew were just brilliant"
Not Verified |  We flew Easyjet yesterday 23rd September from Rhodes to London Gatwick at 12.15 and wanted to leave a review as the crew were just brilliant - probably the best crew I've ever had the pleasure to fly with. So congratulations to the crew of flight EZY8790

### easyJet customer review
Madrid to Gatwick, delayed departure by 61 minutes. Never once has my easyjet flight taken off on time. Stay on the plane without any information from staff about why.

### "My suitcase was 3mm too long"
Gatwick to Geneva. Worst airline ever. My suitcase was 3mm too long literally and I had to pay 50 pounds. I traveled with this suitcase all over the world with low cost airlines and never had a problem. Many other customers had same sized suitcases and they were not asked to measure it. As a tall man I feel already penalized enough in terms of seating space and because my clothes simply take more space, so I, at least, demand that either all suitcases are measured or they give me my money back. I suspect that as I was one of the last passenger in line, they realize that they have not enough space to fit all the luggage in the compartments and they just give it a try, even though all other measurements where well bellow the limits. Also the person checking my suitcase didn't show any sort of emotions: I am used to customer oriented airlines where the staff cares about their customers, this is not the case for easyjet. With 50 pounds extra, this airline is fare away from being competitive and next time I will pay 5 pounds more in order to fly with a reputable airline or take the bus.

### "did not make for a good experience"
Lisbon to Funchal. On boarding it felt it was my duty to greet the cabin crew not them, the same applies for deboarding. Plane was full which did not make for a good experience onboard. Was asked to squeeze my laptop into my bag at the gate but at least the lady was nice. I wouldn't want to repeat the experience, that's for sure.

### "worst flying experience"
Barcelona to Paris CDG. The worst flying experience I’ve ever had. My flight was delayed for 3 hours and 30 minutes. The explanation of the delay was due to weather conditions in the city of departure (Barcelona). In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket. The captain was very weird saying that our flight would last 1h and 35 minutes but then he said he would expect in Paris by midnight (considering the new departure time of 21:35). In fact, we started moving at 21:56 only. I’ll apply for EC261 and hope they will refund me money. I understand that it is a low-cost but anyway timing is always important.

### "obstructive and unhelpful"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Mykonos. The easyjet flight was delayed according to the app and the check in boarding signs. I made my way to the departure gate 51 to enquire about the precise timing of boarding and to confirm the flight was indeed delayed. I was standing in the speedy boarding queue and when my opportunity came to enquire about the delayed departure the check in staff replied she knew nothing about the delay. She was intentionally obstructive and unhelpful. I explained my wife was busy buying something we has not packed for our trip. The easyjet staff member could have offered to put out a PA address to call my wife but no, she was never going to be that helpful. Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife. Once we had checked into the boarding area there were all sorts of pa announcements calling for late passengers. After this a PA announcement came stating the pilot was delayed in arriving so the flight was indeed delayed. I would like to give Easyjet a big fat zero for this customer service.

### "they have refused reimbursement"
Bristol to Nice. Easyjet cancelled our flight 3 min before take off and told everyone to book and pay for other flights to get you to your destination, and then they would reimburse online - we did this and submitted 16 forms online and they have refused reimbursement? We have submitted all receipts tickets boarding passes for £3238.30 for 5 in family and had to borrow this to pay another airline before our holiday had started! We cannot afford a solicitor can anyone help us? Easyjet online system and chat line / customer services are hopeless and cannot give you a valid reason?

### "very disappointed customer"
Not Verified |  My husband, Mother in law, father in law and I booked return flights with easyjet earlier this year to fly from Bristol to faro in August. Two days before our flight we went to check in online, My mother in law and father in law had no problems, but when we were checking in at the same time we were unable to check in. We contacted easy jet to be told they had over booked our seats. The only option they gave us was to turn up at 4am of the morning of the flight and see if people didn’t show up, they may arrange another plane but that wasn’t a guarantee either. We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid £275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn’t guarantee anything cost £150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights. Before now I can honestly say we have never had a problem with the airline, but to do this to customers shows how little they care. A very disappointed customer.

### "Won’t fly with this company again"
Terrible experience. Had a two hours delay from Amsterdam to Gatwick on a Friday, which resulted in arriving 23.30 instead of 21.30 on Friday evening, so that night was wasted. The delay took twice as long as the flight itself would’ve been. Then on the way back, the plane was also delayed 45 minutes. The chairs are all right, but limited leg space and you can’t buy anything on board with a Maestro card. Won’t fly with this company again.

### "Cabin fitted with newer seats"
Amsterdam to Gatwick. Flight was fully booked and cheap with 23 euros. Boarding at Schiphol was not very fast. Cabin was fitted with newer seats and were OK, legroom was tight. Service on board was limited due to the short length of this flight. Flight arrived 20 minutes early.

### "EasyJet refused to compensate"
Gatwick to Nice. Flight was late by nearly 3.5 hours. Arrived at Nice airport after midnight when all public transport had stopped for the day. I was therefore obliged to take an Uber home - about 5 kms. EasyJet refused to compensate the charge, as well as incidental food/beverage charges. Reason given for disallowing the transport was "a private arrangement" was used. What on earth is this supposed to explain?

### "a very unpleasant adventure"
Milan Malpensa to Cagliari. Unfortunately I had a very unpleasant adventure with the airline: Friday 6 September from Malpensa I had to take the 20.05 flight. We were in Milan for work (photographers at a wedding) and we arrived in time to learn only arrived at the airport that our plane had a delay of 3h. I never received a text message or an email warning me of the delay. Shouldn't I receive it? Apart from that, the flight finally started with 2 hours and 51 minutes of delay ... so not only the long wait but neither the compensation that starts from 3h. However we arrived at the airport in Cagliari at midnight. Deserted airport. We go to the car rental to pick up the car we previously booked but the car rental was closed. We looked for someone from easyJet to ask for help but at that time the airport was deserted. Having no other choice we took the taxi that took us to our accommodation where the next day we had another wedding (always work). The taxi cost us 120 euros. I sent the request for reimbursement of at least the taxi since no one will repay us for all the inconveniences attached to this delay ... but at least the out-of-pocket expenses. I respond that repayment is not possible. It seems absurd to me. The airline no. Does he reimburse the only means of transport available at that time at Cagliari airport? And what was I supposed to do sleeping at the airport? All this is absurd. The customer care is non-existent and assistance in case of problems also. I also purchased the insurance and supplement that does not give any guarantee.

### "boarding is closed your flight"
Extremely angry, Ridiculous CDG to Edinburgh.So unimpressed by this airline. I had arrived at CDG airport for my return flight. Departure area is so crowded with delayed flights. I was in the line to board the flight with my wife, the queue was still long so I said to the lady that we are getting close to boarding time. But the lady was so abrupt and said few flights are delayed and I can’t help with this. I pleaded in desperation but there was absolutely no empathy whatsoever toward me, they just carried on chatting. Somehow managed to clear security check and we ran till the gate. We were late by minute and half. At the gate we spoke to a staff member who said boarding is closed your flight and we can’t allow you. But still there is time and I can see flight still at the gate. I was standing distraught and she asked me to move and ask easyJet service counter. The people at easyJet service counter are so rude and not even answering. I asked other person at the counter and he said we’ve got no flights for you and you need to wait 24 hours for next flight. And they said you need to extra 242EUR. Finally we ended up in paying to the stayed while night and day in the airport. The same situation happened to other co-passengers. We disappointed with the easyJet. The way these people treat passengers is absolutely ridiculous. Everyone was lined up for boarding, and it took forever because at the gate they complained about every little thing. The staff at baggage counter doesn’t know anything boarding/check-in process and they took long time for each passenger and always asking senior staff for everything and making passengers to wait for longtime. Next time I'll stick with a better airline.

### "Very disappointing service"
London to Geneva with easyJet. Very disappointing service. After having to pay 50 pounds for a small hand bag I was not provided with a receipt, refused to get support to request it online and after going online twice and not successful was told they did not know and could not help. Poor training, poor service, lack courtesy and empathy to the point to threatening customer.

### "the lady said the gates closed"
Palma to Liverpool. I had arrived at Palma airport for my return flight, checked in, passed  passport control and was was ready 2 hours before at the gate with my boarding passes. I was in the queu to board the flight when my 8 year old daughter said she felt slightly sick, the queue was still long so I said to the lady on the gate I was taking her the toilet - I was 10 minutes. On my return I  walked up to board and the lady said the gates closed!‬ ‪My flight weren’t due to leave for a further 20 minutes! I didn’t understand. But the lady was so abrupt and said your not getting on. I pleaded in  desperation but there was absolutely no empathy whatsoever toward me, they just carried on chatting. I literally had £150 in my bank and knew I was in trouble, I tried not to let my children see how petrified their mother was but they could they were besides themselves. I went down to the main @asyJet desk and spoke to a staff member who said you’ve missed your flight what do you want us to do about it. I was standing distraught as where my children and she asked me to move as there was a man behind wanting to be served. She closed the shutter down and went onto the next desk! I then asked can I speak to a manager so someone came from the back and said we’ve got no flights for you. They said we are not flying you home for £150. I was messaging family asking could they help but flights where coming back at £300 each at 11pm that night. I managed to eventually book flights with jet2 who gave us blankets pillows and took our cases and baggage in their office so we could rest. They boarded us first on the plane and really lifted mine and my children’s spirits with their kindness after realising what had happened with easyjet earlier.

### "Really unimpressive"
Nice to London Gatwick. So unimpressed by this airline, plane delayed an hour and a half, not departing till 23.30. No explanation for delay. When I arrived at the gate realised that at least four of the other EasyJet flight were also delayed by at least an hour. Departure area so crowded with delayed flights there was nowhere to sit other than on the floor. Really unimpressive, British Airways so much better and often no more expensive.

### "Extremely angry"
London to Amsterdam. Awful. My flight for my 4 day holiday in Amsterdam was cancelled 2 hours before we were due to take off! I was in the airport, waiting in a huge queue to get my boarding pass checked when my boyfriend just happened to look at our flight details and see it was cancelled! No one told us, there was no email or text (until a few hours after cancellation) and we were stranded in the airport without any idea what to do. We were given a replacement flight for half way through the next day, but my holiday was short anyway so it was not worth it. I was not refunded or apologized to, and on top of that, I was charged £!50 for replacement flights for the next month. Extremely angry.

### "never be flying easyjet again"
Split to Luton. I arrived at the airport in Split and was required to check my back pack (which was carry on size) due to an overbooked flight. I landed at LTN and my baggage did not come off of the carousel. I was told it was located and I would receive it in the next few days. It has now been over 2 months and I have not received ANY compensation or my bag! I have been charged for long distance calling, made a claim 3x to which no one has responded and been ignored for weeks on end by the customer service staff. None of the staff has seemed to care and I have been treated as though I do not matter at all. I was even told that my bag was located and I should expect to get my bag returned only to be misled for weeks, prolonging the fact that my belongings are forever gone. I will never be flying easyjet again.

### "I want my money back"
Milan to Malaga. Horrible experience, as always! To be at least one hour in late is the rule, fly on time is a miracle! They let us wait up for one hour in a narrow corridor, pressed all together without air, before boarding. But the more ridiculous thing is that we paid for speedy boarding in order to fly with our luggage and we couldn't bring them with us in the cabin! So what did I pay for? I want my money back!

### "could only check one bag per couple"
Catania to Naples. Just like all of the other airlines, the staff and crew were nice and pleasant to travel with. In all, it was a similar experience to any other airline. However, it was a completely different story when it came to bags. We could only check one bag per couple. We managed to transfer items between bags to make it work. We then had to leave one overhead-sized carry on to be stored below. That was what we wanted to begin with, but we had to drag it through a busy airport first. The big issue for us is that some people were charged for stowing that extra bag (€60) when others were not. This was after they were told to take those bags to the gate. It was very confusing and it appeared that there was no set standard. The whole boarding process was slow, confusing, and stressful. We will pay a higher ticket price to travel with another airline for our next trip.

### "ridiculous and unacceptable"
Stockholm to Berlin Tegel. Worst cheapo airline ever! The way these people treat passengers is absolutely ridiculous. Everyone was lined up for boarding, and it took forever because at the gate they complained about every little thing that didn't fit their interpretation of the carry-on policy. Every 2nd person was pulled aside for bag size/weight checks or to put stuff into their 1 bag they're allowed to bring on board. They wouldn't even let people hold a book or a jacket in their hands. Only 1 item allowed! they kept telling everyone, even though the policy says 1 bag, not 1 item. A book or a jacket is not a bag! My bag was a little bigger than what they allow, and I was fine with paying extra. However after doing so the check-in employee instructed me to "leave the bag at somewhere at the gate before entering the plane". I walk down the gate, had to go to the rear door walking across the air field .. no sign, no attendee about dropping checked bags. I enter the plane, the bag fits perfectly in the overhead bin, I sit down, we take off, we land and I exit the plane with my carry-on. Where was I supposed to leave my bag? Somewhere unattended in the gate? Anyone who's ever flown knows: "Never leave your bags unattended". Anyone walking by could've accessed my stuff. Sorry EasyJet, but this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable! I've disputed the credit card charge through my bank, because I'm not paying for a checked bag that I didn't have. Next time I'll stick with a better airline. Never had an issue like this before, even with other cheap airlines.

### "4 hour delay in my flight"
Valencia to Gatwick. 92 minutes of waiting to speak to customers service to complain about 4 hour delay in my flight later today, It ended they said sorry.

### "company has changed and not for the better"
Gatwick to Belfast. As a very regular flyer particularly with this airline I believe my opinions are fair and well grounded. Taking at least two flights a week every week, this airline has become very unreliable in 2019. Constant delays of evening flights being announced before 10am the same day. This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive £50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure £100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over £5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else. So flight club and plus membership, let alone loyalty stands for absolutely nothing. Never once have I submitted an eu261 claim for the countless late arrivals and multiple taxi fares. From now on my approach with match how the company views my loyalty as a customer. Poor show folks. The company has changed over the past 2 years and it's not for the better.

### "have now boycotted them"
Geneva to Liverpool in January. I used to use easyJet a lot but have now boycotted them. Arrived in good time at the airport but as our flight was delayed were asked to wait in a long line whilst they sent other passengers to the front. Got to the front and told bag drop closes on the original not delayed time so we missed it (by 3 mins) and couldn’t board. Told we could pay a ticket transfer fee and get a later flight but no flights available for 2 days - booked a flight the same day through the easyJet app for a lot more than transfer fee. Complained, easyJet Ignored the complaint. Complained again, easyJet said it wasn’t their fault as they had lost the complaint but miraculously found it when I called - easyJet accepted responsibility but declined to reimburse the extra costs incurred. Case taken to independent arbitrator -arbitrator finds in our favour - easyJet ignored the findings beyond the set date and still has not paid.

### "speedy boarding worth the price"
Luton to Porto. We have been satisfied with easyJet in the past but the return trip this time was delayed 2 hours and all we got was an insincere apology. They could at least have offered everyone a free drink. We also wonder why it is that the departure gate at Luton is always so far away from the terminal building. This time we had to walk to the farthest of 16 gates while only one of the other gates along the way was in use. The speedy boarding option offered by easyJet is worth the price as it avoids long queues. It is also possible to book seats with extra legroom, providing all passengers are over 16. Of course, the price adds up and if you pay for hold baggage as well it can cost as much as a regular (not cut-price) airline. For us, the convenience of flying from Luton makes this worthwhile. One last comment - why don't easyJet enforce the cabin baggage size limit? People struggle along the cabin with ludicrously large "hand luggage" bags but the crew never say a word.

### "coming up with lame excuses"
Paris to Geneva. EasyJet is the worst airline. I had 6 flights canceled and most of the other ones late at arrival and late for take off. Their prices are not even low cost, most airlines will offer the same if not better pricing. They keep coming up with lame excuses to not have to fulfill their duties regarding the EU261 regulation. Travelers should avoid this company. Ground service staff are usually very nice but clueless, under staffed and not well trained.

### "will never fly Easyjet again"
Barcelona to Gatwick. We are done with Easyjet once and for all!! Easyjet used to be an okay choice if the low price justified dealing with all the discomfort from the messy boarding procedures, to the constant in-flight announcements, uncomfortable seating, and generally poor service. We were even okay to accept the occasional slight delay in the past. But this year Easyjet has topped themselves: 100% of the flights we took with them this year (so far about 6, incl. return flights) were late. The latest one back from Barcelona was delayed by almost 4 hours. Instead of arriving back in Gatwick at 22:55 we arrived after 2am. With no more train services running we had to arrange a taxi for £95 to get home where we eventually arrived at 3am. Still in dispute with them over compensation for the delay and the transportation charges. This is the final nail in the coffin - we will never fly Easyjet again.

### "always a terrible experience"
It’s always a terrible experience with easyJet! Their flights are always late, regardless when and where you are flying from and to. Strangely the delay is never their fault, so they do never pay back any compensation! This time the we had a 50 minute delay and they kept us on the plane for the whole time dispensing just a glass of water since it was terribly hot outside. Their crews are the slowest and most inefficient in earth! Despite being lunch time and on a delayed flight with no perturbations, it took more than an 1.5 before ordering and being served food. There was no choice on food being just one type sandwich left available! Food is small portion and expensive. On the top of this, they make you paying in euros by default, also with English cards, smart move since menu prices in euro have 2014 exchange rate!

### "Horrible experience"
Amsterdam to Berlin. Horrible experience. I have never heard of an airline charging 60 euros to check a standard carry on bag. I watched the agent as she decided who had to check their bag and who didn't. Clearly there were some bags that did not fit in the baggage "sizer" but she still let them through. The seats were very uncomfortable! They did not recline at all. Upon arrival to Berlin there is no signage for baggage claim. 15 people on my flight walked out of the secure area looking for the baggage claim. When we went to the luggage dept we were told it cost $50 euros to claim our bags. This is unheard of! Total scam. I will never fly with easyjet ever again!

### "Good experience"
Brindisi to London Gatwick with easyJet. Good experience. The app is good for the pass, boarding easy and priority correctly applied. Very nice crew, both flight deck and cabin. A little late due to slow baggage loading. Air bridge at Gatwick much appreciated due to weather. All good.

### "absolute incompetent airline"
Not Verified |  Gibraltar to Manchester. Stranded in Gibraltar airport due to an absolute incompetent airline. All literature provided says to speak to their airport crew of which there is no one in the airport. After 1 hour on the phone, put through to a manager who promised me a call back in 30 mins. 4 hours later still no call back so call back again... speak to an agent who tells me he’ll put the manager on, 30 minutes later still on hold so call back again and the agent answers the phone again knowing exactly who I am and I’m now on hold once again. Biggest joke company I’ve ever dealt with.

### "€60 extra for luggage and backpack"
Naples to Paris. Highly unreasonable airline and out to scam you! Zero client service. They make you pay €60 extra (per person) if you have a luggage and backpack, despite it being able to fit under the seat. Then when my partner and I got to the plane, they took our bags anyway even though there was room on the head storage, without asking my preference - so much for priority treatment. I’m typically very patient and fine being accountable when I overlook something but this is just outrageous. Terrible company. Worse than Frontier in the US and Ryanair was a better experience compared to easyJet.

### "experience one of the worst"
Gatwick to Berlin. I boarded the aircraft (seat in row 7) to find no space for my standard size cabin luggage. Passengers had filled up the front wandering to their seats at the back (no personnel managed the process). I was sent all the way to back where I was then told there was no space left either. I was told and leave the suitcase in the front to be taken to hold luggage. So I had to carry the suitcase against steam of onboarding people to front (told everyone on the way that there was no space left for luggage to be helpful). Once arrived at the front I got shouted another passenger because I was in the way and he did not understand why I was going against stream. Personnel did not intervene, so had to fence for myself. Then the personnel told me she just learned that there is space in the back. So I grabbed my suitcase and went all the way to back again where the lady told me that there seems to be no space! I turned around and found a spot myself by moving a bag that was tiny and yet occupying half an overhead drawer. This is yet another example, as I find pretty much every time I fly with this airline, of personnel just mismanaging processes and making the client experience one of the worst in the industry.

### "couldn't take backpack into  plane"
Amsterdam to Luton. The flight attendants are nice, the space between the seats are good. But I couldn't take my backpack into the plane. I had to put it with all my stuff inside my hand luggage. It was embarrassing. Many passengers had to do the same or check in their bags. As I entered the plane, there was place to put bas under the seats. So it was completely unnecessary to do that.

### "went beyond my expectations"
Not Verified |  Luton to Nice. I have mobility issues and just wanted to say that easyJet went beyond my expectations. A person waiting at Luton airport took myself and my family through check-in, customs then onto an elevation bus, through a separate door onto the plane. Then arriving at Nice a man was waiting to take us through customs and the airport all the way to the hire car company. The same on my return trip. By far, this is the best service I have come across from any company.

### "this doesn't fly anymore"
Milan Malpensa to Paris CDG. I suppose the airline was kind enough to delay the flight for 3 hours. Or should I say 7 hours if I count the delay from last week for the same flight. What really irks me is not the cancellation itself which happens especially when it’s this time of year. It's the fact you cancel after 4 hours. Really? It takes you 4 bleeping hours to figure out you can’t take off? This may have been acceptable when you were low cost but considering the creeping fares and the bogus charges this doesn't fly anymore.

### "Not impressed"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Prague. Delay going out due to them not moving the plane to the gate the night before and then it was too busy to move the plan. On our return I still do not know the reason for the delay and I am yet to board the plane. If I was late they would not accept this, so why do the paying passengers have to deal with their incompetence? Not impressed.

### "Real disappointment"
Stockholm to Berlin. We paid online for one extra luggage in case we purchase something during vacation, which we didn’t. At check in they told us it was ok to take our both small luggage according to their standards. However, at the Gate they charged us again €60 (after we already paid online and they didn’t even check their system). On top they threatened us to call security and not let us fly unless we pay again, considered abuse of power. Real disappointment, not worth the saving.

### "not flying with Easyjet again"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Barcelona. Following our check-in on Sunday 27th July to Barcelona, we were informed our flight was cancelled and to find alternative transport as there were no flights available, we missed our cruise in Barcelona paid for new flights, had to fly to Germany then a connecting flight to Palma in addition the cost of a taxi from London to Manchester and hotel accommodation in Palma to try and pick up the cruise ship I had two children with me as well. Having returned from my holiday I telephoned Easy jet to speak about my claim, I would like to report how unhelpful your customer services team member was, when I requested to speak to the claims team you simply left me on hold for an hour. I still haven't received my refund and have been told there's is nothing they can do about my refund other than for me to wait. Most definitely not flying with Easyjet again, the disruption this caused us with additional costs and travelling to be treated in that manner when you telephone to discuss my claim. Other airlines informed their passengers of the proposed ground strike in Barcelona that day, why did easyJet wait until we had checked in, why did they not inform us prior like other airlines.

### "outrageous price to have overhead luggage"
Naples to Berlin. I am not happy with this airline because of the nickel and diming it does to it's customers. They charge you an extra outrageous price to have overhead luggage. They advertise like it is part of your flight. It's not! By the time you are charged for the extra baggage you may as well had bought a nicer airline ticket because it will have cost the same. EasyJet plays games with there customer deceiving customers instead of just charging what they need to operate.

### "the crew were excellent"
Not Verified |  Faro to Gatwick. Yesterday flew home on EZY8920 and the crew were excellent. Polite, attentive and efficient. This may go against the grain of some recently read reviews but I think when customer service is provided well it should be praised. Yes a good level of customer service should be the norm absolutely, we pay our money and expect nothing less. However all of us expect a pay on the back occasionally for a job well done and this crew deserve just that. Thank you also for the care shown when my daughter in law felt a little unwell. Well done easyJet!

### "refused to provide any refund"
Gatwick to Marseille on 26 July. My flight got cancelled and after claiming a refund again and again, they refused to provide any refund. After a 2 hours delayed flight last week, Easyjet finally decided to take us to the gate pretending there was  a flight ready for us. Then they told us the flight was cancelled and they would try to provide a replacement for the next day, which never happened. They sent us emails and text messages apologizing and assuring us that they would refund the flight ticket and our expenses. So after booking myself a bus to go from London to Marseille I logged in onto their website and applied for the ticket refund and applied for the expenses refunds. And so they emailed me back explaining that the event was out of their control due to storms and so they could not reimburse me. Clearly the last time I book a flight with easyjet.

### "not travel easyjet again"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Chania. The cabin crew were great, didn't stop working. But they need to get to grips with parents who let their children run up down the aisles, bring their own food and let them spread it everywhere and  let them scream and kick the backs of seats, even the cabin crew were fed up with it. We sat in seats 31e/f and it seems you lumped all these little horrors and their parents together, you should warn customers that this could happen. Will will not travel easyjet again.

### "I missed drop off by 2 minutes"
Amsterdam to Basel. I missed the drop off in Schiphol by 2 minutes. The personnel there refused to re-open the drop off despite the fact that I had my boarding pass and hold luggage pre-paid as the process to re-open was “too complicated “ and was unable to provide any solution to me. As a consequence, I had to buy a last minute ticket with another airline (a regular one) at full price with no compensation. I am amazed by the total lack of service and could understand their behaviour if they would pay a full refund for any delay, even a 2 minutes one. Out of fairness, but the way they treat customers is obviously not 2 way. As a consequence I will never travel with them anymore and can only advise others to favour regular airlines which are very competitive price wise and offer some service. Especially if you have hold luggage.

### "cancelled one hour before"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Milan. I had a flight on Monday cancelled one hour before departure. No flight available for 2 days. Easyjet says they will not pay EU 236 for extraordinary circumstance. thunderstorm the day before? The day before? No assistance at the gates, no coffee, no water, no calls. Flight re-booked 2 days later, the new flight is running late of 1:30 minutes.

### "awful customer service"
Not Verified |  I had a flight to Amsterdam on the 24th of July for mine and my partners first holiday without our families. It was a disaster. I’ve never flown with easyJet before so was apprehensive anyway but was worse than anticipated. We arrived for our flight, been through security checks, all the normal procedures and then proceeded to wait around for 4/5 hours for our flight - our flight was announced cancelled. We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we’re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk. We stood in a queue of about 200 people, all upset, and waited a good 30 minutes before being told how to rebook flights. There were only two members of EasyJet staff tending to the 200+ passengers with cancelled flights, one employee on the customer service desk and one handing out leaflets. We managed to get a free hotel for the night with a dinner and breakfast and rebooked a flight for the next day. Theyhotel was mediocre, the food was awful! The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice. We were left waiting in a queue with lots of agitated passengers so me and my partner left. If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to never use easyJet again. I experienced awful customer service, awful organisation, and a waste of a holiday

### "completely abandoned her"
Amsterdam to Gatwick. My 82 year old mother was due to fly back home to Gatwick on Friday 26th July. However when she got to the airport she discovered her flight had been cancelled. She only received an SMS message to confirm this after she had arrived at the airport. After a long wait he got rebooked for this evening (2  nights later.) The flight has been cancelled again. This time Easyjet did not bother to let her know! She is an elderly lady travelling alone with special assistance. Easyjet has completely abandoned her. We have been customers for many years. This is an absolute scandal! If she didn't have us here how on earth would she cope?

### "The staff didn't care"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to London with easyJet. Flight got cancelled 20 minutes before it was supposed to take off. There was no staff in the connections booth forcing me to leave the airport and go to the departures lounge. The staff didn't care about our problem and had no sympathy at all.

### "more or less on time"
Lisbon to Madrid. They used to have friendly cabin crew members, that seems to have changed. Still, congrats for departing more or less on time. Aircraft was also clean and the short flight was a breeze.

### "you can end up stranded"
My plane was diverted from Basel to Zurich. This was not the fault of easyJet. Nor would I give them a bad review for that kind of problem. It is how they handled us post problem that was not acceptable and I would describe as horrible... and possibly negligent. I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you’re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim. If you need any further assistance please speak to one of our ground crew in the airport who will be happy to help you. Note "if you are able to make your own arrangements" and "one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me "go catch a train" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety. I am still struggling to understand how they can drop you off in a different place and do nothing to help you get to your intended destination. Warning to all, if your flight has issues you can end up stranded, luckily, I was in a fairly safe location.

### "assume I can bring a small bag"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Keflavik. Easyjet tickets said I can bring a cabin bag but it didn't mentioned at all whether small bag like handbag or lap top are allowed or not. So this create confusion, I would assume I can bring a small bag. So I hope easyjet would highlight this small bag matter in the tickets itself. It was so embarrassed to stop us from entering the flight due to this and some more in front of everybody.

### "flight was delayed by 1 hour"
Larnaca to Gatwick. Horrible airline. The staff were rude to me, plane was dirty, the flight was delayed by 1 hour. The captain didn’t give  an explanation to why the flight was delayed. Worst airline I’ve  been on.

### "a highly unpleasant flight"
Berlin to Stockholm with easyJet. Rude staff and a highly unpleasant flight. It feels like being treated and pushed around like an animal for slaughter. Please also note that they will charge 60 euro if you have a small bag/purse besides your hand luggage.

### "60 Euros if you have a backpack"
Toulouse to Geneva. Although not explicitly,  charged me 60 Euros if you have a backpack or other small item to go under your seat, even though overhead bag is free. Great revenue raiser. Not charged on one of their flights last year. Avoid if possible

### "Not as good as outward"
Santorini to Manchester. Not as good as outward journey. The crew weren't as friendly as cabin service seemed to take a while. For Santorini Airport the airline do pretty well in terms of keeping schedule.

### "plenty of legroom"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Munich. Check in was really easy and efficient using the self check in machines. The boarding was vary chaotic, we arrived at the gate to find just people everywhere, there were 4 available lanes to scan peoples boarding passes but only one was being used. We then had to queue for 5 minutes before they let us on the plane. The plane itself was nice with plenty of legroom (i'm 6ft3). There was a wide range of food available and the crew was very friendly.

### "really friendly crew"
Manchester to Santorini. Check in was unbelievably quick and friendly - the whole booking and check in was! Nice new plane with really friendly crew. We do this route a lot and this was one of the best. Only negative is that the food on board isn't as good as some inferior airlines.

### "rude and unwilling to help"
Not Verified |  Totally incompetent, rude and unwilling to help after a flight was cancelled! Travelled with 3 Kids and the flight was cancelled really late! At least two hours after it should have taken Off. Staff didn't help out to find another flight or accomodation. Staff actually told me it was my own fault because I agreed to Terms and conditions of easyJet when booking the flight.

### "still the best of the lo-co airlines"
Chaotic boarding at BFS gates 10-14, as three EZY flights were all boarding at the same time. Announcements poor and unintelligible. Had to queue on the apron for a while. Boarding was OK in the end. Flight was good, with an excellent crew. Seats on A319 seem to be more cramped than I remember them to be. Landed at LGW gate 107, but as we were an internal flight, we had to be bussed to gate 55, and then face a lengthy wait for the bags. No real beef with EasyJet, in my opinion still the best of the lo-co airlines.

### "spoilt for most before we had even departed"
Bristol to Amsterdam. During boarding I was not acknowledged by any of the crew in the cabin. Before we took off, as the safety demonstration was beginning, a small number of people were talking to each (one group of 6 men). One of the cabin crew asked the senior crew member to stop the safety brief. He then shouted aggressively to half of the cabin (the area in which I was sat) and basically had a go at us all. He had a very angry look on his face and said we have enough time to talk later. A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive. After takeoff, most of the passengers sat quietly for the duration of the flight to Amsterdam as they felt like they had been “told off”. In future, I think some crew members need to think about the tone they are using towards customers and drop the attitude! At the end of the day it is them who set the tone for the flight for all customers and this flight was basically spoilt for most before we had even departed.

### "thank Wendy and her colleague"
Stansted to Palma. I would like to thank Wendy and her colleague on 4th July flight EZY3213 for her help and support in spotting when I became distressed, helping me to cool down, stopping access to the toilet while she did everything she could to make me comfortable. Thankss, you are a credit to your profession.

### "amateur management"
London to Paris. After 30 hours flight from Sydney. Finally arriving in London. And learning that our connection flight to Paris is delayed by 60 min, then 80 minutes, then no news. And eventually boarding on time without any notification. Almost missed it if we didn't hear French people running all over Gatwick airport. Then we were told that there is no more space for luggage in the cabin. This is amateur management guys and a lot of stress. Yuck.

### "Delay after delay"
Lisbon to Gatwick. If you wish to be treated like a herd of cattle then easyjet is your airline! Delay after delay, little info, long lines,  there is little communication!

### "one of the better low cost airlines"
Berlin Tegel to Edinburgh Sunday late afternoon flight home after a weekend in Berlin. As mentioned in the airport review, check in was excellent due to having HandsFree so able to use priority check in desks. This then allowed me to board at anytime during my leisure after Speedy Boarding, which I took advantage of as boarding looked a slow process. Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I’m 6”1, didn’t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Schönefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T’s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one. That was well above what I expected! Landed 20mins ahead of schedule, as always lovely views coming into Edinburgh, but the time saved was ruined due to airport ground traffic and being bussed to immigration. Not easyJet’s fault. Overall, once again, easyJet is one of the better low cost airlines when flying within Europe, and can easily compete price wise with full service airlines.

### "cancelled and handled very badly"
Liverpool to Dalaman. Flight was cancelled and handled very badly had us waiting hours, staff were very rude when answering our questions and still haven’t given us information about our holiday or next flight. We have travelled very far to get to Liverpool airport and it is a very big inconvenience with no assistance. Massive queues for people who have travelled far so it is going to take a long time for easy jet to sort us all out. Very disappointing. I will never use easyjet again because every time I have used this airline it has been disappointing.

### "Changed seats without telling us"
Gatwick to Olbia. Boarding disorganised / cramped gate condition. Very long walk to gate. Staff in plane very helpful. Gatwick North Terminal IDL - what a messy layout - much worse than ten years ago! Restaurants all positioned together on mezzanine - horrible mix of smells. Poor seating layouts, not enough charging points. Olbia - Gatwick. Confusion at gate over cabin bags. The staff didn’t know how to deal with the problem efficiently. Kept telling people to change to a different desk queue and then back to previous one! Those that paid for priority boarding stood waiting for a long time for the buses whereas (because of the confusion) those of us that didn’t remained seated for longer. Changed our seats without telling us despite paying for specific seats! No reason given. Strange charges for inflight purchases (different to what I actually bought) appeared on credit card receipt - prompted a call from card company re many customers experiencing the same - suggestion of fraudulent charging by EasyJet?

### "the crew was really nice"
Not Verified |  I flew with EasyJet the first time and was positively surprised by this low cost airline. Although we had a delay of one hour the subsequent boarding went smoothly and above all fast. EasyJet boarded in Dusseldorf on the passenger bridge, which is unusual for a low-cost airline. Besides, the crew was really nice. The prices on board for snacks are high, but still to a degree that seems appropriate to me personally.

### "our bags did not make it onto the plane"
Luton to Split with easyJet. After the debacle of checking in the bags that made us have to run for the plane with only minutes to spare. On arriving in Split discovered our bags did not make it onto the plane. So now in 40 degrees of heat with no change of clothes!

### "Typically long delays"
Amsterdam to Split. Horrible. I’ve flown easyJet around 6 times and every time they have an organizational problem. Typically long delays that are only announced until the very last minute. If you care about your time, do not fly with easyJet.

### "left me and my three year old"
Amsterdam to Luton. I checked in early and they left me and my three year old; they left our luggage in the rain and did nothing. They were unable to put me on a next flight. I asked for my bag and it took them 3.5 hours.

### "never be using EasyJet anymore"
Luton to Munich. After my plane being pushed back from 9:10pm to 11pm and finally being able to start the boarding, an Easyjet employee came to me and asked me if I am an EasyJet Plus or Speed Boarding customer to whom I answered that I am not. She then continued and claimed that I had to pay £40 in order to get my cabin luggage into the plane because I was carrying a tiny bag (20cm x 20cm) that I was planning to keep between my legs. I told her that I know that the overhead lockers are limited in terms of space, so I would keep the other bags on my knees or under the passenger seat in order to allow other passengers to put heavier luggage in the lockers. I also explained that I asked multiple times to EasyJet crew about this kind of bags and they were perfectly fine with me taking it in the plane as it is not really a cabin suitcase, so she was the first one to ever ask me to pay for it. She kept saying "Sorry This is the policy, you have to pay £40 for your luggage! not showing any sign of compassion or understanding. I explained that with a plane 1h and 50 minutes behind schedule, there was no way I was going to pay an extra £40 for my 20cmx20cm bag on a ticket that was already not worth it considering the delay. She replied: "You have to pay or I'm going to call security and you are not going to be able to board on your flight". I had to unpack my luggage in front of everyone compressing all the things that were in my briefcase in my cabin luggage, with this employee not helping.In the end, the woman let me through and 5m after I passed the boarding, I unpacked everything and kept my bag between my legs the entire flight not bothering anyone. I have used other low-cost airline companies that did not cause me that much trouble over the years. I will never be using EasyJet anymore.

### "bag allowance is explained"
Ajaccio to Paris CDG. A good flight with EasyJet. The plane was clean and the seats comfortable. The bag allowance is explained on the website and I knew I would have to place the smaller purse containing my sandwich, my passport and my book in my carry-on case before boarding: there is an extra charge for a second carry-on, no matter how small it may be (some people get upset at that but the information is readily available during the booking process. Personally, I find the free carry-on bag allowance pretty generous). The flight was delayed 30 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft, which is still reasonable for any airline these days. I was very happy to find this flight for AJA-CDG on Easyjet. All other airlines from AJA to Paris fly to Orly airport, which is very inconvenient if you connect the next morning out of CDG.

### "Very good flight"
Paris CDG to Budapest. Very good flight. Clean aircraft, on-time departure, comfortable seats. Boarding process was efficient and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Baggage rules are clearly explained on the website. This makes it easy to purchase the required bag allowance in advance. Budapest, the plane parked remotely and the passengers had to walk to the terminal (about 200 meters, under light rain).

### "departure keeps being postponed"
Stranded at Gatwick as our flight from Mallorca is delayed from 10pm to 1.30am, but looks like the departure time keeps on being postponed, while there is no easy jet personal giving information, not even a voucher for a drink, likely to get to Palma in a zombie state 5am instead of midnight, basically a day less of holiday - and nobody around to offer information or support. Impossible to even have a nap a Gatwick terminal north as it is basically an open building site.

### "unfair about baggage"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Bordeaux. Besides getting you where you need to be in one piece and for 20$, this airline may not be worth it. They are rude and unfair about baggage. Boarding took about an hour and a half. A kid vomited across a row of three seats that him and his family were supposed to be in. Instead of removing them from the plane or at least moving them to the rear, this family was moved to row 2 before they even attempted to move me, who was right behind this row. They weren’t even going to move me until my friend asked if there were more seats. The flight attendant tried to move us to the seat next to the vomiting child. The other time I flew this airline, I was told by a rude male attendant to fit my large tote into my suitcase or it’s a 65 Euro fee.

### "absurd charges for an extra bag"
Gatwick to Alicante. Terrible service, absurd charges for carrying an extra tiny bag on the plane, and treated horribly by the staff that was checking the tickets, honestly a complete let down.

### "Would never recommend"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Geneva. Flight canceled and mediocre accommodation offered over 40 minutes away from the airport (by cab, which you had to pay yourself). Very poor customer service. Would never recommend this airline.

### "airline found an easy way to make money"
EasyJet is not easy: don’t fly, bad service by airlines representative, late departure, £50 extra charge for laptop, iPad, jackets, personal purse - need bag or throw away or pay £50 for each extra items. 6/15/2019, EZY8327 LGW Gatwick to CDG Paris - Flight at 2.10, gate closing at 1.40, no gate announcement until 1.35. Flight arrived late, late announcement of gate at 1.35 but boarding same kept same 1.40, announced that gate closing, gave 5 minutes to come a long distance to gate 112, arrived gate at 1.50, boarding wasn’t started and plane just arrived. - Representative checked boarding pass and said £50 extra charge for each item that is not in the carry-on including laptop, iPad, jackets, personal purse, vanity, medications. Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying £50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, "the board is not applicable to my ticket". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn’t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged £50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, "nothing she could do". Now I’ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris. I was in my seat at 2.25 pm, flight left the gate at 2.45 pm, take off at 3.10 pm (instead of 2.10 pm). Landed in Paris at 5.10 pm (instead of 4.10 pm). Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost. I’m sure there is no penalty to EastJet for delays because we all sign fine print agreement upfront that says "airlines are never wrong and they will pay nothing for customer inconvenience". Airlines inside were okay, food offered at reasonable cost, water was available at cost. Of course no Entertainment. It was cold and no blankets or pillows were provided. Thank goodness I took out my jacket from the checked in bag. No announcement to apologize for delay in departure or arrival to Paris. I may have saved £50 when I booked my tickets but ended up paying that back to EasyJet, airline found an easy way to make money. Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet? I’m not sure if my review will make any change in EasyJet’s behavior towards their customers. Don’t they know flight will depart late, boarding will be late because it arrived late? If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run? I’m sure many customers felt the stress and pain due to EasyJet’s unprofessional behavior and bad communications with customers. Considering my experience, I’m not going to fly again with EasyJet. There were other customers at the gate explaining similar issues, I’m sure they wouldn’t fly and give bad reviews. All my friends will stay away from EasyJet. Frankly, I’ll be very surprising surprised to see EasyJet’s existence in next - 4-5 years unless something changed I their behavior.

### "experience makes Wizz Air seem premium"
I book travel for groups for a living and fly several times a week so I know what to expect. For me to bother wasting more time to write this review tells you how bad it must have been. Yet again an easyJet flight home from a lovely trip back from Ibiza is destroyed by the disgusting gestapo they have working as ground staff preying on their customers trying to get home. This group on Wed 12th June quite literally prowled up and down the line, totally ignoring the people themselves who they simply dismissed if they asked what was going on and why they weren't allowed to take the luggage allowance specified on their ticket onto the plane, just pointing at bags they could try and force the passengers to pay extra for and dragging them to the front of the queue to put their bags in the size checker then engaging in screaming matches with people who refused to be bullied and threatening not to let them on the flights if they didn't leave the line and go to the back! Easyjet have a mafia of these people who all clearly hate the job and the people flying with their airline and the whole experience makes Wizz Air seem premium. Pay slightly more and fly BA, or anybody else quite frankly!

### "our personal items were too big"
I had flown with Easy Jet seven years ago, and at the time, we got a low fare, but then there were many additional charges that were added. That was fine, as they were honest about it from the word go, and I knew what to expect. In booking with them for a flight to Sofia from Gatwick, I looked on line, and was pleased to see that they now included one cabin bag and personal item in the cost of their tickets, so I booked with them. I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their "Easy travellers" group, it was the same as always, and we were "fined" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport. If someone makes you pay an additional 100 pounds to board a flight you have already paid for, there is no name for it other than theft, fraud or extortion. At EasyJet, it is called business as usual. Never again!

### "Flight  punctual and uneventful"
Berlin Tegel to Athens. Downloaded the app and attempted to check in approximately 5 hours prior to departure. Although I attempted several times, I was not able to do that and I kept getting the response that I need to go to the counter in order to check in. I went to the airport with some stress more than 2 hours prior to departure and after waiting a bit of waiting, I was told that the flight was overbooked, I got a boarding pass without a seat number and was asked to proceed to the gate. I would enter the flight if there was a no show from another passenger. I had hand luggage only and was pretty stressed. I was waiting on the gate and I informed the gate agents. They told me I'd have to wait until embarkation. Just 10' prior to departure I received an e-boarding pass on the app, with a confirmed seat (3B) and so I made it to the flight. Flight itself was punctual and uneventful.

### "Last time I fly Easyjet"
Geneva to Venice. Last time I fly with Easyjet. In the last 16 months I've traveled several times on the same route, and every single time the evening flight was late. It's useless to have cheap solutions if the price to pay is arriving every time 20 mins to 2 hours late. Next time I'll pay very gladly some extra €80 to fly with a more serious and punctual company.

### "we missed our flight"
We were supposed to fly on Monday 20 May from Luton to Amsterdam at 8am. The flight was delayed to 9.40am. When they announced the gate at 8.55am we went to the gate indicated, gate 21. There was a long queue and we were at the end of it. By the time someone from the airline came to us to let us know that the gate for our flight was at gate 27, it was too late and we missed our flight. We got told to go to gate 6 to talk to someone from the airline. There isn't anybody gate 6, only a phone that nobody answers with a voicemail full. Eventually after about 10 calls or so we managed to talk to someone who said we would need to pay £99 per person to change the flight, either at 6-ish pm from Luton or 2.20pm from Gatwick. In the meantime someone from the airport came to "escort us" and take us to talk to someone from the airline. Once we passed security and were in the baggage claim area they actually disappeared. We  managed to find the Customer Service Desk to have someone tell us the same thing i.e. £99 pp to change the flight. Online the price was less so we booked online for the 2.20pm from Gatwick for £175.86 and had to pay another £62 (£31 each) to transfer to Gatwick for a grand total of £237.86.

### "only one that was charged"
Athens to Gatwick. They tagged several travelers for having a carry on and a purse but out of 6 or 7 people I was the only one that was charged. On top of that they wrote down my credit card number and expiration date instead of processing it electronically. Service agents were rude to me. Just because your cheap doesn't entitle you to be rude and disrespectful.

### "first and last time with easyjet"
Madrid to Lyon. Our flight was cancelled because reasons that was not fault of the company, however the way the personal of Easyjet managed the situation was so bad. They made us wait 30 minutes online, then 45 minutes more, then board the plane, one hour more, to finally go out the plane, flight cancelled till next day. 2 more hours waiting online in customer service to get a hotel to rest that night like the personal promised us... false. Then they said, get your hotel and easyjet will refund. It was 1 am. A lot of people like me, we could not get a hotel at that moment, so we spent the night in the airport. Then, the personal of Easy jet promise us that we will receive a compensation for this problem, if we write a claim. I did, Easyjet said they can not give money for this situation. I can understand that sometimes Easyjet can have unpredictable situations, the problem here was the way the personal managed the situation. It was like they played with us and with our time. Wait here, now here, wait there...you will get a rest...false. Definitely my first and my last time with easyjet.

### "Service was good"
Santorini to Gatwick. Flight departed within a few minutes of scheduled time. Plane was a very new A321. Seat was Ok but it would have been nice to have some better support on head rest to support head if trying to sleep. Flight had some spares seats so my backpack could go in the overhead locker rather than under the seat in front. Cabin crew seemed cheerful. Service was good, shared some wine and snacks, which were priced ok. Flight landed 5 minutes late at Gatwick but we were delayed due to no gate being available, which is always frustrating. Luggage arrived quite quickly by Gatwick standards. All In all a good job by EasyJet.

### "You get what you get"
Gatwick to Santorini. Boarding was a bit chaotic. The boarding gate was announced and all of the passengers had passed through to the boarding area waiting to board, then they announced a gate change and we all had to cross to the other end of the airport to a new gate. There was then a further wait until we boarded. This was explained as due to a change of aircraft, which we had been advised of by email the day before! Once on board we had a further delay and finally departed about 90 mins late. flight time was less than scheduled and we landed at Santorini about one hour late. I am 6ft tall and found the leg room very tight particularly as my small cabin bag had to go under the seat in front. Seat itself was reasonably comfortable. Service on board we ok, although the cabin crew did not seem as cheerful as they usually are on EasyJet. Food and drink selection is ok and not overpriced considering the captive market. You get what you get with Easyjet and it offers better value than BA on the same route.

### "delivered top class service"
Not Verified |  Just got home from a great flight with easyjet flight, EZY6446 from Faro to Newcastle. I'm a nervous flyer and to top it off there was screaming kids on the flight. The crew, although from what we heard had a rough trip to Faro before we boarded but despite this delivered top class service and geordie humour to lighten the mood. The lead air steward was fab and so funny it naturally put my nerves at ease, mostly because we were too busy laughing at him. You could really see why he was a lead and kept the morale of his team up! Look forward to flying with easyjet again!

### "Two outstanding crew members"
Not Verified |  Agadir to Gatwick. I have traveled with easyjet on many occasions but I have to say that this trip while traveling with two very nervous passengers and myself although a seasoned traveler still very nervous we were looked after by all the crew. Two outstanding crew members who chatted with us and put us at ease, we can't thank them enough for 1. The hard work they do 2. Keeping us safe on our journey 3. First Class people skills. Many thanks to all the crew.

### "extra £40 for checkin bag"
I booked and paid for extra leg room seats and easy boarding. I then added $7 to her hands free. I arrived at Stansted this morning and the Manager rudely told me that I’d have to pay an extra £40 for the checkin bag. I said I had paid for hands free and she said she didn’t care as I was taking a bag on the flight so I wasn’t eligible for it. She was rude and unhelpful and despite paying the £40, refused to refund the £7 I had already paid.

### "they didn’t let me board"
Milan to Naples. I paid for extra luggage and when I checked in they mentioned my backpack and when I’m about to board they asking me to pay 60euro. I refused to pay and they didn’t let me board. I bought this ticket just because the timing with my other flight.

### "Good flight with Easyjet"
A good flight with Easyjet. A hassle-free experience from London Southend to Prague. Early flight. Boarding was organized and quick. The plane was clean. Friendly staff and the toilet was well maintained.

### "Well done again easyJet"
My review starts before boarding when an easyJet cabin crew assisted me to locate two iPads that we had left at the security check in. His help was certainly above his call of duty and he assisted also in getting us to the boarding area in time. Thank you Matthew. We often fly with easyjet and have nothing but praise for them on every occasion. They always perform their intended function without fault, which is to provide a no nonsense journey to many European destinations. Well done again easyJet.

### "Awful experience"
Edinburgh to Paris. Awful experience with unprofessional staff at the airport. They never say hello, they are always late. The problem with easyjet is the way they treat customers, without any consideration - don’t expect to be on time with this company since they are never a priority in most big aiports - good food and beverage menus.

### "days of extra legroom are over"
Copenhagen to Lyon with easyJet. Paid extra for early boarding and exit seats for legroom. That is a joke. The days of extra legroom are over. It's still squashed (I'm 6'4") and you can't recline. Don't waste your money. Check in was ridiculous with inept staff who were borderline rude. On the plus, the cabin staff were nice and friendly although why they can't accept cash for beverages is a mystery. Didn't affect us as we had already eaten, but they had no sandwiches/panini on board for two of our flights which is very poor.

### "will never take easyJet again"
Not Verified | Berlin to Toulouse. Firstly, the plane was already delayed. Secondly, one of the ground staff made me pay the 60 euro fee for my backpack. I have been bringing this backpack into the cabin for all my flights in Europe with budget airlines' A320 with no problem, and it always fit because (1) its a soft cover (2) I never fully packed it, so even though it exceeded the length and width requirement slightly, it was well below the height requirement. Other airline staff have always just taken a look and asked that I pack the contents a little tight so it can fit in the overhead bin, but not easyjet. Never mind that I explained that, this ground staff gave the excuse that the flight was leaving soon because of the delay and I had better pay the fee or I might miss the flight. This is a just a malicious ploy to make extra money off their customers and I will never take easyJet ever again.

### easyJet customer review
Alicante to Manchester with easyJet. I am 30 weeks pregnant and unfortunately felt poorly on the flight home. Whilst in the air I had vomited, there was a lovely man who brought me some water, turned on the air con and brought me a bag. He also said if I was still too hot I could go and sit by the crew at the front where it’s cooler. He then continued to check I was ok throughout the flight, he was a lovely person and I appreciated how he was!

### "experience was fantastic"
Not Verified |  My experience of travelling with them was fantastic. My 25 year old daughter has a severe fear of flying (despite having flown all over the world a few years ago) and I cannot thank the crew-and captain enough for what they did to allay her fears. They were exceptional in their treatment of her. They took her fears seriously and she even had the opportunity to speak to the captain on the homeward flight. They are responsible for helping my daughter go a long way to overcoming her anxieties which means so much to her. They also took her peanut allergy very seriously and announced over the tannoy that they would not be selling peanuts and asked that any passenger having a packet of peanuts not to open them. I flew to Jamaica with Delta Airlines in January and advised them that I am a nervous flyer (not phobic like my daughter) but at not one point did they do anything to alleviate my anxieties. People expect a lot when flying-and I get that-but the personal touch was incredible on these flights-including the ground crew. I just want to thank them for what they did and how their treatment of my daughter has helped her to overcome her fear of flying. As the captain said on both flights, turbulence is a matter of comfort and not safety. Such few words that she will remember for the rest of her life. Thanks, guys!

### "Never ever again"
Lisbon to Luton. My daughter and I spent around £550 on return flights to Lisbon including extra legroom seats. However, we weren’t aware that on the return journey this would mean we were part of the lazy crew’s party near the front of the plane. This activity all seemed to centre on friends they also had on the plane - and I know from a friend of my daughter that Easyjet staff can add anyone as family so we suspect high fares such as ours subsidise flights of any random person the crew might know. There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren’t). The crew later deny this but asking requires eye contact and a response. You’d think they’d want to sell their pricey refreshments but this crew were only eager to socialise with mates. They were banging against the barrier between us and them throughout the flight, carrying on so loudly we couldn’t hear through our headphones. People trying to get to the loo had to wait down the aisle. Complete joke. At the end of the flight the cabin manager made a jokey PA announcement thanking the crew for their hard work. He was laughing about it. You couldn’t make this stuff up. I laughed as well for different reasons - another crew member and the off-duty staff member sitting across our row immediately begin to challenge me so I told them the truth - no service and loud noise meant for a rotten flight. Well these guys didn’t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting. On other airlines if a passenger did that they’d call the cops. The cabin manager told him to stop (in a far more polite way than he was speaking to us) and this off-duty guy loudly retorts that as he is a passenger he’ll do what he wants. I told him I wasn’t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she’s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren’t helping. Pilot just said “Sorry for the inconvenience.” To quote the crew member when I told him I had video of their ‘party’ - “whatever”. Who trains these people? No one would be my guess. The off-duty guy laughed and carried on in the bus in front of us with his friends on the way back to the terminal - completely unaffected by his actions. The only crew working or showing their customers any respect was the female crew member. Never ever again. Terminal 2 in Lisbon is horrendous, Luton is also awful - nothing has moved on with this budget airline except for price.

### "I know the baggage rules"
Gatwick to Toulouse. Bussed out to remote stand because aircraft had previously been under maintenance. Priority passengers first off bus and into cabin. Full flight but cabin staff managed to deal with all cabin luggage although a few priority passengers grumbled because they could not stow their luggage immediately over their seats. Flight smooth and cabin crew very engaging. Flight departed a few minutes late but arrived right on time. No queue at Border Control so very quick completion of arrival formalities. While writing this, I have to say that I have travelled with easyJet many times and have never encountered any of the problems that other contributors allude to. However, I always travel Priority which makes life easy. Cabin crews have always been obliging but I do ensure that I know the baggage rules and never get caught out.

### "baggage restrictions"
Amsterdam to Berlin. Easyjet is awful. My biggest piece of advice is to book any other airline but this one. Literally any other one is better. They make you think you are paying for a cheap flight but then add on for their baggage restrictions so you end up having to pay far more.

### "Treated like cattle"
Bordeaux Billi to Luton with easyJet. Billi terminal at Bordeaux is very poor. Crowded, over-priced and lacking in facilties for seating and toilets. Passport control is chaotic - long queues. My small case was not allowed into cabin without explanation. Treated like cattle.

### "the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Venice to Paris. This was the worst experience I have had with an airline. We booked our flight two and a half months ahead of time, and when I went to check-in for my flight, the website had said I had to visit the desk when I arrived at the airport. Thinking there was no issue, I arrived at the airport for EasyJet to tell me that I did not have a seat on the plane. Her exact words were, "You paid for the flight, not for a seat. Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and "speedy boarding," but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport. We also had to go through security again after visiting the counter where they rescheduled our flight. That was fun.

### "unhappy with service in Schiphol"
Our flight to Amsterdam was perfect. We were able to put a cabin bag on and a small back pack with no issues. On our return home we were made to combine our small back packs (which were fine on the way there) in to our cabin bags. The crew in the airport could not give reason as to why we weren’t allowed the same as the way there - their only reply was “well you were lucky on the way here then” in a very sly and sarcastic tone. They wanted to charge us €60 per case to go in the hold. I felt humiliated and embarrassed, having to pull out personal items such as underwear etc in front of over 100 individuals who were getting on to the flight. There was no privacy provided to try and rearrange the bags. After re-arranging the bags, and managing to get everything in to the one bag, the crew in the airport then called to say that cabin bags could be put in the hold for free  as the flight was busy and they would need any space possible. They do this after watching us struggle to put our items all in to one small cabin case. Why could they not have just let us wait till the end, and asked us to put our cases in the hold? This would not have been an issue in the slightest. Disappointed, humiliated and extremely unhappy with the service provided by the team in Schiphol Airport today.

### "miserable at best"
Verona to Gatwick. Won't allow a handbag and mini suitcase, many people trying to squeeze their things into an already full suitcase - which now makes it over their limit anyway so what's the point? The staff are miserable at best. You wait 20 minutes before the bus leaves to drive you 30 seconds to the aircraft and then a further 5 minutes trapped like sardines whilst they try and work out what they're doing. Harass you on the flight with various lotto, food and other items they wish to sell.

### "book with a different airline"
Naples to Venice. We booked this flight well in advance. I have never flown with easyJet and it was my first time traveling to and within Europe. Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a "strike". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight. Thank you easyJet for this experience. Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache. My mistake was not doing the research with this airline. I was told by others that last minute flight cancelation happens frequently with easyJet. After an awesome weekend on the Amalfi coast this airline experience really felt like a kick in the gut nearly made me just want to go home and end my vacation early.

### "the service was very poor"
Luton to Amsterdam. After arriving in Amsterdam, we did not receive our luggage back. A report was made but we received no update at all until we called them. We luckily got our suitcase back after around 40 hours which we were grateful for. We do understand that these things happen, but the service was very poor throughout this. On our return in Amsterdam, the lady at the check in desk was probably one of the rudest people I have ever spoken to and it seemed like she went out of her way to make our journey harder. We were seeking advise for our case allowance as we had to buy more clothes due to us not receiving our luggage, and we were told completely different things by two EasyJet colleagues. One told us that we could pay for the hand luggage and combine the weight (costing 7€) but the lady on the desk told us we would have to pay 45€. We questioned this and they allowed us to put through the 7€ option once it was confirmed that we could do this. Even though my partner and I managed to thoroughly enjoy our trip to Amsterdam, EasyJet participated in making it one of the most stressful holidays I have been on.

### "go somewhere else "
Flights to and from Amsterdam from Gatwick booked weeks ahead and both journeys checked in before we left the UK. Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'. Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight. A lot more than the cost of one or two spare crew on standby. I learn today that Amsterdam is an EasyJet hub airport. But it doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is bums on seats. Don't pay, go somewhere else - change

### "cabin service was slick"
Having flown with EasyJet before we were aware of the pit falls with flying with LCCs. The outbound flight from Luton to Pisa, left on time and the boarding was slick, and professional, despite only having one set of steps in operation. Paying the small extra fee for speedy boarding meant we were able to take our carry on bags on board as the flight was full. Cabin crew operated a full trolley service just after we took off and an extra drinks service before landing. There were regular updates from the cockpit during the flight and a warning that it was going to be a 'tad' bumpy just after take off and we need not worry as the aircraft was going hit cold air has it climbed to its cruising height. Due to a tail wind we arrived in Pisa 90 minutes ahead of scheduled. The return flight into Gatwick was of a high standard and the cabin crew seemed very professional and exceeded customer expectations. Again the cabin service was slick and polished. Easy jet have now followed other airlines and allow you to pre order a meal (Hot or Cold) prior to booking and you are served prior to the main service, this is a good idea and worth every penny of the cost.

### "not able to do online check in"
Not Verified |  Milan to Berlin. I used the company many times and I never had any problem with EasyJet. I was coming back from Bangkok, after a 12 hours flight, after a 2 weeks holiday in Southeast Asia. Landed in Milano Malpensa, still 6 hours to my flight to Berlin, when I realize I was not able to do the online check in from my app, for me and my girlfriend. We tried 2 smartphones, and iPhone and a Samsung S8. No one worked. We reached the EasyJet desk as anxious about the issue. The employee at the desk advised us that the flight was "overbooked", and we were the first 2 passengers in overbooking. We booked and paid the tickets in November, and few hours before I got this brilliant news, and after that, the person at the desk said: I wish you luck. You might be able to board this flight. I used to work for an airline and I know how the system works with EasyJet, so I know that every flight has a no show percentage, but I do not expect to need to have luck to board a flight with a normal ticket, purchased more than 4 months ago. I had two options ahead of me: 1 wait till the end of the boarding even if I had a ticket already - 2 in case there was no seats available, getting a hotel room and wait time to be refunded, and leave the morning next. Both solutions were for me ridicolous as we are talking about tickets that I purchased more than 4 months before, considering the fact that I needed those tickets to get back home in Berlin. As I expected there were around 15-20 empty seats on board, but still I had to wait till the end of the boarding, so in the end I board the flight but still, this is unacceptable.

### "some of the best cabin crew"
Berlin to London. Having read the reviews about EasyJet in recent times and not having flown with them for many years I was a little apprehensive of the service and flight I was about to receive, however I can’t speak more highly of this airline. In the three flights I took over the last few days I witnes some of the best cabin crew, and excellent examples of great customer service. My last flight I was asked politely if I could move seats as I customer had booked to fly with a large musical instrument, the crew found me a seat at the front of the aircraft. I’ve had a similar experience on BA and I have to say they were rude and told me I had to move and put me in a seat at the back of the plane! I’ve flown with many airlines around the world and even the best get it wrong sometimes, but I just felt that I was in safe hands with easyJet, they have a professional attitude and seem to be a willing to accommodate in a low cost world. They are a low cost airline and I’m sure passengers should remember that when they have 5* demands however that should never excuse poor customer service and unprofessional behaviour, on the flights I’ve received this year so far I’m happy report this was far from the case onboard easyJet. I for one will highly recommend them.

### "bags are oversized"
Edinburgh to Luton. EasyJet is incredibly manipulative and makes money is by pulling people out of the queue and arguing that their bags are oversized. They subsequently charge you £50.

### "Great airline to fly with"
Newcastle to Bristol. Have used easyjet on several occasions and always found them to be very helpful. Although on this occasion there was an hours delay to the flight there was plenty of information and apologies from ground crew and cabin crew/pilot. Staff are friendly and helpful and food and drink is reasonably priced. Staff are well trained to deal with nervous passengers too. Great airline to fly with.

### "Poor service and very poor"
Bristol to Funchal return. Delayed flight EZY6346 from Funchal - Bristol Passengers asked to go to the gate at 11.20am very few seats available. Speedy Boarding section indicated for SB passengers to line up. Kept waiting, standing, until 12.05pm when Speedy Boarding passengers asked to load into bus. The bus then loads all the other passengers meaning SB passengers are now the last passengers to get off the bus and hence the last on that first bus to load onto the aircraft. We choose SB so we do not have to wait so long to board. This time not only did the bus not let passengers off immediately but we then queued behind all the other passengers to get aboard the aircraft, get to our seats and then find space for our hand luggage. Easyjets response was as expected, we don't refund. I was told SB was "A Benefit" funny that I thought when we paid a lot of money for a decent seat we were also paying for Speedy Boarding. The plane left 1 hour late, The plane was dirty, crumbs on the seats and paper on the toilet floor. The snacks expensive and the Chicken Chilli wrap freezing cold with the wrap soggy when it thawed out. Poor service and very poor, couldn't careless response by Customer Service.

### "obstructive and obnoxious"
London to Berlin. Flight wasn't displayed on the board closest to us for some reason meaning that we arrived as the gate closed. Staff went out of their way to be obstructive and obnoxious. We could have boarded the plane as we only had hand luggage but, even though there was still half an hour before the flight was due to depart, they wouldn't allow it. They want to force you to buy another ticket for another flight (there were none). Net result is that we didn't fly! I have never used this airline before and will never try again. I wouldn't advise anyone to risk it, it may seem cheap but it is for a reason!

### "Half the flight had to pay extra fees"
London Gatwick to Athens. Absolutely ridiculous - watch out for all those hidden baggage fees. They ran out of space for luggage and for people. I had to check my bag which I have flown with before and has been damaged on easyJet flights before. I was charged an extra £50 for this by the pushiest staff member who just seemed like they wanted to take my money and run. Half the flight had to pay extra fees, the staff were getting into arguments with paying, flying customers, everything was an absolute horrendous mess.

### "polite, efficient and friendly"
This is a fabulous airline! The flight departed on time, the captain on the way there (13 March 2019, 2:45pm) kept us well informed, told us the aircraft type and where we were flying over; which I find interesting. The announcements were also in Spanish (with the most pleasant voice) and the staff were really polite, efficient and friendly. I paid for a tea and it was nice, big and hot. Easyjet accepted cash, which really convenient (receipt given) and the food is excellent value. The only suggestion I have is that on the way back to Luton the plane needed a more thorough clean and the tap in the toilet had a small drip that needed fixing right away. My compliments to easyjet!

### "never heard about regulation"
On January 23rd 2019. as I was queuing up for check-in at Paris airport for a flight to Ben-Gurion airport, I was imperiously asked by one of the security agents hired by easyJet to administer the proof that I would leave Israel within the following 3 months, which is the limit for a tourist visa. The agent refused to have me check in without such a proof. She argued that this regulation had been put in place years ago and started yelling as I was insisting. I traveled to Israel more than 30 times and never heard about such a regulation. I asked to be shown this regulation in a written form. No one could at Paris airport. Still, I was forced to book a flight online as I was about to miss my plane.I ended up booking a bad ticket money- and travel-wise as I was so much rushing to be able to board my flight. After arriving at Ben Gurion, I asked around about this regulation.No member of the Israeli staff had heard about it. I sent a request for clarification at easyJet customer service. The request was sent on Jan.30th. I was told that a proper answer would come within 27 days. It came almost two months later with the following content: "Regulations vary depending on which country you fly to and from therefore I will not be able to provide you with the suitable information regarding travel documents, I can advise that you call your local Embassy or Consulate in this regard". What sense of responsibility does this company have when it comes to the policies that it decides to put in place out of its own initiative? How does it answer for an aggressive staff that does not care about throwing customers in a state of panic and whether they miss their flight or not?

### "polite and friendly"
Luton to Venice via Paris. Very convenient mobile check in and boarding pass. Convenient baggage drop and boarding in the airport. Ground staff and flight attendants are polite and friendly. Most importantly the flights arrived early to the destination. Comfortable for the price I have paid for.

### "absolutely not worth the lower price"
It is absolutely not worth the lower price. If you really enjoy being treated like a number - and only just a number - then please feel free to fly with them. After an hour delay, an employee comes on the queue and says: sir you have to fit your small backpack into your luggage otherwise we won’t let you on board. After asking him if there is no compromise due to the delay he said: “sir, I don’t have to apologize to you, I am just doing my job and these are the rules”. Never ever will I fly with easyJet again!

### "And wrong it went"
Amsterdam to Venice. You get to know an airline when things go wrong. And wrong it went. Our flight to Venice was okay. Half an hour delay due to the whether, but whisked to Venice with a strong tail wind. Friendly staff, bad legroom but it's low-cost. The way back was a different story. Our flight was cancelled in the last minute because of bad wheater in Amsterdam. It was bad, but why didn't KLM cancel its flight on the same route? Apart from that easyJet managed the situation very well. Off course there was a queue, but within 30 mins I got a message that we had a reservation in a 4 sta rhotel for the night, including transport, diner and breakfast. Since all easyJet flights were full, we chose to fly to Düsseldorf the next day on Eurowings. I asked for a refund and the next morning it was credited to my card. So the downside is that easyJet doesn't transfer you to a different airline, but they managed this situation extremely professional. Hence still a recommodation, also thanks to previous good experiences with this airline.

### " could not take the cabin bag onboard"
Gatwick to Luxembourg. They did not allow me to carry my handbag together with the cabin bag. They requested to put the hand bag in the cabin bag and otherwise I had to pay 50 pounds extra! After this, they told me that I could not take the cabin bag onboard and that had to go together with the checked bags because they did not have space! Really do you expect to make money with sneaking practices? Also the flight was delayed by one hour and I missed a meeting in the destination.

### "I’d rather stand"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. Saw an easyJet employee try to hassle a customer into paying more for his carry on suitcase. It was a centimeter too big. It also was his return flight and he was using the same suitcase he came with. When he asked to speak to a supervisor they threatened that he would miss his flight. Also, terrible leg room. I’m quite tall but most airlines are ok for me. On this flight however I’d rather stand.

### "extra cost was well worth it"
Barcelona to Newcastle. So I reviewed Easyjet a couple of months ago, didn't really enjoy the experience. I learned my lesson, pay for a nice seat. I paid an extra £25 for one of the seats in Row 1. This fee also included "speedy boarding" which made is less likely that I would be separated from my cabin bag upon boarding. The extra cost was well worth it. I was able to enjoy what is good about Easyjet whilst not being sardined into one of the seats at the rear of the aircraft. Easyjets model is a good one, no frills for those who don't need/want them and some frills for people like me that value a little upgrade in comfort. Good range of snacks on board (to purchase at not absurd prices). Cabin well presented, good crew, much better Easyjet, I will always now pay for the front seat!

### "Avoid this airline"
Copenhagen to Paris. Avoid this airline at all costs. They randomly block some people checking-in and have pathetic copenhagen airport staff. I had booked an Easyjet flight on 27th Feb, Copenhagen-Paris, time: 20:25. While checking-in, i was first told that i had arrived early so I needed to wait to check-in. Exactly one and half hours before the boarding time, i was told i won't be able to fly because the flight is overbooked. Then, as i asked for compensation to pay for the overnight stay, they said that the compensation is not given immediately but in some weeks. I can understand that the flight was overbooked. But, what i fail to understand is the airlines responsibility. How can they randomly pick up few passengers, block their rights to check-in, and don't even bother to pay compensation immediately. Everything about Easyjet was like a nightmare. Uneducated and extremely arrogant easyjet Copenhagen airport staff. For instance, informing the passenger in advance, if not, then paying the compensation immediately. Why should a passenger suffer because of their mistakes.

### "hand luggage to be added to hold"
Copenhagen to Denmark. Overbooked, delayed, and forced passengers to hand in hand luggage to be added to hold. Instead of arriving with enough time for public transport, the delay took us past findings reasonable transportation home. Cabin team have no consideration.

### "Excellent service"
Not Verified |  Flew EasyJet to Nice from LGW and return. Excellent service on short flight, flight deck and cabin crew were very informative. Cabin service swift and well served by courteous staff. Prices quite reasonable compared to some other airlines. No delays on either flight. Very good service, well done to all!

### "no way helpful"
Belfast to Manchester. I would advise anyone planning to fly with easyJet to reconsider immediately! This airline is in no way helpful. After arriving to the airport early and on time for our departing flight easyJet closed their gates 25minutes before departure! There was no announcement for passengers to make their way to the gate and no effort was made to call out passenger names. We were informed, while looking at the plane that still has the stairs attached that there was no way we could board. The staff blamed the fact that they had no radios to contact each other. What professional airline do not have the simple means of communication! Staff were very unhelpful and placed the claim immediately on us the passangers. We were not alone with four other passangers in the same predicament. No effort was made at an apology and staff seemed very indifferent. This experience has left me enraged and with no other alternative we had to book another departing flight with easyJet at full price! I will never fly with this airline again and I would advise anyone thinking about flying with them not to!

### " this EasyJet flight was the worst"
I booked my holiday through EasyJet holidays. Service from Manchester to Agadir was excellent and i did wonder why EasyJet had thousands of bad reviews. Staff onboard the flight were really helpful. The transfer from airport to hotel was perfect and the hotel itself was amazing. The nightmare started when we boarded the return flight from Agadir (EZY1906) at 8:20pm. The pressure of serving customers food must have got to the manager of the onboard team. Customers were being ignored when they asked for assistance, one passenger asked for sugar and the staff member responded “I’ve only got two hands”. One customer asked for tissue three times. I witnessed another incident where a large female woman walked past and both staff members grinned at each other whilst looking at her in disgrace. The members of staff were blind to the fact that they were doing this infront of passengers. One passenger looked at me and said this is what you expect from a budget airline. I disagreed. No passenger should be treated like this. I have travelled may countries around the World, but must say that this particular EasyJet flight was the worst. A great holiday ruined on return. I personally think EasyJet could become a great airline if the right staff training is provided. As mentioned above, the staff on departure were excellent. Service on arrival from Agadir to Manchester was a disaster.

### "forced me to check carry-on"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to Gatwick. My flight experience with easyJet was the most frustrating experience of my life. The people were not friendly both on and off the aircraft. They forced me to check my carry-on size bag for 60 euros, and the flight departed over an hour late. I would not recommend this airline to anyone, no matter how cheap it is. Save your money, and don’t ever fly easyJet.

### "rarely easy or pleasant"
I travel on a regular basis from Paris to Berlin and vice versa (once per month). The easyJet experience is rarely easy or pleasant. Normally there's at least a delay of 45 minutes. However, this time was even worse. After a delay of 2.5h, the cabin crew announced that we land in Paris Charles de Gaulle instead of Paris Orly. Since it was already after midnight it was nearly impossible to find a mode of transport back to Paris. With sheer luck, and a combination of night bus and cab I finally managed to arrive at my place at 2:30 am instead of 11 pm. What is angering me the most is that easyJet just drops you off at the airport and disappears even though it was clearly there fault. No excuse, nothing. Never again. I would strongly recommend taking any other airline even if costs a couple of euros more. In the end, the money is better invested elsewhere.

### "the standard easyJet experience"
This flight was the standard Easyjet experience. Things started with a 45 minutes delay leaving, which is routine but not excusable, on their flights later in the day. The latest seats are now so thinly padded and packed in that people can’t help poking each other’s arms or kneeing each other’s backs and sitting down for a flight of a few hours is altogether very uncomfortable. The cabin was clean. The crew were fairly pleasant, seemed safety conscious, were all young and did their tasks efficiently. The quality and price ratio in the range of on board drinks and snacks is significantly better than the competition but the substantive fresh food is dull, often understocked on returns and of low quality. I wouldn’t ever pay for any speedy boarding - but those that did have such privileges for one reason or another didn’t get any benefit from it in Cyprus. Instead, the queue surged forward for us to spend the traditional half an hour queuing on a jetway staircase before walking over the runway to the plane. Boarding on the plane was chaotic, involved arguments between crew and passengers about locker space, and caused delay. During the journey, some of the total delay was announced as ‘made up’ but much of this is down to the customary padded schedule. The price was excellent and the plane was full in February. The remaining (all British) competition on this route are usually no better and with Easyjet the product always seems consistent.

### "They lost my suitcase"
Not Verified |  Venice to Paris. They lost my suitcase. We checked in early and the airport was very quiet and they manage to lose our luggage. Their customer device is appalling, when you phone them they will try to push you to call someone else, shifting the responsibility to say it’s the airport fault or it’s the courier fault. Very slow, inefficient and disorganised. They lost my bag after the 1st week of my 2 week holiday. So for the remainder of my holiday in the cold of Europe winter, I had to survive with none of my belongings. They give you 25 pounds a day to buy “essentials” to help compensate but when you lose your whole luggage it is not enough.

### "the best of the no frills airlines"
BRS-FNC-BRS. Returned to easyjet after several flights with Vueling. It's like visiting an old friend. The flights were slightly delayed but not significantly. The difference between easyjet and Vueling is startling. Easyjet is far better in all aspects. Cabin staff are much more friendly and the seats are 100% more comfortable. The only reason I didn't give a 10/10 is the shambles at check-in at FNC. With three flights departing in short order there were only three desks open to check-in up to 500 passengers. The queues were out of the terminal door and it took us 45 minutes to check-in. I think easyjet is by far the best of the no frills airlines.

### "happy with the cabin crew"
Luton to Barcelona. I am so happy with the cabin crew specially when they handed the card which is need to be filled in passport control desk. This could help to save time in passenger's arrival because it's already filled in the plane. I wish other airlines would follow this useful idea and add to their services.

### "service was excellent"
Nice little route between Stockholm and Bristol. We used it as we had relatives in the West Country and there is a good taxi service (and Bus) to Bristol Station. Flight was slightly delayed (25 mins) in leaving but managed to land on time. Check in staff were excellent and late us take thee priority boarding queue as we voluntarily put baggage in the hold (we had paid for one bag anyway so it was no extra time). On board service was excellent and they don't price gouge on food and beverages. easyJet use T2 at Arlanda which tend to be short of immigration staff

### "Very impressed by the service"
Not Verified |  London to Edinburgh. Small delay of 90 minutes due to late aircraft arrival. Not a big deal. However the ground staff at the gate had everyone hearded like sheep, no aircraft and both of them on their phones checking their social media accounts. Not acceptable. However on board the cabin crew were excellent. Friendly polite and professional and soft drinks offered complimentary to all as an apology for the delay and the 'boarding experience'. Very impressed by the service and by the way it was delivered.

### "Highly recommended"
Gatwick to Vienna. After reading all the reviews I feel compelled to write one myself. I think Easyjet is brilliant for the price. When you consider that flights start at £20, it is really reasonable. You will be fine if you know the rules. You cannot expect first class service from an airline when you are paying so little. My flight on this day was great. On time, arriving early. Got extra legroom seats, these where very good and comfortable. Highly recommended, as it's so cheap

### "good seats and friendly cabin crew"
This was the first time we tried EasyJet and will definitely do so again. The check -in Oslo was smooth and friendly, the bag drop a bit far from boarding card scanners but this is really no issue. The trip was also smooth; clean cabin, good seats and friendly cabin crew. No complaints. So EasyJet came out with gluing colors. The Tegel airport did not. Totally clogged - one hour to get the luggage. But we can hardly blame EasyJet for the airport's shortcomings.

### "reflected such a very bad image"
Berlin to Copenhagen. I had the worst experience flying with easy jet airlines. This time it was very stressful, it started by easy jet facilitator at the check-in area where he was very rude and not helpful. We were asking if we need to drop off our baggage he mentioned yes, however the baggage is small and he considered the laptop bag as hand luggage. He was not helpful in general and he reflected such a very bad image for the airline. I told him that you should help us, however he ignored me completely. Big shame! !

### "wouldn't be allowed to board"
Porto to Luton. When purchasing our flights a suggestion from easyjet said "book your seats in advance and carry an extra cabin bag like a purse or a laptop bag", we purchased the sits and were convinced that we could carry the laptop bag. Our outbound (Luton to Porto) was uneventful. Coming back we were forced to pay 60€ for my partners cabin bag and when we were trying to explain why we believe we shouldn't pay instead of a calm explanation we were shouted at, harassed and humiliated in front of all passengers. When I said I would like to know their names to place a complaint I was told I was overreacting and wouldn't be allowed to board. I'm never flying easyjet again under no circumstances. Not only I fell for their tricks into paying for extras that were not provided but was humiliated publicly.

### "the seats are bit nice"
Not Verified |  Not the greatest flight I had. People seem to like this airline a lot which I cant understand. The food, its nothing out of the ordinary. Its not cheaper nor better, I think its even more overpriced than some other companies. I had to pay 5 pounds for a small plastic cup of porridge which wasnt that great either. But what can I expect, Its a cheap airline so no chance for getting anything decent for a low price. The seating is not great but is better than most of the other budget airlines. You have more leg room and the seats are bit nice and more comfortable, the ground service isnt special, you may walk down the stairs and to the plane or get on a bus. I had some issues with that cabin crew being rude. Personally i wouldn't recommend this airline, if you want more legroom and more comfortable seats and you are willing to pay more but not enough to get a business class seat then this is the airline for you. if you are going on a flight that takes less than 4 hours of course. But other than that, the airline is decent.

### "You get choices of seats"
In my opinion, EasyJet is the best low-cost airline. You get choices of seats, and the onboard menu is very reasonable compared to airport prices. EasyJet Switzerland is a notch better than EasyJet, as their staff are multilingual.

### "thank you to the flight crew"
Gatwick to Faro. I would like to say a huge thank you to the flight crew who made the flight a total blast. Such a great way to start our holiday.

### "We are extremely dissatisfied customers"
Let me begin by saying this is by far the worst flight experience I have ever had, and that begins prior to even leaving the tarmac. We begin by finding out our gate only 20 min prior to boarding. After rushing to the site and waiting in an incredibly slow moving line, we were met by a customer service representative stating our bags did not meet requirements, and would not give a clear explanation as to what the requirements were. As the line behind us was so long, she barked orders at us and suggested we pay the GBP50 baggage fee as opposed to finding a solution so she could get the line moving, and perhaps make some commission. Finally, she checked a bag for us for the price of dealing with her attitude. We continued onto the plane where we were made to wait 1hr to leave the tarmac due to a single missing passenger. We found this out through a series of unprofessional announcements from a male flight attendant. Beyond that, some occurrence with a lithium battery unidentified was in a checked bag, resulting in an additional 40 minute delay to find the device (this could be a source of easyjets abnormal 1 bag policy forcing someone to decompose their bag and repack it in a rush). His child was vomiting as they searched for his bag. On top of this, France went on strike during this process creating an even longer delay as we had to reroute around them. The only compensation to be offered was lukewarm water. Flight attendants could later be found charging people on the flight for snacks and beverages since they were now 2 hrs behind on dinner. This is the consequence of LGW’s overall disorganization as a facility along with the poor quality of easy jet to design practical tools for their employees to meet customer service needs. We are extremely dissatisfied customers and will not be flying with easyJet again in the future. As the man on the speaker said “this is a joke”.

### "wouldn't fly with them again"
Belfast to Liverpool. This was my first time flying with Easyjet - I wouldn't fly with them again. Firstly this was a short flight (35 mins) so I didn't expect much. Boarding was ok and the Crew said Hello. Their appearance was shabby. Once in my seat the Cabin itself seemed old. Obvious no recline - seats bolt upright and poor legroom. Did not expect any service and an announcement was made that due to flying time if we want anything to press the call bell. This is fair enough. The brochure prices seemed ok and there was a good range on offer. The flight crew announcements - very professional. We landed on time and the price paid for the fare was reasonable. In saying that i found the seats/space too uncomfortable and would rather pay more for a better experience.

### "very bad customer experience"
Funchal to Gatwick. My flight was cancelled by EasyJet at the end of August, not because of adverse weather conditions or other external circumstances, and I am still waiting for the reimbursement of some expenses. Not to mention that all flights were fully booked and I had to stay two more days in Portugal. The expense claim was managed in a very unprofessional way, with delays, mistakes, lack of clarity and different interpretations of what can be reimbursed and what cannot. Last week, three months after submitting the claim (! ), there were still expenses that hadn't been processed and I was told that the lunches and dinners I had during the two extra days would not be reimbursed because the hotel invoice is not in English and doesn't state what I had for dinner and lunch. This is very bad customer experience!

### "there was nothing really wrong"
Malaga to Stansted. I do not like flying "budget" airlines. That said there was nothing really wrong with this flight. Obviously you have to pay for everything on board which is the model, fine but I just find the flights too cramped especially when you on a heavily booked or full flight. The seats themselves are not uncomfortable but the legroom is not great (not the worst I guess). Professional staff, friendly did their best to make the flight agreeable. In this class of airline Easyjet is probably one of the best I just limit my flights with budget airlines to the minimum.

### "my ticket doesn't include hold luggage"
Bristol to Edinburgh. Arrived at the airport 2 hours early and discover my ticket doesn't include hold luggage. Tried to use the customer service desk and was rudely directed elsewhere. Tried to add it on the website but that didn't work. They charged me £40 at the airport.

### "staff are rude and patronising"
Stuttgart to London. I’m not a happy flyer. Every time I fly easyJet there are delays of at least an hour. Every time they ask me to hand in the luggage to be put in the hold. What’s the point of hand luggage I ask? The staff are rude and patronising. Most unpleasant experience

### "each had 2-3 hours of delay"
Nice to Luton. It is the third time I use easy jet in the 3 last months and each had 2-3 hours of delay! No train available to at the arrival (because too late) and no commercial gesture. So my taxi bill becomes higher than the flight itself. To avoid absolutely!

### "No qualms with the airline"
Luton to Keflavik. No qualms with the airline at all. It is a typical low cost carrier, but on the higher ranking scale than some. No issues boarding or taking off late. Did just the job for a trip to Iceland.

### "Need to be more clear"
Berlin to Naples. Went to my first flight on easy jet and got the “Handsfree” to checkin my luggage, which went through and was fine. My next flight to NAP had an early flight ask for the same thing. Handsfree” checkin luggage, they told me Handsfree meaning you can’t have a purse, small backpack or anything on your hands. Where are you suppose to put your passport wallet and money? Need to be more clear about the Handsfree option. I had a messenger bag and I’m not holding anything on my hand so my hand are handsfree.

### "Would recommend avoiding"
Flew easyJet from Liverpool to Amsterdam. Decided not to fly with Ryanair because they have so many ridiculous hidden fees, got to the check in with my girlfriend. She had an extra handbag and I had a school bag. Got charged £50 per bag. Got on the small overcrowded plane with no room for the bags I was allowed to take on. Would recommend avoiding. Staff were also rude which wound me up more.

### "only allowed one carry on"
This is a ridiculous low cost airline. My ticket from Budapest to Amsterdam was not even cheap and it ended up costing me an extra 65 Usd while boarding. You are only allowed one carry on, my friend and I came with a small carry on suitcase and a backpack which is normal on any other airline. However, the easyJet staff was very rude and was trying to force me to put my backpack into my suitcase which would not fit and then wouldn't let me board until I paid so then I was the last one to board. Additionally, the staff is so rude and was yelling at me on the plane to push my bag all the way under the seat in front of me for no reason when it couldn't go any further back. I would never fly this airline again after spending a ridiculous amount on the bag and then constantly being spoken to very rudely.

### "positive experience each time"
Gatwick to Malaga. We flew back with easyJet on Friday 2nd November, flight EZY8609 The cabin crew were amazing during the whole experience. We were 1.5 hours delayed so there were a lot of high stress levels from customers, each member of staff remained calm and friendly despite me observing a few customers speaking to them rather rudely. I appreciated the pilots keeping us all updated with everything and being honest about the technical fault as I was very nervous about flying after being told by ground staff members there was a technical fault. Once the pilot reassured us all it was, was from a door sensor that was faulty rather than the door itself not shutting properly I  relaxed, I think we were also told we’d changed planes, which also reassured me as I’m quite a nervous flyer! I was flying with my two year old and cabin crew staff were accommodating and friendly with him, he loved the experience thoroughly and at the end of the journey, once we’d landed safely the pilots invited him into the cockpit to see all the lights and buttons - he’s loved aeroplanes since he was a year old and now after getting to meet two lovely pilots, he keeps telling me how he wants to be a pilot. I’ve flown many times with easyJet and always had a positive experience each time.

### "Shocking quality of service"
Not Verified | Manchester to Geneva. Shocking. This is the 3rd time. I have flow with Easyjet and the third time I have been delayed. This flight was delayed by 90 minutes because the wing had to be deiced. Shocking quality of service.

### "This is a lousy airline"
Copenhagen to Paris. This is a lousy airline with a poor customer service. The flight ticket was cost conscious but they would charge you everything. For instance, they allow you only one carry on bag and if you have two, they would suggest you to buy a speedy boarding to carry two bags. If you buy a hold luggage for ex 15kg, they don’t allow you to split. So if you have two hold luggages to check in with whatever weight, you have two buy hold luggages. I think I was robbed that time as I had to pay around 75$ more to be able to check in two hold luggages and carry two bags. It was nightmare and the customer service wasn’t helpful at all. I would not recommend this airline to others.

### "Steer clear of this airline"
Flight home from Edinburgh to Gatwick was cancelled, we then had to queue at the Easyjet desk for two hours only to be told that there were no flights until tomorrow evening. There was no reason given as to why the flight was cancelled and all they could offer us was £3 food vouchers that a number of the places in the airport refused to take. Useless customer service and we are still trying to claim back the cost of our alternative transport without any luck thus far. Steer clear of this airline unless you enjoy aggro!

### "lousy customer service"
My wife traveled with a backpack and shoulder bag each from Paris to Madrid and this airline charged us 47 euros extra for each backpack, this is excessive and we were treated very badly in Paris the one in charge of the check one laughed at us for complaining and he said we were whiners, lousy customer service. ES: Mi esposa viajamos con una mochila y una cartera de hombro cada uno de París a Madrid y está aerolínea nos cobro 47 euros extra por las cada mochila , esto es excesivo y nos trataron pésimo en París la encargada del check un se rió de nosotros por reclamar y dijo que éramos unos llorones, pésimo servicio al cliente.

### "fantastic Special Assistance teams"
Not Verified |  Edinburgh to Bristol. I’m writing this review to praise the fantastic Special Assistance teams at both Edinburgh and Bristol airports. Also the staff onboard and at the gate at both airports who were extremely helpful and considerate of our needs. I booked Special Assistance for my 8 year old grandson who has mobility issues and is super sensitive to loud and sudden noises. A wheelchair was provided with guidance on the process of getting through security. 2 members of the SA team met us at the gate and took us to a special lift to get my grandson on board the plane. The staff were thoughtful , reassuring my grandson and ensuring that things happened quietly and efficiently and without fuss. We were met at the other end by another SA team member with a wheelchair to get us off the plane - again using the special lift). On return to Edinburgh the 2 staff members took us out to the airport bus and helped us on board. It his first ever flight and we were anxious that it should go well. Thanks to the staff it did. We could not fault the service we had - it was wonderful.

### "easyJet our first port of call"
Liverpool to Palma de Mallorca. I've just worked out that this year my wife and I have made 5 return trips from Liverpool with easyJet: 4 to Spain and 1 to Cyprus. The total cost was just over £630. Each flight went off without any problem: in fact, the only unusual event was being told at the gate for one of the flights that our seats had been changed - one row forward! We had a slight delay on a return journey but we were kept informed. Our most recent trip, to Mallorca earlier this month, was typical of the reliable service we have always experienced from easyJet: we left on time and arrived early, the cabin crew worked hard without any fuss and the cockpit team kept us informed. We did not even have to wait beyond the gate before boarding on the outward journey. For us, cost and convenience make easyJet our first port of call when planning any foreign holiday.

### "customer service was horrid"
Easyjet and their staff at Rome FCO airport are a joke. I needed to fly out of Rome to Paris on October 3rd, 2018. Our original flight was at 9:50 am. It was at the airport that I realized I didn't have my passport. I went up to the Easyjet desk and explained to them that I do not have my passport and it most likely was left at a shop in Central Rome. At this time, it was only an assumption that my passport was there. This is because I received a missed call from a Rome number the night before. I spoke to the man about my situation and he said that it would be fine for me to go retrieve my passport and come back and book a flight (fully knowing that my original flight was at 9:50 am and it would take me 2 hours round trip to get my passport from Central Rome). He said that once I had my passport he can go ahead and book a new flight for me no problem, I just had to pay the difference. I wanted to make sure I knew everything I needed to know before leaving the airport and just wanted reassurance that there would be space available for me when I come back to book my flight to Paris. He said everything was fine, just go get my passport. I come back to the airport and an employee says there is nothing she can do and that I had to buy a completely new flight. I told her I had spoken to her colleague this morning and he said I can pay the difference. I tried to ask her understand my situation and that her colleague had told me otherwise. She would not change her mind. I agree to buy a new flight and I realized I booked for Oct 04 instead of Oct 3. I tell her I just booked the flight like 2 minutes ago but I booked for the wrong day, can she change the flight for me. She says that for her to change the flight Easyjet will keep 40-50 euros for the change. You can imagine how frustrated I was at this point. I compromise and purchase a new flight even though her colleague told me I would only have to pay the difference, I go and book my own flight because an Easyjet employee with a computer right in front her, says that she can’t help me, and on top of that the they are charging me to change a flight that I literally had booked 2 minutes prior to talking to her. It just didn’t make any sense. Nowhere did I read that there is a 2 hour time limit on booking a new flight. Nowhere did I see that Easyjet would keep a portion of what you had paid just to change the flight on top of paying a difference. The customer service was absolutely horrid and honestly non-existent. It’s not worth it to fly this cheap airline.

### "helpful, informative and polite"
Just got back from Pula flying with Easyjet and have to say both journeys were brilliant. The cabin crew were helpful, informative and polite. A superb example of how low cost airlines are putting some of the more costly airlines to shame and proof that low costs doesn't mean low quality or poor customer services.

### "trickery of the booking system"
I have used easyJet many many times since their earliest flights. Everything has been reasonably acceptable given the limitations of a no-frills airline and the intricate trickery of the booking system. However the company shows a completely different character if anything non-standard occurs and the customer experience now becomes a completely different one. EasyJet pre-emptively cancelled a Marseilles to Bristol flight at the end of June on the basis of a threatened French air traffic control strike. In the event there was no strike. For myself and my wife I spent £530 pounds and not a little stress to return to Bristol by train.​ ​ I have since attempted to recover these costs under 'Expense Claim. Replacement Travel to your Destination'. That's where the fun starts. To attempt any interaction with Customer Services or the mis-named 'Resolution Team' unearths a most unpleasant side to the happy, smiling image the Company would like to portray.​ ​ I attempted to upload travel receipts to the online claim form. Problem. Webchat agent twice told me it would only work with Google Chrome! Advised to forward all by mail to Luton. Eventually Customer Services replied to say claims were only allowable online. Again told to use Google Chrome despite quite efficiently receiving my payments for many years by Internet Explorer/Edge. Another Webchat agent under duress sent me a link to send all claims documents. Sent but worryingly no acknowledgement. Webchat again promised response from Claims within 24 hrs. Nothing. Tried phoning but gave up after 1hr15mins. Sent complaint. Promised response within 28 days. Still waiting after 40. Webchat again. Usual pre-scripted press-button patronising platitudes but promised a response same day! Silly me to get excited because nothing. Today another little webchat. I was informed that the CASE HAS BEEN closed and that I should call the Resolution Team ! Now it's getting laughable.....if only! Tried phoning them this morning but lost the will to live after 1hr10mins and gave up.​ ​ I've now got much better things to do. So, easyjet you have avoided yet another justifiable recompense through your patently obvious policy of distraction, obfuscation, confusion, frustration, false sympathy, untruths and diversion. I am sure someone somewhere is happy but in reality you should be totally ashamed.​

### "really bad experience"
Milan to Tel Aviv. Just tried your “hands free” service. It was a really bad experience. First of all, I had to wait for the whole line at bag drop even though I was already checked in. Secondly no one told me that if you’re using the service you’re not allowed to have a small bag with you for passport and water so I got fined for 60 euros, while if I had my suitcase with me I would just put my small bag inside. Thirdly, I was promised to be one of the first to get their bags, which didn’t happen and I had to wait for almost 40 minutes while the other passengers where already taking their bags. So eventually I paid 6 pounds for a service that caused me very long waiting times and a 60 euro fine.

### "not the way we should be treated"
Verona to  Gatwick. Appalled by priority check in - we had a 5 month 3 week year old baby boy therefore meant to have priority check in, as previously stated. We were placed on the buses ‘first’, trying to fight our way through the queue of people. We were then sat on the bus for 45 minutes whilst we waited for everyone else to board the bus. How is this priority? My nephew was asleep at the time and the plan was to feed him as soon as we got on the flight. This did not happen due to having to wait for everyone else to get on the bus, as well as everyone else getting off of the bus before us and getting on the plane before us. This is unacceptable and appalling. We are not  at all happy about this! This is not the way we should be treated as priority customers!

### "the usual no-frills flight"
Flew easyJet from London Gatwick to Budapest. Unpleasant scene at boarding gate, where frosty staff with all the charm of an army sergeant insisted that the second small item clearly allowed on board must be squeezed into the main hand luggage, making many passengers repack in frenzy. Other than this, the usual no-frills flight.

### "all very cheerful and helpful"
I flew from Manchester to Venice Marco Polo on 6th October. Plane left on time. It was clean and as comfortable as can be for a Budget airline. The onboard staff were all very cheerful and helpful. Arrived in Venice slightly early after an uneventful flight, I returned on 11th October. Again the plane left on time. After take off I managed to move and get 3 seats on my own. Stretched out and read a book. Landed at Manchester 15 minutes early. Again the staff were all cheerful and efficient. Fantastic value for money at £85 return! I've always had a good experience with easyJet, and can't speak too highly of them.

### "Flight attendants friendly"
Lisbon to Funchal. They are very punctual even arriving earlier than schedule. Plane cabin needed some improvement on cleaning as it was oddly dusty. Flight attendants friendly but too focused on selling duty free items.

### "treated kindly by cabin staff"
Heraklion to Gatwick. Flight was very late (about 2 hours delay), but we knew this a long time in advance due to updates from the mobile app. Check-in, bag drop and boarding all seamless, journey on their new A320neo very comfortable and we were treated kindly by the cabin staff and given frequent updates from the flight deck. As we knew we were landing at Gatwick in the wee hours we booked a hotel adjacent to the terminal, which allowed for a stress-free arrival.

### "impressed with the service"
Birmingham to Belfast. This is our first flight with EasyJet we were very impressed with the service. The flight actually arrived early, the seats were comfortable and the staff pleasant. We wouldn't use the in flight service again on a short flight as it all has too be rushed but this is just a personal observation not a criticism. We also needed wheelchair assistance and this was also first class from EasyJet and the airport staff, thank you very much.

### "Speedy Boarding is chaotic"
Arrecife to Gatwick. The situation at Arrecife with Speedy Boarding is chaotic if you are at Gate 1 - you have to be bussed to the aircraft and it is no use paying extra for Speedy Boarding because it is a free for all. I have experienced this before and, being a Plus Card member, feel aggrieved that the conditions of my membership are not being met in full. That said, the flight itself was superb. The plane was brand new and the exit row seat I chose had brilliant legroom especially as you are not allowed to place luggage under the seat in front. Unfortunately, I had a seat kicking brat behind me making my usual forty winks impossible to achieve. Its response to a request from the parent was to bawl right in my ear! The seats are fine for short haul but a little hard on my backside and I reckon four hours is about maximum. Cabin service was exceptional and the frequent updates from the captain most informative and welcome. I usually fly Easyjet on this route and apart from the times Speedy Boarding has not been possible, the experience has usually been very positive.

### "crew friendly and helpful"
When I flew with easyJet to Bristol the crew were so friendly and helpful. The seats were quite comfortable but the velcro on the seat in front had come off so I could see inside it but no biggie. The pilots were informative, the flight was short (UK Domestic flight - 40 min) and on-time. I would definitely fly with them again.

### "not preferred flight solution"
Edinburgh to Gatwick. Scheduled departure time 15:50, actual departure time 17:50. Conflicting and inaccurate departure gates - easyJet App flight update not working. Nonexistent baggage carousel notifications. Gate crew & cabin staff seemed up to the task of dealing with disgruntled passengers. I’ll be checking out easyJet as last not preferred flight solution next time.

### "delayed over 3 hours"
A quick flight from Basel to London turned into a 3 day and $2k nightmare after easyjet was delayed over 3 hours. They say they will help you with expenses, but I was quickly denied (and I only claimed the $600 rebooking fee Norwegian charged me). I also had two suitcases with my ticket, which they said wasn't in their system and needed to charge me again even though it was on my phone. Long story short, this airline clearly isn't worth the headache. I wish I would have listened to the reviews. Hope this helps.

### "very frustrated customer"
Munich to Luton. This is my 4th flight this year - each flight more than 1 hour late. Easyjet collects delays over the day and the late flights are all delayed as the pilots are over there time windows. As this is four trips in a row now, at different times in the week and to different destinations - this is a systematic failure. A very frustrated customer.

### "about 3 hours of delays"
Not Verified |  Geneva to Amsterdam. Had about 3 hours of flight time this weekend with my return journey, and about 3 hours of delays. Since easyjet is cheap, I ask nothing but to be on time, but that didn't happen apparently.

### "let down by  ground handling"
Luton to Heraklion. Well the flight and cabin crew are first class but the airline is let down by the ground handling agents it uses. Our flight out from Luton was boarded and pushed back from the stand and head down the taxi way towards the run way only to be met half way down by a follow me car from the airport and parked on a remote stand at Luton. This was after what I can describe has the worst aircraft marshalling I have seen since I watched a charity clip by the RAF on UTUBE. Luton Airport wonders why it is getting so many bad reviews and bad press. Why board an aircraft which you know is going to be subjected to a 30 minute delay. The aircraft captain told everyone that the was an ATC delay due to congestion en route but this would of been known before the aircraft was boarded so why board it? But when we did get underway the crew due to tail winds were able to make up the 30 minute delay and arrival on stand on time. The service on board was slick and professional. The menu was good value for money and we had pre ordered which is a new service and I can recommend this to any one. The return trip we left 35 minutes late due to the aircraft which was been used arriving late from its trip to Luton. However again the crew were able to make up 20 minutes of the flight time arriving into Luton 15 minutes late. But due to the non existent cowboy ground handling company and the jobs worth mentality of its staff who could only manage to be bothered to use one set of aircraft stairs for a full A320 which was parked on a remote stand meant we were kept waiting 35 minutes before we got into the terminal building.

### "blown out of proportion"
Aberdeen to Gatwick. I've had approximately 8 flights in the last 3 months and this will be only and last aboard easy jet. During boarding before my flight a woman was holding a very small bag came under question while boarding and demanded be put in another bag the woman was carrying on - needless to say the passenger was frustrated and as boarding said "idiot" after passing the gate. Uncalled for, yes, but the response by the agent was ridiculous. Shouting excuse me, causing a scene and in general making the situation more than it should have been when if the woman had whispered far worse expletive. Unbelievable and poorly managed. Also, while boarding, officers were called -  the whole thing was completely blown out of proportion.

### "one of the best flights"
Gatwick to Funchal. The cabin crew were amazing, made the flight a really happy experience can't praise them enough. The captain was also very informative to the passengers and overall one of the best flights I have flown on.

### "Ryanair £100 cheaper per person"
Basel to Faro. Interesting comparison to Ryanair. The aircraft looked new although 5 years old and was very clean. The seats were slim style but the pitch was noticeably less by about 2 inches and quite hard by the end of the 2.5 hour flight. Flight left on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew were smart and friendly, helping with luggage. The food selection was not inspiring but the rose wine was of good quality although not very cool. Both airlines gave a good service in general but Ryanair wins by virtue of slightly larger pitch, better food and most importantly £100 cheaper person for equivalent lengths of flight.

### "cabin crew were fantastic"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Bologna. We flew with easyjet in August although i had not flown for a number of years. The experience was superb, everything from the booking through to the landing at Bologna went as planned. There was a 25 minute delay, not the fault of easyjet. The cabin crew were fantastic and looked after us well and the flight crew kept us informed regarding the delay.

### "no customer service or manners"
Belfast to London. In the last 2 months I have flown with easyJet 4 times. Never again unless I really have to. I was meant to fly out from Belfast International Airport at 3.40pm on Friday 21st September to visit my son on Norwich. We expected to get the 5.30pm train from the airport. One delay after another ensued with Easyjet staff being unhelpful and not even apologising once for the delay. Even the pilot who eventually pulled away from the stand at 5pm did not even have the grace to explain the delay. Our dinner in Norwich booked for 8pm had to be cancelled as we arrived at 10pm. Now I find myself back again at the airport and and am again delayed for the return flight home. No apologies again. easyJet truly are a horrible airline with absolutely no customer service or manners.

### "stuck in Amsterdam for 2 days"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Amsterdam return. Please pay more and go with a decent airline. Me and my husband are currently stuck in Amsterdam for 2 days due to easyjet cancelling our flight home. It would have been fine but they have moved us into student accommodation! We finally got here after a 75 minute walk miles away from where we were. We have spent hours on the phone, even begging for a down grade so we can get back to the area where we were. We have been told they won't pay for our taxi to the airport which is going to cost us a lot more as we have been moved so much further away. We now have to spend the next 2 days with kids studying. To top if off they haven't given us a food or drink allowance (which they said they would arrange) but the student hotel knows nothing about this! We haven't eaten all day so far and it's now almost tea time. I am so disappointed. Our perfect break has been completely ruined and the customer service we have received has been appalling!

### "appalling post delay service"
Porto to Gatwick. Absolutely appalling post delay service, and no way to contact them. Email complaints and escalations generates automated emails promising response within 21 or 28 days. My flight was delayed on 8 May for over 6 hours, compensation claim lodged on 10 May, today is 20 September, and I still have not received anything from Easyjet besides auto replies of promises to reply. This is unacceptable.

### "The worst airline by far"
Flew Amsterdam to Edinburgh with easyJet. The worst airline by far, rude check-in process and boarding. They forced me to check in my carry on luggage. Told me I was to be removed from the flight if I didnt check-in my carry on.

### "back to the alternatives"
Bristol to Malaga. Switched to easyJet for last four flights. 25% arrival on time including a record two hours 45 minutes. Left with additional car hire fees as a result. Never thought I would say this but back to the alternatives even Ryanair. At least you get a fanfare when they arrive on time. So far 100% for us.

### "put hand luggage in the hold"
Barcelona to Geneva. The most unpleasant crew members when boarding the plane. Forced us to put our hand luggage in the hold, even when explaining to them we had a tight time to catch the connexion. The worse was there was plenty of place in the cabin and the flight was delayed.

### "can do better with minimal effort"
Lisbon to Luton. This was my first time using EasyJet. I was surprised how many people try to carry on huge bags. This meant that staff were taking bags from people to put them in the hold whilst they were queuing to get on the plane. Unfortunately this meant a two tier system as some were lucky and got away with huge bags whilst others were not. The staff were firm but also rude and insisted one lady exited the queue to go and pay for her luggage to be placed in the hold. EasyJet should make it clear that all bags larger than the size listed in their website will be placed in the hold and charged for and this should be enforced at check in, not afterwards. Our flight was delayed by around 2.5 hours. Anxious not to pay each traveller the £3 we were entitled to we were boarded into a priority access area. Queued to go through an electronic passport check only to have queue to have them checked again before boarding. Once on board we err asked to sit quickly to avoid losing the take off slot. Then a staff member demanded boarding passes from some passengers. She was rude and abrupt with them and offered no explanation for her demand despite the passenger being very pleasant with her. The delay meant we were travelling at dinner time and the food options are very basic. Due to the quick changeover the choices were further reduced as they quickly ran out of some selections. Food is poor. I was in row 8. I got the last ham and cheese sandwich. It was really dry. Pretty gross really even for airline food. My husband opted for a bacon baguette. Strangely the bacon was just about cooked but the baguette was dry. He had to ask for the ketchup it was supposed to come with and was given one sachet despite the advert offering two sachets. The staff on board were pleasant. The captain needs to check his maths as he was updating with time left on the flight with corresponding times that simply did not add up! EasyJet is a budget airline but can do better with minimal effort.

### "Not a very pleasant experience"
Palma to Luton. Rubbish. Absolute rubbish. Inbound and outbound flights were delayed. They asked us to go to the gate on time. The official app said one gate no but the flight wasn't there. An hour later they changed the gate no. Went there and a different flight was announced. After that no information whatsoever. Not a very pleasant experience.

### "experience I will never repeat"
At Gatwick on way to Marseilles we had to wait for about 40 mins in a spiral staircase as plane door would not open. Then on way back I had to pay 60 Euro to be allowed on board with exactly the same luggage I boarded on way over. Seats don't recline. An awful experience I will never repeat.

### "most unpleasant experience"
Barcelona to Luton. I just had the most unpleasant experience at the boarding gate M06 at Barcelona terminal 2C when ground staff asked only me out of tens of people carrying massive shopping bags, hand bags and hand luggage to put my tiny handbag into my hand luggage (note the tiny handbag I was carrying!) and even asked me to come out of the queue! Luckily a colleague of hers arrived and he scanned my boarding pass! What a nightmare!

### "would not recommend it to anyone"
My 6.40pm flight was delayed by 3.5 hrs! EasyJet’s excuse: bad weather conditions in Milan. Mind you I currently live in Milan and I did know there had been a thunderstorm (8am) but it had cleared up by 9.30-10 yet my evening flight was delayed due to bad weather? The airport was a chaos because all their flights were facing massive delays that day, but what’s weird, only their flights! None of the other airline’s had more than 30 min delay. We only got a voucher of 4.50eur (bottle of water). And obviously no refund even though I paid 410 eur for my return ticket! I would not recommend it to anyone.

### "Terrible customer assistance"
Ibiza to Milan. Terrible company: flight delayed even on the “arranged” arrival time, no assistance given after landing: left at the airport at 2 A.M. (instead of 00:20) and no more transfers available. Had to pay a taxi, no care given, no refund or anything. Terrible customer assistance, I will avoid

### "one cabin bag for each person"
Milan to Tel Aviv. This was the worst airline I have travelled.I always book my flights through a company but for the first time I decided to book online, and I want a direct flight and this one was my only option to get to my destination. First of all, the customer service was beyond awful, they treat people like trash! When we arrived to the airport, they have a separate terminal far away from the main airport only for easyjet, it was packed! Thank god we arrived early, it was packed and when it was our turn, since we are a family traveling, they dont accept any more 1kg, so they made us open and remove from our luggage or else we pay 14€ per 1kg. We did that then when we arrived to the checking point, a lady was there that stopped as and told us that our ticket allow us to only have one cabin bag for each person, meaning that us ladies who carry a handbag and has a small carry on bag, can’t go in with both unless they already have payed for a ticket that allow you to carry both! I And they make you put your carry on bag in a metal thing to see if it fits or not, if it doesn’t, you have to go back and pay extra to load your cabin bag as if its a luggage bag, 47€ per bag if it doesn’t fit that thing, and if we wanna do that whole thing we have to stand in line for another hour, so they have the option to pay 16€ to get into “fast lane” which changes your seat to the front seat. It’s a money-sucking company, definitely not a saver, you will pay the money you saved on things you didn’t even thought of, if you’re on a budget and traveling alone, dont have much stuff, go for it, if you’re a family traveling definitely I don’t recommend it! Next time I will pay through a company with another flight, all services will be included without any extra charge, and definitely not having to fight with their awful customer service.

### "it is not cheap"
Gatwick to Munich. Flight was delayed 1hr. Now waiting in airport for return flight which is said to be 1.5 hrs late! Airside at Munich airport is awful. Why would anyone fly with Easyjet? It is not cheap.

### "cancelled 2 days in a row"
Paris to Nice with easyJet. Cancelled my flight 2 days in a row and I had to take a train in the end which was very expensive. On top, just got an email refusing my compensation claim. Never ever taking easyJet again.

### "Everything was as expected"
Flew Berlin SXF to Tenerife South on Aug 29 with my mom. We have had very good experiences with easyjet, so we were both happy to fly them again this time and again, positive experiences. Paid 95€ each for the flight, including luggage and seat reservations. Departed 20 mins late and arrived 10 mins late, but okay as we are on vacation and not in a hurry. Everything was as expected. Of course it is a bit boring, a 5 hour flight without any entertainment or any free drinks, but we knew this in advance and didn‘t expect anything else as easyjet is a Low Cost Carrier. Legroom was good in my opinion, I'm 1.67m. Cabin Crew were friendly. Very good flight and value for money!

### "most awful airline"
Gatwick to Prague. This was the most awful airline I have ever encountered. The worst possible customer service, the cheapest airline I have ever seen and a total ripoff. Not worth the low price for all the headache.

### "last flight was cancelled"
Berlin to Vienna. The company does not care about the customers. My last flight was cancelled and no help was provided to find an alternative route. After finding another flight myself, I submitted claim through official EasyJet link they sent, but after 2 months never got refund for the ticket. After submitting claim for expenses that I had from extra ticket and staying in Berlin for another night, 1 month later my claim bounced back to me asking for extra details on a receipt that already had all these data. After sending these data, no reply. The next message was that my case is closed because I never sent any data they requested. On the previous flight I had even worse experience. I had to put all my things into one bag in the gate and was called security when I couldn't push the bags together within 10 seconds counted by the person in the gate. Really angry and disrespectful staff.

### "flight was eventually cancelled"
The flight was supposed to leave from Paris to Edinburgh at 21:50 on July 17th, but it kept getting delayed until it was eventually cancelled at 23:00. Then, all the passengers had to wait for further instructions until 2 am. No one told us in the company offered us help or gave us an explanation, we had to go ourselves. There was a group of elderly people that were sitting uncomfortably on the luggage claim. Of course, easyjet’s staff didn’t care. Two passengers were kind enough to get some chairs from the reception for the elderly. At 2am one bus arrived and we weren’t even told. The staff just left us wait without any updates. Ironically we get the updates from the passengers instead of the staff. The nightmare continue when your company hire a bus driver who doesn't didn’t know the direction of the hotel. He drove in circles around the airport for an hour until we reach the hotel which was very far from Paris. By the time we get to to check in to the room it was already 3 am and we had to get up early in order to get breakfast. Next day (July 18th), we found ourselves with the same situation. We had to ask for updates ourselves on what to do next. We were told to go to the airport to settle everything. If we hadn’t done that we would lose the bus to the airport. Once we were there, they told us there are no more flights today, so we need to stay in a hotel until Saturday (21th of July), when there’s a flight to Edinburgh. If that’s it’s not inconvenient enough, they made us wait again more than an hour to get the hotel confirmation and we were told to come back to the aiport to reschedule the stay on the every following consecutive day. Airport staff told us we will receive compensation for that cancelled flight but until now we receive none.

### "the most stressful flight "
Berlin to Copenhagen with easyjet operated by Smarlynx Estonia. The flight itself was very smooth and no nonsense. The ground services however were abysmal. I arrived way too early at the airport (3h before departure) and still had to run to get on the plane. It all began when I received and email saying that the overhead lockers on-board this SmartLynx A320 are too small to fit easyjets usual cabin baggage. It also said that I could drop off my cabin luggage at the easyjet plus check in desks. To confirm that I asked at customer services if I could indeed drop off my bag at that desk to which they said yes. When the check in for my flight opened, I came back to the terminal to find an immense line to the counters. Fortunately the easyjet plus desk had no such line. I went there and then got called at and kicked out by a ground operations worker and had to endure 2h of line for the normal check in. In the end we got called to a separate desk because if not we would not have made it to our gate on time. When I finally reached a desk, the employee had no idea what I was talking about when I explained the situation with the cabin luggage and needed help from 2 other employees. Finally I dropped of my bag and sprinted towards the gate. I made it to my gate with my belt in my hand because I didn't even have time to put it back on after security. Be careful when flying easyjet during the summer from Tegel. Ground operations is a complete joke. This was the most stressful flight of my life just because of it.

### "shocking company to fly with"
Gatwick to Amsterdam. Flight was delayed by 2 hours and 49 minutes, just short off the 3 hour mark which is how you get compensation. So we got nothing. EasyJet are a shocking company to fly with, there were delays everywhere, none of the staff knew how to control the angry crowd. Honestly easyJet get your act together. Wouldn’t fly with them again. Then they moved my girlfriend away from me so I couldn’t sit with her. Then these other couples came on after and they were allowed to sit together.

### "a cheap short flight"
Not Verified |  Basel to Brussels. The flight only lasted about an hour so I didn't need food or a toilet. The price was quite reasonable although the booking took place only 2 weeks before. By Smartphone App I was informed about a delay of the flight but there was no indication how long the flight would be delayed. This information was communicated to us by loudspeaker announcement. The check in was very pleasant and fast. The employee was interested in a smooth process. There were problems at the security checkpoint because the flashlight I wanted to take with me was apparently too big. Well, the rule is the rule. So I went out again to take the flashlight away. When I came back the check in was already closed but since the flight was not yet there I was waved through the premium entrance as the security staff still remembered me. That was very obliging. After the new security check everything was just right and I arrived at the gate just in time. During boarding the size of my hand luggage was not checked and I was also allowed to take an additional mini bag for free although this was not part of the booking. The aircraft staff were in a very good mood and helped the passengers to get to their seats quickly. They also hurried to help with the luggage. All in all, I found the staff very positive. The captain made a lot of general information about the flight. Overall I recommend the airline for people who want to book a cheap short flight.

### "my bag was slightly bigger"
Gatwick to Glasgow. If you thought Ryanair was bad, easyjet is worse. Hence the price, clearly. Never had a problem with any other budget airlines about my backpack, but when I was boarding, I had to pay £47 because my bag was slightly bigger than the fit. Staff was also impolite about it.

### "check your bag size"
Milan to Olbia. The worst flight experience. They make you pay for seat selection and to bring a second rollaboard on. Then, when you get to the airport, they make you pay for plastic bags for toiletries, at the gate they force you to check your bag size. My official rollaboard suitcase by luggageworks is too big for their checking devices. Then, they charged me 120 euros to get my and my daughter's rollaboard on the airplane, round trip. Did not refund my fee paid for two rollaboards, failed to enter my round trip fee for the bag, so they tried to charge me again for the return trip. Absolutely sickening service, customer abuse, will never fly again.

### "Not worth the money"
Milan to Gatwick. These people sent daily notification via their app 90 mins before scheduled departure (which means that I already inside the airport and passed security - eq there is no easy way out of airport to smoke/etc). Not a single announcement in the airport. Flightradar shows that plane intended for my flight is on route to Ibiza for more then 1 hour (wtf? Why they did not made announcement at least one hour earlier?) and no updatesin the airport even on departure displays up until 5:20pm (if flight were on schedule gate would be closed at 6:10pm). No staff, no one, no further announcements. Not worth the money I paid for ticket.

### "Paid for exit row seats"
Gatwick to Palma. Paid for exit row seats which gets Speedy Boarding and check in which saved quite a long queue for DIY check-in at Gatwick. Plane was clean and tidy with decent leg room at the exit, but looked tight elsewhere. Crew professional and very friendly and dealt well with a split up family. Food and drink to buy onboard was more expensive that expected, but good choice and quick service. Bags out in minutes in Palma. As good as British Airways and cheaper.

### "subsidizing the friends of crew"
Bristol to Barcelona. As I am taller than most I paid extra for a front row seat, this was a mistake, as we had the wall between us and the exit area, we had limited leg room. Once we had boarded, the passenger next to us boarded, she was a flight attendant that knew the crew. So they embraced, and had extended conversation. The conversation went right through the pilots announcements and the safety briefing - this was by a flight attendant who was a passenger, talked right through the safety briefing. As soon as she boarded the attendants gave her a bottle of water, then as soon as we took off, she got two gin and tonics, well before any other passenger had been served - did she pay of course not. Then she was given the toasted sandwich (no charge), the cold meat what ever that was (no charge) then the chocolate cookie (no charge), all before any passenger got a inking of being served. The crew and her continued dialogue ignoring the remaining passengers. This type of service really does put off regular full fare paying customers from using their service, we the full fare payers, are subsidizing the friends of crew. What type of message is EasyJet sending out to the world.

### "they are the worst"
Nice to Geneva. Do not take this airline, they are the worst. My three last flights were all canceled just 40 mins before flight. This is the most unprofessional company I have flown with. Service is horrible, always late or canceled and always making up stupid excuses.

### "I’m still waiting"
Manchester to Belfast. Normally a good airline and I fly with regularly. I was on a flight from Manchester to Belfast on June 11th 2018 that was cancelled. None of the staff new what was happening, the notice boards was not updated, people had to queue for 5 hours to be transferred. Now 7 weeks later dispute numerous emails I’m still waiting to find out if I’m going to recover my out of pocket expenses and be compensated. The Customer service is none existent as you can’t speak to people about it you just have to wait until the next email. I was told they would have made a decision within 4 weeks but I’m still waiting.

### "they make lame excuses"
I had 40 min airtime flight from Stansted to Amsterdam and then way back. The flight was 2h 40 mins delayed and 1h 40m delayed on the way back from Amsterdam to London Stansted. This is ridiculous. And each time they make lame excuses that the flight earlier was delayed etc. Really bad experience.

### "flight delayed for various excuses"
Geneva to Krakow. Easyjet goes from bad to worse. I remember times she it was most reliable and very correct company. This year it's a disaster. Every flight is delayed for various excuses. I'm a frequent flyer I board once per week. Flying on time is a big exception. It's normal for them to board on time and keep waiting on a craft for an hour or keep at the gate with no info. Half an hour delay become a standard and noone cares about passengers connections. Besides stuff is less and less qualified and motivated. Sometimes they hardly speak English and make no effort to make themself understood. I'm really disappointed with the company performance. With a Hub in Geneva it unfortunately lost all Swiss or EU standards. Now I'm at the airport and see that will get info only at the scheduled time of departure. So two hours waiting with no information.

### "my budget airline of choice"
Late evening departure out of Copenhagen for Gatwick on bank holiday Monday. We arrived at Copenhagen airport just over an hour before the flight, and were surpised to be called for the flight almost inmediately we had passed through security. Walking through the airport I realised why, however - the budget airline wing of CPH is a very long way away from the main lounge area. The gate area for the budget flights is basic but there is a small shop for snacks and drinks. Boarding into a 'pen' commenced before arrival of the incoming flight, so we were stood in a queue for quite a while, but boarding was rapid once the inbound flight had arrived. Only real negative was the plane had clearly not been cleaned on the turnaround, and there was a fair amount of rubbish inside. The aircraft was one of the older easyJet planes and was showing its age - they really could do with a refurb of the older planes in the fleet now. Once on board, the pilot announced that storms were causing major delays into Gatwick and we might have to wait some time - an hour or more - for a takeoff slot. However, 15 minutes later the pilot informed us that he had managed to pursuade Gatwick to give us an earlier slot and we were cleared for takeoff straight away - I was impressed at these efforts. In flight, the crew were as good as I've come to expect from easyJet and the pilots gave the customary route updates, which are always welcome. We landed at Gatwick 15 minutes early, which was impressive as I noted from the arrivals board that almost every other flight that evening had a 1 hour or longer delay. Imnigration was surprisingly quiet for a bank holiday. EasyJet are certainly no-frills, and you get what you pay for, but in my experience have always been punctual with excellent staff, and I will gladly continue to use them as my budget airline of choice within Europe.

### "Yet another delay"
Split to Manchester. Yet another delay from EasyJet and unnecessary lie and misinformation. Flight delay for two hours informed technical problem when technical problem was in the morning. The airline knew all day that it will be late so it was no reason to lie and misinform making everyone wait in overfilled airport.

### "Upload again and wait"
Hamburg to Gatwick. If you suffer a delay or cancellation expect the following. Easy to find and easy to use claim form on line where you upload your details and receipts. Upload and wait, and wait, and wait. After 28 days receive an automated email asking for the receipts you already uploaded. Upload again and wait and wait. After another 28 days receive an automated email asking for the receipts you already uploaded twice. Upload again and wait.

### "flights have been delayed"
Edinburgh to Munich. EasyJet is getting worse. I used to fly with them which was a basic, but positive experience most of the time, but over the last months all my flights have been delayed. They seem not to manage to manage their connections when they blame unforeseen circumstances for delays and cancellations. On the top of that the customer service seems to be  based on providing false information on the airport (that everything will be refunded etc.) which is not refunded afterwards and they appear not even to be obliged to answer your email!

### "Worst airline experience"
You get what you pay for. Worst airline experience ever. We arrived at the the airport 2+ plus hours before scheduled departure. I saw that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. The flight was pushed until 11:30 am and didn’t actually take off until 12:11 pm. We decided to walk around and buy gifts for for our family inside AMS airport. We get back to the bag drop area and are informed that we wouldn’t be able to check in and would not be allowed to get on the flight. Keep in mind that this was at 09:47 am which is 1 hour and 43 minutes prior to delayed departure time. We go the help desk and the one agent didn’t get to us until 10:02. She was rude when speaking to us. Instead of the normal bumping and compensation, I think that easyJet turned it on the customer under the “online checkin closes 2 hours prior to scheduled departure” clause. It does not specify on the email airport counter closes at that same time.

### "delayed by easyJet"
Inverness to Luton. Third time in a row spectacularly delayed by easyJet this year. The last two have seemingly been a reflection of the poor resilience built into their schedules which are over complicated by crisscrossing all over Europe. They just cannot bee relied on for domestic U.K. travel. Be extremely worried if you receive an email a few days before your flight if it says that the flight will be operated by easyJet Europe as this seems to mean inevitable delays happen. On this occasion the incoming flight arrived late and so missed its window to then avoid a weather related issue at Luton. EasyJet initially refused to pay out compensation because of the Luton related weather issues - when it was pointed out to them that their own flights landed at Luton around the time mine was due to land and BA had found it possible to depart Inverness later and arrive at Heathrow on time they then blamed more French traffic control and weather systems in Europe. This seems to be an airline that cannot respond to any small issue elsewhere in Europe and then meet its timetable. In future I will either use a more expensive but reliable flat carrier or the train. The train would have been quicker all the way from Inverness to London with these delays and they pay out if just 30 minutes late whoever fault it is. The only positive was helpful cabin crew who gave people free food and drinks and dealt well with an unruly passenger and booted him off.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Basel to Funchal. I flew with my family on easyJets new cabin. It was a standard seat with no additional legroom. The flight was fully booked and four hours long, but it was fine, as the seat was very comfortable and the legroom, thanks to the thin seats, surprisingly good. The cabin was quite clean, although I didn't visit the lavatory, so I can't judge on that. The wine and olives I ordered (and payed) were excellent. The only thing that in my opinion could be improved are the tray tables. They're actually quite small and I'm sure a 15" laptop wouldn't be usable to do work or anything that requires using the keyboard. EasyJet's new inflight entertainment system "Air Time" didn't work, which was fine for me, but may have been bothersome for others. All in all the flight exceeded my expectations and was very enjoyable.

### "not fly  this company again"
Basel to Barcelona. Will not fly with this company again. They cancelled our flight only after 6 hours of making us wait even though they knew the flight was cancelled 6 hours before. Then once they told us they made us wait another 2 hours to try and get us to leave without reimbursing anyone or paying for hotels like is required. After waiting they kicked us out of the airport and did not offer another flight for 3 additional days after the original flight.

### "get your act together"
Bristol to Alicante. Return flight on the 1st July was cancelled due to French Air Traffic Controllers - not EasyJet problem , I accept that but here we are 23rd July and I am still awaiting the refund that is due. There is no way to contact EasyJet other than their chat line - I have tried regularly with expected wait times from 243 minutes to over 600 minutes. Come on EasyJet get your act together.

### "ground handlers annoys customers"
I've never had a seriously bad experience with a flight. However easyJet really must do something about the quality of their ground handling. I don't know who handles them in Vienna but we arrived to drop our bags and found the easyJet Plus counter unmanned. Thinking we were slightly early we waited. After a few minutes we were approached by a man who peremptorily ordered us to join the main queue. I refused point blank and told him as easyJet Plus customers we expected to get what we'd paid for, i.e. priority service. With no good grace he got behind the counter himself and did what he had to do so abruptly that I was surprised when our bags arrived in Edinburgh. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. At Edinburgh we landed ten minutes early and Menzies Aviation ran true to form. Firstly we came to a grinding stop on the apron because, as a clearly exasperated Captain told us, nobody had turned on the ground guidance system required for the aircraft to park on the stand. Having finally got on stand we then sat unable to deplane for almost a quarter of an hour because there were no steps. Three women with day-glo jackets and clipboards stood outside chatting, occasionally looking at the aircraft and clearly doing nothing useful. Once we eventually got off I asked a day-glo lady if the aircraft's arrival had come as a surprise to them. Well we were waiting for the steps" was the response. Gosh, you don't say. I know from this and several similar experiences that you obviously don't have enough kit or enough people to handle the aircraft you're paid to handle. Not good enough. Come on easyJet, your product is good but the incompetence of your ground handlers annoys your customers and delays your flights. This needs to be sorted out before you start losing loyal passengers.

### "I would use the airline again"
Geneva to Mallorca. Despite departing 2 hours late due to union strike action by French ATC which impacted on our flight route, the booking process, the check-in process, the communication from easyJet re the delayed departure and the actual flight - getting us there safely - was more than satisfactory and I would use the airline again. They did pretty well.

### "going from bad to worse"
Montpellier to Gatwick. Easyjet going from bad to worse. In the last month the airline has cancelled over 1000 flights in Europe due to air traffic control strikes in France. Surprisingly, other airlines were operating a normal schedule at the same time. My return flight got cancelled two days before the scheduled date, so no compensation, the next available flight was two days later. And even the rescheduled flight, departed late, after leaving all passengers queuing on the tarmac under a burning sun for 20 minutes. Luckily, I learn from my mistakes, and will not fly easyjet again.

### "operated by WDL Aviation"
Berlin Tegel to Vienna. This route was operated by WDL Aviation on behalf of easyJet, and it was a rare chance for me to check out an aircraft that is neither Boeing nor Airbus. It was a BAe 146 - Interior was relatively cramped in a 3-3 configuration, and it looked rather old overall. There was also a dead bug trapped behind the window of my seat (refer to pic below). Caught sight of the first officer for this flight, who was a young lady. Still quite an uncommon occurrence these days, even with all the gender equality. No entertainment or refreshments were available for this short hop across the border. Decent for a short point to point flight, no more no less.

### "zero customer service"
Berlin to Paris. My flight was on Thursday July 5 at 9:15. I wake up at 6 am and i was in airport at 7 am. When I went to check in I found the flight was cancelled already. Easyjet does not have desk in Berlin airport. Nobody helps us to find other flight to Paris, we were exhausted in airport for 4 hours, finally we bought train ticket from Berlin to Paris at 1:30 pm. We arrived to Paris 10:30 pm. we get to hotel 11:30. Horrible day from 6 am to midnight. I payed 160 Euro more than air plain thicket for train ticket and I lost one day of my trip to Paris. Still I did not received my money and expense of taxi and food in train station. Very unprofessional airline, zero customer service. Even we asked to call them to asked some information for refund of my money and expenses but they said Easyjet does not have phone line in airport, ridiculous.

### "will never fly again"
Me and my wife flew to Ibiza from Stansted on 5 Jul 18 for a short break 4 days. Checked in with no hassles at all, quite a easy system using the app and only carrying hand luggage. We queued to board and the check in staff where stopping I would say 1 in every 4 or five people and charging them for extra baggage if they had it even including a hand bag or a man bag. We were one of the people that got charged £47 for extra baggage, I was frustrated as three people in front of me had the same bags as me. The lady at the desk was rude and would not discuss the issue "we just had to pay". We finally got onto the plane after being charged £47. We had a good holiday and left our hotel roughly 1930 on the 8 Jul to return to UK via Ibiza airport. Again went straight through security with absolute no dramas in Spain the staff were much more polite and not looking to make a quick pound! Whilst browsing the duty free I received a notification on my phone that the flight was delayed by 1 hour, 30 mins later another flight delayed by 4 hours! then roughly 2100 flight cancelled. We left gate are and went to find the easyJet information counter, when we got there we were offered a flight three days later! Which was no good due to being back at work the next day. We explained this and were told you have to buy your own return flight if you want to go earlier. That's fine if you have a spare £500 which what it ended up costing all in. There was five easJet staff at the counter 1 lady was working and the other four were doing nothing even though there was around 200 people in the same boat. 1 working 4 doing nothing so frustrating. We managed to get on another flight via Majorca to London Luton which was 53 miles from where my car was parked. I will never fly again, stay well clear.

### "exceedingly unreliable"
Not Verified |  Copenhagen to Edinburgh. EasyJet is easily the worst airline I have ever flown on. I suppose they are cheap and you get exactly what you pay for. I have flown on 5 flights with them, 4 of which have been delayed with little to no warning or explanation. It’s exceedingly unreliable. If you book on this airline be prepared to arrive at least 2 hours after your scheduled arrival. I will never fly with them again.

### "pleasant on-board staff"
Not Verified |  By opting for a trip only with a cabin baggage, this trip was ideal. No waiting time, online check-in, plane in perfect condition, pleasant on-board staff, unbeatable price. In short, I recommend and encourage this company that I use for 20 years without any worries. En ayant opter pour un voyage uniquement avec un bagage cabine, ce voyage fut idéal. Pas de délais d'attente, enregistrement en ligne, avion en parfait état, personnel de bord agréable, prix défiant toutes concurrence. Bref, je recommande et encourage cette compagnie que j'utilise depuis 20 ans sans aucun soucis.

### "delayed after checking in"
Santorini to Gatwick delayed by 40 minutes. Worst airline ever. Been delayed after checking in both ways. Still waiting to take off on a plane that smells. Rather pay a few more ££ for a decent airline that you can rely on.

### "flights all delayed"
Naples to Luton. Me and my family had four flights with easyJet in July 2018 - all of them delayed. One of them delayed more than 3 hours which caused us missing our connecting flight. We had to then buy new tickets, £90 each. The person at the desk treated us disrespectfully when we explained our situation and talked to us as if everything that he was saying was self explanatory and he was wasting his time telling us what he was. When purchasing the tickets, he told us there were 3 seats on the plane that we could take, we only had to get our seat numbers at check-in - we weren't given them there. When boarding we were told we were stand byers and that they didn't know if there were seats for us. We were then asked to step back; when asked if we could wait beside the desk, they said no and told us to stay aside. We were the last to get on the plane, after a few calls from the staff who weren't certain if there were seats for us till the last moment. At that point the flight already had more than an hour delay. We landed at 10 pm. If none if this had happened, we would have landed just after 3 pm.

### "headache and frustration"
I had a booked a flight from Amsterdam back to London, and day of departure, happened to check my email to see that flight was cancelled. Never received a text alert or anything else, just lucky to check my email in the AM otherwise would have shown up to airport with no flight. And no reason given for the cancellation. Then the fun begin. No other flights offered, no help to get back to London. Had to spend a couple hours trying to figure out a way back and ended up taking a 6 hour train ride instead of a 1 hour flight. Wasn't able to make it to my hotel in Oxford, and due to the late cancellation, lost the money I spent on the hotel. Best part was that Easyjet only refunded me €95 out of the €250 I spend on the ticket. Can't figure that one out and am trying to get an answer from them. So I'm now out cost of hotel, cost of plane ticket, cost of train trip, and a whole day lost on my vacation. Googled to see why cancellation and found a few articles about Easyjet that shows they cancel a lot. So, yes they are a cheaper alternative if they actually fly, but most likely you will end up stuck and out of pocket with a great deal of headache and frustration.

### "lack of reliability and poor boarding organisation"
Took a multi-leg trip LTN-ZRH, BSL-AMS and AMS-LTN. On each occasion the flights were late with the delays being 70 minutes, 45 minutes and 2 hours respectively. On board staff were as helpful and apologetic as they could have been, but the impression remains of an airline that has severe organisational and punctuality issues. Information provided via their app and at the airport is inconsistent and unreliable and boarding is not well organised or pleasant with passengers being corralled into enclosures like cattle before boarding and then made to wait for an indefinite amount of time. When fees for seat reservations and hold bags are taken into account the price advantage over legacy airlines is marginal at best. Plus their lack of reliability and poor boarding organisation makes EasyJet a poor choice. If they can improve their on-time performance they might be worth considering otherwise I will give 'TardyJet' a miss in future.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Not Verified |  I had one of the worst experiences of any company ever when I attempted to fly with Easyjet. It has cost me £510, a day at Stansted airport and ruined my husband’s birthday. We arrived at the airport at 11am for a flight at 1:05pm. We checked a bag in and went to departures. After going to the allocated gate about 45mins before flight departure time we waited and were told there was a technical issue with the plane and were then told that we would need to get another plane which was due to land shortly. Then an hour at the gate with no further news. Then there was an announcement saying we should go back to the departure lounge as there was a gate change. We were taken by bus back to the departure lounge and when we looked at the screen info it flashed up that the plane would be leaving in 1 hours time and that the gate was 81. I looked online at the Easyjet flight tracker which still said that the plane was due to leave about 20mins previous to the current time so was incorrect. So we were not sure of when the plane would actually leave and thought we’d wait for announcements or info on screen in the departure lounge. We kept looking at the screen and all it ever said was ‘Gate change’. It didn’t say ‘go to gate’, ‘boarding’ or ever again an expected departure time. Then after about 1.5 hours it just disappeared off the screen. We were alarmed but there is no information desk at stansted to ask anyone what is going on. We wandered around until eventually asking someone with a walkie talkie who happened to be walking through. She called and found out that since we had been sitting there waiting for information our bag had been removed from the plane and it had left. No announcements had been made, no information on the board. We couldn’t believe it. They had taken our bag off the plane but hadn’t bothered to make an announcement calling us to the gate. There was never anything in the board saying ‘go to gate’ ‘boarding’ etc. Basically they hadn’t updated the screen info. We then experienced the worst customer service ever. After being dumped with various people with no explanation of what was going on we ended up speaking to the so called ‘manager’ at the Easyjet desk. She was woman called Rochelle who made no apology for our situation and could not have been less helpful, she treated us with utter contempt. I’ve never known such awful customer service. She said we should call the Easyjet phone line (which is actually a call centre in South Africa). We did this and they said the communication failure was something we should take up with Easyjet at the airport. But the representatives at the airport said it was nothing to do with them and there was no one we could complain to. Basically if something like this goes happens Easyjet are the absolute worst company to deal with. We were left unable to speak to anyone- everyone just said it wasn’t their responsibility. The awful Rochelle at one point said she didn’t actually really work for Easyjet but another company called Stobarts. So if some mistake is made at the airport you can’t complain, you lose your money and get no apology. I lost over £500 on the lost flights and holiday, it ruined my husband’s birthday and we were treated so poorly by Easyjet staff. The previous flight I got with Easyjet was delayed by 5 hours with no apology too. It’s a big mistake to choose this airline. I will never book a flight with them again.

### "pathetic and bad"
Milan Malpensa to Paris CDG. Flight cancelled and re-booked for the next day. Even on the next day the flight was late more than 1 hour. I lost a whole day of work. Reason given: staff had been working more than allowed?! As if easyJet doesn't know when their flights are scheduled - this happens when companies only look at costs. I am a weekly commuter between Milan and Paris. Out of my last 60 flights 36 were delayed by at least 30/40 minutes. That is pathetic and bad. If one adds the recurrently chaotic boarding procedures (CDG is the worst), and the terrible F&B offering on board, the ridiculous excuses given by ground staff (always given pretty late ie sometimes 1 hour after notices have been sent by the app), and customer service that doesn’t give a damm as not answering emails and complaints...I’d be tempted to say easyJet is the worst airline I know. But seemingly management doesn’t really care as on this route there are very little alternatives.

### "Up your game EasyJet"
Late again. I guess you get what you pay for, but nowadays easyJet isn’t really any cheaper than the rest. It’s 10:55 and we’re still boarding. The plane was meant to leave an hour ago. Today, I’m annoyed enough to write a bad review for EasyJet because the train I booked will no longer be running when we touch down. Of the 9 EasyJet flights I have taken this year, 7 have been late by more than an hour. Up your game EasyJet! Your jam packed time tables aren’t realistic.

### "really enjoyed my flight"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Venice. I usually don't fly low cost airlines because I never trust them but I really enjoyed my flight with EasyJet. I downloaded my boarding pass from the easyjet mobile app, which works extremely well! They called us at the gate about an hour early and they gathered all the passengers in the rather small gate area where we had to wait quite a long time, which was rather annoying. Boarding started and I was the first on the plane thanks to speedy boarding, which I think is really worth the extra money. I was initially worried that boarding would have been absolute chaos but in the end the staff at the gate were very professional and the boarding procedure was really organized. The cabin crew and both pilots were extremely nice and friendly and the atmosphere onboard was very relaxed. Food and drink isn't too expensive and they have a really good selection. The new plane was clean, it had good leather seats and legroom was actually quite good so it was very confortable. Will definitely consider flying EasyJet again!

### "lost my aisle seat "
Milan to Berlin. Glad they announced free seating once I got onboard, lost my aisle seat in exchange for a middle seat. No point in a seat reservation system if you don’t follow through with it. Seat sized for people probably below 50 kg. Probably wouldn’t fly this airline again.

### "not my first choice"
I was flying from Gatwick to Munich with EasyJet. Departure was delayed for more than an hour, arrival was 50 minutes behind schedule but that can always happen. It would have been great to turn on the AC while we waited doors closed on the tarmac and to make at least some announcements. I did reserve a seat in the emergency exit row (window) and had speedy boarding. Even the emergency exit row was narrow and I felt cramped, it may have slightly more legspace but it is still not good. Furthermore, since everybody else boarded when the speedy boarding announcement was made this is no advantage. As expected no free drinks/water/food during the flight. No weight restrictions on hand luggage, though. Verdict: Not enough space. Will try to avoid EasyJet in the future. Round-trip flight was 100€ cheaper than competitors and I actually need to go to somewhere close to Gatwick, but not my first choice in the future.

### "product is basic but acceptable"
AMS-LTN and LGW-AMS. I realised that the outbound flight was very tight and tried to change it but found that it was cheaper to book a second flight giving me the option of two - illogical but no more so than some railway journeys. The easyJet product is basic but acceptable - the aircraft was clean and the cabin crew friendly. I did not pay for allocated seating - the randomised seating that you get is a bit annoying. My main complaint is about the queuing. The outbound flight was delayed by 25 minutes. This is understandable, there were slot restrictions into AMS, but there the delay was not put on the screen seven though easyJet must have known about it and the gate closed before the plane actually got to the stand with passengers left to wait (fortunately in the gate). Don't think that you will get on a delayed flight if you are running late. There was a delay at LTN because the entry gate would not open and everyone had to wait on the apron although this was presumably down to the airport. The return flight was fine - we actually arrived on the gate a few minutes early and I wisely decided to remain seated and be the one of the last to leave the gate, given that the airline has allocated seating, having seen people waiting in lines on the ramp. I cannot complain having paid £61 for three flights, two of which I used but the product of better legacy carriers is superior.

### "barely enough space"
I flew from Munich to London-Gatwick with easyjet. The big advantage about easyjet is that there is no weight limit for hand luggage. There are restrictions on the dimensions. I reserved a seat in the emergency exit row and speedy boarding. Even sitting in the emergency exit row I had barely enough space and felt cramped. The seat was really uncomfortable and even for such a short flight not recommendable. A different airline would have been 50% more expensive (about 100€ for the roundtrip) for same dates and slightly better times. Next time I will think twice before booking the cheapest flight. As expected no free onboard service. Boarding was okay. easyjet uses the old terminal (T1) at Munich and flies to Gatwick instead on Heathrow.

### "provides good value for money"
CPH-LGW with easyJet is easily one of the best airines in Europe. Great direct destinations, mainline airports served, friendly crew and stress-free overall experience. With legacy carriers like BA having cut many amenities including complimentary food and crew that are at best indifferent - easyJet have the right product mix that provides good value for money. Even their buy-on-board food is reasonably priced (in this case cheaper than Copenhagen Airport) and excellent quality, and delivered quickly and efficiently. My preferred airline in Europe now!

### "left high and dry"
Berlin to Vienna. Do not fly on this airline. My flight was scheduled to depart Berlin Tegel at 9:15 PM. To make a very long story short, at 11:15 PM, after receiving no information as to why we were waiting and waiting, we were finally informed that the flight had been cancelled. But the real issue I have with easyJet (what an ironic name) is that, at that point, they simply told us they couldn't help us any further. In other words, at midnight, after sitting in the airport for hours and hours, we were now left on our own to find a hotel and find another flight. It was simply incredible. We were all left high and dry, scrambling to get ourselves out of a terrible situation the airline had put us in. I did find a hotel and another flight the next day, which, together with the taxi rides, cost me around EUR 400. That's in addition to the money I spend for the original flight. I still haven't heard anything from them. Just unbelievable.

### "delayed for another 2 hours"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Vienna. At the check in I was not allowed to take my handbag with me because it counts as a second hand luggage. The first 5-10 people were allowed to take their bags with them, which seems very unfair. After already waiting for about half an hour to enter the plane I found bread crumbs and hair on my seat and the window was and full of finger prints. Apparently the flight got delayed for one hour because one of the stewardesses got sick and her standby flight attendant wasn’t around. If that wasn’t enough the flight got delayed for another 2 hours, which means I had to spend 5 hours in the airplane for a flight that should only take one and a half hours. Because I obviously did not expect such a long delay I did not bring any food with me, and I had to buy the expensive food on the plane.

### "one hour later than scheduled"
21.55 flight from Paris to Luton. Flight delayed as staff unable to disembark two wheelchair assistance passengers from aircraft at CDG as no wheelchairs available. After 45 minutes one wheelchair was located and first wheelchair passenger disembarked, the second passenger got off plane 20 minutes later. My flight left one hour later than scheduled due to delay on previous flight disembarking. I'm surprised that there is not sufficient wheelchair assistance for customers at a busy international airport. I'm not concerned about Easyjet. I'm concerned poor facilities at ChDG airport will impact on disabled wheelchair assistance passengers.

### "No reimbursement received"
Gibraltar to Manchester flight cancelled on 22 April. We were a party of 9 (myself, my partner, 3 step kids and 4 of their friends). No assistance from easyJet ground crew in finding alternate transport, hotels, meals etc. Managed to get a flight from Malaga to Doncaster for the 7 kids, and Malaga to Southampton (we live in the Midlands, near Stafford, so not ideal) for myself and my partner both departing the next day. This really was the very best we could get. EasyJet emailed on 7 May (and in doing so have entered a contract) to confirm they would be paying the kids expenses claim amounting to £609.63: Alternate transport £216.63 Hotel £180.34 (one time gesture of goodwill) Meal £141.69 (one time gesture of goodwill) Transfers £70.97 No reimbursement as promised has been received. I also put in another expenses claim for myself and my partner. No reimbursement for this has been received either. Judging by the number of complaints and cancelled flights, I don’t know how they manage to keep flying.

### "avoid using their services on the weekends"
Our flight was cancelled and we had to arrange our own flight back to London and accommodation. Easyjet then expect you to fill out an online form to claim your expenses back! This was a flight back to London on Sunday, meaning everyone had work to return to but couldn’t do so because easyjet just seem to take bookings without taking into account all the most important factors. The weather was perfectly fine, but they used the weather in France as an excuse to cancel a flight on Sunday night! The accommodation was sorted out by easyJet using their app on your phone, but we had to wait around like clowns for a shuttle bus, only to be taken far away from city central but close enough to the airport! We had to wait around while having nothing interesting to do because the hotel they arranged was situated near a motor way system. Please avoid using their services on the weekends because you will suffer alot if they cancel your flight and you’re left stranded in a foreign country unprerpared for this sort of scenario.

### "did not even acknowledge me"
Awful service, didn’t even get greeted at the entrance. No staff offered to help elderly get their luggage in the overhead lockers. All cabin space filled up quickly and while everyone struggled to decide what was happening, people had to walk back off with their suitcases. Then the two staff (including the staff manager) did not organise themselves very well and my child that struggled with her ears couldn’t even get a drink. They stopped serving food and drink as we were descending. Didn’t think to ask if they could offer a closed bottle of water, did not even acknowledge me or apologise or see if we were ok. Ridiculous service and a bunch that don’t know how to organise themselves. Budget service or not, it’s a service that was paid for.

### "canceled hours before the flight took off"
We were informed that our easyJet flight from London to Copenhagen was canceled hours before the flight took off. We were asked to use the online system which told us we were to queue while they found an hotel for us for more than 4 hours. In that time we went from being 14th in line to 6th in line. We never got a hotel (by the time we booked our own the prices had gone up and options were almost none). The next flight option was 3 days later, I had to buy new tickets for two people with another airline.

### "may offload your hold baggage"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Faro. This is a warning, if you are flying EasyJet be aware that they may offload your hold baggage if the aircraft is allegedly overweight. When the cabin staff say that they have taken off a couple of bags also be aware, this means that half the passengers bags have been removed and left behind. When told your bags are on the next flight and will be delivered to you that night  be aware that this means possibly the next day. If you have hand luggage, pack a spare set of clothing if possible. We departed Gatwick yesterday after being delayed an hour, before takeoff we were informed a couple of bags had been taken off due to the plane being overweight. On arrival at Faro airport we discover half of the passengers bags have been offloaded. Although easyJet knew this was happening before we took off there was no representative at arrivals who could help. After queueing at lost and found for over an hour we were told that the bags would be sent as soon as the arrived and as soon as they had the means to deliver them, it turns out that 40 bags were offloaded. Still waiting.

### "customer service unimportant"
London to Barcelona. Our flight was cancelled which wasn’t too much of a surprise however communication from easyJet staff was sadly lacking. Passengers were more or less left to their own devices! They offered us a flight to the UK which was no where near our home and no public transport was available at the hour the flight landed. The whole experience was very unpleasant and the airline clearly rate customer service as unimportant. In this day and age it is simply not acceptable. I definitely won’t be flying easyJet again.

### "Never flying Easyjet again"
This flight back to Gatwick was 8 hours late. After 4 hours not only the easy jet gate attendant but the easy jet app was telling us that the flight would arrive within 15 minutes. After that it suddenly went back to arriving another 3.5 hours later. When we looked into it we realised the aircraft still hadn't left London so clearly they know there was no way it would arrive within 15 minutes. The gate attendant said "it would appear on the radar any time now" This was worse than no communication with their passengers. We were deliberately mislead. Never flying Easyjet again.

### "No more easyJet for me"
Luton to Munich. Think twice before booking. During one month we've had three flights canceled! I was going to think that two first ones were just a streak of bad luck, but the latest was pure negligence. The Friday flight was canceled and we were offered a replacement flight on Monday. In complete disregard of our return flight booked also with easy jet, which is due before we were scheduled to land on a replacement flight! The return ticket was neither changed, nor refunded. In short, due to easyJet canceling a flight, not only did we lose the weekend, but also they didn't refund the trip! And this is the third cancellation this month! Enough said. No more easyJet for me.

### "very, very unimpressed"
❌ Not Verified |  Malaga to Bristol. Return flight from Malaga booked with Easyjet. We were told when booking in our flight was cancelled. No alternative flight was offered other than a return to a different UK airport 4 days later. I was advised by disinterested staff to find another flight home on the internet. I had no phone, and no internet as a result. I have now managed to find another return flight. My main gripes are: 1. Staff disinterested 2. Easyjet are supposed to offer accommodation and transport while sorting another flight - none of these were forthcoming. 3. As a woman I my own I am stranded in a foreign city with limited money and no idea of how I am returning home with no attempt at help from Easyjet. In short, very, very unimpressed.

### "not a good experience"
London to Geneva. The flight crew was nice. Let me just say this has nothing to do with them. Out flight was delayed. I had been traveling for 24 hours, we were delayed on the tarmac for 45 min. Then I went to lay my head down and my tray table was covered in old food. Just gross. There was no food because catering was delayed as well. Overall not a good experience.

### "first class treatment"
Luton to Pisa. I would like to take this opportunity to thank EasyJet for the first class treatment my wife received from a cabin staff after she passed out mid flight to Pisa on 19th May due to low blood sugar. Staff was so helpful and brought her round so quickly, congratulations on the way staff are trained. The staff on the outward and inward flights were the best we have encountered.

### "it ends up in the hold"
❌ Not Verified |  Flew Luton to Valencia. I have consistently flown with easyJet, however every time I go with just hand luggage it ends up in the hold despite the fact that when I board the plane there is plenty of space. It really frustrates me.

### "Planes are old and dirty"
❌ Not Verified |  Flew easyJet from Gatwick to Zurich. Expect to pay almost as much as your ticket for baggage fees. Planes are old and dirty. Our flight left 30 minutes late with perfect weather conditions. Not recommended. The one positive thing was friendly staff.

### "Amsterdam to Luton"
Amsterdam to Luton. Excellent service by EasyJet despite issues with the airport. I was supposed to fly with EasyJet from Amsterdam to Luton on the day when the Schiphol Airport was hit by a huge power outage that affected all flights on that day. Like a lot of other morning flights, EasyJet's flight was also cancelled due to the issues at the airport. The next available flight was 2 days later as all other flights were booked out due to the cancellations. While I was really frustrated with the situation, EasyJet did all they could to ensure our 2 extra days in Amsterdam were comfortable. They put us up in a hotel on the first day and offered the option to reimburse our stay/meals/transportation on the second day. We really appreciate this especially as the circumstances were outside their control.

### "staff couldn’t care less"
On may 22nd me and my friend were meant to fly from Paris to Luton at 21:55 .On our way to the airport the flight was cancelled, when we got to the airport there was one lady from easyjet dealing with at least 100 angry customers. When we got to the front of her queue we asked what we should do, she told us to apply for accommodation and a new flight. We were put on a waiting list (number 60) for accommodation and were told to wait for an email telling us where we could go. We waiting the entire night in the airport with no where to sleep and no food places were open so the €18 vouchers they gave us were utterly useless! Very unhappy had no sleep and the staff couldn’t care less!

### "it was great value for money"
Manchester to Munich. For the cost of this ticket it was great value for money. Apart from the horrendous screening and waiting around at Manchester airport, I found the whole experience with Easyjet pleasant and enjoyable. Check in, seat allocation and speedy boarding all worked well. I just took on a carry on bag and had no issues finding space. Pre booked an up front seat which was surprisingly spacious. Flight was on time and crew were pleasant and efficient. For what I paid, there was nothing to complain about.

### "friendly and approachable staff"
Amsterdam to Gatwick. Flew with easyJet on an evening departure. With the current French ATC strikes, the departure was delayed by an hour - outside of the airline control. Thanks to the work of the crew and ground staff we left Amsterdam just 30 minutes late and ended up landing at Gatwick, 1 minute early. Friendly and approachable staff as ever and a very reasonable fare. Would highly recommend, easyJet - rarely have a problem when travelling with them.

### "service is usually okay"
Berlin to Mallorca. The service is usually okay. I lost an item on board though and their procedure is useless. EasyJet send you to another service, that leads you to somewhere in the UK (my flight was only from Germany to Spain), so the route doesn't make sense. When asking about it, on social media, I received no explanation, no further investigation. EasyJet only keep on ignoring passengers who they can't provide an answer to.

### "I must check my bag in"
Luxembourg to Gatwick. Arrived with little time to mess about and approached security with boarding pass to be told that as the flight was fully booked I must check my bag in unless I'm one of their premium customers. Whole point of not checking a bag in is that you avoid a long delay at the other end. Normally they say if you can't fit the bag overhead then it goes under the seat. Very annoying as I'm not a UK Citizen so already have a long delay at passport control on bank holiday to look forward to.

### "not allowed on this flight"
Gatwick to Larnaca. We was in traffic for 6 hours to get to the airport as there was accident on the roads so was difficult to get here. We got to the airport at 14:15 and the flight departed at 14:50. The easyjet staff at check in was no help to get us to the aircraft on time, we got through security and ran the length of the airport to get there 10 minutes before - to be turned away because everyone had already boarded. At least 15 people were not allowed on this flight and told the next flight would be the next afternoon. No one helped or tried to contact the gate to mention there were many people late because of the traffic. All easyjet staff were abrupt and didn’t seem to care or want to help us. We lost a lot of money and had to rebook four flights, not with easyJet.

### "treated like cattle"
Just had the worst flight experience ever from Munich to London. I do not travel on EasyJet very often, and I won't fly on it again. It appears if you are over 6 feet, it is not the airline for you. There was no seat elevation once flying, no leg room to speak of, my legs were stuck one way or the other, my brother who is even taller (6' 4"), had his knees in the passage. There is what we call Budget, and there is Cattle Class! This was cattle class. It was also £70 more for the same destination than Lufthansa, which my daughter tells me had more leg room and drinks were included. My back was aching through the following night, and I do not have back trouble, until now. I was farming once, and know now what it feels like to be treated like cattle in a stock-pen. Dreadful. Staff were good despite everything, but then so was I, as a farmer who looked after my herd to the best of my ability. How air travel has descended.

### "I will never use easyJet again"
Milan to Santiago. It was simply an incredibly undesirable experience. From user unfriendly website to having to pay for my carry on bag, I can confidently say that I will never use easyJet again. Customer experience really means nothing to his company.

### "it was a nice flight"
Pula to Hamburg. At the airport in Pula we checked in. The staff were friendly but a bit unorganized. We got our boarding passes and then we went to the gate. Our flight was on time so the boarding procedure was quick. The cabin was OK not so clean but acceptable. The seat was comfortable. I bought a sandwich that was good and fresh. With a delay we arrived in Hamburg. All in all it was a nice flight.

### "delayed 8/10 times"
London to Geneva. I just want to share my experience over the past few years. During that period my flights have been delayed 8/10 times. Mostly they were evening flights and the average delay is about 90 mins. Avoid if you can. I'll never fly again with this company.

### "40 min delay was acceptable"
I found the Eastjet website to be clear and user-friendly. I booked a flight from Catania to Naples and was very pleased with the efficient bag-drop and friendly and helpful ground staff. Boarding was slightly delayed as two blind passengers needed assistance. I noted though that only one staff member went out of his way to help the blind passengers. Far too much hand-luggage was allowed aboard the flight and it was a concern that the cockpit door was left open for quite some time as the pilot chatted with various people. I bought a drink and the cabin crew member walked away without rendering the change. I had to call one of his colleagues and even then I was given the wrong change and had to challenge it. No apology was received. Disembarkation was quite well managed and the although there was a 40 min delay it was acceptable. Easyjet competes well with full service airlines and I shall consider flying with them again.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
This is more advice for fellow passengers than review since we all know how terrible this airline is. We were meant to fly from Lisbon to Funchal for our vacation, the flight was canceled, they kept us waiting for 3 hours before giving any information. They said bad weather was the cause, other flights managed to land though so this wasn’t the case, we then waited in another line for 6 hours whilst 600 people were being seen by 1 member of staff, who after getting to the help desk denied working for the airline and said she’d didnt have information for us an we should request a refund (please never do this as they aren’t liable for client care ie no money for hotels or new flight). They couldn’t put us on a flight until a week later which was past the date we flew home, we booked into a hotel for two nights after already paying in Madeira, the next flight was $500 more, after contacting them their response was the same as the help desk, no refund will be given nor will they help with accommodations, 20 of us in the same situation all receiving this outrageous information. Absolutely horrible experience cost us $1200 as result and a flat out refusal for reimbursement! Never again easyJet!

### "always very late"
Munich to London. The worst airline ever. Always very late, smelly toilets, broken seats but at least employees are very polite! Very disappointed and I hope never have to travel with this terrible airline again.

### "they had lost their bag"
Luton to Tel Aviv. I had heard bad reports about easyJet to say the least but I was prepared to give them a chance and be fair minded. On departure from Tel Aviv I was crammed into an Airport shuttle bus to take me to the plane. My seat location on the aircraft meant that I was pushed into by crew and other passengers. On arrival at Luton I found out that they had lost their bag. No apology from easyJet whatsoever. Ground staff took their time to file a report and I used £5 of mobile phone to liase with my brother for pick up because of the mess. After six days into the trip I still don't know where my bag is or when I will get it back. Thumbs down to this unprofessional and incompetent airline.

### "did not receive any email"
Amsterdam to Milan Linate. When I bought the ticket, it said that the departure time was 14:05. However, a day before a flight I checked-in and the time on the ticket was 16:55. I did not receive any email notifying me of the changes and I had to check airport departures to make sure which time was the right one. When I arrived to the airport, it was announced that the flight as delayed by 2 hours. It is very difficult to trust and plan when using easyJet.

### "the friendliest crew"
Gatwick to Madrid. I was so lucky to have been on board this flight with the friendliest crew I’ve met. They helped me so much with my 6 month old baby and I will never forget this. Thank you to everyone on this flight.

### easyJet customer review
Liverpool to Larnaca. I think that our recent experience clearly illustrates the difference companies like easyJet have made as far as foreign travel is concerned: we have just had a very enjoyable week’s holiday in Cyprus for less than it cost for just the flights on our first visit there over 30 years ago. On that occasion we were going to stay with friends and to reach Cyprus as “cheaply” as possible we had to drive to Heathrow, stay overnight and then travel via Budapest with a seven-hours’ layover in the airport there. Last week we had an hour’s drive to Liverpool and direct flights for two of us for a total of just over £140! We were not sure how we would cope with flights lasting 5 hours each way, as we normally restrict ourselves to 3 hours or less, but we equipped ourselves with plenty to occupy the time and the journeys were relatively painless. Both flights departed and arrived pretty promptly, cabin staff worked hard and efficiently without going over the top and the cockpit crews kept us informed. The plane on the outward journey had the new-style seats which we do not find particularly supportive though they were tolerable, but we were more comfortable on the return flight with the older, more thickly padded seats. Possibly the boarding procedure could have been handled better at Larnaca, but that might have been dictated by the airport rather than easyJet staff. One thing in particular struck me: the totally calm atmosphere on both flights – everyone seemed to be engrossed in or by whatever entertainment they had brought with them to pass the time, an indication perhaps that most clients know what to expect on an easyJet flight and are content with easyJet services, even if they do not bother to say so.

### "such an unprofessional company"
Missed flight from Berlin to Rome due to ticket counter man saying we purchased the baggage package for sports equipment instead of baggage. He sent us to the insanely long customer service line. In line I realized I could upgrade the baggage myself. I did so in 30 seconds and went back to him letting him know I had done this showing him receipt proof. He said I still needed to stand in the customer service line and get confirmation from them. I went back to the line and finally after 1 hour of waiting all he did was print a reciept that I already had on my phone. Finally when I got back to the check in counter they told me check in was closed and that I couldn’t get a refund and they wouldn’t put me on another flight. Later I checked my original baggage package I had purchased and I did not get the sports equipment package. I should’ve been put through the first time and let on my flight. They made me wait 2 hours total, pay additional money for a luggage package that was correct in the first place and waste 226 euros and most importantly made us lose our day in Rome and the hotel that we had already paid for. I’ve never seen such an unprofessional company in my life and would never recommend easyJet to anyone!

### "would have to pay 47 euros"
Basel to Hamburg. Drop-in luggage. Rude staff. Got permission to get my big baggage from Hamburg with hand-free luggage. Since it was only 10kg. And said to start with, we did not want the baggage because we could easily bring it in a bag. And they said we could do the same from Basel. But they were against it and would have to pay 47 euros. If we had the bag from Hamburg we did not have that problem at all. Now we left our luggage here and took things in a bag. It was a little bit bigger than cabin luggage. And less than 10kg. Also they would have 47euro. We had no handbag on the trip.

### "inconsiderate or idle"
Porto to Bristol. No Communication. Flight considerably delayed not only from previous airport but the one before that. Given that Easyjet knew this they only advised this well after they asked us to go to the gate. This delay was not put up in the departures display. How inconsiderate or idle.

### "law allows them to separate the children"
Bristol to Malaga. I checked on line 5 days before our departure. Unfortunately I did not realise that my son who is 4 years old was allocated a seat separated from me from the aisle. Once there, I asked the steward if there was anything he could do, since my son starting crying and was refusing to sit next to a stranger and fasten his belt. The steward told me that if I wanted that I should have checked in a month in advance (!) or pay extra! He added that the law allows them to separate the children! Well if there is any law that allows that it should clearly be changed! Thankfully other passengers offered their place and we managed to sit close, but I found this very upsetting and the steward's answer unhelpful. On our way back, at the boarding point families with young children were offered to board with priority, but then they ask us to pay extra to sit close to our children? Is this what EasyJet considers as family care? Or in our society you need to pay for everything! On their website they advertise their service where by paying you can sit close to the people you care most, and the motto is"easyjet generation". Appaling!

### "personally thank the crew"
I flew from Glasgow to Malaga with my wife on 9th January. I had been ill with influenza, but thought I had recovered sufficiently. I had not! I was taken ill on the flight and passed out. The crew were magnificent with their care of me - when I came ‘round, they were administering oxygen, water and had allayed my wife’s fears. When we reached Malaga, the paramedics were doctors etc waiting at airport and they too, provided exemplary care. Happily, I was able to continue with my holiday! I have always loved Easyjet and fly with them approximately twice each month. I would like to personally thank the crew and I am ashamed it has taken me so long to write!

### "top rate service"
Alicante to Bristol. Cannot fault easyJet. Flight cancelled on 2 March because of the weather conditions in UK. We were put up in hotel Melia Alicante till 5 March. There were passengers of other airlines that were left to fend for themselves, not very good if you had no money. Thank you easyJet for top rate service.

### "she has no humanity at all"
Berlin to Madrid. This company used to be very good, I always preferred to travel with them than with Ryanair, but this it's no longer like that. Yesterday, one person of the company don't let me go into the plane because I was 1 minute late. The plane was there with the stairs, but she didn't let me in. 15 minutes later the plane take off without me. I was 1 minute late but she has no humanity at all. Next time I will choose a company without robots.

### "This company is a disaster"
Flew easyJet from Geneva to London Stansted. Horrible airline, the prices are low but the service is terrible. No information given to passengers 5 min before departing, no one at the station. It is the last time I will be taking an easyJet flight! Acknowledging other prices of other airline companies, it is better to pay more, at least there will some sort of service. This company is a disaster.

### "A fantastic airline"
Belfast to Luton. A fantastic airline. No fuss organised and good customer service. My partner and I had return flights from Belfast to Luton and were treated very well. The weather on the return flight was terrible and our flight was only delayed for an hour. Thanks you guys for such an easy flight.

### "prefer easyJet over Ryanair"
Milan Linate to Amsterdam. EasyJet again proves to be a good low-cost airline. Most easyJet-flights from Milan depart form Malpensa, 50 kms north of town, but some flights, like mine, use the much closer Linate. The boarding started early and was only delayed by late passengers. The very friendly Dutch crew was efficient. Good information from the cockpit, announcements in English, Dutch and Italian and reasonably priced drinks. Legroom so-so, but that's the LCC-style. Landed 15 mins ahead of schedule in Amsterdam. Definitely prefer easyJet over Ryanair.

### "creating a fun atmosphere"
Southend to Alicante. Flight date 26/02:18 7am. I have flown with easyJet many times but had to say the crew that catered for us on the early Alicante bound flight were extra ordinary, creating a fun atmosphere, the two hour flight just literally flew by.

### "Very impressed with easyJet"
Flew Tenerife South to Southend. Very impressed with easyJet both outbound and return. The seat was comfortable with adequate leg room for the 4 hour journey. In-flight service was friendly and efficient and the information from the cockpit was first class. Both sectors were punctual. The food and drinks served were tasty and reasonably priced. I was very impressed overall.

### "We had an effortless journey"
easyJet is is easily the best short-haul airline within Europe, especially as BA has cut inglight amenities without reducing their prices. We had an effortless journey from London Southend to Malta - the plane was clean and the seats comfortable enough for short journey. However it was the staff that made the difference, my partner left some duty-free a gift for his nephew in the terminal, he was a bit upset, but the cabin crew co-ordinating with the excellent and helpful Stobart Aviation ground staff managed to track it down in albeit a small terminal and retrieve it for him. This felt above and beyond and certainly more than I would have expected from an LCC. Both flights were uneventful, and we landed early on both occasions including a full 45 minute ahead of schedule on the return journey. If I was to be really picky, I would say the boarding experience could be better planned from Southend as it means standing in a cold although sheltered caged area for sometime before being allowed on to the plane and then having to go out in the open as there are no air-bridges at Southend Airport.

### "one of the most pleasant flights"
Edinburgh to Luton, last flight of the day. The flight was delayed for over an hour but I was happy to find out that I was flying on the new A320 NEO. The cabin looks exactly like the older version of the A320, however there is almost no engine noise, which made this flight one of the most pleasant flights I've had over the last years. Overall uneventful, except for the arrival in Luton, which is another story.

### "You get what you pay for"
EasyJet for sure is a Low Cost Carrier. You get what you pay for. The flight from London to Munich was completely full and it’s not particularly used for business traveling. Everyone is bringing a carry on bag and the EasyJet staff are very strict about their regulations (you get what you pay), they check it at the gate. The seats are quite narrow, but I’d say for short distance flights it’s ok. Also the staff seems to be pretty young.

### "No reason, no explanation was given"
Flew Manchester to Santorini. Simply put this was the worst service I have ever encountered when flying. When waiting to go home (in the hot sun with a 3 year old) we had to wait in excess of 3 hours while the airport authorities tried to get 37 volunteers not to fly. No reason, no explanation was given. Chaos ensued. No representative from the airline was present, instead, the airline left the announcement and the dealing with how to sort out frustrated, tired, ill, and angry passengers. The airport staff were poorly behaved, rude, threatening both physically and with the police. Apparently, after boarding (eventually) we were told that a member of the crew had fallen ill. This, according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. Problems occur, yes. But the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. Compensation was offered for volunteers. But, no guarantee of a flight back within a week was given. So compensation meant nothing. Those who did choose compensation had real difficulties getting back to their connecting airports. The compensation did not cover, car parking, food, hotel accommodation etc., loss of earnings, connecting flights. easyJet simply did not handle this very well. It appears this is frequent occurrence. The airport staff told us too! I shall not fly with easyJet again. Simply put, they did not care about their customers. Proof - no apology, no announcements, and they did not have one of their staff step off the plane to come and explain. This would have helped a lot. No food or drinks on the return flight too! Rubbish. Makes Ryanair look like one of the best services!

### "last experience has been appalling"
Liverpool to Madrid. Our last experience with Easyjet has been appalling. We got our tickets a month ago but when trying to check in the night before the flight, it turned out that there are no seats left on the plane for us! We arrived super early on the day and were told that easyjet oversells the seats and that we were 'standby passangers'. We had to wait for everyone to board and for the crew to check if anyone did not arrive, leaving empty seats (empty, but paid for!). Stressing over not getting there for a close relative's birthday, the money lost that we paid for the hotel, wasted holiday day booked off work are just the beginning of it. People must know that when they think they are getting seats on the plane, they are only really getting a possibility of a seat. We were absolutely appalled with the fact that the company got paid twice for our seats (my wife sat in the place of someone who did not travel due to serious sickness discovered very recently, as his friends told her and both her and the friends of that person were disgusted that easyjet would not accept refunds but will happily pass that seat to someone else who paid the same money and should have their own seat). We don't understand why getting the ticket and seat is not treated a contract, but instead easyjet 'has the right' to cancel it last minute and tell you that you are not going on the plane for which you bought the ticket, not due to weather or technical problems but as a result of their greed. What a terrible example of customer service! It's unbelievable in 21st century and it has to change or we should all change the airline we use.

### "missed the baggage drop cut-off"
Munich to Berlin. I missed the baggage drop cut-off by a minute and staff weren't willing to assist in any way to help us to get onto the flight. Shocking service and there is hidden costs on everything. When we went to try and get the problem solved it cost us 220 Euros just to get our flights rescheduled. We paid extra for baggage online which hasn't even left the airport which was charged from our cards.

### "Very poor planning"
Gatwick to Funchal. Very poor planning. They made all passengers to queue and wait in the rain when it is 5 degree Celsius with strong winds. There is an elderly couple in their 80s in front of me who stood for over half an hour outside in the wind and rain waiting to be boarded.

### "we would be transferred compensation"
Munich to Luton in August 2017. Weexperienced an overnight delay which resulted in a cancellation due to lightning strike, a new aircraft was flown from Italy to fly us back to Luton. There was one ground staff dealing with departures and arrivals at Munich airport, so as you can imagine, passengers had no idea what was going on and when we would be flying, or where we would be staying over night. The second flight was delayed by a further 5 hours 44 minutes due to technical issues (confirmed in an email). According to the EU Regulation 261/2004, we were entitled to €250 per passenger due to the delay being over three hours. It took over 4 compensation claim forms for easyJet to even respond, even then saying that we were eligible for compensation and that the money would be in our account within 15 days, it wasn’t. Phoned easyJet to get an update and see what was happening. We were then told that the second flight was delayed further due to the lightning strike. Having been in contact with some passengers on the same flight, many had already received the compensation and so I proceeded to explain this to them. He then apologised and said it was an error, and the money would be in the account within 21 day, it wasn’t. Again phoned customer service to be updated, in which I was told that the second flight was a ‘gifted free transfer’, and so compensation could not be claimed. I proceeded to explain that we had been told twice previous that we would receive the compensation. I was told this was by error and that we would not be receiving anything. I then phoned back to finally resolve the issue, and having spoken to her line manager, out of courtesy we would be transferred the compensation. Whether or not we will actually receive it this time I don’t know.

### "really great value for money"
Geneva to Birmingham, For a low-cost airline (given their reputation), this experience was alright. They allowed a great deal of luggage weight, for a price mind. They even offered us the chance to put our wheeled hand luggage items (of which there were many) in the hold, which was a nice touch. An even better touch was offering FREE in-flight WiFi on the return flight, although that limits you to their own website in partnership with Rakuten, so I wouldn't bother with doing anything else. Overall, this was one of the better low-cost airlines I've flown, really great value for money.

### "Another very good trip with easyJet"
Another very good trip with easyJet. Both at Liverpool and Palma boarding was organised efficiently and promptly, with Speedy Boarders first on and off the transfer buses. Cabin crews worked hard and the pilots kept us informed of progress. Both flights landed early. Any problems which arose were caused by those passengers who think that rules or requests are for others, not themselves, and in the process make things more difficult for both staff and their fellow passengers. We had the usual suspects ignoring the repeated advice not to put small items in the overhead lockers, so that cabin crews then spent time tactfully trying to rearrange items to allow more trundle bags to be accommodated. On the outward journey a group wearing the kit of "UK cycle team" were talking so loudly during the safety briefing that one of the stewardesses actually shouted "Please pay attention". On the return journey one of the first passengers to board at the rear of the plane then proceeded to put her bag down in the aisle to open it and take out various items, completely oblivious of the queue held up behind her. I wouldn't mind betting that such people would be the first to complain about poor service or inconsiderate staff.

### "always a breeze flying with easyJet"
Flew Funchal to Lisbon. It is always a breeze flying with easyJet, departures and arrivals are on schedule, the cabin crew are very professional and its product is very trustworthy. Many flag companies could learn from them. They are market aware and don't charge you any more or less than what they actually and ultimately deliver to you. A highly recommended low cost company.

### "rude and unfair staff"
So when I arrived at Bristol airport I realised that my hand luggage was slightly oversized purely due to the wheels (my fault but I have used it to fly with easyJet as hand luggage before and for Jet2 as well). I queued up to speak to someone about what to do and she took a few minutes to decide but after seeing my case wouldn't fit in the example box she said not to worry, that it was ok and charged me £5 instead of £47. There were a family who were infront of us who were 70 kilos over or weighed 70 kilos so had to cough up £70 there and then, so it was like they were picking and choosing who they would charge and what. Anyway, I was so relieved and happy, got on the plane all the cabin staff were really polite, helpful, friendly and the flight was fine. However on the way home, we arrived at the airport 2 hours early, all checked in online before hand too, we went to the gate on time to get ready to board but there was a huge queue so we walked 1 minute down the airport to a loo quickly. When we got back we were at the front of the queue and there were 2 girls who were meant to check our boarding passes/ID and before even saying hello or waiting for the person infront of me to walk onwards one of the girls shouted 'can you check that case, that looks massive' then looked up and me and said 'that's going to be £47, not even a hello or a please'. I obviously said how it was okay on the way and how I'd used it before with easyJet and Jet2 and she actually said 'well you havent' and I said well I have! Was ridiculous! Then they tried to tell us we were late, when we'd been waiting for 2 hours, so rude. Anyway after looking me and my friend up and down in a judgemental rude way I told them how I don't have the money and that I think it's ridiculous I could fly with it as hand luggage for £5 on the way and now they're wanting £47! At this point everyone had boarded the plane and we were told we were about to miss it, I had to make a quick call to my gran to borrow the money as the hotel we stayed in had taken a huge deposit too and I wasn't getting that back until a few days after we left, and after typing the card details wrong 4 times into her computer the rude girl finally charged me £47 and we had to sprint to the plane. They were so rude and didn't even say hello, please or thank you at any point and set completely different rules as we had on the way. So annoyed and appalled at the rude and unfair staff. After all that the flight back was fine, just dissapointed really. Airport experience with easy jet there was 10/10, easyJet airport experience return 0/10.

### "hand luggage were oversized"
Gatwick to Athens. Once we got to the gate a flight attendant told us that we could not board the plane because we had 2 pieces of luggage (1 hand luggage and 1 small laptop case) and both of them were oversized. Then she explained that some policies had'changed and we do not meet the criteria or had accepted the new policies that had been sent to our email. Then we were ask to combine our luggage into 1, even though they were oversized, after 20 minutes of us trying to fit a laptop case into a very small hand-luggage, she told us that we could now board to the flight, but we had to give our hand-luggage to be stored at the bottom of the aircraft. Another 5 minutes till we had placed our luggage and we were told to follow a 'nice', ground staff, so we could hand-in our baggage and board from the back. (We were supposed to be seated at the 2nd row).

### "our flight is now cancelled"
Stansted to Amsterdam. We had return flights booked to Amsterdam leaving at 06.45 on 3rd January and on 2nd January at 7pm we receive a text to inform us that our flight is now cancelled and with no real reason to why. We’ve now had to spend more money on other flights from a further away airport costing us more in time and money, and at a later time when we had all travel arrangements sorted, I’m not happy.

### "flights were pretty horrible"
The four flights we took with easyjet were pretty horrible. All our flights were delayed to some technical difficulties. If you plan checking in a bag the fees on Iberia and BA are cheaper. easyJet check customers carry on to make sure it fits in the measuring box, if it doesn't be ready to pay a fee. At boarding there were no boarding groups so everyone just lines up. They don't use a jet bridge. The planes were all fairly new A321, 320 which were fine I suppose you really feel the pinch when sitting down and realizing the seat is tiny. On the flight you have a choice to buy the usual drinks and food. In all my experience was quite terrible, I will never take an easyJet flight again.

### "aircraft interior is less garish"
I now avoid British Airways under Alex Cruz and this is the first time I have flown EasyJet to Copenhagen. It was broadly comparable in comfort and service, while being significantly cheaper. I'd also choose over Ryanair as the aircraft interior is less garish and there are fewer annoying announcements.

### "Very unprofessional staff"
Belfast to Gatwick. Very unprofessional staff. Before boarding the flight at the airport gate, the member of staff checking passengers in kept coughing not really covering her mouth, then handled passports and boarding passes/mobile phones with e-tickets, without using sanitizer, it felt very unhygeinic. The air hostess doing the safety demonstration burst out laughing along with the cabin manager while doing the safety demonstration, the cabin manager then hid behind a screen to avoid been seen laughing. They safety demonstration was disrupted and not completed. The staff snacked on sweets throughout the flight making announcements with a mouthful of sweets sometimes. My bag had to be moved to the overhead compartment to which the cabin manager muttered 'God not this again' before moving my bag above. The flight was also 50min delayed to which the captain said 'sorry for being a few minutes late', didn't seem to realise that 50mins late can be very disruptive for passengers.

### "printed my boarding pass wrong"
Luton to Inverness. I arrived at the Luton airport at 5:50am for my 6:55am flight, which should give me plenty of time to do the check-in and security process. But the Easyjet employee at the check-in desk just printed my boarding pass wrong (only had half the barcode on it), I couldn't get through the entry gate. Therefore, I was sent back and forth between the entry gate and the check-in desk. That wrong boarding pass thing wasted me a lot of time. So not surprisingly, I missed my flight. When I spoke to one of their employees try to get my flight re-scheduled, he told me that my boarding pass was re-printed at 6:13, the gate closure was at 6:40, SO I should have made the flight. Well, I was wondering how he thought 27 mins would be enough for me to get through all the people lined up there at the security check, Not to mention that I could have plenty of time if they just didn't print my boarding pass wrong! Also he told I have to pay extra 80 pounds for a tomorrow's flight! That's outrageous, I haven't yet even asked them to refund my waste of time and my ruined trip. I had no choice but paid them the 80 pounds for the next flight. I've filed the claim on their website, hopefully I can get my refund and cover my extra day of hotel expense.

### "flight itself was good"
I would really like to express my compliments to the Easyjet crew and ground staff who were on duty for the flight from Amsterdam to Prague on December 16 2017. Due to circumstances we arrived very late at the airport. If easyet would have sticked to their rules we wouldn't be allowed to board, but we were luck. We made the flight and the way we were welcomed on board was fantastic. Also the ground crew were great. The flight itself was good. Never had a bad experience, I have been flying with them a lot since 1998.

### "our thanks and appreciation"
Bristol to Athens. We would like to extend our thanks and appreciation to easyJet staff at Bristol airport for their outstanding help and support on  22nd December 2017. Under extremely difficult conditions they acted in a professional, friendly and efficient manner. Although we suffered extra expenses as a result of the cancellation we understand that easyJet is not responsible for the delays and any way because of the stress we failed to retain receipts.

### "crew were very friendly"
Geneva to Birmingham. The cabin crew were very friendly. I am tall at 6'7" and struggled to fit into the standard sized seats. A member of the cabin crew allowed the three of us to move to the front three extra legroom seats as they were empty. This was free of charge and throughout the journey he and the rest of the cabin crew were very friendly and helpful! Many thanks easyJet for your customer service on this flight!

### "Never again though"
Hamburg to Manchester. Awful! Let us fly with a handbag and small suitcase on the way there but not on the way back to Manchester? If that is going to be applied, it needs to be applied both ways! Not only this, two hour delays on the way there. Have to admit the staff on the aircraft were very friendly. Never again though, will use another airline. First time used and worse time ever!

### "Crews fine on both flights"
I flew London Gatwick to Geneva and returned to Southampton. The flight to Geneva was almost full and arrived 10 minutes early. I had an emergency exit seat with nobody next to me which was handy. The Southampton flight was the first every Easyjet flight to that airport and we were met my the traditional water salute from the fire service. Only about 30 passengers on board. Crews fine on both flights. I did not make any purchases.

### "they should be overall more dynamic"
Flight was delayed last minute due to a police intervention, as a group of passengers had to be removed and arrested. The crew handled this very professionally and did all security checks quickly so we could take off as soon as possible. But once we were airborne, the inflight service was another story: Once they started the food and beverage service, cabin crew constantly had to go back and forth to the galley to get foods or drinks. It took them ages to give passengers what they requested, process payments and reach the next row. They also seemed not to bother about this. I was very annoyed as I just wanted a bottle of water and had to wait for more than 45 minutes until they finally reached my row. This is usually faster with their main competitor. Also, I find it outrageous that Easyjet uses an "old" GBP/EUR exchange rate. GBP 1.80 is definitely not 2.50 EUR at the moment! I think Easyjet crews are usually very professional but they should be overall more dynamic. Other than that, plane was tidy and in all comfortable for the low cost standard.

### "This was a horrible experience"
It has been nearly two months and 8 requests for assistance to no avail. My travel partner was reimbursed for hotel cost due to a cancelled flight, the correspondence clearly stated "we are sorry for the cancellation of your flight. Yet I am being refused compensation for the flight (I paid for our flight) and the cost of the rental car and dinner to get us to our destination. We could not have made the next day flight and still made our connecting flight from Geneva to London, so we rented a car and drove overnight. How is it that she is being reimbursed but I am not? We were both scheduled on the same flight and she paid for our hotel stay. How many different customer service agents do I have to correspond with until I can speak to someone?

### "a massive thank you"
I would like to say a massive thank you to the easyJet crew who allowed me to board my plane from Lisbon to Edinburgh 5 minutes before departure. The airplane was already ready to leave, doors were shut and stairs were taken away, but they guys managed to get me on board. I always have a good experience with EasyJet and I am now rating it even better.

### "thank them for their efforts"
On 8th December I was on EZY1834 from Schiphol to Manchester. It was originally delayed for 40mins due to weather and then a further 2.5 hours due to a technical issue. This was a major inconvenience for all on board, including the flight crew. The flight crew and Cabin crew were outstanding in their approach and interaction with passengers. They made a 2 hour sit in the plane very comfortable. I would like to thank them for their efforts yesterday. I realise that I am entitled to a refund for the delay over 3hrs but I do not wish to take this.

### "Never flying with them again"
Athens to Manchester. Seems standard after reading some reviews here. They stopped me at the gate and charged me 60 Euros for an 'oversize' bag that I've taken on a few dozen other flights with no trouble. Third slot has some metal bars at the top that shrink what you can put in by a cm or two and they know it. Never flying with them again, no matter what their price.

### "is always our first choice"
After two recent flights with Ryanair, it was a relief to be flying with easyJet again. We paid just under £100 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a long weekend. Both the outward and return flights were uneventful. We left on time and arrived early in each case. Boarding was handled smoothly and the cabin crews carried out their duties quietly and efficiently. There was none of the anxiety associated with Ryanair of infringing some new rule or having our flights cancelled at the last minute. We know all the "dos and don'ts" of flying with easyJet and the airline is always our first choice, if possible.

### "experience onboard flights pleasant"
Rome FCO to Paris Orly, it had the best price compared to the other airlines, since I was travelling with a big Indonesian group and paid for all the flight tickets for them as gifts. My experience onboard two flights were pleasant, the cabin crews were nice and the interior of the aircraft is not bad at all for a budget airline. Sadly, the good experience on board was  ruined by the horrible ground staff on both flights! On the first flight from AMS to LIN, each of us brought 1 cabin luggage & 1 small bag. We didn't realise that it was a mistake, so when we knew it from the surprisingly unfriendly Dutch ground staffs, we hurriedly packed each of our small bags to the bigger bag. So, we can say that we really tried to respect the rule. However, we felt that as an tourist group, as some passengers could bring 2 Luggage without being warned, maybe it was more because we were a big group of tourists so they wanted to show their power to us. On the second flight, we tried our best to respect the rule by only bringing 1 cabin bag for each of us. And we were positive that it wouldn't lead us to any problem. We were wrong! The ground staff in FCO Airport were trying to charge us 60 euros in the gate just because one of our luggage was a bit too big just because of its wheels! There were actually so many people with bigger luggage than ours I believe.

### "last time I used Easyjet"
Dortmund to Luton. This was the last time I used Easyjet. I don't care if I need to pay double the price for a ticket. I passed the check in Dortmund airport, head to my gate and waited to board. I had a luggage and a backpack as I had my suit in my hand luggage and didn't want to ruin my suit. My two bags were less than 8Kg so there was enough space to combine them in one. Easyjet's employee told me in a very rude way that I need to put everything in one luggage and told me "you get what you pay for". Of course I put everything in one bag but Easyjet should have in mind that it doesn't do as a favor when we pick it as a flight service provider.

### "Time to change to Norwegian"
Gatwick to Keflavik. I fly around 3 to 4 times a year. Occasionally with hand luggage only. I've flown with a variety of airlines including Ryanair. When we were about to go through the gate to board the plane to Iceland. easyJet crew stopped me and my friend and said we were only allowed 1 piece of luggage and we had to put our handbags inside our small case which we had as hand luggage. I've always carried a small bag as well as my trusted size friendly case. But no easy jet explained this 1 item only as hand luggage. Quite a few people had been stopped. And all of us was on the floor forcing our bags into our cases. It put a damper on our trip. It weighed the same what ever way we carried our luggage. But upward and onwards we went. Only to be informed that if we paid extra as a speedy boarder or priority boarding we can take our handbags with us. I have always praised easyJet as I have flown with them for many years. But they are becoming a rival for money grabbing Ryanair. Time to change to Norwegian as I have heard great things about this airline. Goodbye easyJet.

### "wouldn't allow us to carry laptop bag"
Gatwick to Malaga. My husband and I travelled with cabin bag (approved size) with extra bag. I was with laptop bag and my husband with small back bag. 2 ladies on that morning wouldn't allow us to carry laptop bag & small back bag, we have to put them in the bin. They didn't even offer to keep the bag for us collect on the way back. Is this reasonable? Coming back at Malaga to Gatwick, I have carried a small handbag, no problem at all.

### "EasyJet have disappointed"
Athens to Bristol. EasyJet have disappointed on this trip. I had paid out for an extra suitcase along with upfront seating for an extra suitcase. This small suitcase has been used on their flights before but on this one it was apparently too big to go in the cabin. This resulted in them charging me another 60 euros on my flight home. Overall I spent an extra 120 euros on getting home. I appreciate I had to pay for the extras to get my luggage home as I have been working abroad for the last months. What make this worse is that there were other people on the flight who's luggage was bigger than mine. I can say I won't be choosing to travel with easyjet again!

### "Poor customer service"
Flew easyJet from London Stansted to Prague. Flight was on time, boarding experience fairly easy. Seats ok. We ordered a drink from their inflight bar, about 30 mins later (40 mins until landing) we asked for another drink only to be told they were going to have a breakfast so would not give us more drinks? Surely you have a breakfast before you leave the house or if you must eat on a 90 minute flight, you can take it in turns to make sure staff are available. Absolutely ridiculous. Poor customer service.

### "Sorry does not fix things"
Gatwick to Hurghada. I understand technical problems can’t be avoided. But to be delayed two hours due to it being fixed I can deal with although still ridiculous when you have boarded the plane that then problems are noticed. The main problem is that now after a two hour wait we have a further couple of hours to wait as the current crew has said they are finishing their shifts. We now have to wait for the new crew, who still have to travel to the airport. Unprofessional and no compensation! Sorry does not fix things! I would not even rate a one star, they don’t give you that option though.

### "what a wonderful flight"
Gran Canaria to Gatwick. I just wanted to say what a wonderful flight we had. I had never flown with easy jet previously, And after having flights cancelled with Monarch I had rebooked with easy jet. The head flight attendant on our flight home was excellent. Helpful, friendly, funny and made a night time flight very bearable for my family of 6 (4 children, 2 adults )

### "just don't fly easyjet"
Munich to Gatwick. Terrible cancellation policy. I bought three tickets for $68. A few minutes later I saw that I needed to fly out a day earlier. I then proceeded to cancel and change my flight. They charged me $129 to change, and then charged me $248 for the same flight the day before (A few minutes after I made this change I looked up how much those same flights cost, and they were selling for $68 -  meaning easyjet gouged me). In short, a $68 ticket ended up being around $400. If you are going to fly easyjet and you need to cancel, then dont cancel, just let the seats fly empty and buy your new seats. Or, better yet, just don't fly easyjet! Ryanair had much better solutions.

### "I did not have a Hungarian visa"
Gatwick to Budapest in July 2017. I was denied boarding in London (I had a connection in Budapest transit zone to to Kutaisi, Georgia) because I did not have a Hungarian visa. This is absurd since I was supposed to have connection in the international transit zone in the same terminal in Budapest with no check-in carriage and I was checked-in for my next flight. EasyJet eventually refunded me for that, but they could not explain at all which of their terms I was violating.

### "no sign of any improvement"
I have to take easyJet flight from Manchester to Geneva, Sunday-Friday almost every second week since June this year. Have to' because this is a cheapest option and the only option of direct flight from Manchester. If you have any flexibility avoid by all means as 9 of 10 flights delayed (and more than half of them on 1.5-2+ hours) and you do not fancy to spend half of your weekend at the airport waiting. EasyJet absolutely don't care for them it seems to be normal operation mode. For the next month going to book connection flights with other airliners as it simply is going to be faster than easyJet 'direct' one. Absolute and huge disappointment with that airline as no sign of any improvement for months.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
Glasgow to Palma. I booked our holiday a few months ago and each of us was looking forward to this trip. When we arrived to the airport everything was fine.After some time the gate was open without any problems. Everybody was standing in a big queue. Our flight should have been at 6:55 pm. At 6:45 pm we were still waiting for the flight. And suddenly a few minutes later one person came and said to everybody in the queue that he was very sorry, but our flight has been cancelled. He did not explained to us why that flight was cancelled. Everybody was very disappointed and angry. When we asked him what we can do now he said that if we want to know more information we should go and ask about some details at EasyJet information desk. Again a few minutes later we were in a big queue at the information point and again we were very disappointed. Everything what we heard there was that they have got only 2 flights to Majorca during a week (Tuesday and Friday) and all they can offer us is a leaflet with the information how to apply for refund. They also did not tell us a reason why this flight was cancelled. I was travelling for 5 hours to the airport and after that cancellation again I had to be on my way to home for 5 next hours. It was ridiculous for all passengers. I had to cancel all our holiday because of that cancelled flight and due to that cancellation I will not get all my money from the travel agency. I am not going to book anymore a flight with EasyJet and will not recommend to anyone this airline. I am extremely disappointed and will never fly them again.

### "our flight was cancelled"
Olbia to Manchester. After waiting for 3 hours we found out from the Manchester airport site that our flight was cancelled. Nobody at Olbia had informed as to anything more than they were working on the toilets on the plane. The crew visited the airport toilets walking through the departure lounge, they then went back to the plane and ascended the skies without us. This is after the captain had told us personally that he would keep us updated. Nearly 300 people wandered around the terminal at 11.30 pm looking lost and confused. I could see what was coming so I rang a hotel and booked a room. When I went outside the terminal there were no taxis due to there being no flights due until the morning. I tried phoning but were told "No taxis"! Then one taxi appeared and took us to the hotel. Easyjet posted on their website that we could have a free flight a week later at the same time, or have a refund. We had to fly to Milan the next day to get part way home, then on to Manchester the day after that. We met some of the other passengers on the flight from Milan who told us they had to sleep on the Olbia terminal floor. We can't get through to Easyjet and have not been contacted.

### "not easy with easyJet"
It is not easy with easyJet. At Berlin Schoenfeld Airport, the queue was extremely long and there were only 3 counters opened. Check-in staff were rude and unhelpful. I feel that the airline's main aim is to be voted "most on time carrier" at the expense of passengers. The app does not really work when you have more than 2 boarding passes. For example, I could see that I had 4 boarding passes on the app but I could only open 2 earlier passes. After the check-in staff also could not open the other 2 boarding passes, he issued us with paper passes, but he issued my son's pass twice and not mine causing further confusion and distress at the security gate. Overall, not happy with easyJet. But a positive point on easyJet in comparison with other budget carriers, they allow a child traveller to have a free check-in of a stroller / car seat. Also, instead of spamming with offers on hotel and car rentals, they could alert travellers on what is likely to happen at any particular airport (eg very slow security) as I am sure that they would have data on the number of passengers who missed flights.

### "never fly them again"
Madrid to Paris. As a student on a budget I thought EasyJet would be a good airline to fly because it was cheap. They made us get in line for boarding much before they were ready to board us resulting in every person getting on the flight standing in disorganized lines for at least 30 minutes. The staff who was checking me into the flight proceeded to make me pay 60 euros for my bag even though I paid extra when booking the flight to have more than one bag. I tried to explain this to her and she told me that wasn't possible and forced me to pay for my bag. When I tried to ask her questions she continued to be dismissive. Overall I am extremely disappointed with my easy Jet experience and will never fly them again.

### "not fly easyJet again"
Gatwick to Athens. The plane was so dirty and very bad smell in the cabin. I think for the money I paid (200£) return it was really disappointing. I have paid 60£ return with other company and everything was absolutely fine. I will not fly easyJet again.

### "very rude with attitude"
I had a flight from Paris to Nice on 17 July 2017. They cancelled our flight. After doing 3 hours line in customer service, staff very rude with attitude told us they can't do nothing, only next day at night they can send us in another flight. We have to buy a ticket in another airline (we need to be in Nice that day). I may the claim on line they said I will have my money back in 14 days. Its been more than 2 months. I haven't receive my money yet. Call every day, no answer, send more than 30 e mail no answer.

### "Very happy with EasyJet"
Gatwick to Mykonos. Overall an excellent experience. Booked an extra legroom seat (front row) with speedy boarding which worked really well. The seat itself was quite hard. I like how the seats don't recline and I think all short haul economy seats should be like this as its so frustrating when the person in front reclines their seat. The flight departed and landed on time and the service from the crew was friendly, professional and efficient. There was a good range of food and beverages available for purchase. The easyJet app is excellent give you alerts when a gate is assigned etc. Very happy with easyJet.

### "robbed by speedy boarding"
Gatwick to Paris. I've waited 10 flights to see if things would improve - they didn't. Once you have checked in for a flight on the App, even if you change your reservation, the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted: confusing. The way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. Then you cannot change it yourself. By the way, you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. I like to check in on the way to the airport once I know I will get my flight. No, you have to check in way before. Once, the check in with the app or via their website didn't work, so I tried to call the customer service helpline: waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldn't do anything. You are now on your way to the gate, it is 1/2 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. Normally no stress, not with easyjet, where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight, so you run to realize it hasn't started boarding. In short, if you have a short connection, forget about your connecting flight. You think you are better off with a more expensive Flexi fare ticket (that is what we travel with). Good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security, but in Paris at easyJet terminal there are no fast security lanes, while in Gatwick all the lanes are decently fast. But then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream: you are entitled to board first, but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all, standing in the jetway until you can board the plane. The flight in itself is more or less OK, the staff are usually smiling, except when they bother you, at the first and emergency exit rows, to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders. This time they bothered me saying that I needed to fold my iPad cover during the descent, in a way that I wasn't able to use the Bluetooth keyboard which is part of that iPad cover.

### "the pilot saved the day"
As I was boarding from Gatwick to Milan on 24th September, I thought this is going to be a nightmare, I am surrounded by teenagers flying back to their country. Thankfully, the pilot saved the day. He was humourous, witty, joking and had a really good customer-approach. When arriving to Milan, he was joking about plane arriving but no-one was there to get us with stairs, advising us to take a seat and be patient. Hope my praise will get to this particular pilot! Wishing him well and motivation to continue in his job.

### "delayed with more than 2 hours"
Gatwick to Malaga. Very bad experience on 2nd October, my flight was delayed with more than 2 hours. Instead of taking off at 5 pm was delayed to 7.30. There was already another flight to Malaga same time with easyjet. Was no information on the screens as to what gate, so I  went to information desk, they didn't know exactly. Running around, stressed and got to Malaga after 11 pm. Had to pay extra for a taxi in order to get home. Not happy

### "very friendly crew"
Short trip, no thrills airliner. Check in was fast and easy, so were the reservations. Boarding was slow. Inside the aircraft, the usual bright colours from EasyJet and with fairly good amount of space thanks to the new seats, and specially for me that was lucky to get an emergency exit row seat. Very clean airplane. No entertainment system or wifi but then again you can't ask for much more at this price rate. Very friendly crew. I departed on time and even arrived a bit before the estimated time.

### "great value for the price"
Pleasant surprise! It was my first time flying with easyJet and I was a bit concerned, specially with their more strict luggage rules than what I am used to. Boarding was very slow and I must confess that the whole "speedy boarding" thing seems more like a gimmick, and that you are not going faster, you are just slowing everyone else instead. The plane was nice, comfortable, plane was very clean and seats were fare more spacious than what I would though, as the cabin was equipped with the new Airbus seats which provide so much more knee room! I really enjoyed the colours of the cabin. Staff was very friendly and even passed with a garbage bag before landing to let passenger get rid of all there garbage, not even normal airlines do that so I was not expecting it in a low cost airline. Flight was nice but of course there was no inflight entertainment. Great value for the price, I just wish they would let me take my camera bag apart from my carry on.

### "I was so disappointed"
Athens to Gatwick. I added a hold luggage for the flight and asked for a fragile tag. The lady behind the counter seemed uninterested and I was told that the company doesn't provide any. I was carrying an item which I had bubble wrapped but I found the way the situation was handled appalling. They didn't even suggest a solution or seem to care any less about my concern. I was so disappointed.

### "very good low-cost flight"
Gatwick to Jersey was a pleasant and stress-free flight. The plane was clean and modern, although the seats felt rather cramped. Boarding was efficiently managed. The crew were friendly and made an effort to interact with the passengers. We didn’t buy any food or drink onboard but crew managed to serve all passengers despite the very short flight time. Despite a delay  at Gatwick we still arrived on time. A very good low-cost flight.

### "very friendly and always smiling"
Krakow to London Gatwick on an Airbus A319. A fast and quite comfortable flight, considering I flew on one of easyJet’s oldest Airbus A319s. I booked the flight for a fairly cheap price. We were waiting for the aircraft at the doors to the apron when the aircraft was still in the air. We were made to wait around 5 minutes at the bottom of the aircraft steps in a 30 degrees Celsius heat. Boarding was fast and we were airborne on time. Once in the air the crew started selling. I bought myself a meal deal for around £6/7 which is a good price in my opinion. The seat was not the most comfortable but bearable for this flight. Seat pitch was good for a low cost carrier. The crew were amazing, very friendly and always smiling. We landed into London Gatwick early. When disembarking the aircraft we used the jet bridge,this is something easyJet don’t normally use. I would say easyJet is a very good airline, despite hearing and reading all the bad reviews about them. I would fly with them again in the future and I definitely recommend them.

### "crew polite and cheerful"
Faro to Southend with EasyJet. Bag drop at Faro is a single queue serving all EasyJet flights but although the queue looked long, it moved quickly. Flight left only a few minutes late and in spite of a headwind we landed ahead of schedule. Cabin crew polite and cheerful. EasyJet had sent an SMS message while we were at the airport to advise that there would be no fresh catering on this flight, although not a problem for us! bags delivered quickly and we were out of the airport within 20 minutes of touch down.

### "otherwise comfortable flight"
Southend to Faro. Bag drop was quick as was security. Plane boarded on time and departed on schedule. Cabin crew were polite. Standard EasyJet catering available to purchase. No recline on the seats which is a shame but otherwise comfortable flight. Toilets were clean. Arrived on schedule and bags delivered quite quickly.

### "better than other budget airlines in Europe"
Excellent experience travelling with easyJet from Munich to Luton. Our flight was delayed overnight because of a lightning strike on the aircraft, I am really happy with the way the ground staff managed to help us, they arranged a hotel with breakfast, taxi fares, everything. We had a couple of appointments in London and hotel bookings which we lost because of this delay. We have claimed eu 261 compensation claim which we got as 250 EUR. When it comes to aircraft they have mostly A319/320 in the fleet which are well maintained. I would say easyJet is better than other budget airlines in Europe.

### "name easyjet is ironic"
Amsterdam to Gatwick. Probably the worst airline I use by far. Today is a delayed flight of 30 mins. They don't treat their customers well, have poor service and generally a bad attitude from the staff. Flights are delayed or cancelled at random and they overbook the flights leaving people frustrated and stressed. The name easyjet is ironic, I feel.

### "last time we will use this airline"
Venice to Gatwick. Flight was delayed by over an hour - it would seem this was the case for all EasyJet flights across the day. We had tried repeatedly to pay for extra legroom seats in advance but the airline's website simply refused to load on either of our phones, instead refreshing the login page over and over again. Tried to purchase seats at check-in but we were told the flight was already full and this would not be possible. Boarding was announced a good 45 minutes before we took off but this being EasyJet, it took all of that time to get people moving onto the plane. The usual stress of a lengthy queue going nowhere, ground staff coming through to check every bag they could get their orange labels on into the hold, etc etc. Our seats were beyond uncomfortable - my partner is 6'7" and was pretty much paralysed in place for the entire flight. This is the last time we will use this airline - it may be marginally cheaper than others but the stress and hassle caused from start to finish simply isn't worth the 'savings'. Also unhappy that we could only pay for the flight online in euros, which of course meant we were charged a fee.

### "not happy with the service they have provided"
I use easyJet often to fly back and forth to London although this time around this was the worst experience I have ever had with them. I have trusted their services for years to meet my travel needs. Yesterday my flight was delayed and not only that but when we had landed it took 20 minutes to get off as they only opened one door on the plane to allow passengers to evacuate the plane even though passengers were able to board from both doors which I did not understand. I needed to use the restroom while we were waiting to get off, although because the toilets were out of service I was unable to use them which meant I had to wait 20 minutes to use the restroom. This was not good for me at all as I have dysfunctional kidneys and makes it very painful for me to wait. My flight going to London and coming back to Belfast were both delayed. I am really not happy with the service they have provided this time around.

### "professional and polite"
Tenerife to Manchester. The cabin crew were professional and polite. A passenger had a severe peanut allergy, and the crew made an announcement to make other travellers aware and request us to refrain from eating or opening anything containing nuts. Boarding was smooth, with the passengers split in two groups. The crew directed us  to the stair case closest to out seats - this made boarding the plane quite smooth. I will use the airline again in future, as it was value for money and a very positive experience. Thankyou Easyjet.

### "it was just a random boarding"
Flew Hamburg to London Luton with easyJet. Boarding experience was horrible. There was no system whatsoever, they were not boarding families with kids or people with speedy boarding cards first, it was just a random boarding which I found stressful and unfair. Staff looked unqualified and unprofessional.

### "the only thing that tarnished our holiday"
Flew London Gatwick to Barcelona. This airline is the only thing that tarnished our holiday. 2 hour delays, meaning arriving at our hotel at 4am! We felt tired the next day. Delays going home, waiting around to get our boarding passes checked twice! The plane then took ages to leave and fly home.

### "stupid things can ruin your mood"
Gatwick to Milan Malpensa. I bought the speedy-boarding option. When I arrived at the boarding line, the pre-boarding was already started. So I've been asked to put a label over my luggage to put it in the hold. Apparently the number of available spaces were ended. I just would like to know why they don't simply count. They know how many speedy boarding there are. They know if they've done the check-in and if they are inside the airport. I've seen with my eyes their staff counting with paper and pen how many luggages there are. So, the question is: is it so difficult to reserve the spaces for the speedy boarding customers? They even claim that you can get an additional luggage with you and you can skip the queue. But not if you arrive a few minutes after the started pre-boarding. When they offer to buy the speedy boarding you should tell that some advantages are valid only for a few minutes. On the flight there were free spaces for luggage and a lot of them were used for something that, based on their policy, should stay under the seat. To conclude: if you just wanna go from point A to B, it can be ok easyJet. If you're expecting to pay to have a bit better service, avoid easyJet. They just don't understand how these stupid things can ruin your mood.

### "staff on plane very unhelpful"
Porto to Manchester. The experience at the airport was great, staff friendly and the process was very smooth. The staff on the plane were very unhelpful and made you feel like everything you asked them for was a chore. The trolley had traveled down the isle of the plane once but when asked by my partner for a coffee was told 'is that all as the trolley has already passed once'. Then didn't ask if sugar or milk was required and then returned with one empty sugar packet which I had to request to be changed. I didn't know it was a rule to only ask for items once the trolley has passed once! This isn't written in terms and conditions when booking the flight! The return journey home would have been more pleasant with the addition of friendly and smiling flight attendants who had the willingness to provide good customer service or just act like they wanted to help (even if they didn't want to! ).

### "thank staff on the flight "
I have recently travelled with my family from Bristol to Malaga 10/8/17 on the 6.05am flight and I cannot thank the staff on the flight enough. My two year old had been poorly before we flew and she was sick on the flight and they acted very quickly and without a fuss. Within minutes we had a new seat cover, seat belt and bottle of water for her. They continued to check on her for the whole flight! I would like to thank staff who were so efficient and helpful during the flight! Very professional service! I would travel with my family with easyJet again.

### "Our experience was horrendous"
Gatwick to Madrid. Our experience with Easyjet was horrendous. Our flight was cancelled at the last minute, and we were notified at the boarding gate after our initial departure time. We were initially told that all flights to Madrid Barajas were being cancelled due to bad weather conditions, however a quick Google search confirmed that this was not true and that ours was the only cancelled flight to Madrid that day. We were escorted out of the airport to a poorly organised customer service area where we were promised by the customer service staff members that we would be refunded for our flights and reimbursed for our new flights to Madrid, transportation costs, accommodation and even food expenditure. We were told that we could not book another flight to Madrid with Easyjet until Monday the 10th (in over 3 days) as their flights were fully booked until then. This was not true, as they were still offering flights for that weekend on their website. However, we couldn’t do anything about it as their ‘support’ staff were unresponsive and dismissive, so we went back home to central London, and tried to look up affordable alternatives that would get us to Madrid in time for the music festival we had paid a lot of money to attend, and to the Airbnb that we had already paid for as well. The cheapest tickets we could find were £200 stand-by tickets (each) with Iberia, on top of the £80 each we had already paid for the Easyjet flight. After leaving Madrid, we were informed by Easyjet that they were actually not going to be refunding us the cost of the flights as their flight was cancelled due to bad weather, and they added that they could not refund our Gatwick express tickets as we sent them a copy of the bank receipt of the tickets with corresponding photos of the tickets, rather than an itemised receipt that we were not given from the station clerk. Overall, because the cancelled Easyjet flight, we had to spend: £280 per person for the flights, £35 each for the Gatwick Express, a wasted £60 on pre-booked accommodation in Madrid, and a lot of stress. That is over £1000 wasted between three people for a short-haul trip. Easyjet has refunded us nothing in return, thus we will never be returning to use their services.

### "Delayed 6 hours"
Stansted to Glasgow. Delayed 6 hours due to a hole on the runway. Told no food vouchers were available due to a technical issue. Flight was scheduled to arrive at 19.20 and we didn't make it to Glasgow until 00.45. No easyJet staff were seen after 8pm as they had clearly finished their shift - not helpful and left spending more money in the airport after being there from 16.30.

### "staff ignored his pleas for help"
This review relates to a flight from Toulouse to London Gatwick in August 2017. I shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as I can. Firstly, I found the website easy to use and clear and follow-up emails were constructive and informative. I found the Easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. Check-in as operated in Toulouse was efficient and the staff well-presented and polite. While checking in I was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. Toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from Lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. The flight to London was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. I witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. I assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. During the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and I saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. The safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. Snacks were available for purchase. The crew failed to deal with an irresponsible parent who allowed her child to run up and down the aisle during the flight. Disembarkation was orderly.

### "also very nice flight"
Faro to Paris Orly. It was the first time for me and my family with easyJet, the plane was full but it came to us has a nice surprise we got speedy boarding because we had a child. And also has we had kids we were invited to check in our luggage for free and pick it up later, must say that we were surprised with the nice staff and also very nice flight, will use again

### "how not to run an airline"
Flew Liverpool to Belfast with easyJet. Worst service going! Didn't inform us of a 1 hour delay until they had boarded us including a screaming child. Made us stay seated for 1 hour plus whilst they waited for an extra attendant. No drinks or anything. Why not leave us on the airport! Common sense would dictate that. Plane was full of screaming kids getting impatient. Full marks for easyJet on poor services and how not to run an airline. They knew the staff member was sick the night before so why not the issue then?

### "flights late by over 1h and 1.5h"
Flights to and from Edinburgh to Geneva were late by over 1 and 1.5h respectively. On both occasions easyJet was the only airline with a substantial number of delayed flights (according to departure screens). It appears that the problem is systematic unrealistic scheduling. The second point constitutes an aknowledgement of the fact that the destinations were eventually reached.

### "pleasantly surprised by the experience"
Luton to Faro. First time flying with easyjet for several years and I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. No queue at bag drop and boarding was well managed, despite being a very full flight. Both flights were on time and the planes were new and clean and although the new slimmer seats are not that comfortable they are OK for a flight of this duration. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Overall both flights were pleasant and hassle-free.

### "By far the worst airline"
Flew Copenhagen to Paris CDG. I flew all over Europe for a month taking bargain airlines and flew easyJet three times. By far the worst airline, and when I read reviews for Flybe, it got really bad reviews but in fact that was my best flight. Two flights on easyJet were delayed, one had the worst turbulence I've experienced and we had to circle before landing, their policy on carry on bags is absurd. Every other airline if you carry a bag and a backpack you're fine but you can volunteer to check for free, but with easyJet you have to either stuff them into one or pay $60 in order to check the bag. Additionally, twice the gate was moved after waiting at the gate it was originally assigned, which could be an airport issue but since it happened at two different airports it is suspicious. The staff were not particularly nice.

### "impressed by EasyJet"
Southend to Malaga. I travel with them quite routinely, and have to say I am impressed by EasyJet. What does let EasyJet down are some of the support staff at certain airports, that cannot seem to get there act together. Malaga recently they decided to swap boarding gates at the last minute and there was no tannoy announcement. As we had swapped with a Newcastle flight, we had a lot of people from Newcastle in our queue going to Southend who wasn't aware the gates had been swapped. The value for money on these flights is very good, I will keep travelling with them.

### "operated by SmartLynx Airlines"
Lanzarote to Gatwick. No one in the queue at Lanzarote EasyJet check-in. Polite, english-speaking staff at check-in and boarding gate. Tediously slow boarding process. Flight operated by SmartLynx Airlines on behalf of easyJet (24 hours notice given by easyJet via text message). Plain white, unliveried A320. Cabin crew all in SmartLynx uniforms. Cabin crew polite and no interaction with passengers unless you wanted to buy something. Announcements were clear and made in english only. Aircraft was dirty. No attempt had been made to clean aircraft during turn around. Crisps and chocolates littering the floor of row 10. Took off about 30 mins late. Zero overhead locker space left (flight not even full) by the time we boarded. SmartLynx A320 seats are bolt upright, non-adjustable and very uncomfortable. No leg room as had to store cabin bag under seat in front as all overhead lockers stuffed with cabin suitcases. Toilet was in a poor state when I used it. Soap dispenser broken and lying on its side and water draining very slowly from wash hand basin. Smooth enough flight with minimal CAT. Would not use SmartLynx by choice.

### "worst experience flying"
Larnaca to Berlin SFX. This was my worst experience flying. It all started when I was on my way to to the airport when I received message that plane would be 40 minutes delay and while at the airport another when it said 2 hours and 15 minutes, that was bad but OK. Plane departed 2 hours later than scheduled, but that's when fun begin, Captain told us that we might not be able to land in Berlin because airport is closing at midnight and we might not get exception which was the case so we were diverted to Rostok. We were told that buses will be waiting for us when we exit the terminal and message from EasyJet said that cabin crew will be there to assist us and will give us some food and drinks. Reality was a bit different, when we got out, there was one bus which was close and driver nowhere to be seen (we were one of the 3 aircraft) and cabin crew got into their shuttles and left, I've stopped one from other aircraft (from my already left) and she told me to ask person at the airport, there was no person at the airport. It took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. I could understand that things like diverting can happen, but the way EasyJet handled that is beyond terrible, I thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this. I used to fly with EasyJet often and it was my favourite budget airline, but I'm done with them and I won't be flying with them again.

### "fly with another airline"
Amsterdam to Berlin. We checked in our baggage and after the luggage was sent off only then were we told that we were not allowed a back pack and a carry on so we would need to fit them inside our carry on. When it came to boarding they made everyone sit and re-pack their bags to fit it all in 1 case - wasn't even allowed to wear my bum bag which was for my essentials (passports, money, etc). We still had plenty of room in our checked luggage but the lady on the check in desk intentionally sent off our bags then told us about the bag situation, poor customer service. If this was the case atleast notify your customer prior to sending off their checked baggage and we would have packed the backpack in their. Flight was delayed by an hour atleast get your flights on time then tell people about the bags. These guys can't get anything right! Save yourself the stress and fly with another airline.

### "reassured me and helped me feel better"
20th July 2017, on the 12.00 flight to London Gatwick North from Zakynthos I had a panic attack and the cabin crew members were excellent. One member of the crew in particular was fantastic and helped me gain back the control and helped with my fears about flying and really reassured me and helped me feel better. This staff member made a real difference.

### "wouldn't recommend this airline"
Aberdeen to Luton. I left a book in the front pocket of my seat and remembered just as I got off the plane. I wasn't allowed back on so a member of the airline crew went to check the the seat. They came back saying nothing was there. Maybe they couldn't be bothered to check. I wouldn't recommend this airline.

### "2.5h trip took 7h50m"
The easyJet flight from Naples to Paris scheduled for 2.5hrs. On arrival at airport, told flight cancelled. Offered alternative flight to Lille with bus trip to Paris. The 2.5hour trip ended up taking 7 hours and 50 minutes. easyJet did not attempt to inform passengers of the plans. We boarded flight to Lille having been told we would need to make our own way to Paris by train. But once on plane, we were told we would be catching a shuttle bus to Paris that would take 2 hours. The bus driver told us the trip would take at least 3 hours, not 2 hours. On arrival at Paris airport, the bus driver did not know how to enter the airport. Hence, time spent parked in middle of road whilst he made phone calls to find out info. I repeat the 2.5 hour trip took 7 hours and 50 minutes. We were not provided with any food or drink whatsoever during this prolonged trip. No apologies were made. The little bit of information we receive was incorrect. We boarded the plane expecting a train trip to Paris but ended up with a lengthy bus trip that we were told would take 2 hours but ended up being closer to 4 hours.

### "flight operated by SmartLynx"
Gatwick to Arrecife on 30th June. A few days before, I was told by email that the flight would be operated by SmartLynx airline. Having never heard of them, I made a few enquiries and found out that they were an Eastern European setup. I had booked exit row seats and already printed off my boarding pass so hoped the seats were configured the same. They were and a charming flight attendant let me know the rules attached to the exit row seat. The aircraft looked a bit stark - white all over and no logos. Interior was grey leather seating which was actually much more comfortable than the Easyjet modern seats and the crew were smart and very pleasant. The captain had good communication skills and kept us informed about our route. The flight was smooth and only a few minutes delayed.Overall, I would recommend the product and Easyjet have chosen well in choosing this airline to operate in their name.

### "food prices are reasonable"
Gatwick to Marrakech. I decided to use easyJet for all local flights. Choose seat 1C and this provides good legroom, the cost of the ticket is 1/3 of what some airlines charge. The food prices are reasonable, on time out of my previous 10 flights and a great young crew that provide a genuine service . Well done easyJet keep the fingers on the pulse.

### "flight back was terrible"
This is a direct return trip from London Luton Airport to Paris and back with easyJet. To be fair, the trip to Paris was ok, but the flight back was terrible, with not one, but a series of unpleasant occurrences. The problematic flight from Paris to London Luton was due to set off at 9:55pm, but was delayed by an hour and took off at 10:55pm Paris time. Despite the delay, the boarding procedures were extremely inefficient. There was no sense of urgency despite the tardiness, especially given the fact that this is such a late flight. The gate number also changed mid-way through the delayed hour. When we scanned the boarding pass, my friend was stopped by one of the staff as he was carrying two backpacks. Despite the fact some people's roller cabin luggage alone is the size of my friend's two backpacks combined, that staff insisted that my friend must pack everything into one backpack only. My friend had to step out, repack everything into one bulging, overflowing backpack before he is let through. The content brought through the gate doesn't change, the two backpacks were far from exceeding the luggage allowance in the first place, and the staff has created nothing more than sheer annoyance and further delay in our already delayed trip. The flight was around 50 minutes long and given the 1-hr time difference, reached London Luton airport at around 10:45pm London time. By this time, my friend and I were very anxious as we need to catch the 11:20pm bus from the airport to the train station, if we miss that bus, we will miss the last train home and will inevitably have to spend the night out in the streets. Just when everyone is getting their luggage from the cabin and gearing to leave, a flight announcement sounded saying that the bus to the gate will not be here for another ten minutes, and we were frustrated. Despite being late for an hour, the shuttle bus to the gate is still not scheduled on time! By the time the shuttle bus came, everyone got in, and we arrived at the gate, it was 11pm and we have barely 20 minutes to run to the customs, clear it, and dash to the bus stop. I have to run and dash through the crowd like a mad person, and we hopped onto the bus with only 2 minutes to spare. I don't think I will take easyjet again. What an ironic name.

### "very smooth and pleasant experience"
EasyJet flight from Vienna to Edinburgh. A very smooth and pleasant experience for a low fare. Fast boarding, on-time departure, on-time arrival, clean, new and modern aircraft, enough legroom for the flight, everything one could need for a travel within Europe. Even using an airbridge in Vienna, that is very unusual for a low-cost airline. Highly reccomended!

### "customer service is quite terrible"
There was a half hour delay on my most recent flight from Berlin Schonefeld to Pisa with easyJet. Flight quality is fine. I understand you're not paying for amenities so it's ok that it's so basic. There are no outlets or screens, and of course you have to pay for food. In my experience customer service is quite terrible and sadly the only thing I remember. I normally have a jacket with me for cold air temperatures inflight. I have never been told that my backpack can't fit under the seat (because it can and it does fit) in front of me and I need to put it overhead or that I need to put my jacket on or overhead for takeoff and landings until this flight. And I am a frequent flyer. This nitpicking, which coincidentally was only for me, felt ridiculous. With all the add-ons (eg. 18 euros per kg overweight check-in baggage) it's not even good value. I will not take this airline again.

### "last time I ever fly with easyJet"
Would not fly with them again. Delays on the aircraft are unacceptable. Putting you on a plane and then having you wait for over two hours before take off, that is disrespectful. And having it happen on both flights from Tel Aviv to London shows a pattern. For sure this is the last time I ever fly with easyJet.

### "asked Easyjet to compensate us"
Stockholm to Luton was scheduled to depart from Stockholm at 21.30 on 2nd June. On airport monitors it was displayed that the flight was delayed until 22.30. No one from Easyjet showed up so we asked airport information and were told that flight was cancelled and that there will a flight the following day. We stayed at the airport hotel and took a 5.00 am flight for Gatwick the next morning. We asked Easyjet to compensate us for the flight but they said the flight was delayed and not cancelled.

### "flights are usually delayed"
Frequent flyer on this flight Madrid to Gatwick. I don't know if I am unlucky but 95% of the times has been delayed! I understand you are not paying for a premium service but I cant really understand how its possible, specially from London airport, the flights are usually delayed.

### "Would fly easyJet again"
Manchester to Prague. Quite a good experience on the outbound flight to Prague. Aircraft clean. Cabin crew nice & friendly as was the captain/co pilot with their information. Arrived just a few minutes late. Return journey delayed. Over 2.5 hours late leaving so arrived at MAN 01.30 instead of 23.00. Delay due to a lady being offloaded on the aircraft's earlier journey due to panic attack. These thing happen. We had a 99CZK (£3) for refreshments. Managed to get a drink and a butty with just a few pence to pay. So not bad. Both flights full. Would fly easyJet again as we like the unrestricted weight on cabin bags.

### "will never use this airline again"
Miserable 10 hours spent waiting for a delayed easyJet flight to Gatwick because of a fault with the plane. Very disappointed and will never use this airline again. No help offered from airline staff to source alternative flights and final delay of 14 hours.

### "at least you know what to expect"
Flew London Gatwick to Aberdeen. EasyJet during winter times been a good option to fly to and from Gatwick. For what you pay, flight was on time and went rather smoothly. The cabin crew were friendly. Will keep using them every time I need for Gatwick flights. Better then BA, at least you know what to expect.

### "Always delays with boarding"
Horrible service from London to Amsterdam with easyJet. Asking to squash my little hand bag into my suitcase so I could take it onboard. Stupidity! I saw several people carrying two huge bags in front of me and the staff members didn't say anything to them. Always delays with boarding. Have flown several time and have never bordered on time. As a result delays in landing as well. The aircraft is always dirty. Will not fly with them again!

### "happy with the service for the price paid"
I have never had a problem with easyJet. Very happy with the service for the price paid and only had to pay extra charges once due to my bag being too heavy. Not exactly their fault! I am due to fly with them again on Saturday from Bristol to Glasgow and I changed my return flight for which they charged me an extra £30.00. However as this was within 24 hours of booking, I was fully refunded with no fuss having submitted a request for a refund via the website, when I'd noticed the charge. A message was left on my phone to confirm this. Again, never had any problems with easyJet and happy to fly with them.

### "show some respect to your passengers please"
It's not so much about the flight itself from Nice to Luton although it's always delayed or cancelled (frequent flyer on easyJet). I have a big problem with the way they treat passengers before boarding in general. Yesterday in Nice they pushed us in a long corridor of mostly windows with the sun pointing at it. It was horrible. No air conditioning, impossible to get fresh air or even shade. This was going on for approximately 30 minutes. I asked if it was possible to get some door or window open but was totally ignored. EasyJet show some respect to your passengers please. It's not that complicated.

### "cancelled at the last minute"
Gatwick to Geneva. Having had a terrible experience with the flight being cancelled at the last minute and no help at all from the airline I asked for some recompense. After multiple emails and discussions we agreed recompense for the increased costs of the new flights I had to book online with them for later that day. Now several months later I have still not received that refund and they have gone completely silent. This is a terrible experience and I will not use this airline again until they have paid me what they owe me. If anyone out there believes that customer services should work - don't use easyJet they are impossible to talk to or get any sort of satisfaction from.

### "Was very happy with everything"
Flew easyJet from Tel Aviv to London Gatwick. Was very happy with everything. The flights weren't that expensive, the staff were nice and I was comfortable the whole flight. The staff filled my water bottle and I also purchased one. Since it's a low cost flight I had no expectations but everything was like a regular flight except for the luggage allowance. Although adding one more suitcase to my last flight only cost me 4£ which is very cheap and worth it. They also had vocal guidance in Hebrew which is very nice. I have no complaints.

### "abandoned us in Berlin"
I flew Hamburg to Gatwick on May 12th. Flight 2 hours delayed. I had to get a cab at the other end as it was 1am. I flew back on May 19. There was a thunderstorm over Hamburg and we were diverted to Berlin. Assurances from the Captain we would all be taken care of by EasyJet turned out to be empty words. Apparently people with hand luggage were taken off somewhere in a bus. The rest of us waited an hour and a half for our luggage by which time it was midnight and not an easyjet person to be seen. I was able to phone my son who lives in Berlin but others were trying desperately to find hotels and trains. Whilst the storm caused the diversion I think it was very bad that easyjet abandoned us in Berlin.

### "rude staff"
London to Alicante with easyJet. Told to put my hang bag into my luggage. While me and my family members I did this, the staff continuously shouted I will miss my flight and have to pay (making me panicked and anxious). Flight was 30 minutes delayed. 5 empty seats available where I was not allowed to swap and sit with my family and had to sit alone. Disgusting behaviour. Rude staff.

### "overall a huge disappointment"
Flew Madrid to Liverpool. Charged 47 euro at gate for my wheeled bag because I was not allowed to add a hold bag online after online check in. Many passengers subsequently boarded with wheeled bags much bigger than mine, I asked them if they were charged and they all said no. Flight was 2 hours late owing to technical problem. Got more information from flight tracker than easyJet. Tried to call easyJet from Madrid and gave up after holding for nearly 20 minutes. Used chat message facility but this kept failing and eventually got poor response online. Speedy boarding did not work as other passengers simply unhooked the chain separator on the bus to board at the same time. Despite long delay on inbound flight, there was no bridge available at both ends caused and this added to delay. Overall a huge disappointment - I have used this airline many times before but would choose alternative in future.

### "extra charges at the gate"
Venice to Budapest. Beware of extra charges at the gate. They had plenty of overhead carry on space for luggage. I had one duffle bag and my purse and was charged 60 euro for my duffle bag to be in hold. Flights are cheap but they get you with their bag checks. I have noticed many other airlines doing the same thing.

### "were treated very poorly"
Prague to Gatwick. Very unhappy with their customer service. We felt we were treated very poorly when there was a misunderstanding about checking our bags. The lady at the counter was being extremely short and wouldn't answer my questions in a respectful and professional manner. Her attitude was completely unnecessary. Smiling instead of scowling would do them some good.

### "always seem to be delays"
❎ Unverified |  Gatwick to Faro. I appreciate that easyjet is a budget airline, but on my last 4 flights to Faro there always seem to be delays. I'm currently sat in the departure lounge, and although being called 45 mins ago, there is no information made available as to why there's a continuous delay? I've finally lost faith in easyjet and their poor customer service, and advise people to consider paying more for a more reliable service.

### "easyJet for business in favor of BA"
Barcelona to Gatwick. I've started flying easyJet for business in favor of BA because of punctuality issues with latter. I've flown with them 5 times in last year for both biz and family and all flights have been on time or ahead of time. On this occasion we arrived 40 mins early which was useful to get me to a meeting I thought I wouldn't make. I paid for Easyjet Plus so I could take extra bag, speedy boarding and select exit aisle. I had the entire row to myself. It was an uneventful, comfortable flight, just as it should be for less than 2 hours.

### "uneventful and went smoothly "
My flight from Edinburgh to Paris on easyjet was fairly uneventful and went smoothly without any problems. I'm almost 6 feet tall and the seat was comfortable enough. The best part about budget airlines is the direct routes they offer between cities - especially if you're not flying out of a large hub like London. So although the flight lacks the comforts and frills of a larger airline, at least it's a much shorter trip than having to connect through a hub.

### "experience was impressive "
Gatwick to Marrakech. Bag drop at London Gatwick was  efficient and speedy. Flight was called on time and boarding again was quick and easy (speedy boarding). Welcome on board was friendly and professional. In flight catering was started shortly after take off and for the prices charged good value. The Captain had provided a detailed update on what was happening and actually came into the cabin to speak directly to everyone over a short delay to take off due to flight congestion in Marrakech. After two hours into the flight, the Captain announced that a member of the flight attendant crew had been taken ill and he had decided to divert to Lisbon to get her medical treatment. Immediately the remaining crew took steps to get the plane ready for a landing and the Captain continued to supply information on what was happening and how problems on finding a replacement crew member were handled. It was handled efficiently that everyone was fully informed and understanding of the problems. After landing the crew member was taken away by ambulance and within 30 minutes a replacement arrived. Whilst we waited the Captain kept us informed and walked through the plane to answer anyone who had specific questions. The flight continued on to Marrakech arriving two hours late. The experience was impressive and a credit to the airline with the Captain a credit to his crew and his airline.

### "It was a comfortable flight"
Flew easyJet from London Gatwick to Budapest. It was a comfortable flight. The staff were helpful and kind. I was sitting in 17E (middle) and the passengers either side were sleeping (Sunday flight 17.55-21.25). The food was good and of course, it costs money. I do recommend purchasing a seat because it can be very annoying checking in and realising you are sitting in the middle especially as you can't purchase a seat after check-in. The flight only cost 28 pounds.

### "uncomfortable seating"
Belfast to Gatwick with easyJet. Really rude check-in staff, then uncomfortable seating on plane that squeaked really loudly every time I moved. They might appear cheap but you get what you pay for. If you can afford a little more to fly with a reputable airline then do it - be aware that they'll sting you for baggage if they can, its how they make their money.

### "staff are rude and demanding"
Flew easyJet from Gatwick to Keflavik. I had to pay a 105£ to check a bag that I have been flying with for a month all over Europe. I didn't know that on these low cost airlines that you don't get any checked bags and when paying for it, it was also "overweight". The staff are rude and demanding probably because they are under paid and unappreciated. I have not been on the plane yet and if it is as bad as the service I hope it arrives in one piece. Please do not make the same mistake as me and fly a better airline.

### "very friendly and efficient"
Bristol to Rome return with easyJet. We booked our seats with extra leg room so had speedy boarding which we will do again. It made boarding so easy. The seating was comfortable and clean, plenty of room for hand luggage. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The pilot kept us up to date with the planes progress. Arrived on time. The whole experience helped to make a really enjoyable holiday. Return journey was just as good. We will be using EasyJet again soon.

### "the leg room is so little"
Amsterdam to Luton with easyJet. The flight took off on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The overall flight experience was stable, but very cramped. I am around 174cm tall but the leg room is so little that even I felt uncomfortable during the 40 or 50 minutes flight. The seat is not adjustable, thin, hard, within expectation though as a budget airline. That said, I got my return ticket for around £100, without checked in baggage. That was not a good deal to be honest. A lady in front of me carried a small pouch and a medium sized handbag. Even though it really was a very small pouch, an easyjet employee asked her to put the pouch into the handbag because she recognized the pouch as one handcarry luggage. So strict.

### "threatened by the cabin steward"
EasyJet flight EZY1821 on 19th April from Manchester to Antalya. Having travelled extensively for over 50 years, never have I experienced such appalling, intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. From the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight. Whilst I understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with (as do all other customer facing roles) the majority of yesterday's passengers appeared to be middle aged, sensibly behaved golfers & regular, well mannered holiday makers. We were all initially warned that the crew had a "list of passenger names" who'd made purchases from Manchester airport duty-free and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found 'guilty' they would have the duty-free confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. An example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to Tenerife, and was conveyed as if this was a threat. One  does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. As far as I could see, most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. The in-flight safety demonstration then commenced, but the steward paused it, and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be "returning to the terminal and we'd be going nowhere". Much as I fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples (there were many others) there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. I did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. I witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger (behind his back) as "grandad". Another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger, there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. When the cabin steward announced that in flight duty-free sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in Turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight (hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in Turkey). We subsequently did not purchase anything from duty-free in protest to such slanderous remarks, nor did fellow passengers nearby. It was a relief to disembark, in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. I have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before, however on this occasion I feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay. I enjoy flying as a rule and have never come away from a journey feeling nervous of the crew. I sincerely hope we don't encounter this particular crew ever again. I will also think hard about which airline I choose to put my business through.

### "seat was filthy and stained"
Marrakech to Gatwick. Worst experience flying ever. The seat was filthy and stained, had to wipe it off. The card in the seat pouch was covered in an unknown sticky substance. My girlfriend and I recieved multiple flea bites which I assume was from this flight. When the meal cart finally arrived we had very little selection to choose from.

### "makes a challenging journey terrible"
Gatwick to Krakow. I usually had no issues with EasyJet, as a single person you can deal with no thrill on short flights. However, now as a parent my needs and requirements have changed and i do not think Easyjet takes care of this customer base at all. On a bright side - staff was nice and at points very helpful. However my stroller was not delivered to the aircraft at my destination - not an airport restriction as even Ryanair does this - I had to wait for my stroller more than people for their luggage (not easy with active toddler) - on the way back in Gatwick again I did not get the stroller and when I asked if it will be at the top of the sleeve was told it will not be available until baggage claim. That is a very long walk carring a toddler and waiting for passport control. I was told that 'maybe' i can find a yellow pushchair that i guess are used to lower the cost of service. None was available to anyone on this flight - not only me. If easyJet wants to use this system than i should have an option to prebook this chair or have enough available for all. Otherwise they cant claim they provide the service. - at the end again I had to wait until most of the luggage rolled off I fly a lot with my toddler - low cost and not - but never before I have had to endure this inconvenience. It may not be a problem with older kids but with toddler it really makes a 2 hour already challenging journey terrible.

### "cabin crew were pleasant and friendly"
Flew London Luton to Inverness. One of the best easyJet flights I've been on in the past year, left the ground at the perfect departure time, flight was early landing in INV, plane was clean and cabin crew were pleasant and friendly, how ever I feel like the cabin manager could of slapped a smile on her face as she came off rather serious and abrupt.

### "fast, cheap, on time flight"
Aberdeen to London Luton with easyJet. Left Aberdeen 10 minutes late due to a late boarding despite the aircraft arriving on time, crew were young and professional apart from one who I feel was looking down on customers and her fellow colleagues. Overall another fast, cheap on time flight from easyJet!

### "pilot extremely informative"
London Gatwick to Inverness with easyJet. Flight finished boarding 10 minutes early and we left the stand early only to be caught up in traffic queues waiting to depart. The crew seemed tired as I think it was their last sector of the day. The pilot was extremely informative which I love when there is no IFE.

### "nothing to complain about"
Inverness to Gatwick. My flight was at 1500, I turned up to proceed straight though a fast security before boarding my flight at 1440, the plane was the 200th Airbus that easyJet own, with that special inverted colour scheme which was fun, but the inside of the A320 was just normal. Friendly, on time, and cheap fare, nothing to complain about!

### "courteous, friendly and helpful"
❎ Unverified |  Mallorca (Palma) to London Gatwick. I had booked an over-wing exit seat for the extra legroom and the offer of 'Speedy Boarding'. It was good to see that the ground staff at Palma boarded the aircraft efficiently with 'Speedy Boarding' passengers first down the jetway. We were informed that the flight was full, and l must praise the cabin crew for the courteous, friendly and helpful way in which they managed the boarding process and accommodated everybody's luggage into the overhead bins. The aircraft was clean and tidy. We were told by the Captain that there would be a 30 minute delay leaving Palma due to aircraft congestion in the London area (the communication from the flight deck crew was accurate and informative). A reasonably priced Buy On Board food and beverages service was offered twice during this 2 hour flight. The only disappointing aspect to the journey was when we arrived at a remote stand at London Gatwick. Although the bus was ready and waiting to transfer the passengers to the North Terminal, it took nearly 25 minutes for ground service personnel to arrive and position the stairs against the side of the aircraft. Again we were kept well informed by the Captain and this inconvenience could not be attributed to the airline but their assigned ground handling agent.

### "cabin service was excellent"
Gatwick to Lanzarote return. We had the pleasure to Fly with easyJet to Lanzarote and we cannot fault the level of service. From the time of booking the flight we felt the airline cared about the passengers. We had timely reminders by email about the Terminal move at Gatwick, the opening of online check in, and to make a change there was no hard sell within the emails, unlike some airlines On arrival at the airport there were plenty of staff to explain how to use the self bag drop terminals and to guide you though the process. The outbound flight was a bit bumpy and we had to make two attempts at landing due to a cross wind. But we were warned by the Captain that the plane in front of us had reported 'A bumpy ride over the Bay of Biscay'. The return flight we arrived at Gatwick 25 minutes early due to a tail wind the return flight was perfect. Cabin Crew on both legs operated a slick service and worked well as a team. The cabin service was excellent on both legs and the food was hot and fresh. Its price was the same has the outlets in the airport. The information from the cockpit and cabin was clear, concise and friendly. It was nice to see the Captain on leaving the aircraft on both legs. I would not hesitate to fly easyJet again.

### "crew are very helpful"
The more I fly with easyJet the more impressed I become, flew from London Gatwick to Lanzarote. Ground staff were terrible a few years ago but now they have become very professional, they don't rush you as much as they used to. They are there to help. I flew to the Canary Islands on a 4 hour flight and it was very comfortable. I was on a recently refurbished aircraft and the slim seats prove to be more comfortable than they look. The crew are very helpful, of course they try to sell a lot but they do it in a friendly way. Food and Drink is affordable, especially if you get a meal deal, but some of the products are extremely over priced. The magazine is basically sell sell sell! I wouldn't recommend giving it a read as not much entertainment on it.

### "don't care about convenience and comfort"
Flew easyJet from Luton to Lisbon. The cleanliness and comfort of the plane was acceptable as was the service from the flight crew and communication from the pilots. What lets the airline down is generally the pre-flight experience: - insufficient bag drops open, prolonged queues for boarding gates, lack of seating in boarding gate areas – all gives the feeling that Easyjet don't care about the convenience and comfort of their customers. Oh and if you are going to encourage passengers to bring only cabin luggage then redesign your planes to cope with this, because you can't get your holiday off to a better start than by having to stand on the runway/steps in the cold, wind or rain whilst the people at the front of the queue are rearranging their baggage in the overhead lockers and blocking the aisles.

### "used to be a pleasant alternative"
Alas easyJet is not the airline it used to be. On December 23rd I flew back from Gatwick to Edinburgh, the plane due to take us was held up in Belfast by a storm. When it finally came (I was supposed to catch the 7pm plane) it was given to the passengers waiting from the delayed 5pm plane. To cut the story short the plane we finally got put on (and then sat waiting) finally reached Edinburgh after 1 am on morning of 24th Dec. This is because easyJet now juggle with planes and have too few to cover the short falls. Last night my Edinburgh plane was again delayed to Gatwick, should have been 6.55 pm and it finally got in at 9pm. One other winge is that they frequently fly you in the plane that differs from the diagram of one used to allocate tickets, twice now I have booked £10 extra for sitting in row with extra leg room over wings (Exit) and ended up in one with virtually no leg room as its a different plane. No one explains this and yet they take money paid for space. I shall not be using the flights from Edinburgh any more, they used to be a pleasant alternative to the train - used to.

### "a really good experience"
❎ Unverified |  I have flown Easyjet to Lanzarote twice, changing from BA on 3 issues 1) Price 2) Timings and 3) BA no longer offer complimentary drinks or food. Both flights with Easyjet have been great. Bright, modern aircraft, enthusiastic but not pushy cabin staff. Drinks a bit expensive but I'm in holiday mode so I don't mind. The early departure means an extended first day and the return is again, at a reasonable hour. Plenty of chat from the flight deck and overall a really good experience. I always pay a bit extra for exit row seats as I'm a bit lanky and with this comes Speedy Boarding so there's always room for my luggage in the aircraft. However, I will add that it seems to be a free for all in Arrecife with no discernible advantage to have SB. As I now have a holiday home in Lanzarote, I will be visiting quite often following my retirement so Easyjet will continue to be my airline of choice.

### "Appalling experience"
Flew easyJet from Gatwick to Fuerteventura. Automated check in chaotic. Flight time delayed initially by over 3 hours, subsequently 2 more changes causing confusion and inconvenience. Poor communication throughout. Held in gate area for ages then herded onto tarmac and stood in freezing conditions for 15 mins. Crew arrived late despite lengthy delay. Flight short on already limited menu options and only served first refreshment after 2 hours of 4 hour flight. Appalling experience.

### "made me pay 60 euros for luggage"
Venice to Naples. I always travel with a hand luggage if my trips aren't longer than a week. Yesterday at the airport in Venezia (Marco Polo) they wouldn't let me pass with my hand luggage although it fits the official proportions of the company/airport, then they made me pay 60 euros for the luggage, an absurd price, I paid more for the luggage than for the flight. I always travel with the same luggage, but thanks to the person in charge from easyjet I had this problem - other passengers pointed out to me that they passed with luggage bigger than mine. So my advice is don't ever pay those 60 euros if you get in the same situation as I did, report it to the airport, do what you need to do, but don't pay that money. 10 people who came after me had to put the luggage on hold, that is to send it for free because the plane was full, so for them they could do that but I had to pay 60 euros.

### "so helpful and cheerful"
Newcastle to Belfast. We would like to commend a young man who was working on the Easyjet desk at Newcastle on 02.02.17. He was like a breath of fresh air, so helpful and cheerful and gave us a warm welcome at the desk. He arranged for our bags to go in the hold and this helped us enormously. I wish all easyjet desk staff were like him. It made such a difference to us and made the trip enjoyable. We were going to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary with our family in Northern Ireland and it set it off on a good footing. However on our return on Sunday 05.02.17 the flight was delayed and we were sent to the waiting gate where we had to wait for some considerable time without any seats to sit on. Considering it was a full flight there were only about 20 seats in that area. Because the flight was delayed we missed the last train out of Newcastle and we had to get a taxi home which cost us £15. This was a disappointing end to our trip.

### "told us flight has gone"
Luton to Geneva. On 23rd February myself and my partner have checked in our luggage then went to the gate 11 as indicated in the screen TV in order to board the plane. While in the queue, the easyJet staff told us they are delaying the flight because of weather conditions (there was a strong wind) and we should go to the waiting area for further update. They told us to monitor the updates on the TV screen. We went to the waiting area but the status of the flight has never changed from "gate closed". After an hour we got hold on one of the rare easyJet staff, we asked for information about the flight and she told us that the flight has gone. We did not understand how this has happened. We have asked them to put us on the next flight but there was no one to help us. They were sending us to each other with no help at all. They were sending us to a place in the airport which they call desk 6. They told us to use the phone in this desk to contact easyJet staff and tell them our problem. We tried This phone for 30 min but no one was answering. When we could get out from the airport security zone, we went to easyJet desk in order to put us on the next flight they asked us to pay £80 each. How can they make us pay for their mistake? The manager of the desk at the check in area was rude to us. The attitude of the staff on the ground is inacceptable. If I have to advise, better pay £50 more and travel with a decent company..

### "stood on bus for over 15 minutes"
Munich to Gatwick was dreadful. The negative experience started long before departure. EasyJet use terminal 1 at MUC but there were no indications on the boarding pass of which zone to use for bag drop - I ended up having to ask at the information desk and then trek all the way down to zone Z by the S-Bahn station. Some simple signage and advice on the app or website (I did check before travelling) would have allowed my taxi to drop me at the right place. Passport control not within EasyJet's control I admit but they should be making representations to the authorities  was incredibly slow. Security was fairly quick. Then boarding - I've rarely had a more unpleasant experience. Coming through the gate at the "last and final urgent call", I am greeted with the dreaded bus. Already packed of course, and more passengers pile on behind me well after cut-off time. We stood on the bus - cramped, cold, uncomfortable - for over 15 minutes before we were driven to the stand. Boarding once off the bus was quick enough, we taxied on time and were in the air by 0955. Seat was the usual cramped LCC arrangement. No recline at all. Slept, so no idea on service. Landed slightly ahead of schedule and then rather surprisingly got a jetway to the plane, so at least I didn't have the horrors of a bus both ends. One good thing - baggage delivery was swift.

### "horrible to watch how that staff "
Manchester to Munich. A dad traveling with two young kids was kind enough to help me put my suitcase in the overhead locker, only to then straight away be told off by one of the flight attendants, for putting his jacket in the overhead locker as well. (Since when is that a crime?). Then the flight attendant impolitely ordered the dad to unload everything again and to only put "things with wheels" in the overhead locker. It was horrible to watch how that staff who should be responsible for taking care of the passengers treated that very helpful person.

### "an okay short flight"
❎ Unverified |  Copenhagen to Berlin Schönefeld. The plane was delayed by over an hour, so that wasn't so great. But in addition to that, the plane was new, and the cabin staff were friendly. And when paying only around only 50€ for a ticket, it's kind of hard to complain. So all in all, an okay short flight.

### "Excellent both ways"
❎ Unverified |  Luton to Barcelona return. Excellent both ways with Easyjet and for a bargain price. For roughly same dates BA out of LHR looking for £250 , this was £40 return including taxes! Both flights on time, outbound middle seat free, inbound whole row to myself. I purchased the speedy boarding which worked both times for getting on an off the aircraft. Crew were friendly and efficient. On landing I was back in my car in 15 minutes. Very impressed.

### "often at cheap fares"
Berlin to Nice. EasyJet was never my choice, but they do offer routes and often at cheap fares. So I headed to Berlin Schoenfeld instead of Berlin Tegel, suffering the inconvenience as well as the most squeezed seat in the air. But what do you expect paying my early booking fare. It was good that EasyJet always delivered me to my destination safely. Slight delay only.

### "boarding was rather chaotic"
Flight from Gatwick to Aberdeen with easyJet. Flight was 30 minutes late and boarding was rather chaotic. They love to put us in long queues waiting a long time to board the plane. Apart from that the flight was fine. The new seats are slightly more comfortable then the old ones, but the gap between each seat don't give much privacy in your own space.

### "a very pleasant journey"
❎ Unverified |  Flew Inverness to Bristol return. Outbound flight arrived early, which allowed for an earlier boarding time. Passengers well managed at gate and aircraft was boarded quickly and without issue. Flight took 1 hr 15 mins and was a very pleasant journey. Only took cabin bag which was easily stored within the overhead locker provided. Cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. Arrived into Bristol early, with a short walk from the aircraft to the baggage claim/passport control. Return flight was on time. Gate at Bristol was located quite a walk from the departures area, crowds of people walking through corridor means that it's not ideal for travellers with small children, wheelchairs, etc. Boarding was efficient and flight left on time. Again, pleasant flight to Inverness with regular updates by pilot and cabin crew pleasant. Highly recommend that if travelling EasyJet from Bristol to arrive at gate early due to long walk and relatively small gate area.

### "good selection of food and drink"
I flew Glasgow to Stansted on Friday 27th January at 11.55, returning on 28th January at 13.40. Flight down was delayed an hour and flight back was on time. Flights were only an hour, so comfortable enough. Good selection of food and drink to purchase on-board. The cabin crew on Glasgow to Stansted route were  friendly and bubbly, particularly the cabin manager. The crew on the Stansted to Glasgow route were not as friendly and didn't engage with passengers.

### "had to check in my hand bag both ways"
Booked a couple of days to Belfast and back to Luton with easyJet. My hand luggage was taken both times to store as a check in bag. And when I mentioned to the crew that I chose hand luggage due to time saving reasons and had to check in my bag on the way to Belfast already her reply was: "in that case you know that you need to come first and queue up and bag will not be taken". It was said in a very rude way and I don't think it's right at all for easyJet to force people to do so when you are traveling only with hand luggage. At least the man that took my bag made me smile.

### "flight was really enjoyable"
Berlin SXF to Barcelona with easyJet on a one year old A320 reg. G-EZWU. Despite the horrible airport of SXF and sitting in my least prefered last row, the flight was really enjoyable. We departed about ten minutes late but arrived thirty minutes before the scheduled arrival time. New black seats although not reclining, are very comfy on short haul flights. The crew were very friendly and professional. Captain welcomed us onboard and gave detailed information about altitude, winds and the views we would see as the sun was setting when we took off. It was quite a while since I've flown easyJet but after this flight I will consider them a good alternative to other airlines like Vueling or Lufthansa on this route. The only problem was the completely chaotic boarding handled by BER Ground Services.

### "stringent cabin luggage policy"
Lyon to Luton with easyJet. Worst system! I paid for hold luggage while checkin in and they charge me again at the airport. No consideration for their system failure. Now spending time getting my money back. Plus a very stringent cabin luggage policy. It's better to go with other budget airlines.

### "wide seats, newish planes"
Paris Orly to Nice. easyJet has fantastic staff and is a great airline. Arrived super late at the gate and had already closed the corridor but the ground staff still let me in the place since the plane door hadn't been closed - couldn't have been happier because that was the last flight for the evening. Overall very nice flight, wide seats, very newish planes and probably one of the best airlines in the world in their category. Of course you pay for food and drinks but for short distance flights, it's really not an issue considering that planes are new and on time. Congratulations to the ground staff in Paris-Orly for being so good.

### "staff efficient"
Two good flights with easyJet to Isle of Man from Liverpool, took off in fog but quick and safe flight captain warned us we would brake sharply on landing due to short runway and was managed well. Return flight slightly delayed because captain had to inspect the outside of plane as ground crew were concerned. Provided full explanation and was very reassuring. Staff efficient, plane clean and leg room reasonable.

### "had no refreshment facilities"
Flew from Belfast International to Gatwick. If I can avoid travelling with easyJet again I will. Flight should have left Belfast 18.10, 17th Dec 2016, eventually took off at 9.50pm. My son was flying to Canada the next morning and we had arranged dinner, but that was all hit on the head. We got a card with £3 to get a coffee. My husband and I eventually got into Gatwick at 11pm and had to grab food from an M & S store and take it back to the hotel. Return flight should have left Gatwick at 1.55pm, Sunday 18th Dec 2016 but didn't take off until 4.40pm. We were herded into a departure lounge that had no refreshment facilities, not even a vending machine. Never again.

### "a very satisfactory experience"
Arrived at Málaga airport to find no queue at the bag drop counter, and the clerk confirmed the flight was on time and told me the boarding gate. I went to the boarding gate 45 minutes before departure time and the flight was already boarding with no queue, although we were waitiing in the airbridge for a short time. This allowed all passengers to have boarded and stowed their cabin bags before the scheduled departure time and the flight took off promptly. It was the first time I had flown with easyJet since they introduced the non-reclining seats and I found the leg room much better and the seat more comfortable than the old ones. I didn't buy any food or drink onboard but the crew managed to offer two trolley services during the short flight which seemed very efficient. The plane landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule and there was only a very short wait to collect my bag. All in all a very satisfactory experience.

### "good and well priced flights"
Newcastle to Berlin. EasyJet do as they say on the tin. Very good and well priced flights that all were on time and on clean modern aircraft. What more does anybody want? Shame they fly into Berlin Schonefeld though as that really is an airport desperate for the end but apart from that I will be flying EasyJet again.

### "the service needs to improve"
Stansted to Edinburgh. Flight delayed and there was no apology. We were kept waiting on the steps of the plane in the cold. I had to clean my seat as it was dirty. I will not fly with easyjet again as this is not the first time and the service needs to improve.

### "look forward to next flight"
I can't fathom how many times I have used easyJet and over the past 2 years they have become better and better. For my flight from Edinburgh to Copenhagen, we left on time, had a great crew and the aircraft was clean and felt quite new. I look forward to my next flight with easyJet!

### "not impressed with EasyJet"
Used easyjet for years with no problems but this flight had a farcical ending. Pilot had 2 failed attempts at landing in Gibraltar due to wind so we diverted to Malaga but after a few minutes diverted to Seville with the excuse it was windy at Malaga too. Landed at Seville and were kept on the plane for over an hour while they worked out what to do. Could not go back to Gibraltar as weather worsened. Eventually bussed back to Gibraltar which took 3 hrs and finally arrived there at 8pm instead of 11.55am. At no point were we offered a drink or food on the plane - unless we paid for it. A goodwill gesture of free food or drink would have made a huge difference. The next day we discovered that both flights after ours had landed in Gibraltar and all flights into Malaga had also landed - why couldn't our pilot? I am aware landing at Gibraltar can be hazardous and have been diverted to Malaga on one occasion a few years ago but the detour we had to endure seemed pointless and totally unnecessary. All I have had from easyjet is a text thanking me for my understanding! We are not impressed with easyjet and their pilot skills or their customer care on this occasion.

### "a toxic airline"
Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2016. A four hour delay in Liverpool airport escalated into a cancellation, and then led to us being advised that we would have to take trains to London and stay in a hotel overnight in order to disrupt our holiday the least. We were reassured that we would receive reimbursement for the above, only to be told after over four months of correspondence that in fact the answer is no, we won't be receiving any such thing, leaving us over £300 out of pocket and with a head full of bad memories! Truly a toxic airline, average at best when things go right, but EasyJet merely shrug any blame or responsibility off as soon as anything goes wrong.

### "great experience with EasyJet"
Gatwick to Barcelona, and a great experience with Easyjet. The whole process using the phone app was a delight and easy. The staff at Gatwick were friendly, the plane was clean and cabin crew very friendly and helpful as well. I normally try and use BA, but after this great experience as well as being a lot cheaper, I will be looking to use Easyjet in the future.

### "plane was very clean"
We flew on a return trip from Southend to Faro. We didn't book our bags into the hold as we didn't know you had to, so ended up paying for them at the airport, however we paid for them on the way back so it was cheaper. We flew on the early flight at 6.35 so didn't expect the cabin crew to be too nice however they were very friendly and willing to help. We didn't try the food and drink on either flight so cannot comment on it. On the way back at Faro the plane had not come in yet so we were all told to go and wait in a room looking over the airport to wait for the arrival of the other plane and everyone to get off. The plane was very clean so well done cabin crew. Not a lot of leg room but that is expected on a budget flight. EasyJet was good for a budget plane, would recommend.

### "good leg-room for a budget airline"
Cheap fares came up so we booked it about 6 weeks before. Easyjet have good on board baggage allowance which is one of the reasons we choose it and the fact that they fly to Southend during the winter from Tenerife. Checked in online - easy. Bag drop only took about 15 mins but unfortunately we weren't told of the 50 minute delay which they must have know about as it was the inbound flight that was delayed so we could have sat outside in the sun for a bit longer. Gate came up as if flight was on time so everyone gathered and We stood there for 50 minutes wondering why we weren't boarding. That's my only complaint. Once on board. Good leg-room for a budget airline. Food and drinks Ok (including hot tea). We were amongst the last off and had quite a wait to get through Southend passport control but you cant blame Easyjet for that.

### "fly with Easyjet again"
Flew from Gatwick to Budapest and back. Unfortunately as we were at the back of the queue at Gatwick our suitcases had to go in the hold but as it took us ages to get through passport control at Budapest our suitcases were already waiting for us. Both flights were on time Would fly with Easyjet again.

### "better than I expected"
The easyJet flight from Berlin-Schönefeld to Barcelona was great. The plane departed on time and the flight was better than I expected. The cabin staff was very friendly and the seats are comfortable enough. The legroom was better than legroom in other low-cost flights. I had to pay for my seat and for the food. But the focaccia I have bought for 3.5€ was hot and very delicious. Juice for 3€ was a bit expensive if you compare it with the good price of the focaccia but it was also good. The small room where I had to wait before Boarding was not comfortable because I did not have a seat for 10 minutes. Like in other low-cost or regional airlines there was no IFE but for 2.5 hours it was okay. The value for money was good but other low-cost carriers are much cheaper with the same service.

### "employees ignorant attitude"
Liverpool to Berlin. We booked to go to Berlin outgoing on 29th of October and all went well till the departure gate when we were told one item of hand luggage was over sized and we would have to pay extra for it to go in the hold and the price would be £45. We elected to pay with a card which didn't please the female staff member as she didn't have a card reader and with my wifes card on display for all to see she wrote out a receipt giving every passenger in close proximity a clear view of the numbers. When my wife objected to this it was made clear to her that this was frowned upon and we could be banned from the flight. For our return on 1st November the staff in Berlin were totally different and my own bag was put in the hold free of charge to free up cabin space. On checking I have found that along with others easyJet changed their policy on hand luggage a while back and while I accept we were wrong, the company and it's employees ignorant attitude and primitive methods leave a very bad taste and we will not go with them again.

### "journey was uneventful"
Flew easyJet from Amsterdam to Luton. The plane was full so my cabin baggage was put in the hold even though it was the correct easyJet size. The plane was about an hour late departing. This did not cause me any problems. The return journey was uneventful. However, contrary to the information given, some passengers had more than one piece of hand luggage. easyJet is a good low cost carrier and I have never had any problems to date except for extreme weather or an erupting volcano.

### "totally bad experience"
Luton to Copenhagen with easyJet. Poor service. Still on the ground writing this review while the cabin crew run around like headless chickens trying to off-load bags. This airline lets customers take a big bag in the cabin rather than let them put them in the hold, then spends 30 mins off-loading luggage that does not fit. Net result is we don't take off and still sit on ground. Easy does not describe them. Poor quality airport, poor quality planes and poor quality service. I pity the poor people who work for them in service. Totally bad experience.

### "paying extra made this flight fine"
Gatwick to Hamburg. Paying the extra for premium boarding and baggage made this flight just fine. I avoided the fights over bags, seats and other chaos that occurred around me. The in flight magazine looked like paper ready to use in a bush toilet. The staff looked a bit frazzled but all in all a fun flight. Worth paying extra.

### "cannot praise easyJet enough"
Newcastle to Faro. We cannot praise easyJet enough. We make at least 4 return European flights every year and they have never failed to deliver. You get what you pay for in respect of seat space and lack of entertainment but you get exactly what it says on the box. Cabin staff are just fantastic and do their very best to deal with some of the passengers on board. In our last 20 flights, only 2 have been delayed and by less than an hour in each case. We have had no problems with cabin baggage as we make sure our cases are within the size limit. As far as hold luggage goes, we have actually sent a generator, and a washing machine from UK to Portugal with no problems. We have no reservations in recommending easyJet.

### "extremely good value"
Flew Bristol to Amsterdam 17th October returning 21st October. Boarding was quick and easy although flights were full both ways. Aircraft cabin clean and tidy,  crew friendly and professional. Flight crew provided warm welcome with route and weather details. Flights on time both ways. Seat comfortable with ample leg room. Booked ticket 1 month in advance so extremely good value.

### "not be flying them again"
Gatwick to Chania. When my partner and I previously flew easyJet, we were crammed into tiny seats with no legroom at all, and were told we would have to pay extra to be moved up front (even though the seats were empty and the attendant could clearly see my partner, at 6'7", was clearly far too tall for the regular seats). As a result this time we paid an additional fee for exit row seats, which included 'speedy boarding'. Firstly, there was no speedy boarding. We had the privilege of showing our tickets at the gate ahead of other passengers, only to be kept waiting in the corridor for about 20 minutes before everyone was allowed to swarm towards the plane. We were then shocked to find our so-called 'exit row' seats were almost exactly the same as regular seats, with maybe an extra inch of legroom. I shudder to think what would happen in an actual emergency, as there would certainly be very little room for passengers to swiftly evacuate the plane this way. We endured almost as much discomfort as on previous flights, and could not believe we had been made to pay for such a joke. And as with every easyJet flight, I find it ridiculous that we have to pay for hold luggage, when on every flight I have ever taken with them somebody at the gate has announced that the plane is 'too full' for everyone's cabin baggage and invited people to check theirs in. An utter rip-off. Will not be flying with them again.

### "great service from EasyJet"
Berlin to Glasgow. Great service from Easyjet. Well organised boarding in Berlin. Bought an up front seat which gives free speedy boarding with the seat and an extra bag. Plenty of room for bags onboard as ground crew where proactive at asking for voluntary bags to go into the hold. Cabin crew where very professional and quick service with the drinks service. Flight took off on time and arrived early into Glasgow.

### "easyJet are ripping you off"
Corfu to Gatwick. It is known at Corfu airport that passengers are bused out to and from the aircraft. Therefore, when being bused out - easyJet are ripping you off for the "Speedy Boarding" fee as they is no option to speedy board - just chaos. Then when you write to them to seek a refund, they say they are not responsible for the "airport atmosphere" - Go Figure? They must conduct an assessment at Corfu annually, therefore, they are aware of what the "airport atmosphere" is! Their answer to this is not acceptable and I am just making people aware of their "rip-off - not interested" attitude!

### "customer service disgraceful"
On 18th March myself and three members of my family traveled with easyJet from Liverpool to Barcelona, and our return flight was cancelled. Receipts were kept of expenses incurred, but seven months later the claim is still not resolved. Staff shocking, customer service disgraceful and would never recommend the airline to anyone. The whole experience has been traumatic and easyJet and it's staff unbelievably bad.

### "5 months to get reimbursement"
My Gatwick to Amsterdam flight with easyJet was cancelled less than 3 hours before the departure time. I called them immediately after receiving the news and was told to book an alternate flight by other airline to Amsterdam because there isn't any other available flight to Amsterdam on the same day. I cross checked with two customer service personnel and they promised that easyJet will fully reimburse me as long as the alternate flight I book is of Economy Class. I followed their instructions and it took me all in all around 25 emails, 10 long phone calls, and 5 months in order to get my reimbursement.

### "much improved service"
Flew Stansted to Majorca. Much improved service from last time I flew with easyJet. Flight on time, staff polite and knowledgable. Food and beverages not too overpriced. Like the layout of the A320, plenty of leg room and fold down table doesn't pertrude into your stomach. Also by not being able to recline the seat it is less annoying to other passengers.

### "polite and nice staff"
I flew with my family from Milan Malpensa to Catania and back. Everything ok, flight on time both going and returning. Polite and nice staff. This was my first time with easyJet, but certainly I will use again. This was the first flight for my 8 year old son and he was thrilled.

### "saying the cheque is in the mail"
Manchester to Belfast. Flight was cancelled due to strike in France. Compensation was to be sent which we have never received and the airline keeps saying the cheque is in the mail. Also, they promised to send me a credit for insurance I didn't want which I still have not received. easyJet charter sets out what customers should expect when they travel with easyJet which I find ironic.

### "got the classic bait and switch"
We got the classic bait and switch carrying our bags onto the plane. Paid extra so we could bring standard-sized carry-on bags on board, were told they were fine when we checked in, but when we got to the gate were told one of them was too big. Because we were forced to check at the gate they charged an extra fee, so the $80 to check the bag was almost more than the cost of the ticket. What a racket. What's worse, when I contacted them to complain they simply replied (after weeks of waiting and multiple contact attempts) that this was standard policy. The flight itself made us feel like we were living in an infomercial with the flight attendants selling all kinds of junk up and down the aisles.

### "ineptitude by ground services"
We have flown numerously with EasyJet and nearly every time they have run out of hot food. If it was once or twice I would be happy to say 'that's life' but I think this last flight was the straw that broke the camel's back. The cabin service was appalling as the crew spent more time in the galley than looking after their customers. It is only a 2.5 hour flight from Faro and they eventually came to us nearly two hours into the flight only again to say there was no hot food left. All I want to know is, is this a company policy to carry limited supplies, which surely is false advertising, or is it just ineptitude by ground services? I don't expect 'a golden service' but I do expect to able to except what is advertised on offer.

### "will not be using them again"
Today my wife and I flew easyJet from Vienna to London and I have to say that this was the worst flight I have been on. 1.5 hours late due to the cabin door not closing and traffic control. There was nothing provided to the customers such as tea or coffee while we waited and even had to ask for landing cards. What terrible service. Would not recommend them and I certainly will not be using them again myself.

### "think twice about using Easyjet"
Gatwick to Sofia with easyJet. Have travelled many times on this route and pay extra for speedy boarding. Always great at Gatwick but non existent at Sofia. It's always a free for all getting on the plane. The man in front of us was an Easyjet cabin crew trainer who was going to take this up when we got home so he would have confirmed what had happened. We have complained many times asking for a refund of our speedy boarding fee but have been told that they will use this as feedback and never reimburse this fee. Is this not taking money under false pretences if there's no speedy boarding on the return flight? Have since been back to Sofia and used Wizzair, speedy boarding both ways brilliant! Will think twice about using Easyjet in the future!

### "very convenient transportation service"
The easyJet flight from Milan-Malpensa (MXP) to Rome-Fiumicino (FCO) takes less than one hour, so the inevitable discomfort of somewhat limited elbow room and legroom is acceptable. The flight was a few minutes early at takeoff and several minutes early at landing, service being limited - both ground an onboard - to the very essential, there is little to comment. Overall, a simplified, reliable and very convenient transportation service.

### "communication is very poor"
Flew easyJet from Luton to Palma. Delays with both outward and return flights, no explanation until you are on the plane, communication is very poor, attitude seems to be you are lucky to be going at all, never mind the affect of the delays with very young children travelling. Also flew with easyJet in June and last November and was delayed on those flights, do any flights take run on time? Customer service could be much better if communication improved and less delays.

### "I can no longer recommend them"
I fly EasyJet weekly between London and Budapest so have accumulated a representative view of their service on this route, and tonight's flight from Budapest to London is not unusual. It's cheap, they fly to Gatwick, planes are new and crew professional and friendly. The flights are almost always late, due to ground handling issues. Twice this week, I have been delayed (1 hour tonight, 2.5 hours Monday) due to the water not being cleared and replaced on the aircraft when it should. On Monday this resulted in me getting to my apartment 3 hours late at 1am. Tonight this resulted in passengers flushing the toilets manually using bottles of mineral water provided by the crew and using a hand sanitiser to "wash" hands. For the second time this week, there was also no hot or cold food. Tonight, not for the first time, we were then dropped at the South Terminal at Gatwick rather than the North as scheduled, leaving people to find their way to their cars, taxis or friends at the other terminal. I have now reached the point where if I have a choice of airline on a route, I will choose another than EasyJet, even if it costs substantially more. I used to be a fan of EasyJet, but having become a regular flyer with them over the last year, I can no longer recommend them.

### "bag drop took 50 minutes"
Barcelona to Bristol with easyJet. The bag drop at Barcelona took 50 minutes with only one desk open for non speedy boarding or disabled passengers. Is this to encourage passengers to pay for speedy boarding? The flight itself was on time and the crew were excellent. The pilot gave information about the flight and the service was efficient.

### "it was good value for money"
One-way trip from Amsterdam - Luton with easyJet. Everything went fine on this short hop, from start to finish. Plane clean and flight on time. Bags were waiting for me when I arrived at the baggage claim area. First-time experience with this budget airline and I thought it was good value for money.

### "most costly experience"
London Gatwick to Malaga. Worst and most costly experience with any airline, hands down. They overbooked my flight, so I got to watch my plane board for 25 minutes before it left without me. Then they wanted to charge me 80 pounds to get on a later flight, with no guarantee of having a seat. Ultimately, I had to buy a ticket from another airline and easyjet wouldn't reimburse anything. Customer service people were embarrased and tired of being yelled at for just cause. I will never use this terrible company again.

### "no more easyJet"
London to Athens return. Late by well over an hour both ways. Chaotic boarding and slow cabin service. No value to cost of ticket so back to a professional carrier for me. Budget airlines are only worth the discomfort and impersonal service if they are punctual. The additional cost of BA would have represented real value to me. So, no more easyJet.

### "pleasant easyJet experience"
Bristol to Murcia return. Pleasant easyJet experience on both sectors at both check-in/bag drop and at boarding gates. Cabin crew were pleasant and professional. No hard sell of food or non-food items. Which was just as well as on outbound sector they could not offer any hot breakfast food and on inbound sector (lunchtime) no sandwiches were available. I prefer the relative comfort of easyJet's A319 seats compared to Ryanair's 737-800 seats. Seat pitch on the A319 was more than adequate for me (1m 78cm) for a 2.5 hour trip. Bags were quickly onto carousel on both sectors. About 15-20 minutes late on return due to thick fog at BRS.

### "happy to use easyjet again"
Edinburgh to Gatwick. Hassle free online booking. Good prices compared to our alternatives. Inconsistent approach to hand baggage. (My wife was able to board with a small handbag in addition to a smaller than regulation carry on, on one leg, though not on the return, requiring us to repack our bags at the gate). Disappointed that easyjet did not park at an airbridge requiring passengers to negociate several flights of stairs at EDI. Efficient boarding with passengers seated 15 minutes before departure time. Reasonable choice of snacks and drinks and an efficient crew were able to get everything done on the short flight. Both flights sustained traffic delays but they did their best to make up the time. Overall a good flight with good value for money and we'd be happy to use Easyjet again in the future.

### "never book again with easyJet"
After two and a half hours delay, flight departed at 23:30. So I had to book a hotel to stay in the night because there whould be no transport at the time of the arrival. In the last moment they changed the arrival airport from Orly airport to Charles de Gaule. So my hotel booking was useless and I would have to stay in the airport sleeping in a chair. Of course I had to go to work the next morning. The departure was even more late because the aircraft had a mechanical problem. I will never book again with easyJet, and I strongly believe that airlines shouldn't treat people this way just because they don't want to reimbourse the cancellation of a flight they are not able to carry out.

### "friendly and helpful assistance"
Gatwick to Fuerteventura. As a disabled traveler I should like to thank the airport and aircraft staff for their friendly and helpful assistance at the airport and on board the aircraft. I had been very anxious as to how I would cope with flying. The female pilots on the return flight to LGW took the time to show my two grandsons the flight deck and answered their numerous questions in a very professional and friendly manner. The cabin crew are a credit to EasyJet, helpful, friendly and made the journey stress free.

### "now it simply is a cattle transport"
Flew Palermo to London Gatwick. Excessive delays with not enough info provided during my last 4 flights with easyJet. The last two times we incurred over two hours delay due to "passenger removal" and security checks. Only water provided during the long waiting on the plane. They used to do food service with two trolleys: one starting from the front and one starting from the back of the aircraft. They now start with two trolleys from the front and no sandwiches are available when reaching the last five seating rows. Disgraceful. No interest whatsoever if there are small children. It used to be a very good company, now it simply is a cattle transport. I and my family will never use easyJet ever again. Quite frankly the tickets are in reason of 200/250 GBP per person every time we travel so not interesting anymore for this kind of dis-service.

### "speedy boarding was very useful "
Marrakech to London Gatwick. Flight was delayed because of two idiot who was fighting in the air causing the inbound flight to be diverted to Madrid. Arrived 2hrs after the normal take off. Then it got delayed again because of a French issue. Nothing was said in the airport but once we went on the aircraft, the pilot told us everything and offered us a free soft drink. Took off at 13:00. We arrived at London at 16:45. Got speedy boarding which was very useful and first selection of drinks.

### "service was very good though"
A very nice flight with easyJet from Hamburg to Catania. Check-In at Hamburg was very quick, the staff were friendly and helpful. Flight was very punctual and boarding was very quick. I did however not get the seat that was on my boarding pass as it was in an exit row. Crew would not let me sit there. The service was very good though. I can recommend this airline.

### "we are entitled to nothing"
easyJet flight from Majorca to Gatwick was delayed by 4 and half hours. Our taxi driver back in England found out before we did. Was told at the airport it was due to a plane mechanical at first. Then told no staff so had to borrow staff from Belfast and Luton and send them over on an empty plane. Got told at the airport we were all entitled to £250 each. The lady at the desk even rang her manager to double check. Now back home being told were getting nothing as it was extraordinary circumstances and we are entitled to nothing. They gave us food vouchers. However the plane had basically no food onboard.

### "return flight was 100% better"
Gatwick to Milan Malpensa return. Very disappointing outbound flight. Cabin crew rude and uninterested. PA's were inaudible and service was delivered without a smile. Return flight was 100% better; happy, friendly cabin crew who obviously enjoy their jobs. Based on the return flight I would fly easyJet again.

### "won't be using them again"
We were recently due to be flying with easyjet from London Gatwick to Glasgow to attend an event we had previously booked. The flight started off as being delayed for a couple of hours which we didn't think much of, then eventually ended up being canceled for a completely unrelated issue. I stress unrelated as they don't have to pay out compensation if it is for a particular reason to do with air traffic control, with conveniently it was. Regardless of wether we are entitled to compensation or not we are entitled to a refund of our flight ticket although they still don't seem to want to even pay that out. Five emails back and forth and getting board of hearing how sorry they are for the inconvenience. Definitely would not recommend this airline, I wouldn't have expected much from them by their price but now just feel conned from them. Wish we had done our research before as sounds like getting your mone back from easyjet is never easy and in many cases not possible. Certainly won't be using them again.

### "ticket price is no longer competitive"
Frequent flyer but recently tried easyJet for first time because of the cheap last minute tickets. Huge mistake. I've never had a worse flight experience. The flight (Barcelona to Basel) was an hour late leaving the gate because of some technical breakdown. Once we started taxiing it took more than 30 min to get off the ground. Not clear why the taxi took so long but we could have driven around the entire airport several times in that time. They have luggage requirements different from all other airlines. They appear to make all of their money running this luggage con. You can only have a single piece of luggage. They don't tell you during the long wait in line either. They purposely wait until you are just about to board so you don't have time to re-arrange your luggage. If you do manage to consolidate your luggage, they are waiting and ready to throw the other shoe at you: oh that luggage is too bulky and/or heavy. They charge you 60€ to check an extra bag. It is that or miss your flight. They are not even polite about it. 6 of us got caught in exactly the same way on this flight. After that, the ticket price is no longer competitive. Adding insult to injury, the luggage bins in the cabin are huge and could easily fit luggage much larger than ours and we flew with them all half empty. Nothing free is offered in flight to eat or drink. What they do sell is grossly over priced. The last straw was at the arrival, walking up and down stairs with droves of other people down long tunnels. Additionally, they took forever to send the luggage to the belt at destination basically guaranteeing we would miss our train at the destination. We are dreading the return flight which will be tomorrow. Never again.

### "when it goes wrong, lookout"
We arrived at Toulouse airport 11th July, to find our flight 21.50 flight to Gatwick delayed, and nothing open in the terminal, not even drinking water available. Flight eventually left at 1am next morning, so should be home shortly. Apparently previous crew had run out of flying hours so a replacement crew had to be drafted in to get us home. The plane starts to descend to land at Gatwick, wheels down and then a steep pull up, full power and we are back up, pilot then tells us that as we are so late the main runway is closed for repairs so he attempted to land on second runway but due to bad lighting and visibility he aborted landing. He was then going to circle for 15 mins while they re-opened the main runway. Next announcement was "welcome to Stansted". We were then told to wait on the plane while they sorted coaches for onward travel. 20 mins later were we told to make our way to arrivals for the transport home but once we were in arrivals we were then told to make our own way home (2am in the morning) and seek compensation on the EasyJet website. We eventually arrived back in Gatwick at 9am, another day off work. So far, now 22nd August, despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation, no refund of our bus fares, no explanation. EasyJet Customer Service is anything but a customer service. They have employed every tactic to not give us a straight answer. When everything is ok, they give a good service, when it goes wrong, lookout. In reality we could have flown 1st class on BA for what it has actually cost us for these "cheap" seats.

### "comfort not high on the agenda"
Amsterdam to London Stansted with easyJet. They are not kidding when they sell themselves as a budget airline. If you are aware of this fact, and what it entails, then you know they will get you to where you are going, quickly and fairly efficiently, but that comfort and convenience are not high on the agenda. Their ground facilities will be using the worst and most out-of-they way parts of the airport they are flying to and from (in my case Terminal H from Schiphol, which is the least pleasant part of the airport, despite being relatively new, and London Stansted, of which many more passengers than I have already fittingly described on this site). Any extra service above getting you and only you to your destination will have to be paid for. However, the aircraft themselves seem clean enough, and for short haul flights are adequate.

### "boarding is not organized"
Efficient flight from Bristol to Paris CDG. Lounge (Espire plus at Bristol) was mediocre. Flight itself both outbound and return took off and landed on time. This was my main priority for this flight and on this aspect easyJet delivered. I wouldn't be keen to take a longer flight or indeed bring my children on board. Boarding is not organized. But for time keeping they seem to deliver. They don't clean the plane between flights and this keeps the times punctual. So in summary a safe and punctual flight.

### "the seat is very thin"
Luton to Amsterdam. Flight took off 15 minutes late, and landed at around 6:48, ahead of scheduled time. It seems that easyjet does not clean the aircraft, the seat is very thin, like a bus. only hand luggage is allowed free of charge. Although easyjet is a budget airline, my return ticket still costs more than 100 pounds.

### "we were left stranded"
We were unfortunate enough to have travelled on easyJet flight EZY8612 from Malaga to London Gatwick on 27th March which was diverted to Liverpool. After the flight delay, which exceeded 3 hours, on leaving Malaga we were subsequently unable to land at Gatwick because the weather had deteriorated. No reasonable explanation was given for the delay. Regarding the issues with our flight it was almost unbelievable that we were left stranded at Liverpool airport with no arrangements made for our onward travel to Gatwick. Even more outrageous was the fact that the airline was continuing to charge passengers for food and drink on board while we were being held for hours on the tarmac before disembarking at Liverpool. We have never experienced an organisation that appears to reagrd its customers with such contempt. We won't be using easyJet ever again and would advise others not to use them unless they are willing to accept this kind of service.

### "Well done easyJet"
Well done easyJet. Have to say that I'm pretty surprised with flying easyJet. We sat in a new aircraft (A320), with thin seats which provided some extra legroom. Boarding in Amsterdam and Prague was pretty good, especially in Amsterdam because the M gates are seperated of the rest of the gates. The cabin crew provided an overall good service on both flights.

### "helpful service was non-existent"
We booked a summer vacation to Europe - landing in Paris. We used EasyJet to book airfare from Paris-Barcelona-Paris and a week later for Paris-Napes-Paris. Trip to Barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal, onto busses, then to a plane on tarmac - similar debark in Barcelona. Inconvenient, slow. On the return trip, an EasyJet staffer pulled us out of line, measured our bags. One bag was 1" too long. She said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. We were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. Later looking online, it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bag/purse per passenger is general, but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carry-on bag is allowed. Very confusing. I can embrace the concept of a low-cost carrier but be clear about what you're not offering. Not even water, soda, juice or crackers was provided. Seats do not recline. Friendly helpful service was non-existent. Staff at BCN to help with complaints did not exist either. Worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight - we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. Had I not happen to wake up and check my phone at 3:30am, we would have been totally screwed. As it was, I spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 one-way tickets to Naples. EasyJet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. The return flight was an Air France flight. That wasn't cancelled. So, now I needed one-way tickets (expensive) and last minute (even more expensive). What did EasyJet offer in compensation? They would rebook me (at no charge) another flight to Naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. Two issues. Next available EasyJet flight was 5 days later (bye-bye vacation). Value as for 1/2 round fair purchased a month ago. I will never fly EasyJet again. Wish I could rate lower than a 1. For the last kick in the pants, EasyJet also booked my rental car. Though I was clearly booking a 7 day trip to Naples, they only reserved the rental car for 1 day.

### "disgraceful attitude of staff onboard"
I travelled from Belfast International to Malaga on 17th May of this year with Easyjet. Tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall I found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. In normal circumstances I could endure this for a short three hour flight, however, a fate would have it the seat in front wouldn't stay in an upright position - it was in a permanent reclining position - it was broken. I asked the Stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do, which was reasonable. She seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so I sat with the Lady in front practically sitting on my lap. After a couple of hours I decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane, and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. So I sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. The Chief Stewardess rudely asked me why I was sitting there so I told her that row 16 seat was broken. She said I would have to pay extra to sit at the front so I asked her if I would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours - she said not and that I would have to return to my broken seat. As a matter of principle I refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to Row 16. On my return home I sent a complaint to Easyjet on 29th May. I received the following response right back "Dear easyJet Customer Thank you for contacting easyJet via our online form. We aim to reply to you within 3days, although in busy periods this may be longer. We’ll be in touch soon. Regards, easyJet Customer Services". That was on 29th May 2016 - it is now 3rd August 2016, almost ten weeks later and I haven't heard anything more from Easyjet. Seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesn't surprise me one little bit. I am a reasonable person who realises that things go wrong now and then but the disgraceful attitude of staff onboard and the total ignoring of my post-flight complaint proves to me that Customer Service is very low on the priority list.

### "an hour delayed in flights"
Booked a weekend in Bristol travelling from Bristol to Glasgow with easyJet. On both legs of the journey at least an hour delayed in flights. No explanation given. Speaking to other travellers this seems par for the course. Will definitely take the train or drive next time.

### "Speedy Boarding a real bonus"
Gatwick to Arrecife return. Outward leg was delayed slightly but made up the time and landed a little ahead of schedule. Bought a nice cup of coffee and a bottle of water - not too expensive and nice coffee. Had an exit row seat which was just right for my lanky legs I did not mind paying extra for this plus, being allowed to print boarding passes well in advance is nice as you can relax knowing you won't be bumped out of your seat (as happened to me in March with Iberia Express). Return leg five days later was also in an exit row seat with the added extra of Speedy Boarding on both legs a real bonus. The plane seemed newer and if anything, even more generous with legroom. Seat OK for the 3.5 hours flight. Two bar services and a decent red wine made this a pleasurable flight. I have never had a negative experience with Easyjet and will continue to use them so long as the price is right.

### "overall decent flight"
We flew easyJet from Luton to Catania on the first day of the UK summer holidays. Luton airport is a joke but the airline do there best to compensate for this. When we arrived at the Bag drop desk there were no queues, and we were greeted by a friendly agent, who offered to check in all of our cabin bags for free. When we got to the Gate, however there are so many staff who are just stood there waiting to pounce on people with more than 1 bag, quite disgusting really. The flight was delayed for 15 mins because a family were having an argument with the agents about paying 50 euros for bringing 2 items with them. We were bused out to the waiting aircraft, the cabin crew were friendly, overall decent flight, landed in Catania only 5 mins late, and again taken by bus to the terminal.

### "we are still late and ignorant"
Verona to Gatwick easyJet flight delayed by more than an hour. No explanation from the airport PA system. I have the mobile app that says flight delayed because of necessary maintenance work before take off at Gatwick. What does that mean? The app maybe be cool but adds nothing to the passenger experience. We are still late and ignorant.

### "extra legroom was worth it"
My first time on easyJet. I paid for extra legroom which was worth it, the seat a bit narrow but I am not slim! Boarding was quick. Delay of 30 minutes on the ground but the flight arrived only 10 minutes late. Cup of tea satisfactory - did not try anything else. Friendly crew - I was not allowed to put anything under the seat in front of me for takeoff or landing but the crew looked after and returned it. Note, passenger sitting on the aisle seat. The smell of hard-boiled eggs between eaten was horrible. Please refrain. I would fly easyJet again.

### "I wouldn't fly with easyJet again"
Gatwick to Edinburgh. After delays of 2 hours, which is quite good for easyjet, our gate was announced. This was where the drama started. We went to gate 55D which was the same gate the Glasgow flight which had been called earlier. After about half an hour of trying to figure out who was at gate 55D they decided to move the Edinburgh passengers. They moved us to gate 54 which was back through the check in desk. On getting there we were told we could get through. So the 100 or so passengers were trapped in a glass corridor in the blistering heat. After another half an hour they decided to move us in to what looked like a departure lounge that time forgot. Basically seats and that was it. I asked one time during the next half hour if could visit the bathroom and was told no. When an announcement finally came. The first one of the day I hasten to add the the flight was cancelled. We then had to wait about an hour until they decided to escort us out of the airport through passport control, even though we were domestic which took another half hour. After finally getting out of departures we were expected to stand in a queue for cutover services with one person on the desk. I'm pretty sure I would have been there 2 days later which ironically was the next flight they were offering. I know eastJet is cheap but if it wasn't my company that booked the flights I wouldn't fly with easyjet ever again.

### "flight delayed by 4 hours"
Second time I take this easyJet route from Geneva to Berlin and 2nd time the flight is delayed by 4 hours. Absolutely no information was given and the service is bad. Avoid easyjet when possible. They don't even apologize which is after 4 hours waiting kinda upsetting. They sell for cheap but did not deliver on their process.

### "a disgruntled easyJet customer"
I fly with easyJet at least three times per week. Yesterday's flight from Edinburgh to Gatwick was delayed by an hour. We then lost time for some unknown reason and arrived even later. When we arrived at Gatwick the pilot couldn't park the plane and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a tug to push the plane into position to enable the jetty to be attached. If I wasn't tired and hungry it would have been comical. Today boarding should have commenced 50 minutes ago, we have been left standing for 50 minutes with absolutely no explanation in the sweltering heat of the departure lounge. So it looks like my return journey will have a similar farcical delay. If you are flying the Edinburgh to Gatwick route, do yourself a favour and use British Airways. You will be surprised how similar the fares are. And for the record, I am not a British Airways employee, I am a disgruntled Easyjet customer. In conclusion, I only have myself to blame for booking a flight with Easyjet, I guess it's time for me to practice what I preach.

### "you get what you pay for"
Flew from Copenhagen to Manchester. It's the old adage that you get what you pay for. EasyJet is a very cheap way to travel by air. And that's what you have to remember. EasyJet - by the looks of it - is shoved to the furthest part of the airports presumably for cheaper renting space. The staff seem adequately trained but a little distant and indifferent but they do get you through with little fuss. You have to permanently keep reminding yourself when travelling with EasyJet (or any other super low-cost airline) that you're flying at a fraction of the cost of other airlines and that you should always bare that in mind no matter what. There is no airs and graces with them and you'll be expected to shuffle along with the pack with almost no service or attention paid to you. That said, they are quite quick and efficient.

### "yet another delayed flight"
Due to fly London Southend to Amsterdam. Yet another easyJet delayed flight due to "technical issues", second one from Southend in a week? 4 hour delay at 7.25am, perhaps someone at easyJet maintenance should set an earlier alarm to make sure passengers don't lose half their break in a departure lounge.

### "try to rip you off"
I am extremely frustrated with easyJet after our flight from Paris to Nice. Not only was this an expensive flight for a short trip in Europe but the attendants at the gate were very rude. The website says that you have to pay 60€ for an extra bag (in a subtle way), so you must know that going into it. Unfortunately, we did not know this policy until we get to the gate and they aggressively asked for our money. After traveling throughout Europe for some time, we have never had any problem with our baggage. Most airlines have allowed one small bag and one overhead bag, so while we still have all of that luggage, we have to pay for what they already have space for on their flight. Furthermore, once we had boarded the flight, we noticed ample space in all of the overhead luggage compartments for the bags while they had specifically said at the gate that due to the full flight, they could not fit our baggage. They charge you for all food and beverages as well. The policies this airline holds are frankly absurd as they try to rip you off. Definitely not worth what you pay for. They advertise themselves as a cheap airlines while instead you will probably have to pay the price of a much nicer flight. However, they do leave on time and their boarding process goes quickly.

### "delayed departure"
Flew easyJet from Venice to Luton. Delayed departure for muffled reason. Captain sounded competent. Cabin crew had a novel rule - cannot use a blanket if seated at an emergency exit. Landing was quite wobbly, apparently due to blustery wind. On arrival, bags took unbelievably long to arrive: 80 minutes after scheduled arrival. No ground staff on site to explain or apologize.

### "it was quickly turned round"
My wife and I flew easyJet from Edinburgh to Gatwick on an Airbus 319. We were one hour late leaving due to late inbound aircraft, once the plane was on stand it was quickly turned round and we were on our way. Enough leg room with the non reclining seats, we did not make any purchases from the food menu. Flight was full.

### "excellent service"
Flew easyJet from London Gatwick to Geneva. Excellent service on a brand new A320 Neo aircraft. Very polite cabin crew and in general although a 30 min delay the flight was effortless. I have really witnessed a lot of improvement over the years, they are far surpassing British Airways on service.

### "flight was without any problems"
Our flight with easyJet from Prague to Milan Malpensa was without any problems - the plane was new and clean and there were no delays. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Of course, like with every lowcost carrier, you have to carefully check your cabin luggage size. We've experienced beautiful approach over the Alps when landing in Milan.

### "will be using them again"
Although a frequent flyer I have never flown with easyjet so when I booked my first flight with them from Stansted to Edinburgh I didnt know what to expect. I can say that they were fantastic. My partner and I had flown to Edinburgh on business. We booked a return flight for 8pm but we were finished earlier than expected at 1pm. Dreading the long wait for our flight my partner suggested we go to the airport and ask if we could change our flight. I was quite adament that this could not be done unless you paid either over the odds or paid for another seat. We went to the airport and asked the member of staff at the easy jet desk if we could change our flight. She replied of course and had us on the eariler flight leaving at 5.40pm. This was done in the space of 5 minutes and no extra cost at all. We were delayed going out and coming back but not for long and these are things that cannot be helped. I can say they were very professional and accommodating. I will be using them again.

### "deceitful way of announcing delays"
The easyJet flight from Bordeaux to Amsterdam was my worst flying experience, until the flight back that is. First off the deceitful way of announcing delays, google told me the flight was going to be delayed 2h50min straight away but easyJet said 10mins, then 20mins, then an hour, then we stand at the boarding gate for 40. Finally I board to sit next to an overweight undershowered fellow. All we got offered was a glass of tap water. Got to hand it to easyJet though, they managed to get us back in 2h50min, just 10mins shy of the limit to get our money back. Avoid this company.

### "see a great deal of improvement"
London Gatwick to Arrecife, Lanzarote. I've been flying with Easyjet for about 7 years, mostly to the Canaries. Over the years, I could see a great deal of improvement in the service, food and aircraft. To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath. I don't think low-cost could be much better than this.

### "standing in a hot stifling room"
I am standing in a hot stifling room with all the other passengers for flight EZY8882, from Amsterdam to Gatwick, which is an hour and a half delayed at the moment but likely more. We were told to board when the plane had not even arrived yet. I finally persuaded a member of staff to please open the door. The first member I asked refused and I heard someone else ask her before. The flight we took on the way here from Gatwick 3 days ago was also delayed 2 hours. Our arrival evening was the best weather of our stay so we missed out on some good tourist time as the next day was pouring with rain. Rubbish service.

### "severely restricting space for my feet"
Very busy flight both directions from Bristol to Berlin. Outbound a few minutes early, no issues, very acceptable, return flight was 20 minutes late arriving then seemed to take an age on turnaround, then it picked up an air traffic delay at Berlin but they made good progress on the return flight and landed only about 20 minutes late. On checking in at Berlin, it's seems ironic, Easyjet state they like you to arrive 2 hours early at the airport yet we couldn't check-in our bag until 2 hrs 10 mins before our flight. Easyjet also tell passengers that they will more likely get their cabin bags in the overhead locker space if they try to board early, we paid for speedy boarding and were amongst the first passengers on board, safely put our bags (smaller than most) in the overhead lockers, yet a guy boards almost last couldn't get his large case in the lockers so the flight attanedant takes mine out and tells me to put it under the seat in front of me, severely restricting space for my feet for the whole flight. Not impressed. Other than that Easyjet, you did OK and we wouldn't have a problem flying with you again. Easyjet you have to take some responsibility for the airports you use, Berlin Schonfeld is the worst airport I have ever used, see separate review.

### "last time we book with them"
Rome to Paris, a last minute change of boarding gate (10 minutes walk) without =notification, new gate closed 30 minutes before take-off, very aggressive staff offering no solution but treating you like a cost, flight missed. As usual, "client assistance" provides no information, no reimbursement, no possibilities to change our flight. Only return flight available is two days later for 500 EUR more. Would be the last time we book with them.

### "flight cancelled - no emails, no notification"
Arrived at Stansted for a flight to Prague with easyJet to find out it had been cancelled. There were no emails, no notification prior to our arrival. Staff weren't willing to help us. Just telling us your flight is cancelled and there is nothing we can do. Supposed to fly out on Saturday morning and fly back Tuesday afternoon. All they could offer us was a flight out on Monday for half of our party. Not willing to help us find alternative flights. Just said that we are on our own.

### "I'll most likely choose them"
I recently flew with easyJet to Madrid from Liverpool. On my way out we were on a new livery with the old cabin. The boarding area at Liverpool was very hot and they kept turning the lights on and off. We used air stairs and had to go down about four flights of stairs before we even get onto the tarmac. We departed about ten minutes late because they hadn't yet refuelled. In the air, you could purchase food or drinks, as well as items from a large duty free selection. It would be a good tip to actually give out napkins when we're served a drink. The seats didn't seem to recline and the windows were messy. The crew could smile a bit more, they seemed bored. We landed about 5 minutes late and had a jetway at Barajas. If I ever require budget air travel in future, I'll most likely choose them.

### "avoid easyjet from now on"
Pisa to Luton. Arrived at airport keen to get home to see the football. 1 hr 40 delay posted, this went up to 2 hrs 50 eventually. Communication poor, refreshment vouchers of 4.50 euros given. We took ours to be surrendered and were told there was no credit on 2 of the 4 cards. Told to go to supervisor's office which turned out not to exist. When flight was called no speedy boarding was called. Once underway all was ok. Free drink for delay would have been nice. Filled in easyjet's post flight survey asking for someone to call / email me to discuss. Guess what? No one has! Regular short haul flyers who will now do all they can to avoid easyjet from now on.

### "flight was smooth and on time"
Flew Brussels to Berlin with easyJet. The flight was smooth and on time, and cabin crew attitude was good though they do not serve you unless you buy something. On this instance practically no one buys anything (a tea bag costs £2.50). Seat pitch is a bit narrow but that doesn't matter. I boarded with a cabin trolley and a computer bag: I was asked that I must be able to put the bag inside the trolley at the gate, which I did after a lot of fuss. Other airlines will allow an extra small bag. The flight was less than half full, and I think this restriction was imposed because EasyJet wants to demonstrate that they are a cheap carrier. But after cost of a checked bag etc it was not that cheap, and you suffer from arriving at SXF rather than the more convenient TXL.

### "crew more interested in themselves"
London Gatwick to Corfu with easyJet. Delays at airport were bad enough but we also had another 1.5 hour delay sitting on aircraft before it taxied to runway. No info forthcoming regarding the delay. No welcome on board due to staff talking amongst themselves. Crew more interested in themselves than passenger needs and poor attitude when passengers called them for requests - this was more than I could bear given that we were the paying customers. This was my first (and last) flight with easyJet as the return flight was even worse.

### "denied a seat on my flight"
Flew easyJet from Barcelona to London. Due to overbooking by the airline, I was denied a seat on my flight, and not offered a seat on the next flight. After a heated discussion with the few staff available, I was able to get information and book into a flight several hours later. I missed my meetings in London. On the return flight we were sent to the plane but the flight crew had not arrived. We were put in a dark, airless stairwell without water and made to wait, again without information on the length of delay. There was no thought for customers.

### "incompetence of customer service"
After having used EasyJet with complete satisfaction for about 10 years this has now been overturned by the incompetence of their customer service. On 28 Feb 2016 I was supposed to take a flight from Naples to Paris Orly. Unfortunately this was cancelled due to the weather conditions. Ground staff did all they could to help passengers. We were told to come back the next morning for a new flight scheduled at 9.55. This flight finally departed after 13.00. The reason given by the captain (in Italian and English - translated into French by a stewardess) was that an emergency slide had to be repaired before departure and that he was waiting for the final paperwork. Result was a near 22 hour delay on arrival in Paris. I accept this misfortune could happen with any airline. What I do not accept is that on 15 June I am still waiting for the reimbursement of my out of pocket expenses and that EasyJet have claimed that they do not owe any compensation under European legislation as the flight was delayed due to weather conditions - that was the case for the original flight, but not for the replacement flight. By way of comparison following a mechanical failure on a Flybe flight compensation was finalized within 24 hours. As a result of this experience I have learned to NO longer have any faith in EasyJet and in future shall do all in my power to avoid this airline and to warn potential flyers about their poor after sales service (plenty of bla-bla, but no action).

### "been fobbed off with lies"
London Gatwick to Isle of Man with easyJet and it was appalling. I've flown on 4 flights with easyJet this week - UK domestic, to Belfast and IOM. The first flight was 1h 40m late, BFS to LGW 1h 50m late, LGW to IOM 9 hours late but not cancelled (so that's okay then) and lastly IOM to LGW. I'm being told to proceed for boarding when the aircraft hasn't even landed so boarding is at least 45mins away. I have been fobbed off with lies, ignored and endured rude staff. They're all tired, fed up and had enough of going the 'extra mile' and I don't blame them, but the excuses for delays have been laughable. ATC strikes in France - not within 2 days of my flights, severe weather causing delays - none, high pressure over the whole of Europe/UK with no weather apart from beautiful clear skies. Awful airline who haven't got enough staff or resources to operate their service. A good price is as much use a chocolate teapot if you don't arrive somewhere near the planned arrival or even on the same day. Unreliable.

### "no customer service"
London Gatwick to Copenhagen with easyJet. Flight cancelled after 4 hours of waiting. No customer service to provide hotel and meal vouchers. The only instruction received was "go online and change your flight". I made an online request to get hotel accommodation but this request has not been answered. Solution if we can call it that to sleep over at Gatwick and hope to board the first morning flight. Nobody from easyJet showed up to offer drinks or food. It happened to me twice before with KLM and Lufthansa but there I was treated like a proper customer, receiving efficiently all I needed.

### "Well done easyJet"
My review concerns the customer care given on a planned flight in May which I was unable to take. Easyjet have been faultless in their help and process to refund via vouchers when I required hospital tests and could not fly. On providing a Doctors letter I received the vouchers for the full amount on the same day. Well done easyjet!

### "still put everyone on the plane"
Flew Gatwick to Jersey. Let’s face it, Easyjet treats their customers like cattle. We boarded the flight which was to be one hour in duration. The flight actually boarded on time and without incident. When everyone was boarded the captain came on to say that the flight was to be delayed because of weather in Jersey. He said it was going to be delayed an hour to start but could be delayed as much as four hours before the flight left. So here was a full flight, in an uncomfortable airplane with children and families on board that was going to just sit. What upsets me here is that the crew knew about this potential delay prior to boarding and still put everyone on the plane. The plane did finally leave, 5 hours later. The passengers were forced to sit on the hot plane with no air, no food, no drinks, for 5 hours. Once the flight left it was a one hour ride to Jersey.

### "excellent flight and service"
Due to a medical emergency we required 3 adjacent seats plus one across the aisle. 72 hours before flight I contacted EasyJet from our hotel in Palma. Their online system was brilliant and within 10 minutes we had confirmed booking of everything we needed including assistance at both airports. Excellent flight and service all round. We had confirmed flights with British Airways but after 72 hours and many phone calls they could not confirm the two additional seat we needed. Well done EasyJet. We are due to fly to Alicante in 6 weeks and are using EasyJet again.

### "cabin crew were very kind"
easyJet flight from Luton to Aberdeen got delayed for 3 hours due to 'operational reasons'. Luton airport was packed with people. The cabin crew were very kind. I sat in seat 23B. There wasn't sufficient legroom. No complimentary food or drinks (which was annoying because we were delayed).

### "prices not too bad"
Last time I flew this route from Montpellier to London Gatwick, the boarding process was somewhat farcical. This time I had Speedy Boarding which was an improvement although people still queued far too early (the incoming flight had not landed yet!) I had to force my way past them to take advantage of the SB. The price I paid for our flights was low, I decided to book extra legroom seats which made the flight very comfortable and came with automatic Speedy Boarding and an extra bag allowance (I still think Easyjet's policy towards handbags etc. is annoying and unnecessary). The flight was on time, the bar service was prompt and nicely carried out with prices not too bad. Info from the flight deck was pretty good and overall, the experience was fine.

### "plenty of space left"
Very bad experience, from Berlin to Orly Paris by S669, with 80 mins of delay (means that we will arrive in Paris around 23H30). When we arrived at the gate, the staff very aggressively asked passengers to check in their cabin bags. I asked them the reason and was told that they have the right to demand this. I was the last person get onboard the airplane and surprise, surprise, there was plenty of space left. When we arrived at Orly, I had to wait another 20 mins to get my luggage (almost 23H50).

### "good information from the captain"
No problems going out from Stansted to Munich, flight was on time and in fact arrived ahead of schedule. Pleasant cabin crew and good information from the captain about our journey. Coming back the bag drop didn't open until 2 hours before the departure so many people were queuing for some time as they had expected this to be 3 hours. Nevertheless the flight back was also punctual and the same professional attitude from the crew. EasyJet are definitely my preferred short haul carrier.

### "flights were on time and pleasant"
Great value for money. We flew from Manchester to Santorini and then returned from Athens to Manchester with easyJet. Both flights were on time and pleasant. Aircraft were clean and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. They came through the cabin twice for food and beverage sales, once for duty free, and several times to collect rubbish. Extra legroom seats were an excellent value and include Speedy Boarding and use of the much quicker check-in queue. Seats on our flights did not recline, so there were no problems with rude people reclining too much and trapping people in the row behind them. We would use easyJet again.

### "comfortable enough for a short flight"
Flew easyJet from London Gatwick to Milan Malpensa for a short break with my wife. Flight departed pretty much on time, only the busy flight traffic at Gatwick holding us up. Landed in Malpensa early so made up any lost time. Flight itself was comfortable enough for a short flight. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly enough. Took our own water on board as know the score in regards food and drink on board. Return flight was same as outbound flight, in fact left bang on time and landed very early. It's worth noting that Terminal 2 at Malpensa is a bit dated but you can see improvements are being made to facilities, this will take time but they'll get there. Facilities were adequate enough and free bus to terminal 1 for train station was easy to find. Used the easyJet app on my phone for check in etc. Impressed as gives you a message when your gate us announced and all that. Works well and easy to use compared to other airline apps. Overall can thoroughly recommend easyJet from this and past experience. My wife was also impressed with her first experience.

### "all 6 flights were late"
The easyJet flight from Paris to Milan is okay, the airports are not too far from city. But for the last 3 times I went from Milan to Paris (round trip), all the 6 flights were late by at least 30 minutes. This last flight is 1hr 20 late. 6 times in a row cannot be a coincidence. I will prefer to take other low cost companies from now on. The service in general is the same, but I know that I won't have to wait for the late airplane in every flight.

### "service not great"
Manchester to Venice. Due to problem with plane the easyjet Manchester departure was slightly delayed and some passengers could not fly as the plane that was substituted was smaller. We did get on the flight but all our seats were changed, for a short flight and being older children this was not a huge issue but we had paid for allocated seating and it took several unanswered emails and eventually a long and no doubt costly call to Easyjet to try to claim the payment back. They tried to offer me free seat allocation on the next flight, as I'm hoping never to have to use this airline again I politely refused and was told a refund would be given in 5-10 days - time will tell! Return trip was delayed but no announcement made or info given, when finally boarded in Venice the cabin staff were to say the least brusque, we were seated at very back of flight and of course no room was left for baggage, rather than try to help by checking overheads at the front of the plane a staff member thought it appropriate to just shout at my daughters to sit down, when she explained she had no where to put her baggage and could not "go against the tide" of still boarding passengers to check the front she was told she would just have to put it in the hold, how this was going to be managed by my daughter was not mentioned and clearly the staff were not going to help - eventually another staff member did find some space and called my daughter down from her seat at the back to the front to store her baggage - not a major issue but overall the experience is one of lack of care, whilst safety should always be paramount they seem disorganised at best and uncaring at worst, helping a passenger could actually save them time in the long run and when they are obviously running late and working against a tight time frame you would think that experience would of taught them this - the whole customer service ethos has passed them by and I got the impression on both flights that passengers were very much a necessary evil and the cabin crews life would be so much better if they just didn't have to deal with them. Service not great, communication poor, every time I've flown the flight has been delayed, overall worth paying a little more for a better experience.

### "worst experience ever"
Naples to Berlin. Biggest disappointment and worst experience ever. They kept us for an hour in the plane on the ground in Napoli, due to bad weather conditions in Berlin. They flew later and decided to fly to Hannover, after giving in to the conditions. They promised transfer coaches or other solutions. After staying in Hannover for almost an hour, they decided to fly back! With the forecast still showing storm! After passengers started complaining loudly, they offered anybody who wanted to get off the plane, to do so, but on their own account. They would not hand out our suitcases and left us alone in Hannover to organise our getting back. easyjet left us alone. I write this while sitting in a bus, on a stormy highway in the middle of the night, being awake for 18 hours now and having found connections back home myself.

### "weren't the friendliest "
Nice to Luton on easyjet. Delayed flight with no apology from the flight deck nor cabin crew. Cabin was old, tired and filthy; the seat pockets hadn't been cleaned and behind the tray table was covered in previous occupants' chewing gum. Cabin crew weren't the friendliest I've encountered, nor the most professional; laughing in the middle of several PA's was not impressive.

### "easyJet is streets ahead of BA"
Flights to Split, Croatia, outbound from Stansted and back to Gatwick, and I can't fault easyJet. They offer excellent service for outstanding value. We were a little nervous about flying out of Stansted. We needn't have been - the airport was clean and modern, we were checked in by courteous professional staff within 3 minutes of arrival. The airport has clearly spent quite a bit of modernising, although it was packed with summer holiday passengers. Onboard a very warm welcome. Older seats on way out with quite tight legroom, but on time departure and early arrival. Bags off very promptly. Returning, boarded quickly and efficiently onto a new A320 with new slimline seats that offered way more legroom. Staff were extremely professional, especially when dealing a fairly rowdy family. Early arrival into Gatwick and bags first off. In taxi within 20 minutes of landing. easyJet offers an excellent product which is streets ahead of BA in terms of price and service.

### "fares are just unmissable"
Jersey to London Gatwick with easyJet and another great flight. Due to the flight time, airport check-in was not open, however I'd checked in a few days before with the easyJet app which was very quick and convenient. Boarding was quick and we left a few minutes early, which is a bonus. The cabin crew were friendly and the aircraft was clean and comfortable. We arrived at Gatwick 5-10 minutes early, and disembarking was as quick as boarding. On the way back, we were about half an hour early landing, which was fantastic. For the short flight from JER-LGW, easyJet are ideal and a bit better than British Airways in my opinion, and the fares are just unmissable. Both flights for two adults cost £180. easyJet can expect my business in the near future.

### "we arrived tired"
Tel Aviv to Paris CDG return. We arrived at Tel Aviv to see that the flight had been delayed 50 minutes. When the time comes to board the plane we get the news that takeoff has again been delayed because the plane had reached its weight limit. The flight attendants went around offering passengers trips to different destinations in order to get them off the plane to decrease the weight. After a few passengers left, we got yet another call from the cockpit informing us that we will not be landing in Paris, but in Milan to refuel. In a matter of minutes we were airborne. Its worth mentioning that the cabin crew had the decency to offer complimentary beverages and snacks to make up for the inconvenience. The food was average, simple meals most of which are sandwiches that I do enjoy. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable. The distance between the seats was insufficient lacking legroom which made the flight uncomfortable. We arrive at Milan only to hear more bad news, we were told that the plane had hit a bird, which meant that we had to change planes. To summarise the story, we arrived at Paris CDG after an 8 hour flight, exactly double the amount of time it should have taken. We had lost half of a day on our short trip, arriving at 5:30am local Paris time instead of 12:30am. We arrived tired, with very little time to sleep.

### "impolite and unprofessional"
On two recent return flights Naples-Venice, I found the ground staff impolite and very unprofessional in both airports, so I decided to send an email to the company to explain. Unfortunately, I still have not received a reply to the email which I sent to the customer services on 3 April 2016 and on contacting them by phone 10 days ago was assured by the man at the other end of the line that I would receive a reply to my original email in a couple of days. I am still waiting. In my opinion, this company charges just slightly less for flights than the national airlines because they do not spend money on customer services. I reckon customers' emails are never read and they only have one person answering the telephone as I waited 40 minutes before my call was connected to a member of staff. If I had a choice of airlines for my flights to Venice from Naples, I would not travel with Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
London Gatwick to Naples with easyJet. A very competent service both ways. On time. Outbound aircraft tired and scruffy. Outbound crew (LGW based) much more customer friendly than inbound Italian crew. Boarding on inbound was very well handled, where speeyboarding passenger kept on front the whole way through to boarding plane. Toasted cheese/ham sandwich outbound was a soggy mess. All in all very good for the fare paid.

### "Very bad experience"
Rome to Geneva with easyjet. The flight was planned to depart at 20.55 but then we got first notification that the flight would be delayed 30 minutes. After few minutes, we were notified additional delay of 1 hour 40 minutes and the last, we got delay notification of 2 hours. After the latest notification, we were informed that we would get voucher of 4.5 Euro for snack (only sandwich). Vouchers were given when they called people for boarding which means basically no time to take the snack. Besides, when they called people for boarding, the plane was not arrived yet! The latest ETD was 23.35 with ETA 00.10 and ATD was 11.31. We landed safely in Lyon, because they mentioned that GVA airport was already closed at midnight and we were not informed before. Considering the ETA was after midnight, they should have seen this possibility but, they did not mention anything to passenger before. We missed our train connection because of the delay and we arranged last minute bus travel which we missed as well due to the arrival was in Lyon. Thankfully they still managed to make bus transfer to GVA airport. We arrived in GVA around 3 AM. Considering the arrival time, the total delay was around 5 hours and we were stuck in GVA airport at 3 AM. Very bad experience.

### "it was a pleasant flight"
Copenhagen to Gatwick check-in was done on the app, and I didn't have any checkin baggage, so went straight to departure. The boarding gate and arrival gate were both very far from the airport main shopping area. Especially in CPH, the easyJet and Ryanair boarding area F is the farthest among all the boarding gates. The seat pitch was good for a low-cost airline. I felt comfortable at my seat, where my knees didn't touch the back of the front seat. (I'm 188cm tall). Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. All in all, it was a pleasant flight, and good value for money.

### "crew very personable and friendly"
I approached flying easyJet with some reservations. My last budget airline, a certain blue and yellow operator operating from Stansted put me off - almost for life. As I was only in Milan for 24 hours, the BA Club Europe fare, the worst regional business class in the world, was a staggering £900 return. So I settled for easyJet at £160 - including row "a" seats on both flights. I was very pleased I did. The 1st flight left an hour late due to a bizarre "technical" issue. A wheelchair in the hold was found to have non detachable lithium batteries. The captain had to cross check the legality and in the end the passenger and wheelchair was deplaned. On both flights, the crew were very personable and friendly. Greeted everyone on board with a smile and "welcome aboard". On the return the captain did likewise. I found the seat comfortable. The plane well turned out. The return flight left on time and arrived early. Had a gin and tonic on the way back which was fairly priced. All in all a very good experience and I would not hesitate to recommend.

### "the crew was nice"
Lille to Berlin Schönefeld on easyJet, with a new aircraft there and back. There was enough legroom (I'm 1m 86), the crew was nice and there was enough information. The pilot gave during the flight some information about the destinantion and city, and the cabin crew as well. As they are a low-cost carrier there is no WiFi, inflight entertainment or free beverages.

### "staff were polite and helpful"
I flew from Gatwick to Heraklion return for less than the price of a train ticket to Cornwall. The staff were polite, smart and helpful. The Captain and First Officer welcomed us with announcements that informed us of the route, height , speed etc. Take off and landing was smooth. The seats were comfortable with enough leg room. Some people might struggle over the amount of space. When we left the aircraft on each occasion the Pilot came out to greet us.

### "got on with massive bags"
I'll start by saying that the price is fair, we paid around 400 euros each for a flight from Tel Aviv to London which is quite a distance. The cabin crew were polite and decent but they still have to start acknowledging their own rules. They have a rule for carryon luggage 56x45x26cm, why can't they stick to that? Everyone got on the flight with massive bags that were obviously not fit to be carried on and then had to remove the luggage from the plane. Another thing that is annoying is the non-existant entertainment system. We had a family infront of us that had ipads and laptops with them. All you have is a magazine with pictures of things you can buy, and not to mention that everything on board from foods to drinks will cost you money. There are however, meal deals where you pay 6 euros and you get a bacon sandwich, a drink, and a bag of chips. All in all just like someone else said, it will get you from point A to point B, but only if the low price is worth sacrificing food, comfort and entertainment.

### "gets you from A to B and back"
Bristol to Newcastle, returning from Edinburgh. Nothing special makes either flight stand out, it gets you from A to B and back again. Seats are hard and with a tight pitch so anything more than 75-90 minutes duration would be hard to put up with. All flights full, and as expected usual scramble for overhead space. Something lacking with them when compared to a regular airline - budget airline characteristic probably. Would I use them again, yes if there was no other options available.

### "cabin crew were helpful"
Flew Luton to Amsterdam. Great flight and smooth, left on time, arrived on time, pilot was communicating at take off and during the flight and cabin crew were helpful. Paid for extra leg room as I am over 6ft 4" was surprised at the amount of room and a nice high backed chair so room to relax, thank goodness they have removed reclining seats, nothing more annoying than somebody reclining into your face. You also notice that easyJet I would say are too nice as many passengers seem unable to read or ignore the hand baggage guidelines. So well done Easyjet for putting passengers first as you could make good money by sticking to your guidelines.

### "cabin crew were warm"
You get what you pay for with easyJet. Flew from Luton to Madrid. Cabin crew were warm and very welcoming at boarding, which was very efficient. Departed bang on time and arrived a few minutes before schedule. There was regular communication between the passengers and the pilots which I find comforting when flying, and I like to know the routing we are taking. Seats were comfortable, legroom was tight, but what do you expect, it's a budget airline after all.

### "seats were relatively comfortable"
Flew London Gatwick - Milan Linate with easyJet. Check in was smooth and fast at Gatwick with very friendly staff. We boarded the plane around 25-30 minutes late, this was because it was an evening flight and there was a delay during the morning. The seats on-board were relatively comfortable, legroom was average, but comfortable. There was no in-flight on screen entertainment, but there was a very interesting magazine, with plenty of articles in 5 languages. We needed to pay for food on-board, I had a hot chocolate and muffin, this was quite tasty. The flight was very smooth and the pilot dealt with turbulence well. We landed in Milan around 20 minutes late. All of the luggage arrived quickly on belt. Would recommend easyJet for all short European flights and would use them again.

### "leave us there without any help"
I was travelling from Larnaca to Gatwick. Because of the bad weather we landed in Liverpool. The problem is that the company leave us there without any help about how we travel to Gatwick. It was 4 in the morning and we were trying to find money to buy a bus ticket for £100 pounds to travel to Gatwick. Also I have to mention the bad behavior in all flights of Easyjet I travelled especially to this one. Two weeks after the flight I sent them several emails without any answer. I'm calling them everyday waiting about 30 minutes everytime and no one answer the phone. Don't trust easyJet.

### "cabin crew were marvellous"
I travelled back with easyJet to Luton from Corfu yesterday on flight number EZY2372 with my parents who are both disabled. The cabin crew were marvellous to us all and I can't thank them enough for their pleasant and helpful attitude. My partner and I have just brought a villa in Corfu and this excellent service means we can now feel quite comfortable in inviting our parents to stay with us.

### "won't be flying with them again"
I have had the missfortune of flying with Easyjet 3 times in the last 7 days. The first flight was delayed by 4 hours (Catania to London). The second by 1 hour (London to Madrid) and the third (Madrid to London) is so far delayed by 2 hours. They seem cheap when you buy the ticket but when you take into account all the extra money you end up spending due to their delays (rearranging transport, buying food, etc) and the stress caused it is really not worth it. I won't be flying with them again and I would not recommend them to anyone.

### "initially delayed, then cancelled"
A useless airline. Flight from London Gatwick to Isle of Man was initially delayed, then cancelled. Extremely slow informing passengers of the cancellation. EasyJet clearly knew well in advance because checking on the Isle of Man arrivals board, the flight clearly showed cancelled long before EasyJet at Gatwick had the decency to inform it's passengers. The excuse given was that the crew on the inbound flight from Turin which would operate our flight had mixed up the times because of the change of clocks in the UK. Quite unbelievable. No seats available on the evening flight and ground staff didn't know about the seat availability the next day. We left Gatwick and went to another airport to get home at considerable cost. If you are relying on arriving at your destination on time or even on the same day, then don't use this airline.

### "never fly with easyjet again"
Liverpool to Amsterdam return. Me and my boyfriend went away for a few days to Amsterdam. As we were waiting for our gate to open our return flight got cancelled. So I asked staff where do I go to find out what's happening and he told me to go up the stairs and carry on walking and then another member of staff told me differently. Anyway when we got the information we needed our flight got cancelled. We had to fly out the next day. We had spent all our money in the airport and we got left with nothing. They put us up in a hotel and told us food is provided for us. The hotel tried to charge us for the breakfast as they said it is not provided. I would never fly with easyjet again.

### "never got off the ground"
Luton to Faro with easyjet and never got off the ground. Flight delayed by over 6 hours. No Easyjet staff available to explain or provide any information. Their ground handling staff (Menzies) were dreadful. For 6 hours of delays, we received a poultry £3 in meal voucher. After cancelling the flight at 11:00pm there then proceeded to be a pantomime of several groups of passengers trying to leave Luton airport but with no customer assistance. What a joke.

### "value for money"
Bournemouth to Geneva. Very pleasant cabin crew and no manic boarding like some airlines. Seat not particularly comfortable nor was the inflight food great, but on a 1hr 20 min flight its not a deal breaker. All in all Easyjet is value for money and my airline of choice for short haul flights

### "the price you pay is fair"
Hamburg to London Gatwick with easyjet. The crew was very friendly and helpful. The seats were comfortable and legroom was okay. Also the prices for drinks and snacks were fair. The only negative point was the two hours delay we had on our return flight from LGW to HAM. Nevertheless I would fly again with easyJet because the price you pay is fair for the great service you get and the refreshingly friendly crew.

### "seat comfortable, legroom ok"
Fast and easy boarding at Southend and good welcome by crew. Seat comfortable, and legroom ok. Flight left on time, and arrived about 30 mins early into ACE. Airbridge at ACE. Food on flight was good value for LCC and served pleasantly. Return flight was equally good, greeted by the Captain at top of boarding steps (no airbridge this time). Early departure due to headwinds and pilot wanting to try to hit scheduled arrival time (which he did). Only issue was inordinately long time for bags to appear at SEN, due to Border Farce (spelling intended).

### "heavy and oversize bags"
Both the outward flight to Bologna from Gatwick and the return trip were spoiled by passengers taking on to the aircraft bags that were a lot larger than easyJet stipulated. Loading and unloading of bags into overhead lockers became dangerous with heavy and oversize bags. Even the cabin crew told me that they wished that the company would obey their own rules on carry on bag sizes.

### "crew was refreshingly friendly"
To spend a weekend in Manchester, I booked easyJet flight from Munich - Manchester return at a very reasonable rate. My experiences were positive throughout. The crew was refreshingly friendly, the seat pitch sufficient, there was space for my suitcase in the overhead bin and, most important, both flights were on time. The cabin on the Munich outbound flight was not very clean though.

### "great value for money"
Madrid to Gatwick was a nice flight, with a friendly crew who so were professional dealing with a very intoxicated person they decided to remove from the flight. The aircraft was clean although the cabin was displaying signs of wear. Updates from the flight deck are welcome  and we arrived 25 minutes early. EasyJet's product is basic, but is great value for money and it's still my favourite low-cost airline.

### "reasonable for low cost airline"
Berlin to Madeira via Lisbon with easyJet. Very efficient and flights departed just with small delays and arrived earlier than scheduled. Legroom, by no means sufficient to call it comfortable, is reasonable for a low cost airline. The seats on their A320's which seem to be the newer ones, were less private, as between each seat there is a huge gap which me and my partner didn't like.

### "Berlin to Gatwick a nightmare"
I usually love easyJet but every time flying from Berlin to Gatwick is a nightmare. They are checking in 4 flights and have 1 check in desk open. It's ridiculous and the worst service ever! The average waiting time is over 1 hour and the same for security. Once you are onboard the service is great.

### "attendants were friendly"
I bought a ticket online to fly out on Saturday from Gatwick to Budapest. Once I arrived at the terminal, I had a problem with my passport due to EU policies would not allow passengers to enter the EU if you passport expires less than 2 month. No refunds allowed and they couldn't let me fly until I get it fixed. So, I had to go to the Embassy in London to renew it as an Emergency passport. I went back to Gatwick on Tuesday and I flew that day for another £80 fee. The seats didn't recline, but the positive thing was that airline attendants were friendly.

### "new seats offer more legroom"
easyJet from Gatwick to Hurghada return on an A320. Outbound we had a 2 hour delay due to a spillage on the runway at LGW. On reaching Hurghada the captain was forced to divert to Luxor due the runway being closed due to debris. We re-fuelled at Luxor and flew back to Hurghada, and crew dealt with this in a professional and understanding way. Concerning seats on the A320, outbound we had the 'old' seats, and on the return flight we had the new seats. We were able to make direct comparison. Our verdict is that the new seats offer more legroom and are more stable and comfortable. I was relieved to see that the seats do not recline, a big reason that we select EasyJet. One criticism is that on the return flight the cabin crew had run out of food (rolls, baguettes, etc) by the time they reached us. We were told that this is a frequent thing. I noted that they had plenty of duty free perfumes and goods to sell. I would suggest more food is loaded at Gatwick and less perfumes etc.

### "arrived 10 minutes early"
easyJet from Gatwick to Marrakech with smooth boarding. Overall a good flight, flight attendants helpful and the seating was comfy. The flight took off on time and arrived 10 minutes early. The food on flight was nice. Looking forward to using them again at some point.

### "found the service great"
Found the service great. It was an hours flight from Bristol to Edinburgh and flights were on time. The handed baggage service was great! Staff were polite and good at their jobs. I would fly easyJet again, thank you.

### "back-office is abysmal"
I fly regularly with easyJet and for the price the flights are okay, but be warned if you have a cancelled flight! Last November my Gatwick to Amsterdam flight was cancelled, easyJet's internet connection went down and the passengers were left to fend for themselves, with the assurance from the easyJet ground staff that all expenses would be reimbursed. I have contacted them dozens of times since with no progress. I'm now in the midst of a 45 mins call (yet again) to their switchboard. The back-office is abysmal and unaccountable and I'm out of pocket.

### "had enough leg room"
This was my first time flying with easyJet and as it is low cost carrier I didn't expect much (paid 65 Euro for return ticket to Rome so why should I), but it was a pleasant suprise. I've checked in online using their app so no need to print anything so saved time there, boarding both at Vienna and Rome were done pretty quickly so no long waiting. Plane looked pretty new so this was positive and even though seats weren't big I had enough leg room (it was short flight and I'm not really tall) and actually had seat pockets with their magazines. Crew were really nice and helpful and even though they don't give out any drinks you can buy them on board for reasonable prices along with snacks, they also sell bus tickets to Rome city center which is helpful and save you time at the airport. I will definetelly fly with them again. For me the best low cost airline so far.

### "extremely rude and unfriendly"
Short flight from Luton - Amsterdam with easyJet. Cabin crew were extremely rude and unfriendly to passengers wanting to purchase food/drinks. Whilst I appreciate that it was only a 40 minute flight, telling the passenger in front to 'hurry up and make a decision' was down right rude.

### "wait ages in departure gate"
We use easyJet regularly from Bristol and I'm always amazed that we have wait ages in the departure gate. This trip was no exception. The plane had been standing there overnight so it should have been ready but no we had to wait (standing) for the best part of thirty minutes before being allowed to board. Sheer bloody lack of consideration. When we eventually boarded the captain informed us that there would be a delay because they needed an engineer to come and update the maps for BCN airport. Again the plane had been standing there overnight surely the maps could have been updated then. Then to cap it all a passenger who had checked in had failed to turn up so we had a further delay whilst they found and removed their bags (admittedly not EJs fault). The flight itself was uneventful and the landing at BCN was one of the best (smoothest) we've experienced in many years. We will continue to use easyJet but they really should be more professional when it comes to boarding.

### "staff friendly enough"
This is only a short flight from the Isle of Man to Bristol. Check in fine until you get to board, then staff were telling women that their handbags had to go in their hand luggage as only one bag was allowed, this was not a full flight so the hold up was not too bad. Flight itself was a non event, staff friendly enough. Never buy food or drink onboard. Flight arrived early. Would fly it again as with budget airlines only if the price is right.

### "crew were always helpful"
The easyJet flight from London Gatwick to Lanzarote was excellent from take off to landing. The service was first class and the crew were friendly. The announcements from the flight deck were clear and informative. The cabin service was unrushed and the crew were always helpful with no hard sell unlike other airlines.

### "didn't expect much"
I didn't expect much as it was the 2nd time I flew with easyjet. The first was in 1997. It hasn't improved much in terms of Customer Service. I have avoided it this long but it was inevitable this time around as I wasn't paying for the trip myself so I had budget constrain. Flew from London Gatwick to Lisbon. Let's start with the booking process. This was easy and straightforward, living up to its name. However, the additional charges for bags and seats (although I knew about it) still irked me. It really should be standard. How can any airline charge their customers for choosing where to sit? Afterall, we are already paying to fly. The bags - less said. Anyway, the London Gatwick experience was so-so. If you're not an easyJet Plus customer you can't bring anything else apart from one cabin bag-not even a small handbag. I think this is just ridiculous. A handbag is like a 5th limb for most people. Having said that, when returning, the staff at the boarding gate in Lisbon terminal 2 (budget airlines only terminal), allowed the passenger in front of me to carry her handbag which was almost as big as her cabin bag. She wasn't an easyJet Plus customer as those who were went through another lane. She was told to queue like we all were. This inconsistency is what lets easyJet down. I have to say, their pilots on both leg of the journey were brilliant. High winds, but not a bump when landing. The bag drop process in Gatwick was smooth. The one in Lisbon was so-so (might have to do with it being a budget terminal). Calling you to the gate 45 minutes before departure and then to go through passport control was a very silly set-up. It meant everyone was anxious and rushing and in a bad mood. But that's the termnal's fault. Easyjet - if I have the means, I would never fly it. The only other airline worst than easyjet is Ryanair (which I flew with once 20 years ago and never again).

### "very disappointing journey"
First and last time I fly with easyJet from Manchester to Copenhagen. Departure kept being postponed. Screens, showing one thing, apps another and website a third. The only airline I have ever used, where your handbag was considered hand luggage and had to be tucked away in you cabin bag. A very disappointing journey overall.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
I was pleasantly surprised with my first experience with easyJet from Jersey to London Gatwick. I'd checked in online and that was a very simple process. The staff at the gate and onboard were extremely friendly. The cabin was clean and welcoming, the seats even reclined! We were on time taking off and landed 5-10 minutes early. The way back was the same, however the staff at the gate weren't as friendly and were extremely slow! We boarded 15 minutes late but got into Jersey 5 minutes early. I'd definitely fly with easyJet again, as there isn't much different between them and airlines such as British Airways.

### "nickle and diming"
Cramped seats and nickle and diming for everything. I put an abbreviated version of a name accidentally on a ticket, and they wanted to charge €65 each way, for a simple name change. I decided I didn't care about the leg room because it was going to be such a short flight. I arrive at the airport, and the board of departures shows the flight is in check-in and the gate will be determined. 20 minutes before the take off time, passengers receive a text saying flight is canceled until next day. Obviously you can imagine the troubles this would bring, and I can only help easyjet will redeem itself slightly by refunding my entire flight, and paying for the new train tickets I'll have to buy.

### "impressed with service"
I was booking a flight from Glasgow to Jersey for my brother and accidentally put my name. I called customer service to explain and change the name on the flight. As you are aware there is a charge for this. I explained that my mother is very sick and asked if they could show me some compassion at a very difficult time for my family, EasyJet changed the name on my brothers flight and did not charge me for it. I got through to customer service within minutes and am very grateful and impressed with the service I received today. Thank you so much EasyJet.

### "never fly easyJet again"
easyJet from Madrid to Geneva, and one of the worst airlines I've used. They were rude at the beginning when I was just staying online to the departure. A man came to me and said that I only can have one bag with me. I had one carry on really small luggage and one small handbag. I thought he was kidding and just ignored him. But when I was about to board he said that I have to pay extra 60 euros because I have two bags with me. I paid. He put the sticker on my luggage and I continued my way to the plane with the line. Unexpectedly a woman is coming to me, very aggressively takes my luggage and says "I need to take this bag" - I said "Wait a minute, I just paid for this bag" she says "that's why I need to take it, you can't take it with you onboard. You only allowed to take one bag" Well that is ridiculous! And not even an effort to be nice to me. Never will fly with easyJet again.

### "made the flight miserable"
I was travelling easyJet from Madrid to Edinburgh to attend a wedding reception straight from the flight, so was carrying only 1 carry on trolley case (within required dimensions). I queued up very early (only a few passengers in front of me) to ensure I got onboard fastly and I could put my bag in. When I reached the door of the plane the ground staff tried to snatch the bag from me but I asked why as the overhead lockers were empty - I explained I was going straight to a wedding reception and that my dress was at the top of my case ironed and ready to put on and this is why I had a seat and the front of the plane and queued early - they were kind and understood and told me to speak to the crew. I then encountered a very smug crew who didn't want to know about my need or wouldn't explain why my bag was being offloaded when it was still empty - he said it was a full flight but surely it's first come first served for baggage space? To which he sang with a big smile on his face "you have agreed to the terms and conditions when you bought the ticket, so if you don't like it please leave! I was in shock of this and had to ask again to make sure I heard right - asking me to leave because I had asked why I couldn't put it there when it was empty - absolutely no empathy or warmth and seemed to take pleasure from it and made eyes with another crew. He then instructed them to remove my bag and wasn't asked if I needed to take anything from it - I later realised I was left without money or my motion sickness medication and didn't feel comfortable to ask if my bag could be retrieved due to the unapproachable crew - this made the flight miserable. The captain did make a PA to apologise for offloaded bags after landing which was professional, so was it too much for the crew to use his discretion and be human or atleast apologise for the situation also? !

### "value for money was good"
Geneva to Barcelona return with easyJet. Booking and online check-in was smooth. Boarding was a mess both times, probably due to the cabin baggage allowance at low cost carriers. People had huge carryons and because the flights were full, there was nowhere near enough space for all those carryons. Both flights were more or less punctual and uneventful. The cabin crews were friendly, the cabins itself a bit dirty. Typical low cost flights. But value for money was good, so I recommand them.

### "Staff excellent"
Due to a French Air Traffic we transferred from Ryanair leaving Carcassonne to depart with easyJet from Barcelona to Newcastle. The booking process through to landing was very professional even although the incoming flight had a couple of hen/stag parties to contend with. Staff excellent, communication excellent the only (slight) problems were waiting for 15mins on the bus to board the plane - it had to be cleaned after the incoming flight and a shortage of refreshment both probably due to the incoming flight.

### "cabin staff were very helpful"
Flew out on the 21st from London Gatwick to Montpellier with easyJet - a few of us flew out for a rugby game. My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers. As the price was quite cheap, I would use Easyjet again but I think their cabin baggage policy needs to be stricter as people will always try to break the rules.

### "received no apology"
During my recent flight from Spain, where I live, to Gatwick for the weekend I experienced appalling treatment at the hands of Easyjet staff. As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated "right, it doesn’t fit it will have to be checked in". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay £45 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied "well you won’t be flying then". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn’t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her "well trained" staff couldn’t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager’s response was simply "ok, yes it can go in with you". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet £45 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet? This is easily the most appalling treatment I have received as a customer. I will make every effort, even at personal expense and inconvenience, to fly with other airlines.

### "kept us informed"
Liverpool to Palma return. Outward journey was fine: prompt departure, uneventful flight, efficient - if slightly low key - cabin crew, slightly early arrival. Return journey was delayed because the original incoming aircraft had had to be replaced, but easyJet did what it could to keep us informed. An agent came and waited at the gate for an hour or so to tell passengers of the delay and to provide updates, only leaving when the first of the proper boarding staff arrived. She had actually ended up trying to field more inquiries from passengers waiting at the next gate for a delayed shared Heathrow flight than from easyJet customers. From the time the plane finally arrived, boarding was very swiftly organised and completed in less than half an hour. The flight itself was uneventful and we made up a little time en route, eventually arriving about 90 minutes late. At no time had there been any significant fuss or complaint about the delay, probably because an effort was made to keep us informed.

### "disappointed with speedy boarding"
Rome to Copenhagen with easyJet. The check in process was easy enough, ticket price a good value. I paid extra for speedy boarding and a pre assigned seat and hold luggage. Was very disappointed with speedy boarding. All this meant was you have to stand around longer than everyone else. I had to stand around waiting to board (and this was after I had my ticket scanned) for almost 30 minutes. Don't board people until you're ready to board!

### "fly with easyJet again"
The easyJet flight departed on time from Copenhagen, far away from the main terminals. We were a group of 20 persons but we could sit together. Some of the tray tables were very dirty. We landed on time at Rome Fiumicino. But included the taxiing to the stand on the other side of the airport and the bus to the terminal we were over 40 minutes late. It was good with free weight of the cabin baggage. In the menu they had over 9 sandwiches but only two of them were on board. The cabin crew seemed to enjoy their work and that made passengers happy and comfortable. I will definitely fly with easyJet again. But not on this route due to the ending of the route in February. The flight was cheap, but I have found cheapier with Alitalia on some dates.

### "efficient cabin service"
Its been a while since I used easyJet having had poor service and standards from them in the past. But a recent Gatwick to Fuerteventura return prompted me to reconsider this view. A new aircraft and slimline seats on the outbound flight made for much increased perception of leg room. Quick efficient cabin service, albeit not much to choose. easyJet have come a long way in its 20 year history. Improved inflight catering could help in the future as well. Good value for money too with a return fare, minus the frills of GBP83.

### "problem with our bags"
Amsterdam to Manchester as a party of 4, we had a problem because apparently our bags were too big - we managed to fit 3 out of the 4 bags into the measurements, but 1 had to be paid 60 Euros - which is a lot of money and it was never checked on the way to Amsterdam, so we thought it would be fine on the way back! The lady on the desk was terrible, she seemed mad that we managed to fit 3 of our bags in, and seemed disappointed that she couldn't charge us for all 4. I don't agree with the fact that your not allowed to take handbags on board if you already have a carry on especially when it's OK to do so on all other airlines. What are woman supposed to do with their purses, passports, phones and feminine products, you don't really want to be delving into your hand luggage all the time especially when it's in the overhead lockers. Plane and the flights itself was comfortable compared to other cheap airlines and the staff on the plane were friendly. And the flight was cheap.

### "efficient service"
Almost on time flight from Marrakech to Bristol but easyJet sent a text 2 days before to advise of 4 hour check in. We reorganised our taxi but when we arrived we were told that no check in desks would open until 3 hours before so we with 3 small children, car seats, buggy and hand luggage had to hang around. What an inefficiency. Next they refused to split the childrens'carseats into 2 which is what usually happens consequently when we arrived in Bristol part of one was missing making the seat unusable. Finally no sandwiches suitable for children - mustard or herb mayonnaise. What about good old egg sandwiches. Otherwise efficient service thank you.

### "received tremendous service"
I travelled with my elderly mother (81) from Edinburgh to Luton return and received tremendous service from staff at easyjet. My mother finds walking difficult and extra help was given by the staff at both airports. Nothing was any trouble to the staff and despite dreadful weather on our return to Edinburgh, the easyjet staff member took my mother in the wheelchair all the way to our connecting bus. Thank you to everyone in the team!

### "not fly with them again"
On checking in our party of 11 all for our easyJet flight from Liverpool to Faro our cabin bags were measured and found to be the correct size for the lockers. At boarding one of the party was singled out and her cabin bag was found to be to big - this is in spite of it being deemed the correct size in the measuring receptacle at check in and in spite of the fact that another passenger with exactly the same cabin bag was waived through. When the party finally boarded there was no locker room so obviously they had to get rid of a few. We would happily have checked our cabin bags in at check in but were told there was no room. She had to pay £45 and has been refused a refund. The service on the plane was non existent the cabin crew spent 30 minutes eating their breakfasts and ignoring the needs of the passengers. Will not fly with them again.

### "staff kept us updated"
Luton to Belfast for New Year. While landing at Belfast, winds made for a difficult landing and we diverted to Dublin. The staff kept us updated and we were told we would fly back to Belfast and try to land again and if we couldn't would fly back to Luton to change crew. We had the option to get off and make our own way to Belfast and approx 120 people made this decision, we decided to stay onboard and made it to Belfast before passengers who had made their own way. Crew were professional and friendly.

### "none of them was on time"
Gatwick to Milan Linate, and check in was smooth as was security. Although we had one piece of hand luggage only, we were asked to leave it at the door of the airplane and collect it on arrival, as there plane was packed. Boarding seemed quite fast, but onboard we were told that we missed our slot and we should wait one hour on the runaway for another slot. We ended up in Milan with a delay exceeding 1 hour (out of the 3 easyjet flights I booked in the last 12 months, none of them was on time). Flight attendants were reasonably friendly and seats reasonably comfortable. Albeit a low-cost airline, flight price was expensive, maybe because of the close proximity to Christmas (18 Dec).

### "appalling customer service"
easyJet Staff in Southend Airport have appalling customer service. They don't know how to deal with technical issues caused by their servers and seem bored enough to cause issues with myself and my husband that we have not had with easyJet or the other three airports we've flown through in the past twelve days. We paid an additional 50GBP to change the name on my ticket; somehow when my husband booked our four flights for four separate days in four separate airports, the easyjet website processed this particular flight under my husband's name twice for two seats, instead of mine for the second passenger's ticket. Never mind that we had no issue with the other three out of four. They wouldn't do anything for us.

### "never be using again"
Gatwick to Aberdeen with easyJet. We were fully aware of the baggage policy of Easyjet before we booked our domestic flight and chose to book and pay for one bag to go into the hold. Due to flooding around Crawley, our train suffered long delays and we got to the airport with minutes to spare for boarding, missing the bag drop deadline. I had to go to the gate with my cabin size case and a medium handbag where the attendants rudely harrasssed me for £45 and forced me to put my case into the hold. They didn't give a monkeys that I had already paid to put a bag into the hold! And £45? What annoyed me even more was that the flight was only 75% full so my case could have easily fit in to the overhead locker! And only one piece of baggage for a woman? Once home I requested through their customer services department some apology for the way I was treated but didn't get one, even after going through Twitter. This was the worst customer service I have experienced. I will never be using this airline again.

### "quite good for the price"
Gatwick to Heraklion with easyJet. Great flight there but not great back. On the way there we were on an aged A319. The plane was packed and we had a problem with the tickets because we booked the seats that we were all sitting next to each other, but a website blunder put our seats wrong because this was the only flight on the day. The way back wasn't so good, the staff were not organized, they forgot to get my drink. Overall they're a low cost airline and it's quite good for the price.

### "experience was not good"
London Gatwick to Stuttgart. My experience with easyJet was not good. On my first flight to London, the plane was delayed. But that isn't a big deal. I flew with hand luggage plus a backpack from Stuttgart to London without problem. On my return flight, apparently this was a problem. I was told at the gate I needed to check my hand luggage and bring my backpack on board. Normally I'd store the hand luggage in the above compartment and the backpack underneath. I reluctantly paid £45 to have the privilege of checking my bag. I then boarded the plane, stored my backpack in the above compartment only to be told that backpacks are only stored under the seat. I see no reason why I could not bring my now checked luggage on board with me. I'm very disappointed with this procedure.

### "left a lot to be desired"
easyJet from Manchester to Belfast. I don't ask for much on short flights of this nature apart from a reasonably on time departure and arrival, so I am rarely moved to write a review. However, on this occasion I think the attitude of the young man in charge of the cabin left a lot to be desired. We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an "upfront fee" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: "Excuse me Sir" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology. They simply resumed their conversation about Christmas gifts they had received.

### "would fly them again"
The cabin staff were fantastic. Was flying back from Berlin on new years eve and had not been well previously in the day and was worried about getting on the flight in case I was unwell. Unfortunately I was not well on the flight and they gave me a seat at the back of the plane to calm down and try and feel better, gave me water and were checking on me. I am very grateful for what they did and would fly with them again.

### "very disappointing journey"
Lyon to Bristol. We were a family of 8. Ranging from 6 - 70 years old. My 70 year old father hurt his knee whilst we were away so was walking with crutches. When we arrived at the airport we asked for a wheelchair it never arrived. He walked from terminal 1-3. We queued to book in, again asked for a wheelchair. They told my parents to sit and wait and a wheelchair would arrive. They told us the rest of our group had to carry on through passport control leaving my father with my mother to wait for the chair. They never checked on them to see and the wheelchair never arrived. My dad then had to walk through security and a 15 min walk to the boarding area. When they arrived in the boarding lounge they told us what had happened. Dad sat down on one of the chairs and a staff tripped over his bad leg. She only turned around when my mum lept to try and cover his bad leg. She didn't stop to see if he was okay. I asked another staff if he could have assistance from the boarding lounge to the plane - she said she had to see his boarding pass, checked it and said it's not written on his boarding pass. She begrudgingly let him go to the front of the queue. A very disappointing journey that could have easily been different if any of the staff had taken time to deal with the situation properly. To say we are angry at the level of customer service provided by easy jet would be an understatement!

### "staff were fine"
Edinburgh to Geneva return. Arrived at the airport to be greeted with the news that our flight would be delayed by 2.5 hours. After the dreaded wait before boarding the aircraft, the journey went quick enough and the staff were fine. However upon arrival back in Edinburgh we were treated to a 1 hour long Edinburgh airport wait for our baggage.

### "upright tiny seats"
Their seats are the most uncomfortable of budget airlines and easyJet objective is not customer service, but to extract as much money out of you as possible! It was a late evening flight and the attendants spent an extraordinary amount of time, selling their tat in duty free. We were in row 30, and god forbid the attendants speak quietly, lots of loud aimless chatter - so thanks, I didn’t want to try and sleep on upright tiny seats anyway. We flew from Larnaca to Gatwick, far too long for those awful seats - and never again. Get what you pay for I guess!

### "excellent value for money"
I fly regularly Manchester to Munich return and I have to say I am very happy with easyJet. I used to fly Lufthansa but got caught out with a couple of flights cancelled due to strikes so stopped using them. I think easyJet is excellent value for money and I cannot recall ever having a delay. I also like that in Munich they get into Terminal 1 and usually it's straight from plane into terminal (no awkward bus transfer). I can get the flights for under £100 if I book early. Using the app now for boarding passes and online check-in and it couldn't be easier!

### "never travel with them again"
The drive to Bristol was good, the parking was good, the bag drop "plus" was quick, efficient and friendly, fast track through security was good as was priority boarding. Then it all turned pear shaped. The Captain told us there would be a maximum delay of 1hr 10mins because of computer issues at Brest air traffic control. We finally set off 1.5 hrs later with no further warnings or explanations. We had paid for extra leg room seats, but were not warned that for the person sitting nearest the window in row 1 (the only extra leg room seats) was limited by the slide stowage, so it was only okay if you had no left leg! The seats were like church pews, upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch! This despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright! After about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. We were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. Cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness, rather than efficient. The descent into Funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a "missed approach" due to the cross winds being outside the aircraft's limits. We briefly joined a holding pattern, but were diverted to Gran Canaria. We were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt. As it was now nearly six hours since we last ate, we asked for some food. We were told they could not serve hot food now and anyway all the food would have gone off and not be fit to eat! Instead they handed out complementary pringles/crisps and plastic cups of water! After at least an hour, the pilot decided to return to Funchal make another attempt to land. If that failed he would take us to "mainland Europe. The descent was much smoother and the landing was achieved. We finally landed 5 hrs after our allotted time at 12.20am! It was a relief to disembark after 9hrs on the aircraft. Fortunately, our car hire had stayed open for our flight, so we were able to get ourselves to a hotel and find a room for the night, as it was now too late to pick up the key to the apartment we were renting. We have since discovered that earlier flights by other airlines took their passengers to other islands and paid for overnight accommodation. Easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour - there being no taxis at the airport! Whilst the circumstances were not all the fault of Easyjet, and, indeed, we had expected problems with the landing, this airline made a bad situation many times worse by their appalling attitude and shoddy service. Suffice it to say we are not looking forward to the return journey, after which we would never travel with them again!

### "customer service was excellent"
We were unable to land at Funchal because of a terrible storm and weather conditions. The information from the Captain was excellent, we had to divert to Lisbon were met there and looked after overnight in a good hotel with meals and transfers. They made the crisis as bearable as possible and their customer service was excellent. The same crew returned with us to Madeira next morning.

### "not worth the trouble"
Still at the airport - our easyJet flight has been delayed several times and we are at our fourth gate change so far. Bogus announcements rushing passenger from gate to gate for immediate boarding, waiting at the new gates just to be told to rush to a new one. What prompted me to write this review is not only the apparent lack of organization with this airline, but mainly the arrogance of its staff, smiling at each announcement while passengers getting frustrated. Not a single "we are sorry", or "we apologize". At the end of the day, including all the extra fees charged, such as seat assignment and luggage checkin, this airline is just not worth the trouble and the demeaning staff attitude herding passengers left and right.

### "attitude one of arrogance"
Having used my hand luggage on many previous flights I was disappointed to find out that it was slightly too big to meet easyjet rules. I was charged £45 to place the bag in the hold one way, a charge that Easyjet publishes. The attitude of the jobsworth checking hand baggage size was one of arrogance with a patronising tone. I would have no problem paying a fee but £45 is a ripoff and can never be justified. I have had 2 other flights with easyJet recently. The last one was delayed by an hour which wasn't too bad. The previous one arrived at the destination 21 hours late having been diverted to Edinburgh and we were then driven by coach to Liverpool.

### "comfortable with ample legroom"
First return flight with easyJet from Southend to Arrecife. Clean aircraft. Seats comfortable with ample legroom, but did not recline. Regretted choosing row 1 seats. Front of aircraft is very cold, compared to rest of aircraft. I found this out after a stretch walk to the back of the cabin. Many front row complaints. Suffered during the four hour flight. No more front cabin for me on this aircraft.

### "a big thank you"
I travelled with my daughter and her friends on 10th December to Marrakech for 3 nights, Easyjet  from Gatwick, unfortunately I was taken ill pretty soon after taking off, and want to say a big thank you to the staff on duty especially the male and female that helped the 4 medically trained friends I had with me and a Doctor passenger who assisted me. We are all too willing to complain and not give praise. So a big thank you to you all.

### "ground staff unhelpful"
Awful experience with easyJet travelling from Lyon to London Gatwick. Before check-in had to stand for over 30 minutes as there were no seats, door unopened at gate. Then delayed by almost 2 hours due to staffing problem. Was lucky to have a seat at the gate area, most passengers did not. Asked for some water or food but Easyjet insisted on charging. Ground staff unhelpful and did not apologise once. Inflight the captain did apologize, but again no free food. Almost 2 hours late.

### "crew were welcoming"
I traveled easyJet from Geneva to Manchester. Flight departed a little later than scheduled time but this was no problem . The flight crew were welcoming and were active and kept the cabin clean. Only downside is that there isn't much leg room but this is expected using a budget airline.

### "very decent performance"
easyJet from Lanzarote to Bristol, one way flight. Inbound plane about three quarters of an hour late, thanks apparently to French ATC trying out a new system and thereby reducing the flights it was handling for the day. Anyway the plane made up some time and arrived Bristol about thirty minutes late. So nothing much to grumble about. Both pilots were chatty, which I like, and the cabin crew got on with their tasks cheerfully. Cabin clean and fresh and a spare seat gave room to spread a little. All in all, a very decent performance by easyJet.

### "really enjoyable experience"
Boarding our easyJet flight from Bristol to Murcia was fast-ish. Really enjoyable experience, ground crew were friendly and inflight crew were also good. Food was great and at a reasonable price. Took off on time and landed early. I would recomend this airline even though I haven't always had a good experience with them.

### "fly with them next time"
I flew with easyJet from Vienna to Rome a couple of days ago and the experience was great for a low cost airline. I brought a large carry on, so didn't need to check in luggage. Seats are small, but I'm not really tall so I'm fine and for 70 Euro for a return flight you can't expect much. Crew were professional and were always near when you needed something. You don't get any meal or drinks, but prices on board are reasonable, I also like that they were selling bus tickets to Rome onboard. I'll fly with them next time for sure.

### "choose to fly easyJet again"
Flew Liverpool to Lanzarote (Arrecife) in November. Very attentive cabincCrew. Service onboard was quick and efficient, along with smiles and laughter. Seats were comfy and leg room was better than expected. Overall very impressed and would choose to fly easyJet again without hesitation.

### "would like to travel again"
I really liked their flexible policy with passengers' luggage. I noticed some passengers having problems, but the ground crew were extremely friendly and helpful. The seats seemed comfortable, and we had a nice cabin crew. I would like to travel with easyjet again.

### "good value for money"
Easyjet is good value for money. The ground staff was friendly, and staff on board courteus. The cabin was clean and boarding process without any complications. When I booked the easyJet plus, it gave me a much shorter waiting queue and was allowed to enter the plane first (so I had no one standing in my way).

### "not as much as a sorry"
4 hour delay and a bus ride to Malaga. No compensation or as much as a sorry. Rubbish airline, many people struggled with luggage walking from airport to bus. easyjet said delay was due to relaying tarmac on runway when it could be done on days with no flights. The pilot said on the plane said it was because of a national holiday and airport staff did not want to work late. Do not use.

### "I'd fly with them again"
Hassle free start at Gatwick given I travelled hand baggage only and had checked in online. So straight to security which had a very short queue at 05:00. I had purchased an exit row Extra Legroom seat (13D) which also allowed me an extra, albeit smaller, item of hand luggage and Speedy Boarding. This was well worth the additional cost. At the gate, which was posted approximately 50 minutes before departure, I was impressed that gate staff were politely but firmly enforcing their hand baggage policy. For example a group in front of me were requested to pack their hand bags into their wheelie bags as they were allowed only one piece on board. Speedy Boarding was honoured and well policed with other passengers being politely asked to wait when they tried to board. However we then had to wait 5-10 minutes standing on the airbridge until we were allowed on board. Onboard I had no problem getting my bags up in the locker near me. This aircraft had the new seating and the legroom in this exit row seat was superb. The crew were very friendly and professional. My only criticism was that on a flight duration of 4h 30 mins they could easily have done more than two runs with the food and drinks trolley service. I would have bought another drink if they had! We departed early and arrived early and disembarkation was swift. Unfortunately progress through passport control was slow as there were only two immigration officers on duty in Paphos. This was my first experience of Easyjet and I'd fly with them again.

### "up to usual standard"
Another flight with easyJet last week coincided with their 20th birthday, so flight crews were in a celebratory mood. My wife and I also received an e-mail telling us that we first flew with easyJet in 2005 and have travelled over 120,000 kms with them since then. Apart from one significant delay in Corfu because of weather, we have never had any problems with any of our flights. The existence of easyJet (and to a lesser extent, Ryanair) has allowed us to travel frequently and cheaply, which would have been impossible 20 years ago, so thank you for that, easyJet. Yes, one can be picky and identify minor irritations at times, e.g. on this latest flight to Malaga we were marginally late leaving Liverpool because boarding was delayed despite this being the plane's first flight of the day. Such gripes are trivial, however, in comparison with the efficient and good-humoured service provided by all the easyJet staff we have encountered over the years. The slightly tardy departure apart, this flight more than lived up to the usual standard, with a bonus of an anniversary token for everyone on board.

### "think of your customers"
I fly with Easyjet several times a year from Edinburgh to Paphos and cannot see how they can justify outbound flight from Edinburgh at a cost of £36.00 and the return flight on the same aircraft, same crew, same day being £360.00. It is no wonder Easyjet are posting high profits. They are getting greedy and should reduce fares from Paphos to Edinburgh to a more realistic price. Why should passengers from Cyprus subsidise the outbound flight. Customer services cannot give any reasonable explanation for this difference in cost. Come on Easyjet, give us a break. Reduce your multi million pound profits and think of your customers.

### "mixed experience with easyJet"
A mixed experience with easyJet. Outbound flight Manchester to Geneva an enjoyable experience. A320 was fitted with the new slim seats, surprisingly good legroom similar to traditional airlines. Cabin and cockpit crew efficient and friendly. Flight arrived 20min early. Inbound flight Basel to Manchester rather disappointing. Delayed departure by 1h 45min with no information from ground staff. easyJet flight status website had more accurate information! A319 with worn-out seats and very tight legroom. Cabin crew looked a bit tired, but the Captain was apologetic and chatty.

### "10 hours delay flight"
Amsterdam to Rome with easyJet. First time they said it would be delay for 40 minutes, after that another reason happened and they said delay for 5 hours. We only got 13,5€ voucher for foods or drinks at Schipol. After wait for another 5 hours, they said another 5 more hours delay. Total be 10,40 hours delay from the original time. Yes, it happens. They gave us an information sheet which is contains if we will got the full refund and compensation about 500€ each person. And the result? Only the full refund ticket and they said the compensation will we get if we onboard the flight. Who will on board the 10 hours delay flight? No one. How smart easyJet. The customer service at Schipol also doesn't have a good hospitality at all. They talk each other about you in Dutch language cause they think you won't understand what they said. So if you have a little bit more money, just buy another one who can make your journey more satisfied.

### "easyjet went the extra mile "
I was impressed by the way easyJet handled our grounded flight at the end of October 2015. After boarding in Corfu a fault was discovered with the aircraft and it would not be taking off. Passengers were bussed to the terminal to collect luggage, boarded coaches to a hotel for the night, with breakfast included. The next morning we checked in, the boards told us departure time was changed by two hours. Refreshments and sandwiches laid on for delayed passengers at the café. Easyjet in my opinion did well. It was the best delay handling I've experienced. A week later I checked their compensation policy and online submission was easy! Eight days later 800EUR was paid into our bank account. If EU law hadn't been in play concerning compensation,I wouldn't have been disgruntled as I believe easyjet went the extra mile for us delayed.

### "very easy change over"
Was due to fly easyJet to Sharm el Sheikh on 5th November, on the 4th we received email advising that the flight had been cancelled. We were offered a full refund or to transfer the flight. We spoke to easyJet in the morning and were transferred at no extra cost to Paphos. Fabulous and very easy change over.

### "most unfriendly airline"
Paris to Venice with easyJet. The most unfriendly airline I've ever flown. From charging an extra 55 euros in a self evident scam to force me to check a bag that would easily have fit in the overhead to crowding passengers on a bus and making them stand for a half hour before opening a plane nowhere near the gate at Paris Orly, this is absolutely the worst. Spend the extra money for a real airline.

### "First and last flight with easyJet"
Worst experience ever. Had rebooked my easyJet flight in the morning for 100 pounds to a later flight. Then had a cancelled meeting so I could be there earlier and take the original flight. I read at the formal website that there is no check in counters in Copenhagen, so go all the way to the gate just to be told that there are check in counters, and and changes have to be made there. Plane is in front of me, empty seats and no - they will not change it at the gate. My original flight was 3 hours later and was 50 minutes delayed. Flight seats could not recline and the plane was full of advertising. First and last flight ever with easyJet!

### "closure time for baggage drop"
Unsatisfactory due to closure time for baggage drop. On the day of the flight, easyjet posted a message on website advising that flight was 70 minutes late. Accordingly we arrived at airport half an hour later than originally planned but still over an hour before revised departure time. Easyjet refused to allow us to check in bags because bag drop had closed. Staff at check in said the baggage drop closes at the original,specified time irrespective of any delay to flight - even if announced on website. Fortunately our cases were small enough to go as hand luggage. However my elderly 87 year old mother had oversize liquids, scissors etc which of course were picked up at x-Ray. Fortunately when we explained what had happened the security official took pity and zipped up her case without confiscating the items which surprised me. We then had long wait before the delayed departure. Seats and service onboard the flight were satisfactory.

### "Good value"
In a word "satisfactory". Paid for Premium Boarding and seats at front as travelling with my elderly mother. Flight on time and seat comfortable with sufficient legroom. Good value and very satisfactory for a short flight.

### "well worth it"
Outward on Easyjet, back on a Titan Air aircraft. Online checkin and self print boarding passes worked fine. Both crews good and although the return flight was delayed 30 mins (due to fog) were kept informed. Captain kept us well informed during the flight. We paid a little extra for seat reservations, well worth it. We didn't use speediboard but it was used at both airports.

### "very disappointing experience"
The way easyJet reduces flight prices is absurd and customer unfriendly. First of all, they urge you to check in online saying there aren't any check in counters at the airport, only luggage drop-off (which isn't true of course). Anyway, I wanted to play the game and tried to check in online. My first try was 7 hours before departure. I had several other tries but each time the internet site told me to check in at the airport. There, they told me that my flight was over-booked (this seems to be a common policy of easyJet and often, there are enough people who do not come). Well of course, this time not. There was only one easyJet employee (who was totally over-charged with workload) at the customer service who told me to wait briefly. The queue of people became longer and longer (there seems to be lots of queries and complaints with easyJet) and I ended up waiting several hours. Ironically, easyJet writes on their boarding passes "don't be late the others can't wait" (yeah right, and I can?) and "next time, why not check-in online" (well I tried to but their site wouldn't let me). Very disappointing experience, easyJet!

### "policy they told me was a lie"
I was told that "the easyJet flight was full and all carry on bags now needed to be checked unless you were speedy boarding. I complied and didn't put up a fight. Then countless people came in behind me who were not speedy boarding and were allowed to take their carry-ons with them. It seems the policy they told me was a lie. It's obvious that they just needed to check a certain amount to make room. Next time I will put up a serious fight. This is ridiculous. If you need volunteers that's fine but don't lie to my face easyjet. It's just not good business! !

### "seat was comfortable"
Stansted to Naples with easyJet. Paying a premium to preselect my seat in row 2 at time of booking, also gave me priority boarding, and allowed me to carry on a small handbag in addition to a carry on bag. The seating, as well as use of the priority bag drop off. Boarding was efficiently handled. My seat was comfortable with adequate legroom for a short flight. Cabin staff were pleasant and professional. Overall a good experience, and better I have experienced on similar flights with major carriers

### "best of European low cost"
Pleasant flights with easyJet. We had purchased emergency exit row seats, and had speedy boarding, which made the boarding process stress free. It was good to see that in Palma, even though a bus was needed to get to the aircraft, speedy boarding passengers were released from the bus first. I was impressed by the attention given by the cabin staff to ensure that the exit rows were kept free of bags, shoes etc. The best of the European low cost airlines as far as I am concerned.

### "enjoyable 5hr flight"
Newcastle to Tenerife with easyJet. Cabin crew took care over us as we were priority boarding. Captain kept us well updated. Boarding on time and departure 5 minutes late. Overall a really enjoyable 5hr flight. Seat comfort and recline could be improved and entertainment!

### "boarding procedures inconsistent "
I've been flying with easyJet since the very beginning, so I have a particular affection for the company. However my most recent experience, a return journey between Gatwick and Edinburgh, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding boarding. At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them. Overall I do like easyJet but their boarding procedures are becoming inconsistent and a tad shambolic.

### "high level of customer service"
We recently travelled Glasgow to Malaga return. Unfortunately at the start of our return journey our hire car let us down and we had to telephone roadside assistance. This resulted in as arriving at Malaga Airport 25 minutes before our return flight was due to take off. After many apologies to other passengers for queue jumping and running underneath barriers we reached the bag drop desk and the Easyjet representative told me to run with my luggage as I had already checked in on line. She said she was not sure we would make it but encouraged us to go for it. We were held up slightly at security as due to our earlier encounters with the car I had omitted to remove a bottle of water from my hand luggage! This resulted in us leaving security 10 minutes before departure and with a heavy heart and heavy bags we run through duty free to the departure gate. The Easyjet representative made a quick call on the radio and told us to run as quickly as we could down the airbridge. Staff efficiently tagged our luggage and on we went - departing Malaga on time. Had we not received the very high level of customer service and assistance from the Easyjet staff in Malaga we would not have made it home to Glasgow on Sunday.

### "have a monopoly on this route "
easyJet really are terrible. Cutting cost at the expense to customer service would appear to be their mantra. They are full of untruths regarding punctuality. Awful, awful experience every time I fly, bit unfortunately they have a monopoly on this route so no option - and they know it!

### "staff need some training in customer service"
First thing easyjet need to address is their staff need some training in customer service, what a miserable, sullen and in some cases rude bunch of people thats from check in staff through to cabin crew, rude and ill mannered. There was an odd one or two and I mean two max who were bordering on half pleasant. Flight was delayed but we were still herded onto the plane and sat there with a 4 hr delay, we were eventually maybe after 3hr and 45 minutes offered a plastic cup half full of water which you had to go to the back of the plane for. Granted - mid air we were offered a drink and pringles or a chocolate bar, but you would have thought the cabin crew were paying for this out of their own pocket. It was begrudged. I would say nearly all if not all passengers were from the north west, and even though we were cooped up, passengers were annoyed and fed up, but there was still a good banter amongst the passengers. Easyjet take note you could have had a lot of irate, angry passengers to deal with and quite rightly so.

### "never seen such confusion"
All the easyJet flights from Bordeaux at Friday 09.10.15 evening were delayed. After having no information first, the delay info for our flight was 10 minutes but we ended with more than one hour, the flight to Lyon was more than 2 hours but from the beginning correct announced! I have never seen such a confusion in a waiting area and so confused staff on a plane searching several time the same empty boxes for whatever. It seemed to me that the staff had come to this plane by surprise. Like we did with the delay. The staff was very friendly but obviously not on their right plane. Information policy of easyJet is a big mess. If they are late the just do not want to talk about it!

### "easyJet is a joke"
easyJet takes people for granted. We were rushed on the plane only to sit on the runway for at least one hour. Our return journey was delayed for two hours and then we were told that most of the snacks were unavailable. easyJet is a joke but the sad thing is that we will probably use them again, and they know it because we are willing to put up with their inefficiency.

### "could not have been more attentive"
Confusing information about our outbound flight had us running to the gate only to sit on the plane for an hour as, although the screens said gate closed, the flight was in fact, delayed. Return journey was on time and both flights smooth. As a nervous flyer I wasn't expecting much on a cheap flight but the staff could not have been more attentive. The cabin manager was fantastic, even to the extent of introducing me to the pilot and co pilot. Both of whom reassured me and asked if I was OK when we landed. Although of course its ridiculous, I tend to stick to certain airlines I feel slightly more confident using. easyJet have not previously been on my list but will be in the future. The pre booked allocated seats were comfortable and for me the customer service was first class. Thanks to all the crew for turning what could have been an ordeal for me, into a much more pleasant experience.

### "return journey was horrendous"
Newcastle to Bristol return with easyJet. The staff at the Newcastle were polite, friendly and helpful. The return journey was horrendous. I have never been to Bristol airport and asked at the easyJet desk where I needed to go (myself and family already had 'speedy boarding cards') - the assistant on the desk spoke to me like I was something she had trod in saying in a cold manner 'You don't need to be here, you don't have luggage do you? , just go up the stairs over there'. So I went to the Aspire Lounge until the TV screen showed which Gate I needed to be at to board my flight home. When the screens did show me where my gate was, the time was 15.45 at gate 15,  so we made our way towards the gate. I happened to spot a sign on a wall that said it was a seven minute walk from this sign to gate 15. Whilst walking down the corridor I was watching the info screens and noticed that gate 15 had changed from 'boarding' to 'closing' - the time on the screen was 15.51. Everyone on that now started to run down the corridor in fear that they would not make the flight. My elderly parents were flying with me and my mother is asthmatic so she cannot run or even walk quickly. How is anyone supposed to make a flight when they are not given enough time to comfortably walk a route. Everyone was complaining about this and the staff just shrugged their shoulders and said in a muttered tone 'You got here didn't you?'. That is not the attitude I expect from a professional company. This was my first experience of an easyJet flight and it will also be my last. My advice to Bristol easyJet staff is to remember your customers pay your wages, treat them with respect and have a friendly attitude. My overall rating is 5/10 and the 5 is for the staff at the Newcastle, Bristol easyJet staff get nothing.

### "policy only valid for Italian citizens"
Had to cancel my trip because my travel companion was not cleared to fly post surgery for medical reasons. I purchased trip insurance because I knew this might be a possibility. Little did I know, easyJet sold me an insurance policy that is only valid for Italian citizens. I inputted my address as being from the US, but this evidently means nothing to EasyJet. I've had to call them and the insurance company several times to clear this up, and in the end, both myself and my travel companion are out for the cost of this flight. No where on the site did it make clear that the policy is only valid for Italian citizens, and the insurance company representative said that this is a very common problem for all citizens worldwide who purchase a flight through EasyJet. I would rather easyJet not make trip insurance available so that I wouldn't have purchased the flight in the first place!

### "denied checking in another luggage"
Was denied checking in another luggage bag even when the first bag weighed less than 20kg. Staff at the easyJet check in counter was rude. The only plus point during this particular journey was the lively cabin crew. I would hesitate to fly again with this airline and not recommended it to family and friends.

### "horrible easyJet ticketing staff"
Most horrible easyJet ticketing staff at Schiphol Airport. I missed my flight through my own fault, and was extremely upset because I had to get back to London by 5pm that day to catch my flight back to Australia. My airline to Australia had no other seats available until two weeks later so I had to get back that day. The woman I spoke to just gave me a really cold look and basically made it clear she couldn't care less about me the customer. Offered me no help, and  all I got was indifference which was even more upsetting. Luckily for me a kind stranger saw me in tears and calmed me down enough for me to get it together and eventually get on a BA flight to London City Airport which got me to London in time. I will never bother with easyJet again and will not recommend it. When things go wrong they don't give a stuff about their customers.

### "gives me everything I need"
Even though easyJet is a low cost airline, it gives me everything I need - a good price, relatively good service, and I can buy meals and drinks on board. The only thing missing is wifi ad there is no entertainment system, so I recommend you take a book or something to read. Since I used lowest fare I could not choose the seat, but since I was flying alone that was not important. I could sit anywhere. The flight was smooth.

### "Impressed and will use again"
Ibiza to London Stansted on easyJet was a really good flight. Paid extra for legroom and speedy boarding. Well worth it. Newish aircraft staffed by friendly efficient crew. Flew Ryanair on outward leg, and easyJet experience was far superior. Impressed and will use again.

### "you can't trust easyJet"
If your easyJet flight is cancelled - watch out! We were notified the day before our flight from Santorini to Manchester,  that the flight had been cancelled. After a lot of messing about and little support from Easyjet. We got a flight a day later to London Gatwick. We incurred significant cost getting back to Manchester and submitted our receipts to easyJet to claim compensation. We flew to Gatwick on the 6th August - it is now the 25th of September and they have still not settled our claim even though I had to pay the extra travel cost almost 2 months ago. What is most annoying is that when we were in Santorini trying to contact easyJet to see what our options were - you could not get through to customer services (we were on hold for over an hour!). I have called them since my return 5 times (the average hold time is over 30 minutes) and although they promise to sort this out and say a manager will call back, they lie - they don't sort it out and don't call back. As a travel editor I regularly use low cost airlines - Jet2, Ryanair etc. and I have to say the lack of customer service make easyJet the worst I have come across. I will certainly never use them again. You can't trust easyJet to be there for you and to sort out problems. Think carefully before you book!

### "I feel easyJet is best avoided"
We were stranded in Portugal for 5 nights due to the French Air traffic control strike this April. Yes we were put in a 5 star hotel but there was no proper advice given. People were encouraged to fly to an airport, in some cases hundreds of miles from home, with no clear promise of payments. I had serious doubts that easyJet would pay up. To this day they have promised to look at my out of pocket expenses, but they do not answer the phone and if you email them you get an automated response but no real reply. I think easyJet believe if they drag their heels people will forget about it. A very poor show. all in all I feel easyJet is best avoided.

### "wouldn't contemplate them for flights over 2 hours"
easyJet is not a cheap airline if you don't book when the "headline" fares go on sale or when they run one of their fare sales. Because it was an early morning flight we had to book a hotel nearby. The one plus is being able to check in your bag the night before to save time in the morning. The staff doing that told us to hurry as she was about to go off shift and we would have had to wait for her replacement to arrive! Next morning we did just breeze through however. We were in the South terminal. What a horrible terminal. The only upside was we had a gate were we actually boarded using a plane bridge instead of the stairs! Onboard the crew were very nice and the plane clean and tidy. I find their on board menu options overpriced and they never seem to have the items I want anyway! The flight to Paphos is over 4 hours and easyJet seats don't recline (even though they tell you make sure your seat is in the upright position) and there is no head rest support. easyJet planes are like sitting on a park bench. Nice for a little while, but eventually you want to move on. But you can't. The whole plane got fidgety because they were so uncomfortable. These no frills flights are fine for short trips but for mid haul like this they really need to have more comfort features built in to their seats etc. I wouldn't contemplate them for flights over 2 hours unless there was no full service airline available.

### "larger hand luggage was not allowed"
Because easyJet is a low cost carrier, almost every passenger travels with hand luggage only. That means many cases. More than the overhead compartments can handle. That's why we had to give our carry on to the flight attendant and had to wait for our luggage upon arrival. For a short city trip this is not very convenient. On the return flight we had the same problem and larger hand luggage was not allowed inside the aircraft.

### "lost half a day of the holiday"
Flew with easyJet from Manchester to Athens and told at check-in that there would be a 2 hour delay as the captain had taken ill. Made to repack 2kgs luggage. Boarded 2 hours later then sat on runway for a further hour with the captain keeping us updated but with extra excuses "new crew as over hours", "congestion", "missed slot". Flight was fine. We arrived late afternoon instead of mid morning so lost half a day of the holiday.

### "flew Easyjet because we couldn't get anyone else"
We had an 05.50hrs flight from Gatwick to Fuerteventura. At Gatwick by 0400 hrs. Huge queue to drop off bags. Had to be pulled out of long queue by staff and moved to the front to check in as time was running out. Through security immediately. Went straight to Boots and bought sandwiches for kids (took 5 mins max ). Came out to see "Final Call" for flight. Ran to furthest gate possible with 2 kids. Straight on plane, and then the plane sat on tarmac for 90 mins. Captain came out and told us the problem and then let everyone in to see the cockpit. Great communication and kids loved it! Brand new plane with good legroom. Return journey on older plane with no legroom but in fairness arrived 1 hour early. Sent to South Terminal instead of North (crew informed us after taxiing around airport for ages). Then we had to get bags, kids etc on monorail back to North Terminal at 02.00hrs in the morning. Suffice to say some kids had had enough by then. No help or direction. Very poor. Only flew Easyjet because we couldn't get anyone else.

### "Took off over three hours late"
Told at easyJet check-in there was a two hour delay as the captain had taken ill. Great to be warned in advance. Paid-for luggage allowance, was 2.2 kg overweight so had to repack or pay! Boarded on-time but after several different excuses, loss of departure slot, flight attendants over hours and having to be replaced etc. Took off over three hours late which ruined the rest of the day. Inflight service is standard, you know what to expect. Wasn't even a particularly cheap flight.

### "best way to deal with a delay"
Outward flight from Liverpool to Palma was fine and we landed marginally early. The return flight was delayed but my wife and I were impressed by the way staff handled the delay. A problem with the hydraulics had been discovered on the outward flight and this needed repair. The captain explained and kept us informed of progress. The repair meant no air conditioning for a time, but aircraft doors and the flight deck windows were left open and passengers who needed air were allowed to stand by the doors. Everyone was offered water. We eventually left over an hour late but made up a little time en route. We hadn't been comfortable waiting on a hot plane, but there was no fuss because we knew why. It was the perfect example of the best way to deal with a delay by telling passengers what is happening to  minimise any discontent.

### "congratulate easyJet on high standard"
As a very nervous and somewhat elderly passenger travelling with my daughter-in Law, I would congratulate easyJet on it's high standard. The crews on the flights I took from Edinburgh to Hamburg return were extremely polite and welcoming. The refreshments offered were fine for the money. Both flights were very smooth as were both landings and I was able to relax and enjoy my flights. I will certainly use Easy Jet again, and pass my thanks to crews on EZY 6931 14/09/15, and EZY 6932 on 16/09/15.

### "I will never travel easyJet again"
I booked EasyJet for a quick weekend trip from Amsterdam to Rome. The departure flight was 5.5 hours late arriving at 2 am the next day (instead of 10pm), I was so tired the next day from no sleep it impacted our weekend trying to catch up on sleep. The return flight was even worse. They kept delaying the flight and delaying the flight, then cancelled after midnight. The blamed it on the weather so they didn't have to pay hotels. There was only a light shower at around 6pm and all the other airlines were departing except for easyJet. The customer service is horrible. No one cares about how delayed you are. We were stranded in Rome because all the flights out were booked. I ended up having to book another airline to get out of there. They were not apologetic for the huge inconvenience. The baggage fees are ridiculous. I will never travel easyJet again.

### "late departure time is about 45-60 mins"
I have traveled easyJet from Glasgow to Bristol on the 14.45 flight from Glasgow on a Sunday and on the 16.15 from Bristol on a Friday. In the last 7 weeks these flights have left on time only twice. easyjet used to be my favourite, now I think their standards and customer service is getting to be bad. My average late departure time is about 45-60 mins.

### "flight either delayed or cancelled"
Every time I fly with easyjet the flight is either delayed or cancelled. I had promised myself over 18 months ago to never use easy jet again, but this week I had a last minute travel and the time of departure and airport was very convenient with easyjet, so I decided to give it a try. I was hopeful the airline had improved. Outbound flight was about an hour late, return flight was three hours late. On top of that, no one was available to provide information, finally found a desk with a person that was giving a food voucher for the passengers being delayed. The total voucher was 4.50Euros - barely sufficient to get a bottle of water, and maybe a coffee. Seats dirty, this time the tray table was broken and didn't latch.

### "did not expect to have this refunded"
I booked this London to Ljubijana flight, but could no longer fly when my father in law passed away. Given the reputation of low-cost airlines, and the fact I booked a flight that could not be cancelled, I did not expect to have this refunded. However, when I contacted the call centre, the staff were sympathetic, kind and arranged for a refund. I am still amazed and thankful.

### "crew friendly and happy to help"
Glasgow to Alicante return with easyJet. The crew were friendly and happy to help, boarding fast and the seat was comfortable. I have flown easyJet in the past and would fly with them again. The only issue I had was that there was no inflight entertainment on a 2.5 hour flight but that's expect on a low-cost airline. Also the outbound plane was quite dirty.

### "will be flying with easyJet again"
We had return easyJet flights for my sons 18th birthday and staff on both flights were brilliant. Our flight Luton to Edinburgh was on time and the return had a slight delay of 20 minutes then they had a technical issues which required maintenance to come on the plane and correct the problem, so we ended up 45 minutes late but it wasnt a problem for us. In flight service was very good and so was the captain and cabin crew. I was surprised at the leg room which was fine. The planes were nice and clean. For what we paid for these tickets we were very happy and we will be flying with easyJet again.

### "ground staff let the company down"
Whilst the service onboard easyJet from Geneva to Liverpool was fine, with cheerful and efficient cabin crew, the bag drop at Geneva is a disgrace. To queue for 45 minutes to drop a bag off and with 70% of desks unmanned beggars belief. For an airline trying to get more business travellers the EasyJet airport manager at GVA needs to start dealing with the needs, requirements and basic service requirements of passengers. Nothing wrong with the flight crews, just the ground staff (which are EasyJet employees) letting the rest of the company down.

### "reliable, straightforward service"
Edinburg to Munich return with easyJet. Both departures were slightly delayed by around 30 minutes. MUC-EDI leg this was due to the temporary closure of Munich airport because of severe weather. Boarding well organised in Edinburgh but less so in Munich. The cabin crew on both flights were pleasant although EDI-MUC crew seemed more efficient. Cockpit announcements were informative and it was a nice touch to have the captain see us off the plane in Edinburgh. easyJet provide a reliable, straightforward service and are our airline of choice for European travel.

### "wish every flight could be like this"
Booked easyJet as it gave the best flight time. Check in was slightly slow to drop bags, but after that it did what it says on the tin. Flight on time, easy boarding, seats fine (did feel like a little more leg room than BA but can't be certain). Friendly energetic cabin crew. We were in row 2, so able to buy food and drink very quickly which was of a good standard. I think further down the plane they would have been waiting quite some time. Quick to offboard and luggage turned up in 15 minutes. No complaints, wish every flight could be like this - excellent value.

### "get what you pay for"
They pretty much define the Low Cost Carrier model where you get what you pay for. If you just need a seat from A to B and are willing to play by their rules it is excellent. The cabin was very clean and the crew professional. The selection of snacks and beverages was decent but pricey. There was some confusion at EDI before the return flight as first there was a 15 minute delay announced but then they seemed to change their minds. Only a few minutes after the gate number first appeared on the screen they started announcing that they were about to close the gate. After sprinting across the terminal I found a decent queue at the gate so I figured this was some sort of a scare tactic to rush passengers to the gate, it felt a bit dishonest.

### easyJet customer review
Luton to Pisa return. Good cabin staff. Slight delay on return flight but kept informned. Luton arrival was an absolute disaster - baggage took over one hour to be processed. No passenger information given. No easyJet staff to speak to. No indication of the cause or likely length of delay. No apologies. Three calls to easyJet customer service were abandoned after listening to piped music for a total of 75 minutes. My taxi waited for 1 hour 20 minutes in arrivals and cost an additional 50GBP. This was a late booking and the first made with a no frills airline in some time. We had a great holiday but I will not be travelling easyJet through Luton ever again.

Being a very nervous passenger I can say easyJet were brilliant. The staff were fantastic with me, I was crying and panicking. The cabin crew came and spoke to me and reassured me and even offered for one of the crew to come and talk to me. Both flights were good, even though there was turbulence I felt ok. Thank you easy jet! No delays and easy check in too.

Flew with hand luggage only so I went straight through security into the South Terminal at Gatwick. Great terminal with enough shops and great views at some locations, especially Cafe Rouge. Boarding the plane was a bit hectic as everyone is supposed to just charge at once. Felt a bit like I was in a herd of cattle. Once on the plane I headed to my reserved seat. The flights to and from Toulouse were quick without distruption. I knew EasyJet is a budget airline so I expected the worst however to my surprise the Airbus A319 I travelled on was very modern and the seats were very comfortable with a generous amount of legroom. During the flight I noticed that the crew were there for your safety and nothing else. All of the crew were French so asking for anything might have been a challenge. Every announcement was in French and then (with difficulty) translated into English. I was a bit surprised considering it's an english airline but maybe these flights are run by another division of the airline to suit the majority of the passengers on board. Overall I was impressed by their 'no frills' service and would recommend flying with Easyjet on their short european routes.

Will the 21.35 pm flight from London Stansted to Glasgow ever leave on time? Its never a short delay and the customer is never given any prior warning of delays although Stansted airport updates on your phone tell you of incoming flight delays - so common sense would tell you that if flight EZY 218 from Glasgow to Stansted is estimated to arrive at 22.30pm then flight EZY 219 cannot possibly leave at 21.35pm or am I missing something?

Easyjet are good in the air but awful elsewhere. They cancelled the flight to Aberdeen on Monday. About 10 minutes after they had directed all the passengers to the gate, (3 hours late) the flight was cancelled and 200 passengers were told to go and see the customer services agent in the departure area. Of course there was no one there. Eventually a single rep turned up and had to deal with us all. After 30 minutes those with no baggage we were led away, those of us with hold bags waited another 30 minutes before we could reclaim our bags and join the queue for a taxi to the Copthorne Hotel. The promised a shuttle bus but it never materialised. The boarding passes issued for the replacement flight the following day sent all passengers to the wrong terminal. It takes longer to get from the Gatwick runway to the terminal exits than it does to fly from Aberdeen to Gatwick. There is always a palava getting off, no steps, no chocks. Too windy. Then a bus to the wrong terminal: the final insult. As I sit here waiting for the flight home easyJet are once again apologising for the late departure of the flight to Gatwick. Not their fault: it never is.

LTN-INV-LTN. The easyJet A319 fleet is really showing its age, particularly where seats are concerned. On the outward leg, every time the chap next to me moved in his seat, mine moved with it, and vice versa. On return leg, the cloth behind the in flight tray was severley worn. Departed 1 hour late from LTN, due to late arrival of inbound aircraft. Bad weather was delaying all departures and arrivals. Quick turn around on the ground at Luton however, good hard working crew, and the run u to Inverness only took 1 hour, despite it being timed at 1hr 25m. Inbound early to arrive at INV, so early departure and early arrival at LTN, again flight time less than the 1hr 20m scheduled. Good crew again. Fourth easyJet flight in a period of 3 weeks, and can't really knock them. Only chose easyJet as BA does not fly this route anymore. LTN to INV flights were cheaper than LGW to INV.

### easyJet customer review
Seats were hard, felt stiff after a 4 hour flight. Not comfortable at all, and they had the cabin heat turned right up. At Larnaca airport queued for over an hour, standing even after check in and security. The airport and easyJet were a let down. easyJet is only good for a 1-2 hour flight.

### easyJet customer review
Opted for easyJet as the price was half my preferred airport and airline option. Even with the travel time and train or car park extras it was worth the saving. Hand bags only, so nothing to check in, but it wouldn't have been a problem as there were so few people at the check in desks. Southend Airport only has around 20 flights a day so it wasn't crowded except when we queued for our flight. Boarding was slow as they made most people check that their bag fitted in the measuring device. Onboard you could see why as there wasn't much space for bags if you were late. We were two thirds of the way in the queue and just managed to get our bags in, but some rows from the seats. I wish we'd been with our bags further up as we had parents with a toddler behind us that kept kicking the seat, putting it's hands through the gap etc. I know this wasn't easyJet's fault, but glad it was only a short flight. Despite the short length, the seats are still hard and lack neck support. So glad to get off at the end. At Amsterdam it was a new experience using the "G" gates. These are low cost I assume as we had to up and down stairs in the terminal as well as from the plane Coming back we got to the gate earlyish so we were in the queue to get onboard quickly and got our bags above our seats. Prompt loading and good to see the crew helping load bags to get the flight away on time. Looong taxi to the runway. Took 10 mins to pass the "regular" D gates BA/KLM use for UK flights. However departure was ontime and with flying time of 35 mins back to Southend, can't complain. Off the plane and through immigration in about 10 mins. Easyjet offer a bus service in the air, a no frills trip. It's fine as it got us from A to B and back again but could improve the comfort of it's seats. The seats are the only thing you will have interaction with if you don't check in a bag or buy some of the overpriced on board food, so it would do them a world of good to improve the comfort of them.

### easyJet customer review
This is my first and last time flying Easyjet. On the last leg of our honeymoon, my husband and decided to book Easyjet because it was cheaper than other airlines for an hour and a half flight. Big mistake. We got to the airport at 10.45 am for our 1.20 pm flight. Right away they notified us at the baggage drop that our flight was delayed two hours due to a "technical difficulty. About an hour before the delayed flight time, we were notified at the gate that the flight was delayed another two hours due to a "technical difficulty. We went downstairs to customer service to discuss our options. The representative was hostile and extremely rude, telling us that the only option was to wait. We wasted the entire day at the airport and will miss all of our reservations. The best part is today is my husband's birthday. In fairness, I know all airlines experience technical difficulties from time to time, but it seems much more frequent of an issue with Easyjet (see Easyjet reviews). Spend a little more and book with a reputable airline to avoid spending a full day of your precious vacation at the airport.

### easyJet customer review
Boarded our plane just ahead of schedule but due to poor weather at Gatwick the take off time was delayed. Captain and 1st Officer were the most informative team I have ever experienced in all my years of flying, the conversation was so down to earth and explanatory. During the flight more information was given also explaining that due to the poor weather he reminded us that it may be a little bumpy. Crew carried out the duties with total efficiency and I certainly look forward to using easyJet in the future.

### easyJet customer review
I'd booked seats last year for this trip. When we arrived at the check in at Bristol I was told I'd only booked one piece of hold luggage and we had two. My mistake as I'd forgotten. However, the woman on the check in desk did not mention that the surchage of £32 did not include bringing the bag back. Had she said this then I would have taken the bag back to my car which was in Silver Zone (we had arrived 2.5 hours early). I was shocked at Geneva when I was asked to pay another 50 Swiss francs. The supervisor for was rude and his reply was "well I'm not Bristol airport". I've complained to easyJet and asked them to refund half of the £64 surcharge but they have refused simply saying that correct charges were applied. Yes, I know they were the correct prices but I would have expected a more professional and helpful approach at Bristol from the easyJet  check in desk. At least then I could have the choice to leave the extra bag behind.

### easyJet customer review
The overall quality of the flight was as expected from a low budget airline - nothing special. The way in which we were treated as customers was below par, and the respect shown for our belongings was next to nothing. The flight was steady and arrived on time, but this does not make up for the poor experience we encountered.

### easyJet customer review
Made last minute trip to Belfast with my Dad. Unfortunately he had a fall at the airport due to a disability he has had since birth. The easyjet staff member at the desk noticed his distress and once she checked he did not need medical assistance arranged for us to be the first people on the plane. The flight attendant ensured he was comfortable on the flight and offered to arrange a wheelchair upon arrival. Upon our arrival at the airport for the return journey Easyjet check in staff arranged assistance and again we were well looked after. I cannot thank everyone enough for everything they did for us without any fuss and making my Dad feel awkward or different. He is a very independent man and they respected this.

### easyJet customer review
Both flights going out and returning were unacceptably late. Going out about one hour late, returning about two hours late. The cause were a series of operational problems: in the first plane the hold door had to be opened and closed manually and the second the plane had a puncture due to picking up a screw. I could forgive one such problem; two strikes me as that there may be grounds to operational management issues at this airline. It seems to me that EasyJet does not have the capability to operate its program at the rate it is trying to do. Particularly for short flights with rapid turnaround. My advice to passengers is fly early in the day. Late on they will have encountered problems and you will have no idea what time you will travel.

### easyJet customer review
This flight was chartered to Titan Airways (I'd heard of them, but never used to be honest). The service was obviously Easyjet. Pleasant crew, good service, (even had flight info - something not seen on an easyJet Airbus!) very comfortable seats, and punctual on departure. Would be happy to fly with them again, if they were a substitute for a European short haul scheduled service.

### easyJet customer review
Horrendous experience, both myself, my 2 year old and my husband were allocated seats in different rows. When I requested help with this on the plane I was told to "sort it out myself" the flight attendant also informed me "if you wanted to sit beside your two year old you should have paid to do so". I had already paid almost £600 for the 3 seats and since minors can't travel alone I assumed one of us would be seated with him. It was obviously something I hadn't even thought of an in hindsight, even though I shouldn't have to pay even more it would have been the safer option, however my complaint is with the way it was dealt with by the cabin crew and the distinct lack of customer care. I encountered rudeness and aggression and was spoken to like I had done something terribly wrong. I am disgusted.

### easyJet customer review
I am pleased to say Easyjet performed well for the busy summer season for our flights to and from La Rochelle to visit family. We didn't have bags but did get to the airport very early. Outbound: EZY8995, 14.40 (15.30)-17.05 (17.37), July 28th. Once in the departure lounge a 12 min delay was posted with the inbound aircraft 30 mins late. Around 30 mins before scheduled time of departure we got told to go to gate 52. Boarding was predominately hassle free but people could just walk on the plane. We pushed back at 15.00 and left Gatwick at 15.30 which was 50 mins late. The cabin crew were friendly and did apologise a few times for the delay. The food was quite expensive but still not as bad as Ryanair. We landed at 17.37 and deboarding was done quickly. The delay was acceptable as it was the 3rd return flight of the day in the summer. Inbound: EZY8996, 12.35( 13.25)-12.50 (13.20), August 5th. Once in the departure lounge a 25 min delay was posted. We boarded quickly around 10 mins after the aircraft arrived and were off quickly and on time. We were advised a flying time of 50 mins which is extremely quick in comparison to the average duration therefore service was rushed. However it was good to catch up with the delay. All in all the easy jet service was normal and the delays were bearable for the peak summer season. Flights costs £95 per person with row 7 seats pre-booked.

### easyJet customer review
Check in was very quick, easy boarding, fight took off on time. Food was typical aircraft food, smooth flight and landing on-time. For a low cost carrier I can't complain.

### easyJet customer review
The flight departed 30 minutes late due to a fault with the water supply tank. I thought that the announcement and explanation given by the Captain who rather than make it from the flight deck made the announcement over the cabin PA from the front of the cabin to be a good touch and set the tone of the short flight. The cabin crew were great, and the service of food and cold drinks was first class.

### easyJet customer review
Older A319 on this flight with older style seating, and I got the impression that the leg room was not as good as the newer A320. Informed by flight deck that there were some "lumps and bumps" en route back to Luton, a term I have only heard on BA before. It was bumpy, but not too distressing, and I always think it is a good thing to be informed before departure - forewarned is forearmed. Did not try catering as did not enjoy it on outward leg. We opted instead to purchase something at Malaga Airport. Good hardworking crew, good announcements and info en route. Another nod in the direction of BA, charity collection and Captain saying goodbye to disembarking passengers. Next easyJet flight for me will be next week to Inverness.

### easyJet customer review
Fairly new A320, with seating reminiscent of coaches. Not too bad actually, and leg room was quite good. No issues with finding selected seats. Five minutes late departing due to some issues with rear door boarding, and then 5 minutes late into Malaga. This is the first time I have flown easyJet in a number of years, and I am glad to report that they have upped their game. No more silly announcements about placing your unwanted children in overhead lockers, or smokers will be evicted mid-air. They were professional, and hard working. Good announcements from flight deck and crew. They seem to have adopted some of BA practices, such as collection for charity (Unicef) and Captain waiting to say goodbye to disembarking passengers. Only downside, I could not recommend the bacon baguette, and my wife could not recommend the ham and cheese toastie. Overall good experience.

### easyJet customer review
The flight itself was OK, typical low cost airline, food inedible and coffee poor. Seats cramped, aircraft new and very clean and neat. The problem with this flight was the terrible check in at Catania, no priority given to flight departure times, all flights in one rugby scrum, queue jumping was the norm. We arrive a full two hours before the flight, the check only opened an hour before departure and we barely made the flight, absolutely ridiculous.

### easyJet customer review
Flight cancelled after lightning strike. Kept us on plane for 1.5 hrs, crew said alternatives would be sorted out. No easyjet employees to assist approx 130 passengers. 2 Menzies staff trying to handle a planeful of passengers by offering buses to Edinburgh or Stansted. easyJet knows nothing of customer service. We paid through the nose for flights for the 6 of us with Lufthansa tomorrow.

### easyJet customer review
Flew from Bristol to Arrecife return. Family holiday. Flight there was great, left at the right time and landed early, we had the newer aircraft with comfier seats. Cabin crew were great, food was alright with a nice chicken wrap. Flights were EZY6193 and EZY6194. Staff were friendly and pilots were great both ways with keeping us up to date with weather upon arrival and flight routes.

### easyJet customer review
The flight was nice and comfortable, as always. The service was OK, not very entertaining, but it is actually not required for a short range flight. The service gave a moderate selection of food and beverages, and I personally recommend the Double Chocolate Muffin (very tasty). Being a low cost airline I very recommend to fly easyJet whenever possible.

### easyJet customer review
2 trips within 3 days, FNC-BRS-FNC. 1st flight outbound fine, return flight not so good. Newer aircraft with upgraded seating etc. Seats are much slimmer, less padding and therefore very uncomfortable, larger gaps between, no built in headrest, legroom appears less. Rows are now slightly staggered. Presumably new seating has allowed an extra few seats to be fitted and are clearly much lighter than older, more comfortable seats. The design of the seats does not allow anyone in seats other than aisle to see the safety demonstration. I am 6 ft tall and really struggled to watch demonstration and knees reached seat base in front. Have flown many times on Easyjet over many years but this was one of the most uncomfortable and is clearly a retrograde step in my opinion.

### easyJet customer review
Overall a good value for money experience with EasyJet. Was flying from Luton Airport to Nice on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy. Good experience with EasyJet would advise booking early for cheaper flights but if your able to be flexible that also helps. Overall good experince with EasyJet and looking forward to our return journey with the airline.

### easyJet customer review
I haven't flown with this airline for 8 years. Seating much better than in past. Staff look smarter but still old easyJet poor staff attitude, herded on and fed the expensive usual. At the end the proverbial "Goodbye, thank you for flying us etc". No screen to watch route and the Captain flying out couldn't say anything about the route. Friends who flew with a sister holiday airline had really useful data regarding route. So really no better.

### easyJet customer review
Good flight both ways, checked in online using the mobile app which worked like a dream. Both flights slightly delayed due to ATC backlog but captain kept passengers informed. Found flight attendants to be both professional and courteous serving a good selection of snacks and drinks, also some good offers from the onboard shop. Plane on the return flight looked new and was comfortable.

### easyJet customer review
CPH-BRS. Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight –  wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner. The captain made up for the late start, and we arrived on time in Copenhagen.

### easyJet customer review
They had the new thinner seats on this flight and it made the journey an absolute joy. I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and I could fully stretch out. The flight left on time, boarding was easy and the cabin crew were helpful and professional. Not my usual budget airline experience.

### easyJet customer review
Usual easyJet flight - on time, reasonable refreshments available, pleasant staff, seats bit hard after a couple of hours.

### easyJet customer review
Flight out (Manchester to Heraklion) was fine, pleasant staff and straight forward. We checked bags and carried hand luggage. Cramped and uncomfortable seating, along with expensive food on board, this unfortunately becoming the norm for this level of airline, so no surprises. Returning (Heraklion to Manchester) however ended with further expense just prior to boarding. We checked the same bag for the hold as before no problem and carried the same bags, but afterwards we received very disorganised information from the easyJet staff at this airport. Waiting to board the plane at the gate we were singled out in the line by an particular easyJet staff member and to some extent made an example off. The issue initially involved my fiancée carrying an over the shoulder purse as this is apparently one extra piece of hand luggage. I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fiancée's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional €55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff). Uncomfortable, no entertainment, limited and lastly not that particular inexpensive flight. We hope to fly with a more reputable airline in the future.

### easyJet customer review
As this is a low cost airline, we did not expect free meal, snack, drink or entertainment system. Staff very friendly and helpful. Seats width and legroom acceptable (191 cm tall), however backrests not adjustable, but just a short flight. Negative: very long queue at the bag drop desks in CAG. Had to wait 35 minutes.

### easyJet customer review
I don't know why they call easyjet a low-cost carrier as the flight was definitely not cheap. Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet's "midnight check-in" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I'd paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn't find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay €100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I've had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins. Bags took a while to come out. Overall, a satisfactory journey, but they need to drop the "low-cost" moniker and go back to being called a no frills airline as that's what it is with all the charges you pay.

### easyJet customer review
Would like to thank EasyJet for recovering my wallet (with all my money and cards in place) from the aircraft after I noticed 1 hr after landing in Malaga, on 9th July 2015. That is what I call Customer Service. Thank you to the honest staff who boarded the plane and returned my wallet making my holiday fantastic.

### easyJet customer review
Flights on time both legs, good service from the cabin crew. Thought the seat width and legroom was actually quite good, better than some charter companies used previously. My only gripe was the ridiculously long queue at the bag drop desks at Bristol. What's the point of checking in online if you've still got to stand for an hour just to drop off a suitcase, they needed to open far more desks. Other than that, I couldn't fault them.

### easyJet customer review
Return flight KRK-BSL-KRK. I needed a cheap ticket from Poland to that area of Europe and this fulfilled my expectations. EasyJet is a low cost airline, so I did not expect any meals, snack or entertainment system. Price wasn't cheapest possible, but it wasn`t high either. Seats were low cost airline type, but the airplane wasn`t fully occupied, so there was a place if someone really wanted to change place. Flight wasn't long, so traveling conditions were completely acceptable.

### easyJet customer review
The gate agents declined our backpacks as personal items to go under the seat and informed us we had to consolidate them into our full rollerbags in order to take them on the plane. Of course we could not accomplish this. The agent then informed us they would have to be checked at £45 per bag fee, and this could not be done until all others had boarded the plane. We could have bought the two rollerbags a seat on the plane for half that amount of money. After tagging our bags, the agents did not seem to be able to figure out how to charge us so they told us to give our bags to the luggage handler at the bottom of the airplane steps and get on the flight, which we were holding up at that point. We felt very manipulated and embarrassed and will not use this airline again, despite its favorable pricing. It's a great bargain as long as you travel naked!

### easyJet customer review
Just to print the boarding pass was a nightmare. I tried for several times and I did not succeed. That was in Rome. I asked a friend in UK and we did not succeed. We made a round of all the shops in town that could help us, but they could not, we went back and tried many ways, at last after many many attempts we had this boarding press printed. A real nightmare and a loss of time. Moreover to bring the guitar in the cabin I had to pay 50 euros. I really would not recomend it.

### easyJet customer review
My husband made arrangements for our Europe trip months in advance. We were due to fly out of Paris through Easyjet to Berlin. Our flight was at 7 am. We arrived at the airport 1.5 hours in advance only to find out the airline requires you to check-in online. The clerk argued that it was too late. How is it possible that they could give our seats away when there was still 1.5 hours left until our flight left. In any case, they were not helpful in trying to book another flight. They were fully booked for days. We ended up taking the shuttle to a different airport and booking a more expensive flight for 13 hours later.

### easyJet customer review
The seats onboard were awful as I could see the seat covers were torn and seat tray table would not latch properly to stopper, they kept falling off. This was the case with every seat. The flight did not have a facility to warm milk for my baby. I know its a low cost carrier but many essential things are offloaded. Passengers are not even offered water on board, that should be free. I really do not see big price difference when I compare full service carriers over easyJet.

### easyJet customer review
Have flown easyjet a couple of times recently and have always been very happy with them. My flight was astonishingly cheap especially as I only had hand baggage. The crew were friendly and efficient, kindly asking other passengers for change when my note denomination was too large for them to accept. Flight was on time and Pula airport gave out free cakes at the gate which was great.

### easyJet customer review
My husband and I flew from Paris to Rome in June 2015. We were going to fly with Air France but their cheaper flights sold out too quickly and we missed out. Apparently there was a fire at FCO in May so they changed us to CIA but only gave me 2 days notice, which I was annoyed about. Turned out to be a blessing because we flew out of FCO and it was Crazy. I highly recommend CIA. Our flight was on time, no delays. Staff were pleasant. The seats were comfortable. I paid $12 extra for extra leg room so our carry on bags would be guaranteed to fit, as we weren't checking luggage. We both fell asleep promptly and missed any drink service or entertainment. I checked in online, knew all about the fees and charges so as long as you are prepared it shouldn't come as a shock. Either way, zero delays, zero issues, cheap flight. What more could you want?

### easyJet customer review
Not very impressed with extra charges on baggage (£30) especially after the flight was turned around and 4hour delay in Liverpool. A £3 voucher doesn't get you much in Liverpool airport. There was a notable absence of passengers refusing to travel afterwards.

### easyJet customer review
There was no communication to me that flights from Rome to Munich were cancelled. No email, no text, no call. Customer service desk doesn't open until 8, too late to sort out how we can get reimbursed  to fly on a different airline. It seems like theyare one of the most noncommunicative airlines, judging from the volumes of people that have experienced issues with the airline. This airline is cheap for a reason.

MXP-MUC-MXP, outbound flight was early in the morning and departed on time from Milan. Return from Munich arrived 25 minutes prior our scheduled arrival time in Milan. On both flight crew members were polite and kind, airplane was cleed and new seat were very comfortable. I didn't use their inflight food service and I neither bought anything from the onboard shopping.

### easyJet customer review
Flew out on a new A320 which had the new thin seats which proved to be very comfortable even on a 3.5 hour flight. There seemed to be more space generally so it was a good flight. Left early and arrived early. Check-in at Bristol was well organised with all check-in desks open so little waiting. A different story at Madeira airport. We queued for best part of an hour to check-in. The whole thing was a complete  shambles and there were some heated exchanges between passengers who tried to push in. We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run. Since they had run out of most snacks early on the first run perhaps they thought it wasn't worth doing a second (although a drink of some kind would have been welcome). Overall easyjet is my airline of choice when travelling in Europe as it is now on par with BA or other national carriers.

Drop off luggage queues huge both ways. Easyjet provided the basis for a trip. Ok for short haul flights, not ok for long flights.

### easyJet customer review
Flight out was about 20 minutes delayed due to late arrival. Speedy Boarding ticket row 1. The boarding process was well organized - SB ticket holders first on bus and first off to enter aircraft at remote stand in Geneva. Aware that Easyjet have changed there hand luggage allowance but no passengers had their hand luggage checked or measured etc. Some taking on board alot more than allowed. A very quick food and beverage service for 45 minute flight. Flight attendants x4 working hard in short flight. No inflight entertainment as expected. Arrival in Nice to the gate safely.

I've not flown with easyJet for a few years. This was a good flight, leaving very punctually and arriving a bit ahead of schedule. The boarding process was quick and efficient as was disembarking in Bordeaux. The cabin crew on this flight from Bristol were especially nice and were really good with children, which was nice as I was travelling with my two young nephews. I didn't bother with anything from the in-flight service so can't comment on that. My seat was fine as well, although the seating generally looked like it could do with a bit of refurb soon. But overall I was really pleased with the service on this very short hop from Bristol to Bordeaux.

### easyJet customer review
My return flight to the UK from Bordeaux was not as good as going out. Largely due to the chaotic nature of Bordeaux airport. This involved a cattle like holding area for passengers waiting to board the flight. We were held there for ages before being allowed onto the plane and it was really uncomfortable with nowhere to sit and a single file queueing area in place. Once onboard the flight was very busy. The cabin crew did a good job really, especially as there were one or two disruptive passengers on board who were pretty rude to one flight attendant in particular. Other than that, the flight went very quickly. I was going to get something from the in-flight service, having not been able to pick something up at the airport, but it was slow coming round (despite the fact I was only in row 9) so we were making our descent by the time they got to me.

Travelled from Edinburgh to Luton on 30/05/15 and returned on 07/06/15. Being disabled, I requested assistance on both journeys. The staff at Edinburgh were superb both times,  but the staff at Luton were almost non-existent. On arrival at Luton, we were taken to the baggage hall and told to sit at the side where we would be attended to. I could see my case going round and round and it was eventually removed and taken to me by another passenger. When an attendant eventually arrived, after a very long time, he was rushed off his feet, as there was such a shortage of staff. On the return journey, I was almost reduced to tears. I rang from the booth for disabled assistance, and was assured someone would be with me as soon as possible. I rang twice more and both times was assured someone was on the way. Eventually, a very kind parking attendant went to investigate matters and someone arrived within 10 minutes, by which time I was almost passing out with the heat, as it was like sitting in a greenhouse with the sun beating down and I had waited an hour and a quarter! Again, the attendant was run off his feet through lack of staff and I had not even been checked in (so much for having to arrive 90 minutes before the flight!). As it was, the plane was late, otherwise I would have missed my flight. Having said all that, all staff were very civil, but it did turn my lovely holiday into a nightmare. If Easyjet are committed to helping disabled people have a smooth journey from start to finish, they need to get their act together and liaise with OES re passenger assistance, especially in this day and age. May I add that the cabin crews were most helpful, as were the OES staff at Edinburgh where the service is most professional.

### easyJet customer review
As a traveller who double checks weight of cabin bag and checks in any larger luggage well before the trip I was very annoyed and distressed when the Flight Attendant at CDG casually stated when I was boarding that my cabin bag would have to go in hold as the plane (luggage capacity) was full. Whilst standing inline it was obvious that many passengers took more than their allowance on so I felt very displeased when I then had to get my computer and other in cabin needs out of my bag and carry them on board because of EasyJets mismanagement. I will not travel easyJet again.

### easyJet customer review
Milan-Malaga-Milan - Flights on time nice Italian crews very careful safety procedure. Outbound flight on a A319 with very limited legroom. Inbound flight on a new A320 with new style seats and good legroom. Nothing negative regarding flights but I didn't like at all their call center and website. Two of us needed to contact them 3 days before departure and no answer even after 12 expensive minutes waiting. After 4 telephone calls without reply they decided to write. The automatic answer was: "we are very busy and will reply within 7 - 10 days"!

### easyJet customer review
Travelled as a couple from London Gatwick to Rome (Fiumicino airport) from Gatwick on Sunday 31st May 2015 and returned to London Gatwick from same airport on Thursday 4th June 2015. Outbound flight: delayed by 1.5 hours due to original Airbus A320 (180 seats) out of action due to technical issues (Easyjet excuse) so eventually transferred to Airbus A319 (only 156 seats). Tight squeeze and confusion for many of where to sit and many family members split. This plane was looking it's age inside and rattled a lot. It was one of the spare ones used specifically for breakdowns. Inbound flight: Delayed by 2 hours. Okay this airport has had a fire but please it was a month ago! Tannoy systems should be fixed by now. This may not be Easyjets fault but consider this: The flight was EZY5260. There was nothing on the electronic screens to show that this flight even existed (despite an Easyjet representative saying that the flight was erased it was never on the boards as we were at the airport for many hours). At the departure terminal 2 there was no information but after several enquiries to airport staff we were asked to go to terminal 3. No information and nobody to consult. There was even a young Easyjet employee who was travelling on an earlier flight (there were several to the UK all delayed) who was as perplexed as we were). At last after further enquiries and looking at the Easyjet website on phones the reason given for the delay was that a technical fault was the excuse. Easyjet are not at fault on the airport issues but I think they could do a lot better. Replacing ageing aircraft is a must and leaving passengers in the dark is inexcusable. Even though the pilot apologized for the delay it's not the delay at all it's the lack of common sense and dialogue that exasperates passengers. I've been in similar positions with other airlines. What do they do? Obtain a large white card describe the problem and where to go and have a rep at the terminal as described. It's not rocket science is it? The marks given are for poor customer relations and not the flight or pilot or flight attendants who were probably as cheesed off as the passengers for working later than anticipated.

We recently holidayed in Santorini Greece and flew out on Sunday 17/05/2012 returning Wednesday 27/05/2015 at 13.10. There were a few problems on the ground which delayed take off but we were kept informed and felt comfortable with it. As the flight commenced the front 10 rows were inconvenienced by a large family who constantly demanded attention from the crew and a small boy who ran up and down the aisle punching passengers arms as he went. He was completely uncontrollable. My observation was that cabin crew dealt with it very professionally and with humour. The flight was an excellent experience otherwise with a lady pilot keeping us well informed and a great landing!

I flew to Ljubljana airport on 23 May 2015. The plane was delayed 5 hours on the way out due to a technical problem. Small voucher given at Stansted airport which wasn't accepted or didn't work at several food shops. No extra internet time given and only one hour free. I now come to Ljubljana one week later to find plane delayed approx. 2 hours. I did check if any delay before leaving hotel and none mentioned. At least Ljubljana airport give you free unlimited Internet! I will look at using Ryanair from Luton next time.

### easyJet customer review
MAN-JMK-MAN. Brand new A320 both ways. Outbound the crew worked as a fantastic team the young female Captain was very informative about the route. The return flight seemed to be much busier some of the flight deck announcements were inaudible. I tried the cheese melt hot sandwich from the bistro. One could only describe it as vile. Hot on one side almost frozen in the middle. Two passengers nearby threw theirs away. Arrived back 30 minutes early. Overall great fantastic service on brand new aircraft I'd just give the Bistro a swerve next time. D E & F seats nearer the front have tighter pitch than seats A B & C.

We flew from Inverness to Luton on Wednesday 13/5/15. As usual it was a straightforward flight with no problems. The cabin crew were efficient and polite and because of the short duration of the flight were quite busy. There was a number of disabled passengers including me who required assistance to disembark. Unfortunately the vehicle used for this was busy elsewhere and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get off. The Easyjet crew were very apologetic and the Captain herself came back and stayed to chat with us while we waited which I thought was a good bit of customer service. Once in the baggage reclaim area there was another slight delay as the conveyor belt would not start. The attitude of some passengers was appalling. The one airport employee present was constantly badgered about what was happening. All he could say was the engineers were trying to fix it and the duty manager was on his way. This evidently was not good enough for some and they registered their displeasure by behaving in a rude and arrogant fashion to both the one employee present and the duty manager when he arrived. The belt started and all luggage was offloaded and collected after about 30minutes not exactly a catastrophe but to some it was as if Easyjet (who were not responsible for any delay) and the Management at Luton Airport had deliberately conspired to cause a problem for their amusement. People should be more tolerant and if time is truly important perhaps allow time for possible or even probable delays.

LPL-ACE-LPL 3 May-7 May. Both A-320 aircraft's were clean and comfortable crew excellent on both flights. Flights left slightly late but due to tail winds arrived on time into Lanzarote and 20 minutes early into Liverpool. Yet another excellent flight. Easyjet remain our low cost carrier airline of choice.

Flew from Luton to Naples on 1st May and then returned on 4th May. This review is for the 4th May return journey (10.35 flight). How nice and personable for the captain to greet the passengers in person just before take off. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. Not used to seeing air hosts/esses looking like they actually enjoy their jobs!

### easyJet customer review
Flight was delayed a bit from MPL-LGW but the rest of the experience went without indecent. It did however seem that boarding took a bit longer than it should have because of some delay in letting passengers on in addition to the general confusion with so many passengers trying to find space in the overhead compartments. In general though the flight went okay it just seems the inefficiency in their boarding process has consistently added time whenever I have travelled with EasyJet both this time and in the past. I also of course did not like how the seats do not recline but I suppose that's another issue.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-DBV 29/4/15. We had already checked in online so bag drop off was very quick also we had booked emergency exit seats so we had priority boarding which also was spot on. The cabin crew were friendly and professional even taking the time to explain to us how to open the emergency door and if we were ok with this food and beverages also ok. Return flight DBV-LGW 3/5/15 also got priority boarding cabin crew just as good as outbound flight. Both flights on time. This is the first time we have flown with easy jet and will have no hesitation about booking with them again.

### easyJet customer review
BHX-GVA-BHX. Another great flight with Easyjet. Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.

### easyJet customer review
BRS-BCN-BRS. Flight out on 18/4/15 was excellent. Took off on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Plane looked to be a new A320 with new thin seats which were surprisingly comfortable and seemed to give plenty of room. Return flight on 2/5/15 was exactly opposite. Probably the most uncomfortable easyjet flight we've ever had (A319). Had seats 20 E & F which were extremely cramped. Luckily the flight left almost on time but with an extended flight time due to head winds it was the best part of two hours of purgatory. This won't stop us using easyjet but we'll make sure we don't have these seats again. Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly but you don't expect them to be your new best friends.

Flew with my mother from Bristol to Reykjavik on flight EZY6001 on Sunday 5th April. Our first time travelling with EasyJet. We had a slight confusion with a staff member at the baggage drop as after he'd weighed and labelled my case I mentioned that the case was my hand luggage but he didn't understand what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but the confusion could have been avoided if there were signs up at both Bristol and Reykjavik airports telling people with just hand luggage that they don't need to go to baggage drop but can proceed to wherever the next step is. Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink. Refreshments expensive especially crisps and chocolate but the bacon baguette I had on the outward flight was tasty! Overall the flights weren't as bad as I'd feared from their reputation and I would probably fly EasyJet again.

Southend to Amsterdam return day trip on 28th April. Quick security check and a nice cooked breakfast at Southend. Outbound flight at 07.25 was just 45 minutes and inbound flight at 21.45 was just 40 minutes. Took off from Amsterdam about 15 minutes late but managed to make up lost time and landed back at Southend 5 minutes early. Cabin crew on both flights were friendly professional and efficient. Didn't bother buying any snacks or drinks as it was just a quick hop. Overall another brilliant experience with Easyjet and would fly with them and from Southend again.

From online check in to bag drop to boarding and on board service the staff were charming and smiling. It has come a long way indeed even the uniforms look professional. Obviously they are doing something right and keeping prices low cost! Every flight was on time.

Flight 2603 8/4/15. The plane and seats were clean and the cabin crew were very helpful and attentive but the ground staff at Milan airport were bad and very disorganised. We started to board and wait in the queue for the bus to take us to the plane instead of having the bus ready we waited in the lines for 30 mins while they organised buses. Why board guests when the bus is not ready is beyond me.

EDI-CDG. Booking the flight online with Easyjet was simple and quick. The experience at the airport was busy and chaotic and ground staff were miserable looking and abrupt with some passengers. Flights on both routes was on time which was good but the cabin staff were poor in their duties and also miserable looking and not very welcoming. I would not use this airline again and would rather pay more for a better experience.

We had a trip back from Chania on 14th April 2015 we travel there many times a year when we left this time it felt like they were on the move to make more money at any cost. We had 20.7 and 20.9 kgs in our 2 suitcases and no hand luggage they insisted on charging us an extra 2 kgs for the extra weight at a cost of 26 euros we had no other bags to transfer anything into so we had to pay it. It is a con and made us very upset and ruined our trip back. Beware people easyjet is charging more and more yet show it costs less and less.

### easyJet customer review
Went SCQ-LGW flight overall was good although it was a little frustrating about their one hand bag rule. Usually I just have a carry-on sized suitcase and my handbag which is about the same size as a purse. Although they said that I would need to put my handbag into my suitcase because "only one piece is allowed" but this woman in front of me had several bags from duty free shops which were quite a bit larger than my handbag yet they said nothing about them to her. Additionally I'm not sure if the seats were not meant to recline or I just couldn't find the switch but I ended up not being able to recline the seat on the flight which was fine for a short flight but for further destinations I think this probably wouldn't be comfortable.

EZY5455 from Gatwick to Paphos Cyprus. I would rather fly in a coffin seats might be ok for short flights of say up to 2 hours but trust me when they rush you on a delayed departure flight already knowing your going to be delayed further due to military manoeuvres around Cyprus air space. Hurry rush sit down belt up. Oh this is your captain speaking we've just been informed our departure is going to be delayed by about 1 hour. Due to military manoeuvres over Cyprus airspace. So sat their we did in cramped conditions for an hour. Another 4 hours until we got to Paphos airport and finally released from the cramped conditions. Still got this to look forward to Saturday night.

U2 1887 Manchester to Munich. Flight left on time despite French ATC strike. I am 183cm and found the seat pitch fine. Cabin crew efficient and reasonably friendly.

I've flown with easyJet a handful of times from London Gatwick to various European cities and my experience has always been pleasant. I've been lucky with delays (or lack of) and have always found staff polite and helpful. I think one must remember that this is not Emirates so your expectation of customer experience should not be as high a standard.

### easyJet customer review
Outward bound was Gatwick to Agadir. It was a traditional 'sardine tin' flight with no leg room and the aisle armrest didn't go up so it was very difficult getting in and out without holding the headrest of the seat in front where a poor young man attempting to sleep was continuously disturbed by me getting up and down as we had a baby with us who wouldn't sit still and it was a 7 30am flight. However the return journey was a total surprise we were on a newer plane with lots of leg room the aisle arm rest went up so we had lots of space and I didn't need to hold onto anything to get in and out of my seat. The seats were a lot thinner but surprisingly more comfortable than the previous thicker seats. On both journeys the planes were on time the staff were friendly- more on the outward flight 2 of the flight attendants on the way back obviously had lost the ability to smile so overall my first experience with easy jet was a positive one and I would definitely use them again. My trip satisfaction would have been a 9 if we had flown both ways on the more comfortable plane and the 2 flight attendants had actually smiled just once!

Flew LTN-ALC return. Flight out was on a new easyJet A320 including the airlines new seats which were quite comfortable and have much more room. The flight was on time and cabin crew on board were friendly and professional. Only downside is how busy Luton Airport is in the morning meaning we just got to the gate in time even getting to the airport 2 hours before! The return flight was on a slightly more cramped A319 with the old style seating. Again flight was on-time and cabin crew were again friendly and professional. Overall a good experience with easyJet.

### easyJet customer review
Appalled by delayed flight from Amsterdam. Two hour delay resulting in landing at Gatwick with no way of getting home because the landing was so late there were no longer any trains from the airport for my destination. Had to find emergency accommodation and pay a fortune in getting there by taxi. I recommend you never book the last flight with this company you will be severely delayed. Other regular flyers confirmed this to be the case. The flight was due to leave at 21.25 actually boarded at 23.21 - funnily enough just within the two hour deadline for claiming compensation. No full explanation on their website and I'm afraid the old excuse 'technical issues' just doesn't wash when you overhear other airline staff mention the fact there weren't enough planes to fulfil the bookings promised! By all means fly with easyJet but just do not book the last flight especially on very short flights.

Outbound 27 February Gatwick to Luxembourg. online check-in with hand baggage and speedy boarding. All worked well with the exception of speedy boarding at the departure gate. Speedy boarding in same queue as general passengers so in my view was not worth the extra. Inflight seats and beverages fine crew excellent. Flight departed on time and arrived early. Inbound 1 March Luxembourg to Gatwick. Online check-in with hand baggage and speedy boarding. Arrived at departure gate and as flight full case into hold. Speedy boarding as waste of time in my view here as all in one queue. Otherwise an uneventful flight arrived on time excellent crew once again. Hold baggage on belt on arrival. First ever time with Easyjet and would definitely use again where price timings etc work. Would have to rethink the sporting boarding at overseas airports.

Stansted to Palma 21st Feb returning 28th Feb. Bag drop at Stansted was very quick and not much slower at Palma where we were offered a 'free' second hold baggage item. I suspect they knew cabin storage would be at a premium with a full flight. Both flights to time and smooth-especially the landings where touchdown was almost unnoticeable. All in all a pretty good experience.

### easyJet customer review
LIS-FNC another domestic flight with easyjet but this time I didn't catch it after all and in part due to the fact that easyjet now decides to slightly anticipate their take offs without notice. The plane was right in front of the gate they just had to open it and I would walk to the plane which had its doors still open and the ground support equipment also functional. Would it hurt that much? Had then to change flights to the other day paid 160 EUR more for 2 passengers and they weren't even able to give me a receipt with theirs and mine fiscal number I could only have it asking through the internet but it's actually impossible if you don't ask for it prior and through the process of booking. I think they try to skip their tax law obligations in the countries they operate.

### easyJet customer review
LIS-FNC. Delayed by 30 minutes due to what seems a terrible lack of organization at easyjet's hub in Lisbon's airport terminal 2. There were 3 flights of easyjet leaving all at the same time. This terminal consists in a suffocating atmosphere with considerably bad infrastructure and used only for departures of low cost airlines. I was assigned a seat at the last row of the plane and not only there wasn't no window - in what it seems a business measure to book the more possible passengers at the expense of the seat pitch - but the plane itself was a really old A319 very degraded but the worst was the total lack of cleaning on the plane the seats textiles had a vivid brown in an absolutely act of negligence. The Portuguese male flight attendants chat a lot between both of them loud and clear as if the passengers were interested in knowing about their lives. Easyjet tends to be an excellent alternative choice but this time failed low of expectations. And please stop selling cameras among others throughout the flight. It seems like a bazaar not a plane.

### easyJet customer review
Low cost seems to equal non existent customer service from Easyjet. Long queues at 'bag drop' worse than other airlines 'checkins' plus long queues at security = missed flight even arriving 2 hours before 'checked-in' flight. £65 per person to rebook on a later flight not what you want on a 3 day trip to Amsterdam. Easyjet don't want to know - never flying with them again.

### easyJet customer review
Recently flew LGW to MXP and return over the half term break. Inflight the service was fine. Delayed significantly by weather on the way out but that can happen. What was shocking however was check in at LGW. Yes I know it was half term but it took 90 minutes to do a bag drop simply because their process with very few check in staff saw constant delays as those turning up late for other flights were whisked to the front of the queue. So if you want to avoid a queue arrive late if you like queuing arrive 2-3 hours early. Just ridiculous!

Gatwick to Hurghada Egypt. Very good experience with easyJet. Flight on time pleasant crew and surprisingly they use different planes on this medium/long haul route so seating comfortable and spacious. Plus at £65 incl taxes you can't get much better value (competitors were charging £200+).

Overall good flight to and from Marrakech. Not sure what the point of the baggage drop is when you have to join an endless queue with people arguing about seats and luggage. The check in at Marrakech airport was farcical. We joined a queue with 4 families ahead of us. There was already a woman at the counter who kept arguing with the counter staff for over half an hour. The checking clerk kept disappearing and nothing appeared to be resolved. Then a single-man checked in quickly. He was followed by a large family group who appeared to be completely unable to fill in there own exit cards. The check clerk proceeded to fill in each form for them taking over half an hour! The family then proceeded to tag each piece of luggage with security strips. Our conclusion is you need to arrive 3 hours before the flight in order check in. We were most disappointed.

We travelled from Marrakech to Gatwick on Sunday 4th January. Our flight was delayed through no fault of the airline and the staff were efficient and friendly. The problems began when we arrived at Gatwick. Easyjet employ Menzies to handle their baggage transportation. We waited 90 minutes for our luggage to arrive. The staff had no information and simply said it was because our flight was delayed but other flights that arrived after ours got their luggage before us. The Duty. Manager refused to take calls from his own staff. Appalling service. Whilst Easyjet continue to employ such a useless and inefficient company to handle their baggage needs we will not be flying Easyjet again.

Travelled Arrecife to Liverpool 8th January having had a great flight outbound some days earlier ex Manchester with Monarch. The contrast could not be more stark. Boarding passes indicated a boarding time of 18.05 for a 18.35 departure. Approximately an hour before the due time boarding was announced which came as a surprise. An entire planeload of passengers were then processed through the boarding gate only to be left standing in an unlit hot covered walkway for just short of 30 minutes. Whilst my husband and I are able bodied there were any number of elderly passengers and very young children amongst our number who quickly became tired. This was an unpleasant experience but we were staggered to learn from regular passengers on this flight that this is standard prior to departure. From the moment the cabin doors closed pretty much until the wheels touched the tarmac in Liverpool 4 hours 15 minutes later those of us in the rear rows of seats were subjected to an absolute barrage of noise from the staff in the rear galley. During a long evening flight it clearly never occurred to them at any point that their passengers may wish to have some peace in which to rest read or sleep. Even the "trolley service" was conducted in between their gripping chats on many occasions causing them to have to ask passengers to repeat their orders as they clearly hadn't listened to them in the first place. We were both glad to finally exit the aircraft and both agreed on walking across the tarmac in highs wind and rain that we would not have had much confidence in this cabin crew to competently handle anything outside gossip and moaning. Will we fly Easyjet again? Trust me never.

After having to dangerously carry my 15 month old daughter her pushchair and 2 bags of hand luggage down two flights of stairs to get outside to the aircraft. I have to say you get exactly what you pay for "a flight". Totally disgusted none of the staff (at Newcastle Easy jet) offered to help. Although I must add after struggling at Gatwick a lovely member of staff took my pushchair off me in the departure lounge as she seen I was alone with a young child hand luggage and a pushchair. Flight itself was fine. But Easyjet you really need to brush up on the service your staff provide!

Flew from Luton to Lisbon for New Year. Both flights on time with efficient and friendly cabin crew. Only downside is the facilities at Luton.

EZY137 from Manchester to Belfast. This was my first time flying EasyJet since 2004 and I must say I was highly impressed. Can't fault them on anything. I dropped off my bag without any issues. I had a mobile boarding pass but the check in assistant printed me one nevertheless. It's nice that some go the extra mile. The crew on board were extremely friendly and welcoming. The flight left in good time and arrived 15 minutes early. An excellent and efficient service. I would certainly use EasyJet again.

### easyJet customer review
EasyJet seem to be having a few organisational problems recently. We had a few friends telling us about delays problems getting into the plane and lack of information. We've always been happy with the service travelling with our family but have been disappointed by our last trip from Barcelona to London Gatwick. Our flight was scheduled at 7.30 pm. We had not luggage so arrived at the airport at 6pm. No information on the gate was available - we then learned that the flight was delayed by one hour. No one on the ground had information to give us. Delayed by another hour. We finally get to Gatwick and we were delayed again because there were no ground staff. Don't they have people at Gatwick who are supposed to communicated with the airport staff. Not a great experience.

On Tuesday 16 December our flight from Reykjavik was cancelled. The flight was due to leave around 14.55 by 17.00 we were in a hotel meal by 20.00. We were kept informed by the hotel staff who were very helpful helping people to print boarding passes. Whilst this delay caused us some inconvenience it was very understandable delay. I have been very impressed with this service.

### easyJet customer review
Booked a one day return flight Amsterdam-Gatwick v.v. to attend a funeral on December 12. Whilst in the UK we heard of the computer problems at NATS but were relieved to hear on the way to the airport that problems were solved. Arriving there 3.5 hours before the flight was due we decided to have something to eat. Then a got a message on my iphone: we are very sorry but your flight EZ 8883 has been cancelled. Please contact Easyjet.com etc. This prompted us to go to the Easyjet desk but unfortunately there were already some 200 people before us in long rows with only 2 easyjet employees to assist. Therefore I (fortunately) decided to change my booking online and managed to get a return flight the following day in the evening. Then after 1.5 hours an easyjet employee climbed on a stand and shouted that everybody should see to changing their booking themselves and that accommodation to spend the night had been arranged at the Hilton Hotel. Upon arrival there Hilton knew nothing and was full to the brim. So back to the Easyjet desk only to find out that there were no more rooms but also no more Easyjet employees! Fortunately we managed to find some spare bedrooms in the Block hotel at Gatwick. Even getting a boarding pass proved to be a problem: as I had changed my booking using my iphone I was of course unable to print my boarding pass. So we went to Easyjet in the south terminal and asked them to print the boarding pass. That was not possible we had to go to the North terminal as we would leave from there. After some talking the man behind the desk told us check in was not open yet but after we told him we had already checked in electronically he managed to come up with two traditional boarding passes.

### easyJet customer review
My gripe is over a flight from Verona to LGW - problems were caused by Italian strikes and on checking in at the airport we were informed that an 11.45 flight had been delayed to 19.15 - not only informed by the check-in lady she also wrote it on our boarding pass and it was showing on the airport screens. She also told us to return to the airport at 1800 hours. We said to the very nice lady (who disappeared about five times as they were obviously being briefed on what to do) that we were going back into town for the day which we did. Due to the delay and a 3 hour drive on return we were looking at booking a hotel for the night at Gatwick but just to check whether we were being told the truth about the 19.15 departure time I decided to check when the rescheduled outward flight was going to leave LGW on the easyjet flight scanner - because it was actually in the air and on further inspection our flight had been rescheduled back to 1250pm - showing on both easyjet and airport websites. Jump into taxi and return to airport. Easyjet (and their agents) must have known at the time we were dropping our bags that the outward flight was actually happening as the plane must have been loaded and on the taxiway at LGW. Also easyjet made no attempt to communicate with us by email or mobile phone. Talking to others on the flight they had been asked at check-in to leave contact details and had been phoned (one family from about 40 miles away had got back home and had to turn around again almost immediately). We were incredibly lucky not to miss the flight.

London Gatwick to Arrecife. Long queue at North Terminal on arrival Friday lunchtime but moved very quickly. The return was on the delayed EZY8682 on 29 November due to bad weather locally. The captain made announcements updating us while the cabin crew distributed water and did their best to look after the passengers. Having announced that we might be going to Portugal initially we did fly straight to London once we were able to leave.

### easyJet customer review
Geneva to Gatwick with Easyjet in September - yet more delays. Our flight was delayed by seven hours or more and though we took an option to travel to Luton we were still over five hours late. No refund for delay costs they said as we chose a different routing we were no longer entitled. Yet I asked at the desk at the time if it would affect any claim they said no. Customer service when you need it is non existent. All those hours in Geneva were rewarded with a voucher for supper 15 swiss francs. You will probably guess what that buys you in Geneva airport.

INV-LGW. Very friendly staff both at Inverness and on-board the aircraft. As soon as we got into the airport we were greeted by smiles from the easyJet staff. Once on-board the crew acted very professionally considering it is easyJet snacks were on offer which was a plus. Would definitely recommend!

### easyJet customer review
I recently booked a trip from London to Jersey for 4 people on easyjet which was a complete mess. One of the passengers arrived separately from the rest of us. He processed to easyjet check-in desk to get a boarding pass and was given the wrong boarding pass by the staff member. He never checked the boarding pass and managed to clear security at the airport with it. When the remanding 3 passengers tried to clear security with our boarding pass this was then it was discovered that the boarding passes were mixed up. This took sometime to be resolved but eventually did. As it was nearly time for our flight to leave we hurried to the gate only to find that is was already closed. At no point during this period did easyjet page us to advise that the gate was closing or that it was the last call for us (the passengers). We had to go back to easyjets desk in the departure area and waited over 45 minutes before someone came to the desk to see us. We had the use the phone on the desk to call an easyjet staff member 7 times before someone arrived. When someone did arrive the matter was not handled with any urgency. We were taken back to customer service desk and were told that it is our responsibility to get to the get to the gate on time. In order to change the ticket we would need to pay. We advised them of the error made my easyjet staff of giving the wrong boarding pass to the wrong passenger. We also asked why we were not paged and was told that easyjet doesn't page customers. They will only do so if you have checked in a bag. We did not check in any bags as we were only going to jersey for a day. I told the agent it was discrimination as easyjet assumes that all passengers are literate. Also it is common practice for airlines to page passengers if they have checked in and not arrived at the gate. We were offered the next easyjet flight which was in the afternoon at nearly 4pm which meant our day trip would not happen. Tried phoning customer service and we were meet with the same no help attitude. In the end we when to jersy and was only able to spend 2 hours. A very unsatisfactory trip. Since then trying to get customer service to take some action has been terrible.

Never flown with easyJet before and feared the worst. But despite a bit of a jam when boarding I was impressed. Aircraft was clean and fairly new. In flight service was quick and friendly and the Captain kept us well informed regarding the progress of the flight both ways and expected ETA. On the whole for a budget airline (or any airline for that matter) a good experience.

Travelled 3rd November EZY1897 MAN-SXF returned 6th November EZY1898 SXF-MAN. Whole package booked through Easyjet online really easy to navigate check in at Manchester a breeze and through to departures within 10-15 minutes. Onboard very new A320 with new seats plenty of space and immaculate. Crew friendly and provided efficient service return flight just as good again excellent crew very friendly and landed 10 minutes early - will recommend Easyjet to friends and family and will book and fly again with Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
VRN-LGW. No frills airline where I even need to pay for water. Verona airport has nothing to do but I can't blame the airline the boarding process involved having to push our way through people who did not purchase priority boarding and standing in buses that had their doors open in the summer heat. Aside from that nothing else to report. I would have flown BA if I could to LGW since the value I think is better.

### easyJet customer review
Friday night flight from Glasgow to London Gatwick. We arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern Scotland. Flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to Tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. At check-in we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyJet would try to push the flight forward. The opposite happened. Our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. Eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. Staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. There were no easyJet representatives to speak to only gate staff. When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.

### easyJet customer review
Gatwick to Bari and back. Ground staff at Gatwick seem to take a delight in the one bag rule. Both crews very pleasant as usual. Boarding at Bari a shambles. Ushered through to the bridge but then waited 15 minutes on staircase as they won't pay to use the full bridge service. Arrived a bit late at Gatwick but to South Terminal. Fine for me as I was alone and catching the train but a real pain for anyone expecting to be met at the North Terminal. And not a word from the cabin crew and no ground crew to offer any apology or explanation. Not good enough. And when comparing prices worth noting that the drinks and snacks I had free on BA the week before would have cost £13 on Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
Have travelled several times with easyJet and continue to be very satisfied with the service provided. Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.

LGW-PFO return. Aircraft clean and tidy with helpful cabin crew auxiliary engine was u/s so aircraft cabin very warm. Captain came into main cabin and explained we would need tender assistance to power up engines. He was not only very informative but highly entertaining taking any pressure off the cabin crew due to circumstances. Although late in departure we arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Return flight also excellent with a good crew but information in main lounge was poor regarding gate and boarding. Without doubt the 'new' arrangements regarding allocated seating has made the experience that more civilised when boarding. My only issue is the poor choice of food on board and the exorbitant prices for tea and coffee. That aside easyjet really are ahead of other short haul airlines.

### easyJet customer review
As an easyJet virgin was somewhat apprehensive. Needn't have worried! Apart from a less than smiling reception at the outward bag drop found the whole experience pleasant with very professional cabin crews (infinitely better than the Virgin Atlantic crew experienced on a long haul to Delhi). Inflight prices somewhat expensive but could have been much worse considering we were captive customers. Only one real concern and that was the lack of padding in the seats and consequent bum numbing - glad it was short haul! However overall would certainly travel easyJet again.

### easyJet customer review
We flew from London Gatwick airport to Antalya Turkey in September 2014. What a mess! When we arrived at the bag drop there were two long queues moving rather slowly. EasyJet staff was running madly around the queues calling out for the passengers of the flights that are about to depart. These passengers (us among them) were then moved from inside the general queues to the fast track queue. The bag drop person informed us that the flight was delayed by 1 hour (this information never appeared on the airport display). We figured we had enough time to have a quick lunch. While waiting for our food I went to the information booth to double-check where the lady told me that our flight is not really being delayed all that much maybe by 1/2 hour or less - still no update on any of the airport displays. We quickly bagged our lunch and rushed to the gate. There was still no plane at the gate. Eventually it arrived late (the airport display still had the original departure time no update) and the boarding began. What a mess! After the initial boarding call for privileged EasyJet loyalty program members general boarding call was announced without any regard to the row numbers (i.e. everyone entered in random order) - but the airplane door was closed for some reason so after standing for a while in the line many people went back to the waiting area. Finally the door was open and everyone went inside the plane. Because the boarding order was not related in any way to the location of the people inside the aircraft (normally the rear rows board first to avoid congestion) chaos inside the aircraft followed and the boarding itself took a long time. The flight itself was uneventful no problems upon arrival luggage was offloaded quickly. If this airline can introduce some order into its operational activities I will be happy to use its services again. Also our flight may have been an exception - I do realize that one should not generalize based on a single flight experience.

Flew LGW to Agadir and returned Marrakech to LGW. Had not used them for a few year. Seat allocation makes the difference. Booking process good and booked exit aisle seats which gave you speedy boarding. Good crews good check-in and an excellent service at a good price. Other budget airlines and full price airlines should take note. Compared with US airlines like United so so much better.

### easyJet customer review
For Schiphol airport (Amsterdam) only. Schiphol is a great airport and it use to be great for EasyJet as well. However EasyJet has recently blocked its gates off from the main departures terminal so you have no access whatsoever to any restaurants shops or lounges. This is a real killer as their concourses have little to nothing to offer including seating. Basically is was enough to convince me to stop flying EasyJet from Amsterdam. I would recommend that everyone else gives this EasyJet departure point a miss as well.

SEN-ALC and return. Easyjet gets the job done with minimum fuss. Out on time friendly professional crew.

LGW-DME-LGW. Nice to be sampling part of the LCCs' entry into Russia for a bargain price. Outbound very smooth and on time gate agent checked I had the right visa papers before boarding. Crew pleasant and informed on routing which I enjoy. Return slightly less easy 45 minute delay incurred by problematic engine starting system. Again crew ensured there were no worries and that we were comfortable. Pleased to see ground staff in Russia spoke English. I must admit I'm not a fan of this allocated seating policy - I'd rather queue up and bag myself a window seat for no extra cost - but it's a very minor inconvenience.

### easyJet customer review
It was my first time using this airline and I will never use them again. I bought the ticket from Rome to Nice on February 2014 for the flight on 11 September 2014. In March I received notice from them that their daily flight from Rome to Nice would change from 11.55 AM to 7.15pm. I had to change my own schedule because I know what kind of headache I would get trying to get a refund from them. On the day of the flight I found out that there's no use of printing your own boarding pass beforehand because there's still a long line at the check in desks. There's no separate lines for bag-drop. After dropping my baggage I was told that the flight will be delayed for 40-minutes. Then during boarding the crew told me that I couldn't bring my hand bag because I already had a back pack with me. I had to drop one or pay 55EUR. I offered 70EUR cash but was told they only accepted credit card. I will never use this airline again.

Travelling from Palma to Belfast International. Our flight was delayed by 2hrs 50mins. We were given vouchers to the value of 4.50 euros each. At check-in the girl told us we could spend them at the airport or onboard we decided to keep them for onboard. We ordered 2 coffees but the stewardess said she couldn't accept the vouchers and that they haven't been accepting them for the last 2 years. It states on the vouchers they could be spent onboard. It's obvious the ground staff have no idea.

### easyJet customer review
Flew Southend to Faro 19 September 2014. It seems that Easyjet have now employed the Gestapo that Ryanair used to employ to monitor cabin luggage. The Southend boarding staff are rude. My wife and I both had small cabin luggage and straw hats in separate plastic bags. Yes I know Easyjet have a one bag policy which we knew about before we flew but please tell me why Easyjet requires customers to take the hat out of a see-through bag and put it on rather than employ common sense. I suppose we must wait for Easyjet to adopt the same cabin baggage policy that Ryanair has been forced to adopt (ie. you are allowed a personal item). Previously we have ranked Easyjet higher than Ryanair. After two recent flights with Ryanair over the last couple of months I think we will now stick with Ryanair and avoid Easyjet. Thankfully Easyjet staff at Faro do not apply Easyjet's ridiculous rules.

Flight from London Gatwick to Venice. Flight on time both on takeoff and landing. The crew were good cheerful and friendly. On a short flight they managed to serve food and also interact with passengers. The one thing to prevent giving a score of 10 for satisfaction was the cleanliness of the cabin. Whilst clean the seats and floor covering were in need of replacement. They were well worn and looking tired. I hope Easyjet will refurbish these old planes because the rest of their service is excellent.

### easyJet customer review
A first and last time flight experience. Flight from Gatwick to Prague in late August. We followed the rules about bag dimensions and weights and checked in 1 bag each and proceeded to the holding area. Finally a call that our flight was boarding and an extended stampede of passengers to Gate 25 only to find we were further held before boarding. Here we were met with a very unfriendly ground staff member telling us that we were only allowed 1 bag not 2 as we were carrying (1 x wheelie + 1 x accessories). Having checked with the EZ web site just 10 days earlier which clearly indicates that a conforming carry on bag and an additional accessories bag was acceptable my wife and I found ourselves along with plenty of other passengers in a difficult space trying to squeeze our accessories bags into a single carry on. Having got into the plane that was about 2/3 full the PA system was telling us that small bags should be stowed under the seats in front of us. Clearly the people at EZ have no idea about presenting a uniform message. In my case 3 different messages. Does the left hand really know what the right hand is doing? A further delay occurred when the ground staff wouldn't issue a receipt for GBP 45 for an unfortunate passenger who couldn't squeeze 2 into 1 and it had to go in the hold. Rightly she refused to board the plane until a receipt was provided which saw us with a departure delay of around 30 minutes. The aircrew seemed more interested in themselves than providing a customer focused service.

Bristol - Malaga return 18 - 22 September both flights left on time and landed early. Crew friendly and pilot very informative on both flights. Check in at bristol was super quick along with boarding but slower at Malaga due to sheer number of people and boarding via air bridge. Very well recommended airline!

For the first time in my life I flew with easyjet last week From Lisbon to Funchal - Madeira (round-trip) and the experience was almost excellent. Boarding went normal on a cloudy/rainy day in Lisbon. Both cockpit/cabin crew were professional and friendly specially on the return flight from Madeira - Lisbon (September 18th flight) EZY7608). Both flights were smooth despite the poor weather conditions. The only exception was the 40 minutes delay in Funchal but it was due to air traffic control restrictions it wasn't easyjet fault. Overall it was a great experience and I will recommend easyjet.

Gatwick to Bari. Ground staff surly as ever claimed to have announced boarding for those with small children but in fact did not. Cabin crew as nice as ever. Noticed we were circling Bari then captain announced weather was too bad to land. After further circling diverted to Brindisi as fuel low. Refuelled then back to Bari an hour and a half late. But at all times the Captain was great informing of the problem and steps to resolve it. Very professional and one can't ask for more.

I recently flew easyJet from Stansted to Edinburgh. I had only hand luggage plus a handbag. There was no problem. Coming back however I was told that I wasn't allowed to have my hand bag with me and it had to be packed in my hand luggage not easy because the things I'd bought whilst in Scotland. Made my case fuller than it had previously been but rules I suppose are rules despite that the seem to be different at each airport. Imagine my surprise then when the tannoy informed me that apart from my hand luggage I was permitted one bag of shopping! I wonder what would have happened had I put my handbag into the carrier bag. I'm not trying to flout rules but I find it very confusing when goalposts are changed.

BRU-LGW-BRU for £98 return including one piece of luggage. Beats Eurostar hands down in terms of price when you book last minute. Full outbound flight much lighter load on the return flight into BRU. Both flights delayed. Luggage on the belt when getting to the arrivals hall in LGW only a 2 mins wait in Brussels. At LGW the gate was only announced at 16.50 with the notice that the gate would close at 16.56 which made for a hasty trek across the famous bridge to the gate where speedy boarding had just been completed. Despite the delays all in all quite satisfactory flights.

### easyJet customer review
I travelled Prague to Rome. I checked one backpack into the hold. I was carrying a small backpack which weighed about six kilos. I had a small bumbag around my waist which contained my valuables. I was told by this arrogant rude tall staff member to place my small bumbag into my backpack as he deemed it to be an extra bag. I have been travelling for 40 years and never come across this pedantic ridiculous rule. There were passengers there with three times the amount of my land luggage and many of them had their valuables in bags around their necks as well as their hand luggage. We also had to pay extra money from Split to Rome for hold luggage because it didn't come up on the Easyjet software app and it cost us more money at the airport. I won't be flying Easyjet anymore.

### easyJet customer review
On-time departure as seems to be keenly adhered on any flights I've taken with easyjet. Informative flight deck and friendly cabin crew who for not one moment do I think want be be greeting every single passenger onboard but they do it and it's invaluable in my opinion leading to positive customer perception. Naturally being an airline of it's type anything you want onboard bar the toilet is chargable. Not a problem as what's on offer is priced reasonably the selection being good and if it's hot food you're purchasing it comes to you hot not lukewarm. Cabin crew seem to be far more visible during the flight than on some airlines which is undoubtedly a positive. Whilst no one expects them trolling the aisles for the who flight it is great to see them other than during cabin preparation and service times. Definitely an airline I'd have no hesitation in recommending. Comfortable on time flight priced competitively clean and comfortable cabin. Wishful thinking would have me hope some of the national airlines would embrace some of easyjets best practices but that will never happen so easyjet where practicable and price dependant would always be my first choice.

NAP-VCE. My last flight on easyJet was around March time frame. The luggage policy is a bit outrageous especially the carry-on policy. The flight was smooth and flight attendants were nice. Staff in Naples were very nice especially when i got mad about the carry-on policy. The staff in Venice were very nice they helped me get on my flight quicker since I was about to miss it. They were nice enough to hold my spot in line while I went to go pay for my luggage. Overall it was a good flight and airlines.

Prague to Rome Fiumicino (Terminal 2) 18 August 2014. Ground staff were extremely rude about their overhead baggage policy. Cabin crew was more bothered about gossiping rather than serving the passengers.

FCO-PRG. Flight went well and in fact arrived early. Seat cramped but I got what I paid for. PRG-FCO. Flight was full during boarding there was this rude ground staff. She forced everyone to cut down their baggage to one piece per person. I told her that during our flight to Rome they allowed us to bring 2 pieces per passenger. She said things like I "dont care what you did in Rome this is Prague follow our rules". This is unacceptable easyjet needs to train their employees.

### easyJet customer review
Recently took 4 Easyjet flights: GVA-LGW-DME-LGW-GVA. Maybe I was lucky but everything worked out very well. Of all the flights only the first segment GVA-LGW was late about 40 minutes but I'd planned an overnight stay before the 07:00 flight the next morning. I booked exit-row seats for the two long flights to and from DME and on my return leg had the whole exit row to myself so I lay down and even managed to sleep. I found the FAs friendly and helpful the on-board food is fine with me though some healthy options would be nice.

### easyJet customer review
I flew on the 12th from Luton to Palma and return on the 19th. I admit I was slightly worried after reading some of the reviews on here but I was pleasantly surprised. Checked in online however this doesn't save time as you still have to join a long line of people waiting to drop their bags off. This wasn't much of an issue as it was only about 10 minutes but I didn't see the point of checking in ourselves. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the seats were comfortable enough for just over 2 hours. We were late taking off by 5 minutes which doesn't matter as we made up the time. The food on board was nice and not too expensive for airline food. Cabin crew were lovely and professional and captain was very informative. I thought this flight was better than the Thomson flight I took 6 months ago which was double the price!

### easyJet customer review
EZY5336 17th July 2014. On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.

### easyJet customer review
GVA-VCE GVA-LUT LUT-GVA GVA-ORY ORY-GVA. A terrible airline usually late has own rules which it does not follow poor security poorly trained staff at gate and on plane. The only reason to fly Easyjet used to be the price but with the delays and increased baggage costs you need to add about 50% to fare to compare.

Within the last 2 months I have travelled with Easyjet 6 times all Glasgow to Bristol return. Flights were always on time onboard staff friendly and not over pushy with onboard sales. Overall a very pleasant experience.

### easyJet customer review
Flight with family Rome to Basel. At boarding no information of which gate to take. Waited for 2 hours until we were brought to aircraft. In front of aircraft bus turned around and brought us back to gate. No information why. After 4 hours we were told we might get a flight at 10 pm (instead of 1 pm) to Geneva then Bus to Basel - at 3 am in the morning when the airport was closed! They promised us a refund which was later denied and only given a flight two days later. Service the worst I have ever experienced. Unacceptable. Will never use again.

### easyJet customer review
LGW to Nantes. They say you get what you pay for but this was more expensive than the scheduled flight from London City. I fly multiple times/year normally long haul and I have never seen such rude uncaring staff as the ground staff at LGW. As commented upon by another reviewer silly me for checking in a bag as this then meant that I was told to stow my laptop under my seat as the overhead bins were for those with trolley bags. Check-in was a scrum added to by having to climb over those whose bags were overweight by a couple of paperbacks and were forced to re- pack their suitcases. Never again.

### easyJet customer review
Edinburgh - Bristol 8 Aug 14 arrived at Edinburgh airport early so asked if I could transfer to an earlier flight was transferred immediately and given an extra legroom seat free of charge without asking by the very helpful lady on the information desk and also speedy boarding. Use easyjet frequently and they never disappoint.

### easyJet customer review
Flight from Gatwick to Rhodes 30/07/14. Baggage drop was sorted within 5 minutes while we watched massive queues at all other airlines desks getting impatient. Found this quite amusing! Were then put to the front of the passport queue by an Easyjet staff member to save us some time too! Straight onto plane and we left early as everyone was on board early - great! Service was friendly on board but basic. Smooth flight with no gimmicks. Quick at other end too. Coming back was even better - 5 minutes from getting off the coach to being sat in departure lounge while everyone else joined their huge queues again! Does what it says on the tin really!

### easyJet customer review
Flew LGW - Bordeaux on 26th July 2014. Gatwick check-in a complete nightmare - massive queue despite arriving 2.5 hours before the flight. Speedy boarding equally chaotic as some non-'speedy boarders' had already started queuing at the gate and stayed where they were. The two queues then became mixed up with the 'families' who were also trying to board first so 'Speedy Boarding' really not worth the trouble and checking in on-line academic as everyone had to queue anyway.

### easyJet customer review
Flew from LGW-BFS. First of all our cabin baggage was just 2 centimetres too long and because of that wanted to charge us 45 pounds to put the bag in the hold. Very rude about it. Gate agent who thought she had a little bit of power. So they have us a rubbish bag out of the bin to put our stuff in. By the way this bag has flown in the easyJet cabin before without a problem. When we boarded the plane we told a cabin crew member and rudely said to us "You must have got away with it before but you didn't this time. We even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers! We told a crew member and he said "Well I'm not checking the bag sizes. No customer courtesy! Next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didn't choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. My grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. We asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. Not one bit of sympathy! The man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window! No courtesy from the staff! No help! Outrageously not allowing our bag on because of the wheel being 2 centimetres too long when bigger bags we saw were allowed on!

### easyJet customer review
BFS-EDI EDI-BFS July. Outbound flight slightly delayed due to a technical issue but no fault of the airline outbound flight was great! Attentive cabin crew A320 spacious and modern adequate legroom for this short flight ended up arriving early in EDI despite this short delay. Return flight on A319 was very much the same story! Will definitely use EZY again!

### easyJet customer review
Flew MXP-HAM on July 4th and back three days later. Onward flight delayed half an hour but no big issue as I was travelling for leisure and Hamburg was my final destination. Plane reasonably clean and comfortable crew friendly even if not as professional as you would expect them to be (often making jokes and laugh among themselves). Seat assignment worked fine so the boarding was smooth even though a bit slow both ways as they start to queue people at the gate well in advance. The best things were price and schedule which is what makes you choose a low cost carrier at the end. I often fly Ryanair as they are based in Bergamo where I live and work and it had been a long time (8 years) since I last flew with Easyjet: this experience was ok and I will still consider them as an option for future trips.

Venice-CDG. Very worn out Airbus. Outside (paint) and inside! Priority check-in and boarding were a bit messy. Captain was great.

### easyJet customer review
LGW to INV. 1) 'Bag drop' and online check in a complete joke when you still have to join a mammoth snake like queue and basically 'check in' anyway! What's the point? 2) Those passengers who do pay extra to check in their hold baggage are only discriminated once on board. The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew. Pity the magazines were stained torn pages missing and out of date. Basic service. If you can't be bothered replacing them please don't have them in the seat pocket. I gave up looking for the 'menu' because the magazines were filthy. 4) Sorry bring back full service airlines. Altough Easyjet do a good job of letting you know your flying low cost are their prices really that low?

### easyJet customer review
BRU-SXF. Flight on time boarding was quick on the new looking A320 cabin seat pitch seemed better than Wizzair or Ryanair. The crew were very friendly and flight deck informative. The food/snack selection on board was not very expensive. EasyJet definitely delivers a good low cost product.

### easyJet customer review
Flew BRU - LYS 16/07/14. Boarding on time the plane an Airbus A319 good and clean. Seats are comfortable but the pitch is a bit small. Portuguese cabin crew very kind and professional. Snacks on board are a bit expensive but it's not necessary for a 1 hour flight. Arrival on time. Value for money: very good.

### easyJet customer review
7.45 flight from Gatwick to Gibraltar diverted to Malaga due to fog my son travelling alone (aged 16). Member of crew says on tannoy "bus service will take you to Gibraltar" that's it. Remember it is 135km away. My son quickly goes to toilet gets through passport control and gets his suitcase (one of last off carousel) goes to find bus and nothing - no Easyjet rep no directions nothing. He reckons max 10 mins from when he got his suitcase to when he was out in foyer/concourse etc. Eventually he finds the Easyjet Malaga desk on a different floor basically zero interest tough. Numerous calls to Easyjet UK - absolutely hopeless said they had no obligation to get you to your end destination if you missed a bus they provided they admit they never do a head count on the bus. We have a 16 year old 135kms from his destination and Easyjet on site answer is "tough go and use public transport".

Glasgow to Berlin Schonefeld (17th July) and back again (27th July).

Fares have gone up in price a fair bit though!

6/6/2014. I can not believe the bad reviews from others from Australia my wife and were a bit hesitant to use easyjet but had no choice from Montpellier to London and they were as good as any airline.

### easyJet customer review
This was a flight from Gatwick to Edinburgh on July 9 2014. My first complaint concerns the lateness of take off (an hour). Then we were assigned the last seat on the starboard side of the aircraft despite my wife requiring wheelchair assistance. The return journey on July 18th left right on time but on landing was assigned a parking space in the international section of the airport. This entailed a walk to a bus to enable passengers to get to baggage claim. Of course with my wife requiring wheelchair assistance we were kept on the plane till an "ambulance" vehicle arrived to take us to baggage claim. This took up to close to an hour while a friend waited in flight arrivals to take us home. Overall not good enough.

### easyJet customer review
Paris-Berlin-Paris in February 2014 and Paris-Pisa-Paris in March 2014. While boarding in Paris Orly is more or less fine the airports of Berlin and Pisa are awful the staff are impolite and indifferent and the boarding process is extremely badly organised. Actually in Berlin and Pisa they announce "boarding" while the plane is not actually there put all the passengers in the small room with no fresh air and place to seat. Above mentioned airports are very small and look like hangars. Easyjet writes that the boarding ends 30 minutes before flight while actually it opens 30 minutes before or sometimes even later!. The positive thing is that their flights are more or less on time and the tickets are relatively cheap (but not always).

### easyJet customer review
CDG-Biarritz. On 11 A & B seats (speedy boarding + better pitch). No disappointment. However we paid for better seats. After doors closing a passenger came from a normal seat and sat in 11C. Some airlines would prevent it. However the situation was worse as that passenger was extremely rude/threatening and tall/large invading my space all the time. Crew did not act and we did not know what to do. It could have been avoided by them.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-VEN 17 July. If you wish to be treated like cattle and snapped at by the ground staff then choose EasyJet. Cabin Crew are OK but ground staff terrible. You can carry a sizeable trolley bag but if you have a laptop and briefcase they are not allowed even though the combined size and weight is half that of a trolley bag. Do not expect logic or intelligence to play a part.

### easyJet customer review
We were caught up in the recent Air Traffic Control strike and while sat with our bags waiting for our transfer to the airport back to Bristol our flight was cancelled. Our only complaint was the text advised of the flight cancellation and what to do re compensation but did not tell us what to do at that very moment. We decided to make our way to the airport anyway and once there joined a queue of other confused passengers. Anyway to cut a long story short we were put in a 4* Marriott Hotel full board for an additional 3 nights at no cost to ourselves. We had agreed to take the Gatwick flight back on the Saturday as this was the only flight available but on reaching the airport early we asked if there might be any chance that there were places on the Bristol flight. We were told to return in an hour and on returning found the lady on the desk had saved 2 seats for us and we were home by midday.

Manchester-Tenerife. Late June. All I can say what a fantastic flight. Bang on time both ways even with the air traffic strike in France. We even landed 30 mins early into Manchester. Perfect. Now let's get to the reason I'm writing this review and that's the crew. Smart smiling and when an elderly lady was taken ill on push back she was dealt with the utmost professionalism that made her elderly companion at ease. I most certainly will fly with easyjet again.

### easyJet customer review
Third time flying and delay is 2 hours plus each time. Sitting in Geneva airport and all 3 flights from here (London - 2 flights Venice other) have delays this afternoon 7 July 2014. An easyjet employee had just lied to us he was not aware of any delays to our flights minutes away from an announcement of a multiple hours delay (so that we enter duty free zone where there is obviously no service desk of easyjet). All delays are due to faulty aircraft and not weather conditions. Vote zero out of 10 for easyjets' faulty aircraft no service desk / absence of client service and unqualified staff. My experience with Ryanair recently has been significantly better - no delays and landing on time.

### easyJet customer review
I have been flying with easyjet for years on a regular basis and have recently been disappointed with how rapidly their customer service has declined. The last 3 times I have attempted to fly with easyjet have been disastrous and unnecessarily stressful with little compassion or understanding from staff who can only read legal requirements. The first was when I had a flexifare and attempted to change to earlier flight as per the terms and conditions of this flight but due to an error of assigning the right reference number they charged me a whole new fare. A month later I was going home for the weekend to see my family (I live in London my family in Belfast) and arrived at the airport on Friday to be told the flight was overbooked and they could offer me a flight on Sunday afternoon which of course was useless. This flight was reimbursed with the standard compensation which only just covered the return flight I lost as this was with a different airline. Finally last weekend when I didn't think easyjet could ruin another trip for me I arrived at the airport intending to get my 8pm flight to Edinburgh but the plane had been 'substituted' for another flight so we would only get our flight at around 1am! I asked customer service if they could arrange a hotel or taxi as I would be arriving to a city at 2.30am and I had been planning to make an onward journey but they refused saying my options were 1) to accept the delayed flight and get a refreshment voucher 2) take the 9.30 flight to Glasgow. I decided to go to Glasgow and would have made the last train to my onward destination but low and behold that flight was also delayed. So instead of arriving at 9.30pm to Edinburgh I arrived to Glasgow at 11.20pm. I asked for a refreshment voucher but was told I had a choice between accepting the late flight with a voucher or the Glasgow flight - what options! Easyjet will push away their loyal customers for becoming too greedy.

### easyJet customer review
MAN-PFO-MAN. We use easyjet several times a year to European city beaks and to Cyprus. Never had any issues with them. Outbound flight was 30 minutes late due to the late arrival of the aircraft but the pilot made this up. It was the week of French ATC strike. Return flight 30 minutes early arriving. Slightly more comfortable on our return at it was on an A320.

### easyJet customer review
Rome-London. Next time I will spend the extra money and save all the headache and hassle! 1.5+ hour wait at Rome airport just to drop the baggage. There were around 500 people in line and only 2 agents working. When the staff was questioned about additional agents they said they did not expect these numbers! Like they didn't know how many tickets they had booked for the day? Those passengers who had close departing flights were given priority so those of us who had arrived at the airport in appropriate time were made to wait even longer. After this fiasco we were informed our flight was 2+ hours delayed but we had to wait at the gate the entire time in case they decided to take off earlier. Completely unorganized and uninformed every time I use this discount airline I pay with patience. Flying out of London last year was the same story - ridiculous wait times just to drop the baggage. I suggest they charge a little more for flights and hire more agents!

### easyJet customer review
Used Easyjet for the first time on return flights from Edinburgh to Krakow and was very impressed especially when compared to Thomas Cook Thomson etc. Check in was slick and easy and flights were on time (both landed early). The A319 and A320 planes were modern clean and comfortable (much more leg room than the above mentioned). Will definitely be my first choice in future.

### easyJet customer review
For the second time this year we flew with Easy Jet from Southend airport. We went to Poland in March and have just come back from Portugal last week (27th June). On both occasions we wanted to have food on the plane on the return journey back to Southend. On both occasions after the first couple of rows had been served there were no more sandwiches bacon rolls or anything substantial to buy. Four of us coming home from Portugal last week missed breakfast as we left the hotel too early but then our transport to the airport was 40 mins late anyway this meant we only had time to check in and go straight to the boarding area for the plane which meant we were all ravenous by the time we boarded! A muffin each on the plane was the best EasyJet could offer. Why advertise all the meal options in the on-board magazine and then not have any to sell?

I have travelled on numerous occasions with Easyjet and have never had any problems. On one occasion my flight back from Goa to London arrived early and when I asked about a change of flight from Gatwick to Edinburgh the female on reception checked and I had it done within minutes free of charge. I have never met any rude staff or unhelpful staff I have always found the staff very nice and polite. Treat them with courtesy and you will receive it back.

Travelled to Faro on 15th June flight departed 30 mins late because we had to wait for an incoming flight aircraft clean and tidy staff pleasant not a lot of information from flight deck. On 25th our return flight was cancelled because of the French air traffic controllers strike. At Faro airport the Easyjet Reps who dealt with us were fantastic and very helpful in a very difficult situation. Returned on 28th aircraft left on time staff very pleasant and helpful plenty of communication from flight deck. Would travel with them again.

Luton to Nice 13th June. Had to take my motobility scooter as I have a serious back problem. The scooter was free and I and my sisters were escorted all through from start to airline very quickly.

Thank you to everyone at Easyjet for making my trip so pleasant would definitely travel with them again.

### easyJet customer review
I recently took three trips from UK to Lisbon Madrid and return - never again. Ground staff are uniformly rude the boarding process chaotic and cabin crew do their best to ignore passengers. The one bag policy is not true - plenty of people came on board all three flights with two bags many with large shopping bags. On one flight I sat next to a pilot flying to crew a plane back to the UK. He and the cabin crew talked non stop about how hard their jobs are and how many hours they work! Very unprofessional and plain rude.

Flight 1074 Barcelona - Basel June 6 2014. The easyjet boarding procedure is very poor. Half an hour of waiting in three stages. Before boarding pass control inside the gate and within the gate. I hate it. Also Easyjet should abandon Speedy boarding. It does not make sense anymore after the introduction of assigned seating.

Easyjet were woefully useless at trying to get me to Italy after my flight was cancelled due to industrial action at 3 Italian airports. They suggested a flight 6 hours later to Zurich but by booking on-line I was able to fly on Easyjet to Verona just 2 hours later. Both inward and return flights were perfectly fine although the return was an un-announced 45 minutes late taking off.

I flew with this airline on 29th May 2014 from Nice to Belfast. Several flights were being checked in at the same desks as such the queues were lengthy. The check-in staff were neatly dressed and polite. Boarding was efficient and well managed. The cabin crew were friendly and welcoming and made a clear safety demonstration. During the flight the captain was informative and one has the chance to buy a snack. The seats were comfortable. Arrival into Belfast was efficient and the crew bid the passengers goodbye. I will use this airline again for sure!

### easyJet customer review
Some boarding confusion as the flight was showing delayed 45 minutes. However it boarded on time. Not surprisingly some passengers were missing and the flight left half an hour late. Crew seemed unaware that passengers were told of a delay. Really hate the easyjet boarding process where you "board" on time when the aircraft is not ready - so you are stuck like cattle in a corridor for up to 20 minutes. Flight OK cabin crew a bit surly not much info from the flightdeck. OK for a short flight.

### easyJet customer review
Clean modern Airbus A319 friendly crew who spoke English you could actually understand. We were late leaving but landed on time. Paid extra for the emergency exit seats which is worth the £10 on a flight longer than 2 hours. Have already booked my Xmas flights with them. Definitely recommend. (and no daft trumpet followed by a cocky announcement saying how brilliant they are on landing).

EasyJet provide a great product these days. BRS-BCN and back. With speedy boarding the check-in process is like business class.

Complete punctuality.

Manchester - Dalaman (Turkey) return. Surprisingly good. First time I had taken the family on easyjet used monarch and Thomas Cook before and easy jet left Thomas Cook standing. Used Speedy Booking and Boarding system well worth the money on return trip from Dalaman and very funny on way out at Manchester as all the non speedy bookers were moaning like hell. Budget airline food as expected fresh egg and tomato sandwich was a decent size. Cabin crew great and helpful. Captain was a misery - I asked him If he could radio back to Manchester to Get the Manchester City result but he was not amused.

### easyJet customer review
Great flights both to and from Portugal however the queues at Faro airport easyjet baggage gates were very long. This however may have been caused by the Portugese security which was jam packed. The catering on the flight from Portugal to Liverpool ran out of warm food and other popular items less than a quarter of the way along the plane. The gift selection suffered much the same fate because we were informed the outward flight from Liverpool to Portugal was busy and had used up the supplies. Not a good idea to rely on the catering. better to eat before boarding.

First time flier with Easyjet Manchester to Paphos return in April 2014. I had not considered Easyjet previously due to poor impression generated by TV documentary. However our expectations were exceeded on both flights. Rapid check in using speedy boarding; friendly efficient staff; very modern clean plane; the extra leg room seats were spacious and firm yet comfortable. Prices competitive. Did not have a meal but refreshments were fine. Flights were on time for both outward and inbound. Highly recommended.

### easyJet customer review
4 Flights in total EDI-LTN-GVA and the same stop over on the journey home. I have no major complaints about the flights the aircraft was to an acceptable standard cabin crew were okay. Paid extra for speedy boarding more than worth it at EDI and LTN but not Geneva as speedy boarding only gets you onto the bus first so after you get on the bus all that money spent on getting there first as no speedy boarding customers can get on the aircraft before you. Consequently we were some of the last on. Except for that and the fact at the cooked cheese and ham toastie was a bit expensive a very good flights would fly with them again just be careful what airports you book speedy boarding with!

### easyJet customer review
Three return flights from Bristol to different destinations in the last three months all very satisfactory. All left and arrived on time or a little early staff were efficient and friendly and the aircraft were tidy (one with a new interior was very nice). We only ever had hand luggage (within the stated dimensions) and encountered no problems. I feel easyJet has clearly moved on from its low-cost roots and is now pretty much indistinguishable from legacy carriers admittedly the fares are not much less and can be more unless you book well in advance if you can though it is a good value.

### easyJet customer review
Inverness - Gatwick - Funchal - Gatwick - Inverness. All flights landed pretty well on schedule. Aircraft clean and crews all very good and efficient - even managed a second pass with drinks on longer legs. A319 a bit cramped but A320 more than adequate. Departure from FNC frustrating - called very early and they even had us lined up beside the apron. then the aircraft landed. Better planning would have reduced over an hour of standing around. Speedy Boarding was worth the cost.

### easyJet customer review
Very good and clean aircraft. Most of the flights were scheduled on time crew members attitude while giving safety instructions was bad. I would recommend EasyJet for their very lucrative pricing for short haul offerings on time flights and reasonably new aircraft.

### easyJet customer review
MAN-CFU-MAN. By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg. I hope these uncomfortable seats do not become standard in the future.

### easyJet customer review
Recently flew Gatwick to Hurghada. Check in was great as Easyjet take up what seems to be an entire check in area of their own. Our hold bag was slightly over but the check in lady kindly ignored this. As we were travelling with our young daughter we boarded ahead of other passengers which allowed us to get settled without holding other passengers up getting things into and out of bags. Service during the flight was great announcements were adequate and we landed ahead of time in Hurghada. I am 6ft 5ins and found leg room to be fine. Sure you can't stretch out but it's fine for the duration of the flight. I really liked what seems to be new seating with thinner more comfortable padding. All in all another good experience with Easyjet.

EZY 8621 out 26 April return EZY 8628 27 April. Nice new A320 will take a while to change whole fleet cabin crew have a more fitting uniform for the corporate market they have a good age range of crew and as with all walks of life you get good and bad but mostly good As for the food. Well it's not Virgin Cathy or Emirates but it's what you pay for. If you are hungry there is something to eat. They have changed their coffee from Starbucks which for me is good. Luggage issues: they do have some conflicting issues depending where you are ie: only I piece of hand luggage. Then people get on with bags. Does make me laugh. As for the new size I have noted they all stay in the cabin and the larger ones moved to hold at no cost. Speedy boarding I use all the time and it works well. Now as to cost - cheap airline it is not sometimes other providers can be a little cheaper but do they have the amount of flights. No I have had more problems with other airline than ever with easyjet.

Easyjet hand luggage system is a joke. All hand luggage was allowed on the plane even if it did not fit the 'new' standard size. Having much smaller bags meant that we had to have 2 pieces under the seat so that they could fit 1 non guaranteed bag on the overhead locker. You are positively discriminated for taking a bag that is smaller that the new guaranteed size. Next time I fly I will be taking my usual size bag as this will end up in the overhead locker and I will get my leg space. No checks on the size of the luggage was performed at time of boarding. It took an extra 30 minutes to load the plane due to the chaos.

AMS-London Southend return. Again easyJet did an excellent job and far more cheaper than any airline between The Netherlands and London. We were whisked to London (40 mins) and back (35 mins). Legroom terrible but that's the disadvantage of LC-flying. The only one. Efficient friendly crew good information from the cockpit and swift bagdrop both ways. The only problem is caused by passengers on row 16 and beyond boarding the plane at the front instead of - as requested - from the back. Not easyJet's fault. Southend is a breeze with up to 4 trains/hour to London (1hr).

Flew LTN-ALC-LTN. Flight was at 6am which is a bit early but it was no big deal. Flight took off on time at Luton and arrived on time the other end. Flight was nearly full with 4-5 empty seats both ways. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. I would recommend easyJet and I fly with them regularly on this route particularly. I didn't have any food so can't comment on that.

### easyJet customer review
Booked with easyJet due to the cost factor and they were a lot cheaper than all the other airlines I looked into. Checked in online and had hand baggage only which made the whole experience painless and smooth from start to finish. I dislike the policy the airline has regarding just one bag surely if I take a cabin case and a handbag to go under the seat in front this isn't a huge deal! Food onboard was expensive and limited as expected from a low cost airline as with entertainment which was non-existent and not needed on a 2 hour flight anyway.

### easyJet customer review
London Luton UK - Keflavik Iceland and return journey. Both planes departed slightly late but arrived on schedule. Crew and staff excellent on both legs - friendly polite and in the case of the pilot and captain informative about every aspect of the trip. This is a real help to people who are a little jittery on planes. Seats are reasonably comfortable for a trip under 3 hours - any more and it would start to become an issue. Being able to pre-book a seat on Easyjet is a major step up from the free-for-all chaos of a couple of years ago. The charges for hold luggage are excessive but then this is an airline designed with city breaks in mind so hand luggage should accommodate most people's needs. No in-flight entertainment but don't most people revert to their phones / laptops / tablets these days anyway? Onboard food and drink are pricey but not ridiculously expensive and perfectly adequate compared to some of the muck served by other airlines. Have flown EJ before will do again.

### easyJet customer review
MAN-RAK-MAN - Outbound was a decent flight we had booked extra legroom seats which was nice for a 4 hour flight flight left on time and landed half hour early the FA's worked hard during the flight ensuring toilets were kept clean I agree with other reviews in that the food is expensive. Return trip flight was delayed by 90 minutes at Marrakech but they did not announce the delay until 10 minutes after the flight was meant to depart no announcements or explanation until after we had boarded. What was worrying is that another easyjet flight to Milan was boarding whilst we were waiting and they had adopted a Ryanair style cage to check bag sizes there were a lot of disgruntled passengers Easyjet is my carrier of choice but that will change if they start to adopt cheap money making tactics.

Gatwick - Valencia. When I arrived with my small suitcase and a small backpack with my laptop the assistant told me I could not enter with two bags. At the same time the other passengers came with one suitcase but with many objects (clothing bags) in hand. It was a robbery: £45 for a small bag. Never again will I fly with easyJet.

### easyJet customer review
Flew Easyjet from Luton to Tel Aviv in March. Both flights left and arrived on time. Major problems with the flights were the times if left early in the morning and arrived back late at night which necessitated a stay in a hotel. I had a small bag which I wanted to put in the hold but they wanted £30 for the service. No IFE available the food and drinks on the flight over priced.

LGW-VCE/PSA-LGW. Both flights operated to schedule. Boarding swift and efficient. Aircraft (A319's) in good condition and crew friendly and informative. Seats pre-allocated (at no cost) so family sat together. Fare was very good. Easyjet becoming my preferred 1st choice on Euro shorthaul.

### easyJet customer review
We travelled (or tried to!) on 9 April and were supposed to be flying back at 15.10hrs. We were told that there was a technical fault and they would have to fly a plane from the UK which would delay our flight by 7.5 hrs. We were given a £4.50 voucher for food which is an absolute joke. Passengers were treated with great disdain staff were rude and unhelpful and they even left a very old couple in wheelchairs to their own devices. Anyway we decided to get another flight with BA but had a terrible struggle to get our bags back. We were told that now we had booked other flights Easyjet took no responsibility for our bags as it was BAs responsibility to get our bags off the Easyjet plane on the runway! We eventually got our bags after lots of chasing and managed to get our BA flight within the nick of time. Apparently the Easyjet plane finally departed 11 hours late. We will never travel with them again.

### easyJet customer review
Less Customers less issuesthat was a comment yesterday from one of the EasyJet representative at Gate 17 from London Luton to Berlin Schoenefeld (departure 18.15 pm). They have done anything they could to get rid of customers. I flew with my 3 year old son who I paid full price for. I didn't want to take an extra luggage for him due to the many stairs on the way to the gate. Therefore I took one piece of luggage which was one inch too big. It was only one luggage for both of us. Nothing else and they charged us 45 pounds. Another customer same issue who had no cash and only a ATM Card to pay for his oversized back was refused to enter the aircraft until payment. Luckily another customer helped him out. Never again with EasyJet.

### easyJet customer review
We flew on an EasyJet Airbus A319-100. We flew from Bristol to Mallorca. FA's were friendly and catered to our every need. The toilets were a little dirty but what do you expect? Seats felt very comfy. Food was satisfactory but a little hot. I would have no qualms about flying with EasyJet again!

### easyJet customer review
Flown with various other carriers in my time but I personally think it's impossible to beat easyJet in terms of practicality and efficiency. Flew London Luton - Madrid Barajas and returned 3 days later. Outgoing flight pushed back on time and departed as scheduled smooth flight very professional and impressively presented crew who were extremely attentive throughout. Lots of communication from the flight deck and arrived 20 minutes early. Bags delivered promptly. Coming home plane arrived 30 minutes before expected departure it was turned around within a matter of minutes and we boarded early. Pushed back approximately 3 minutes early departed with an expected flight time of 1hour and 50 minutes. Plane was absolutely immaculate and again the crew were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was handled professionally. Landed at Luton 20 minutes early bags again delivered within 5 minutes of clearing immigration. I would undeniably recommend EasyJet over British Airways and other competitors short haul offerings at least with easyJet you can expect a consistently excellent service on time flights and reasonably new aircraft the low cost carriers and catching up!

Gatwick-Malta A321. Service was good but the food seemed pricey! Seats were a bit cramped but better than Flybe. Boarding was easy but took time. Hold items came out on time. Overall it was a good flight.

### easyJet customer review
EZY990. Flew out of Venice to Naples on 5 April 2014. Without notifying any passengers that the flight was to be delayed 2 hours we all stood in line waiting to board. There was also a gate change that happened. Once onboard and inflight we were all informed of the drinks/food they offer however you had to pay for everything including water. Will never fly EasyJet again.

### easyJet customer review
The Easyjet customer service is really pathetic with no flexibility. I arrived at the Boarding Gate 25 minutes before the flight departure for a short flight from Amsterdam to Luton and was not allowed to board the flight while the gates were still open. I paid additional Euro 80 and had to wait for more than 3 hours to board the next flight. I am frequent flyer and was shocked to see to me it was a deliberate attempt by Easyjet to earn more money.

### easyJet customer review
Copenhagen to Basel Switzerland no issues except the walk to the terminal was literally a mile! Baggage was checked for size deemed acceptable but because flight was full they put it with checked bags (no charge as it was correct size). Several days later we flew from Paris (PDG) to Copenhagen. This time the agents were very rude pulling people at random out of line including us to tell us we had to pay 110 euros for our 2 bags (same bags same clothes) as they had to be checked in. We had no choice but pay (it cost as much as the flight). Very poor customer service.

### easyJet customer review
BRS-FNC-BRS. Used EJ for the second time in a month both flights early so top marks again. These flights were completely uneventful and everything was as expected which is exactly the way it should be. Even check-in at FNC has improved and was much better than the last time we were there (looks like EJ now has its own staff as opposed to handing agents). The return landing at BRS must have been made by the trainee as we did come down with one hell of a bump (the Cabin Manager actually made a comment on it). Looking forward to our next trip as EJ is now a good airline.

### easyJet customer review
The new policy on cabin bags is not acceptable. On a recent flight to from Gatwick to Gibraltar we took identical bags in each direction but were not allowed to take the bags into the cabin on the return leg. The bags had to go into the hold. The bags contained our computers wallets money tickets and other valuable items. These bags were not lockable as we expected to have them with us. Their size has been acceptable on dozens of other flights with Easyjet and other airlines as they are made to fit within the airline in cabin sizing. The excuse for this 'new' ruling was that the flight was full. Every flight that I have been on with Easyjet has been full! They need to address the issue of passengers taking oversize bags onto the aircraft without penalising those of us who always ensure we have the correct size and weight for cabin bags. Until that happens we will fly with other airline.

### easyJet customer review
Although it is an improvement that all seats are now allocated it's worth noting that even if you have purchased an allocated a seat up front this does not mean that you have Speedy Boarding. In fact Speedy Boarding now seems pointless since you need to get to the gate amongst the earliest passengers or so they told me at the gate last night. Seems to me that EasyJet should now copy best practice by proper airlines and board by seat number on busier flights. At the moment it is unnecessarily stressful.

### easyJet customer review
Flew from Gatwick to Sharm-El-Sheikh in Egypt. We arrived at Gatwick and first impressions were not good. Massive check-in queue and the flight left in just over 90 minutes. Thankfully for us they asked everyone for the Sharm bound flight to come forward. Very impressed with this as most airlines leave you to struggle on your own. Friendly staff at counter who couldn't stop smiling and were most helpful. Rushed to the gate and boarded straight away as we had priority boarding (for £20 extra mind you). Brand new A319 Airbus with clean and comfortable seats. Stewardesses were very kind and helpful offering us drinks food and being most attentive. They were so good they got a 4th drinks run in 25 minutes before landing. Had a decent bacon sarnie for breakfast which was a bit pricey at £2.50 but didn't taste like melted plastic. However there was no IFE so had to make do with iPad instead. Had same crew on way back and again were faultless. Overall I will definitely fly with Easyjet again!

### easyJet customer review
Without question the worst flying experience in my 45 years of travelling. Departed late kept us queuing for 45 minutes no communication. Returning from Amsterdam the furthest gate out no elevators No bathrooms rude staff who put us through unnecessary steps to measure our baggage kept asking for our boarding basses for no reason barked at us and when I put my luggage in the measuring box and it fit I was told "It doesn't fit comfortably" and made us pay 55 Euros each even though we had already paid extra to bring larger bags on board. For that amount of money I couple have flown a civilized airline like KLM.

### easyJet customer review
Milan MXP to Naples and back 3 days later. Both flights full yet boarding ok and both flights landed ahead of schedule. Comfort in the seat is ok for a flight of 2 hours (if you are not too tall or heavy). Booking months in advance the value for money is good. I've seen the fares one week before and the price really went up. I recommend for people looking for the essential i.e. flying on time from point A to point B.

### easyJet customer review
Disappointed to see that EasyJet at Stansted adopt the Ryanair approach to boarding; passengers with two items of hand luggage ie a lady with a handbag and say a stroller are only allowed to carry on one of them! Needless to say my partner put her handbag inside the other and when on board took it out again. The crew were indifferent.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-Malta. Although I am a frequent flyer I did manage to go to the wrong terminal. My fault but the fact that easyJet operate from both terminals at Gatwick is unusual and they should do more to point this out to people before they join the long bag drop queue in South terminal. Fair enough the queues move fast and staff call out the flights that are closing but that isn't much help to you if you are in the wrong terminal altogether. Fortunately in our case we realised our error quickly and we got to north terminal and made our flight but I would argue that the bag drop system needs serious improvement. The actual flight was ok but the seat pitch is unacceptable for such a long flight. It is ok to read but not enough to work on a laptop - this is an issue for business travellers. The only good thing about easyjet is the coffee which is much better than their competitors. The allocated seating is also an improvement but we were allocated seats across the aisle from one another not ideal. I would say easyjet have some way to go before they can say they are really competing with BA etc for business travellers. They need to seriously look at what Norwegian are doing.

### easyJet customer review
BRS-BCN-BRS. Both flights were early so full marks. We've being using EJ since its inception and I think it is now almost on par with BA. These flights were good and the introduction of allocated seating has been a vast improvement. Check-in at Bristol was fast but BCN is still a bit of a wait (always has been -30 minutes this time). Still some room for improvement though. Hand luggage storage is a shambles and £2-50 for a cup of tea is scandalous (but you don't have buy). Prices also seem to have risen dramatically but EJ is still the best of the low cost carriers.

### easyJet customer review
Have flown easyjet before and would use again in the future. I have returned from a lovely holiday from Portugal today-the flight was slightly delayed due to Air Traffic Control problems in France but this did not affect my experience in the slightest. When it came time to start descent (which I was not aware of) one of the cabin crew tapped me on the shoulder to ask me to put my earphones and phone away on which I was watching a movie. I put everything away in double quick time as soon as I was asked and pushed my bag under the seat in front. As she walked off behind me I heard her comment to either a colleague or another passenger "there's always one". I was very annoyed by this and advised one of her colleagues on the way off the plane. I deliberately hung back until most of the passengers had got off so that I did not cause a scene and I deliberately did not go to the woman in question so that it did not get out if hand. The other lady assured me that they have a debrief after every flight and that my comments would be discussed. The whole point of putting the headphones in and watching the movie was for me not to disturb anyone and cabin noise not to disturb me so I was not being ignorant. However her colleagues response to my comment was very professional and reassuring.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-VRN (Gatwick-Verona). My first trip with Easyjet and I will admit to a sense of trepidation using a budget airline with a bit of a reputation! Carry-on only so I did not have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag. I also used the speedy-board option which avoided the one gripe I would have: people boarded the plane from both front and rear but without any consideration to seat allocation meaning that people were trying to pass each other in the aisle with bags in hand - close to mayhem. Seats were comfortable and legroom good (I'm a reasonably tall person) flight attendants very friendly and helpful. In summary I was pleasantly surprised.

### easyJet customer review
Manchester-Keflavik and return. It has been many years since we last flew with easyJet and all we can say how much they have improved. Our flight from MAN commenced with a lovely smile from the girl on check in which did not take long. Flight on time on outbound. Meals on the aircraft were very good and not too expensive. Aircraft very clean cabin crew excellent and professional both flights. Inbound flight departed 30 mins late from KEF due to taxi ways requiring clearing of snow! Arrived 10 mins late into MAN. Will definitely use them again on this route.

### easyJet customer review
GVA-LGW LGW-BSL. I have no problem with the flights (full both ways) and the extra-ordinary amount of hand luggage onboard the cabin crew are very pleasant and do a good job. The bag drop at both GVA and LGW is appalling. 55mins to check a bag in at GVA (and half the drop off points closed) 45mins at LGW (all the points open just not enough of them). easyJet seem to have spent a fortune enticing business travellers - complete waste of money if they expect a Business traveller (let alone a holiday maker) to stand shuffling along in a snake-like queue just to check in a bag! Until they get their act together I would avoid them simply unacceptable and treating their clients with contempt.

### easyJet customer review
We have travelled with Easyjet many times on different aircraft types the latest being a trip from Liverpool to Malaga and return. Outbound was on an older type aircraft the usual bulky seats meaning smaller seat pitch leg- room etc. however still perfectly bearable for the cheap cost and for the short trip. The return flight however was excellent! It must have been a newer aircraft or newer designed interior many passengers were commenting on it. Thinner seat backs and everything more streamlined made for a much more spacious seat pitch and a more comfortable journey. We could not fault it at all. We have never had any problems with Easyjet airport or aircraft staff and we wonder if any negative reviews towards staff are actually 'Easyjet' staff and not in fact the airport staff from the airport they are departing from and therefore nothing to do with Easyjet? We really cannot understand the reviews on here with regards to luggage. Easyjet (along with all airlines including Low- cost) clearly state their hold and hand luggage policy. If you choose to exceed (or ignore) these policies then expect to be challenged or charged (if you aren't then happy days).

### easyJet customer review
They might be the cheapest but that's for a reason. As a frequent flyer I have never used easyjet but did a quick trip to Germany and needed just a cheap flight instead of transatlantic. You are treated poorly by employees that cannot be bothered. The cabin staff were fine its the boarding staff that I have a problem with seeing passengers getting charge 55 euros for a case which was only a few millimetres too big. I will know if I travel again in Europe would rather pay the extra few pounds and travel with a decent airline.

### easyJet customer review
Paris to London. The crew member in the boarding line was extremely rude abrupt and uninformative. It was all in relation to cabin baggage being more than one bag mind you the second bag for us was a tiny handbag. We flew from Italy to Paris with no problems carrying exactly the same baggage. We were then rudely pulled out of the line and asked if we understood English in a condescending voice after being given no time to try and fit our handbags into our luggage. We were then sent to the boarding desk because we couldn't fit one in. The crew member there had no idea why we were sent there so he sent us back. We were then told it was going to cost an extra 55 Euro for a bag 1cm thicker than the allowed thickness which is outrageous not to mention we were well under our weight limit. I then noticed that some other passengers had cabin baggage as big as the one we had to pay extra for and put in the hold and also a large handbag or briefcase. In one country we are allowed certain things and the next we are not. For the same company in these countries policies and procedures are different obviously as a result of poor management. I would not recommend anybody use this airline I would rather pay extra for another airline and will be in future.

### easyJet customer review
Returned recently from Barcelona back to Newcastle paid for one case in the hold and carried one shoulder bag onto plane couldn't believe the size of the cases people were carrying onto flight some bigger than my case! No one was asked to put bag into bag sizer or indeed no check in staff even bothered to look over the counter. My issue I have with this is apart from stupidly paying for a suitcase when I could easily as it turns out take into the cabin but I was also refused to put my bag into the overhead lockers as they "have to accommodate the larger cases"! My shoulder bag was the proper size for the flight but as it turns out it was too small. I was told that I had to put it on the floor along with my coat (it was too tall to fit under the seat in front) I had a very uncomfortable 3hrs unable to move my legs the crew member was extremely rude and didn't care about the discomfort. Surely the airlines need to have an idea of the weight of the luggage on board an aircraft? At Newcastle there was virtually no hold baggage apart from ours. If we had been the last on the flight I could understand it if there was no space in the lockers but I was on fairly early in the queue the cases overhead were crammed and one of them was taped closed obviously previously overloaded?

### easyJet customer review
1st trip with them going out seemed easy enough. All customers took hand luggage as we did-checked with Easyjet to make sure what was allowed. 1 size hand-luggage hand-bag not included! No room onboard so our bags went into the hold. Poor service on board - passing items over you no excuse me discussing other passengers in front of you. Then flight back from Paphos got charged for my hand-luggage and not allowed to take my hand-bag on board? Only 1 item allowed - not told that before I travelled. Other passengers allowed to take 2 items.

### easyJet customer review
19th Feb 2014 Gatwick North Terminal to Tenerife South airport. Online booking:–Easyjet have a very user friendly website and their email communication was superb. Baggage charge: I found the £18 charge for a small bag to be outrageous. Bag Drop: the bag drop was straightforward and the staff member efficient but unsmiling and not at all friendly. Boarding: orderly enough but the announcements were not very clear and I saw 2 elderly people struggle unaided. The cabin crew were not at all friendly and seemed disorganised too. One member of the cabin crew was particularly unfriendly and gruff in the way in which he interacted with a young mum and a baby. Later in the flight I bought a coffee and the same man who was rude to the lady with the baby handed me my change with a phoney smile and the money with a strange expression. I checked the change and saw that rather than a £2 coin he had handed me an Arabic coin. I immediately saw this and asked for the correct coinage. It took the efforts of two of his colleagues for me to receive the correct change and no apology. Announcements: there were very few announcements during this journey and no route map at all. The lady captain made one announcement at the end of the flight. Comfort: The seat was rather thin but comfortable enough for the distance flown. Value: the price I paid was quite reasonable. However this was not the cheapest on this route and so I shall shop around in future to make sure I get a good deal.

### easyJet customer review
Paris-Berlin Schonefeld-Paris on 20-22 February 2014. Did not notice any particular problems except the boarding process in Berlin. The part B of the airport from which Easyjet flights depart looks like a hangar with no ventilation and places to sit. There is a huge line for boarding moving very slow. They started boarding before the plane arrived and all the passengers had to wait in very small room overheated with no fresh air. Also they write that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure while in reality it only starts at this time or even later. I guess that is completely unacceptable even for a low-cost.

London Gatwick to Bari. Out on 15 Feb flight over 3 hours late. Sent to distant gate for an on-time takeoff where the flight was not even displayed. No information all afternoon and nobody to ask Kept in-touch via Easyjet website. Panic amongst passengers when flight suddenly displayed as 'Gate Closed'. Terrible customer service non- existent. Flight crew lovely. Return flight on time and up to standard of low cost carrier.

### easyJet customer review
I flew from Edinburgh to London. The crew members checking boarding passes at the gate were rude and uninformative. My bag was too big for the cabin but then I was told I wasn't allowed my small handbag on board even though I was allowed both bags on my flight from London to Edinburgh. When asked why the sudden change in policy she had no answer and ignored me while I stood there clearly confused. I also feel that policies should be consistent throughout all airports you are situated at and all crew should be informed and enforce these policies.

### easyJet customer review
I have flown to Portugal and to Berlin and have found it a joy. The staff were friendly and although on one flight I had delays I can imagine that it would be the same with any airline. I'd recommend getting a larger seat as I do think the cheaper airlines have very small seats. Overall I always look for Easyjet first as I've had good experiences. The inflight food and beverages I tend to steer clear of as they are never that great but you can grab what you need when at the airport and save some pennies.

### easyJet customer review
ALC to LGW: Have utilised Easyjet many times on this route during the past year however sad to say that this may be the last. The cabin crew were rude unapproachable non-existent and rude. They quietly moaned about the passengers within earshot and acted as if cabin baggage was an inconvenience (even for their frequent fliers - including us). As there was insufficient room in the overhead bins for others hand baggage they pushed them in front of the empty seats behind us; as this caused discomfort to myself I made the crew aware and they repositioned it. The flight attendant felt as if she was doing me a favour. Have flown with this airline since their infancy (circa 1997) with no complaints. This was such a shame.

### easyJet customer review
I took several easyjet flights in the last few years (Berlin Rome Venice Copenhagen and Dresden - always departing from Basel). I have to say that I'm pretty happy with it. You pay for what you get. The passengers usually are rude and the seats are tight but for short trips it is ok. I had a big delay once (5+ hours) but normally it leaves on time or with minor delays. I never checked in luggage therefore I can't review that part. I also never eat/drink on board so I don't understand the complaints of many about that. It is an airline not a restaurant! Eat at the aiport if you must! Easyjet is great for short trips (less than 2 hours).

### easyJet customer review
My comments relate to the absolutely awful quaintly named 'baggage drop'. To read the easyjet web site this sounds like a casual walk in the park. It is not. Departing Gatwick we were in a zig zag for 50 minutes with the staff constantly going up and down pulling out passengers who were likely to miss their flight thereby pushing the rest of us back in the queue. However worse was to come on the return leg from Copenhagen when we were in a 60 minute baggage drop queue due to there being just one desk open - easyjet will not pay for more. On this showing just what is the difference between check in and baggage drop.

Gatwick - Malta EZY8823 2/2/14. Malta - Gatwick EZY8824 6/2/14. We approached Easyjet with some trepidation - having witnessed hoards of passengers running to grab a seat. However this has all now changed. The on-line check-in was relatively simple although we were unable to choose seats for our return flight - however the allocated seats were reserved and we were seated together. Bag drop was simple and extremely well-organised at Gatwick the seats were comfortable and the removal of a reclining function meant that ones knees were never crushed by the person in front! Plenty of leg-room for the average male and the flight attendants were polite and professional. All in all a hassle-free and pleasant experience.

### easyJet customer review
I travel on a regular basis with Easyjet but really think it's time to ease up on their draconian baggage rules. Now that Ryanair have seen the light and not only offer priority boarding and allocated seating but they allow you to take a small handbag along with your carryon bag. This just makes life so much easier!

### easyJet customer review
LPL-PMI-LPL. A short winter break to Mallorca was made very easy by the efficiency of easyJet. Both flights were full but we still managed to depart and arrive early on both sectors. Cabin crews were both hardworking and patient especially in trying to maximise capacity in the overhead lockers when some passengers seem oblivious of the needs of anyone but themselves. Cockpit crew also kept us well informed throughout both journeys.

### easyJet customer review
Glasgow to Berlin return flight 23rd to 30th January. Both flights on time aircraft clean seats were fine for what is a short journey. Took longer than usual to board on the outward flight mostly due to the scrum to find overhead locker room for the hand-luggage as people understandably want to save £27 for the privilege of checking-in a case. Only gripe is that Easyjet are not as flexible with hand-luggage as they used to be it's a strict one bag per person rule meaning handbags sandwich bags etc must go in your hand-luggage. In Berlin they were checking the size of the bags in the metal cages so be sure that your bag isn't bulging!

EZY8403 LGW-DME 20/1/2014. Would give no stars if I could. Appalling customer service. We were informed at the check in of an hour and a half delay went to have a lunch as now had the time. The flight went on time leaving a few passengers behind. Called the customer services according to their information the flight was delayed and still boarding the ground staff said the flight had left. After a very stressful afternoon the company accepted the liability and rebooked us on another flight the next day. Not worth the money saved poor customer service.

Geneva-Bacelona one way (thankfully). The problem with EasyJet is the ground staff. My bag weighed 20.5kg as shown on their scales and they insisted on counting it as 21kg and proceeded to charge extra. I thought I was dreaming. They could not be that fussy and mean. I asked them to re-weigh and it was 20.5kg. They were fussy mean and petty so I had to take an item of clothing and carried it on. The rudeness of the ground staff continued till the gate. With EasyJet you don't save anymore and when you do it is not worth the hassle and bad blood. Never again.

This is the 1st time we have ever flown with EasyJet and they do a great job. We flew 4 times with them from Paris-Rome 21/12/13 then Rome-Nice 28/12/13 then Nice-Barcelona 2/01/14 and Barcelona-Paris 7/01/14. We only had 1 small delay and on all other flights left on time. Would recommend.

LGW - Seville - LGW. We pre-booked seat in the front of the plane and it gave us Speedy Boarding which was very convenient as we could take large bags with us on the plane. Flight to Seville uneventful crew friendly we took off and landed on time. Return flight was little bit delayed due to weather in the UK. Crew again very friendly and chatty. Halfway through the flight we hit bad turbulence the crew tried to put our minds at rest and make us feel better by explaining what is happening. Very professional behaviour from both the crew and the captain.

### easyJet customer review
Malaga to Basel 9/12/13. Gate opened 15 late and the staff seemed unconcerned despite a queue of 30/40 people waiting. After checking in we were asked to pay an excess of 10 kg despite having paid for 2 golf bags. It appeared that the check in staff didn't know that the golf bag allowance is now 20kg and not the old 12 kg. Then the usual wait at the gate then in the jetty before boarding. Easyjet are OK but if there was another option I would prefer to take it.

### easyJet customer review
Madrid to Paris and return 4 days later. Both flights were late due to boarding delays. It really does seem to take much much longer with allocated seating. I used Easyjet before for years and never had problems choosing a seat. The Easyjet check in agents at Paris were unbelievably rude to everyone and insisted on checking the size of every bag even when they were obviously far smaller than limits. It used to be so easy with Easyjet - not anymore unfortunately.

MAN - BFS return on an A319. Late leaving but early arriving on the outbound and we left and arrived early on the return. Great crew both ways frequent updates from the flight deck and the A319 is a very pleasant plane to fly in. Our landing in Belfast was the smoothest in 30 years of flying and this in bad weather. High marks all round. Cannot comment on the food and drink as I didn't order any.

### easyJet customer review
24th Dec 2013. Manchester to Bilbao. EasyJet was the only company to cancel flights to Bilbao in that afternoon/evening. Weather was improving and all other airlines made it to Bilbao except easyJet. Bilbao airport was never closed. Similar weather conditions days later in Liverpool and not a single easyJet flight was cancelled. Full ticket refund on their website was straightforward so no complaints about that. Staff at Manchester airport were very patient they could not do much about it and had to face all of us frustrated passengers. But equally it was clear that the company had not a clear plan to bring their customers to their destination their advice was more like go home. In spite of all that easyJet when it operates their flights they tend to be very good only when things go out of the ordinary they tend to be very bad. I would still recommend easyJet but passengers should think twice before booking flights on certain important dates without a plan B.

### easyJet customer review
Like many we had a horrendous experience travelling or trying to travel with easyjet from/to Gatwick on 24/25 of Dec. Nothing can excuse the abysmal treatment by easyjet of the passengers who were forced to await repatriation from Malaga on 24th Dec. Poor information of passengers throughout especially on the 24th with passengers lurching from delay to delay eventually ending in cancellation after a 7-8 hour wait in the terminal. Being given a voucher for the value of 4.50 Euros in an airport in which a can of coke costs 3.70 Euros and a brownie 3.50 Euros. Having to queue for 2 hours to rebook following cancellation with 200 passengers served by 2 staff eventually reduced to 1 after which we were all told that all the rebooking was useless as we could rebook ourselves or check in normally the following day. Ferried to a hotel and having to queue in the rain and wind for over an hour while a single person was booking in 200 passengers one at a time. Ferried back to the airport the next day at 11 am only to be left in terminal C for over 7 hours with virtually all facilities shut down no attempt to hand out any snacks or refreshment and only one harassed easyjet rep in attendance being clearly out of his depth unable or unwilling to announce anything and to address anything. Absence of sensible and correct information from easyjet with the only source of semi-reliable information coming from passengers with access to the web or contacts in the UK. Had to endure hours of waiting as an aircraft scheduled to take us to Gatwick was diverted to Alicante without explanation for hours with wild rumours circulating on its destination chances of its return and any time estimates. Offered crisps or some low-cost choc sweet and a drink as compensation”for the 7-hour food-less/drink-less wait in an otherwise abandoned terminal. My own verdict is that easyjet's support framework in Malaga is totally inadequate and poorly equipped to deal with unforeseen events. Staff are poorly trained and poorly motivated having no understanding of the importance of talking to passengers and keeping them informed. Your food arrangements in case of serious delays are ludicrous all characteristic of an airline who has forgotten (or never learnt) the importance of customer relations alongside its raison d'etre of maximising its profits.

Manchester to Bilbao 24th December 2013. Flight cancelled due to poor weather weather was bad at Bilbao. This was handled very poorly by easyjet staff. A man announced flight cancelled and to rebook at easyjet service desk. Vague information and they suggested going home to rebook online. Navigating their website on Christmas Eve was again very unclear.

### easyJet customer review
Manchester to Geneva EZY1949 18 October 2013. Easyjet service has declined over time and one feels more like being herded (like sheep) more than being a valued customer that brings in profit. It feels customers are being squeezed for all they can get out of them. Today was another such example. I had booked tickets for my son on October 2 and he arrived at the airport in time but was told that the flight was overbooked and there were no more seats. He could wait as two people had not shown up. Furthermore there were no more flights for the day. What was he to do sleep at the airport.? They did not even apologise. We were in a panic as we as a family had booked onward flights and he had appointments. How can they overbook when we had booked well over two months ago. It was not that my son just showed up hoping to get on the flight. This is unacceptable.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-DME November. The flight itself was not bad and the staff were good. LGW staff were attentive and helpful. LGW location and time good. I have no complaints about staff or aeroplane. It's the in-flight offering. Paying £7 for a cheese and ham roll and a coffee is a rip-off. Worse is booking online. The fact the flight was advertised at £76 then plus plus plus. £76 becomes £125 and then the most annoying part of all having to pay to reserve your seat knowing if you don't you're going to have a lot of trouble at the airport. I wished I had booked British Airways. At 6'3" I don't have a choice and by the time the online system permitted me to book the tall persons seats had gone because there is unclear notification on the website that you have to pay additional cash to book your seat if you're checking-in online. Next time I'll get up early and fly BA. Advertised Flight £76. Actual cost with hidden extras £140.

I have just returned from visiting my parents in the UK. I travelled from Paphos to Manchester on the 27th November and was satisfied with the flight. The only thing I did not like was the food choice being a vegetarian and having choices of Bacon Ham and cheese or Egg! Other than that fantastic will never rely on their food again. Arrived in Manchester airport 35mins before due time - excellent and was extremely pleased as was starving! Flight back was good cabin crew excellent no food choice again.

Fuerteventura on Saturday 23rd November from Bristol. My husband became unwell on our recent flight and the on- board crew were extremely professional quick efficient and discreet. The stewardess who dealt with him knew exactly what to do and treated him with efficient kindness. They were completely unfazed and I can't thank them enough. If it wasn't for her quick intervention we may have had to land at the nearest airport and mucked up everyone's holiday. Brilliant airline.

### easyJet customer review
Flying from Faro last Saturday we are caught up in the flight control situation. Our Captain was excellent he stood just outside the flight deck and explained exactly the situation and our options he was calm lucid and just about as helpful as it was possible to be. 3 times during our delay he broadcast updates so that we knew what was going on. The cabin crew did everything possible to keep all of us comfortable. Overall a brilliant customer service experience.

### easyJet customer review
What can I say about easyjet other than it does exactly what it says on the tin! Great airline easy to use and if flying anywhere in Europe always use easyjet. We flew Bristol to Alicante in October and as with all our previous easyjet flights we were on time clean aircraft comfortable and the cabin crew are as good as Virgin Atlantic. Obviously as a "no frill's" airline you don't get "free food" or films etc but that said you don't pay for it either and if you want to eat there is good choice on board and for a couple of hours you don't need much anyway. Basically if we are flying to Europe we always fly easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
Bristol to Newcastle 2/12/13. Booked extra leg room seat which included speedy boarding flight left on time and landed 20 minutes early. No real issues apart from over priced food and drinks available on flight which I decided not to purchase. Returned to Bristol the following day on the late flight. Most shops had closed at least one hour before departure from Newcastle airport. Flight were uneventful and arrived on time shame they bussed us to the terminal. Would always use Easyjet for any short flights.

### easyJet customer review
We flew to Fuerteventura and back from Bristol last week. My husband forgot to print off the boarding pass until the last minute so our seats were not ideal especially on the return! Right at the back of the plane by the loo. However allocated seating is still a vast improvement on the horrible scrum you got before. We got to the airport on our return quite early and consequently were near the front of the queue. It was all quite friendly until a 'lady' who had booked speedy boarding turned up. She started shouting that they were all in the wrong queue. We checked in at the normal queue sailed past her and relaxed on the terrace for quite a while. On our return we got our bags first. Moral of the story there is absolutely no point in paying extra for speedy boarding!

### easyJet customer review
MAN-MLA return. My first time with Easyjet for 5 years having avoided low-cost carriers since then due to several bad experiences. But I cannot believe the difference - Easyjet now beats the full-service carriers not only on cost but on most other aspects as well. Paying to choose seats makes a huge difference but it's not just that - the whole experience was so good on both sectors that I had to keep reminding myself that I was not flying with a flag-carrier. Friendly helpful professional and good-humoured crew on both flights flights on time no baggage/boarding card issues and seat pitch slightly better than expected (but you will struggle if you're over 5'11" I'll admit). Warm food available too - which was surprising. I've flown with 5 different airlines this year and only the flights with Qatar were better than this. I'm planning on flying this route again very soon and Easyjet will definitely be the first choice next time.

Travelled to Lanzarote and had a great time there. Easyjet flights considerably better than others we have used most notably because our request for special assistance was fulfilled. Late night return to Gatwick went smoothly with a very attentive young man to meet and greet at the aircraft before taking passengers in a wheelchair to his buggy. He even took the trouble of wheeling one pax out to the drop-off area. Great service.

### easyJet customer review
I and my wife travelled on 14 Nov from Lisbon to Gatwick flight EZY8720. Airport staff rude and impatient lack of helpfulness and customer service. Forced to pay 35 Euro and check one luggage even though this was as specified slightly bigger bag maximum size of 56x45x25cm which holds man suits. Forced my wife to put her purse and souvenirs bag into her suitcase. During boarding her suitcase was not allowed saying there is no room on overhead storage and took the luggage. Arriving at Gatwick this suitcase was missing. Very bad experience with EasyJet.

### easyJet customer review
My wife aged 73 followed all blurb pushed out by Easyjet especially the luggage allowance. She packed her small suitcase and also a small handbag with 2 Xmas presents. She was demanded to empty the small bag into her case damaging the presents! Of course people who had bought goods around the airport came along and they where allowed to carry on their purchases in bigger carrier bags.

### easyJet customer review
Flew Gatwick-Copenhagen-Gatwick. Efficient check-in and on-time departures at both ends which is good and indeed better than some. I am fed-up with their baggage policy. We paid extra for our case to go in the hold but was then asked to remove our coats from the overhead storage compartments so that other people's huge hand luggage could have the space! Baggage in the cabin is becoming a joke (a couple with a small toddler loaded 3 cases!) but we were asked to put our coats on the dirty floor or sit through the entire flight baking hot with them on our laps - not sure how we were expected to eat or drink anything in comfort as the table could barely be deployed! The overhead storage area was choc-a-block so I wonder if our group had also taken cases to go in the cabin - where on earth would it have been put! Maybe next time we won't pay extra and just wait for them to put the overload/surplus in the hold anyway unless of course they ask us to put it on our laps! Easyjet have a good pricing structure and if they included a piece of hold baggage as standard (and enforced the one piece of 'hand' luggage they could become an airline to seriously challenge their flag flying rivals.

Flew Toulouse to Gatwick 29 October and return on 31 October evening. Booking and follow-up were first class including reminders to check in online and print boarding passes. The contact could not be faulted. We had "preferred" seats and plenty of legroom. Flights were almost full but on time. We actually left Toulouse late due to a change of aircraft and hence crew not on board to prepare but were given a thorough explanation once on board. Absolutely no trouble with baggage as we kept within the cabin bag limits.

### easyJet customer review
Luton - Olbia - Gatwick. Luton airport's small terminal resembled a crowded low-end shopping mall with a large food court. The passenger security check was well-managed. There was little seating in the almost-windowless departure lounge though there was somewhere to buy a coffee amid the duty free gauntlet. You wouldn't want to be delayed here. The walk from terminal entrance to boarding gate was relatively short as was the quick taxi from aircraft parking stand to take-off. At the boarding gate (gate 16) many passengers crowded precariously for at least 10 or 15 minutes over the entire length of a long and steep stairway with their cabin baggage before being able to access a small ground-level room where passports and boarding cards were slowly checked before exiting into the open air to walk across the tarmac to board the plane parked nearby. My single carry-on bag complied exactly with the airline's specified 56 x 45 x 25cm maximum dimensions including handles and wheels. At the boarding gate a member of Easyjet staff selected passengers with wheeled bags from the queue for baggage assessment. My bag did not quite fit a metal- framed gauge indicating that it was over-sized. I was required to check it in and pay a £40 fee on the spot. Not negotiable. The gate staff were blunt unsympathetic and appeared hardened to this procedure which felt like a scam. I still had to carry the bag to the aircraft steps and locate a hold-baggage loader to accept it. After boarding had finished there was ample empty space in the overhead lockers for my regulation-size cabin bag. Admittedly my soft- shell Samsonite wheelie was full which may have distorted the dimensions slightly but Easyjet's exacting customer- unfriendly approach felt 'out to get'. Be warned! On the return flight from Olbia my bag - the very same bag - just fitted a similar gauge and I was allowed to take it in the cabin. On both flights the cabins were tidy but with grubby carpet. There was no choice of seat (unless you opted to pay more in advance) which was randomly allocated at the time of online check in. The seat pitch was very tight though just tolerable for a two-hour flight; not for anything longer. The cabin crew both outbound and inbound were friendly and efficient but did nothing to stop noisy young children from running up and down the aisle throughout the entire flight and also made too many announcements. The announcements promoting food and tax-free sales and so many price-savings were intrusive and relentless. Pity the Easyjet frequent-flier! There was no complimentary in-flight catering but drinks and some over-priced unhealthy snacks were offered for sale. The outbound flight departed from Luton on time and arrived a few minutes early in Olbia. The return flight began boarding on time in Olbia but departed 30 minutes late. This delay appeared to be due to desperately inefficient ground handling staff at the boarding gate in Olbia who seemed to lack any sense of interest in getting the flight away on time. We made up some time during the journey and landed 20 minutes late into Gatwick. We arrived at Gatwick North terminal though the flight was sold as arriving at Gatwick South terminal. The boarding pass also indicated arrival at Gatwick South terminal. No announcement as to the change of terminal was made by the crew and anyone unfamiliar with Gatwick airport would have been unaware. The potential for this anomaly to cause problems for customers with pick-up arrangements is obvious. Overall Easyjet was a third-rate airline experience. Bare minimum transportation for a full-service price and the feeling of having been ripped-off.

Milan Malpensa-Berlin SXF. I fly them I know exactly what to expect for the money I pay and I stick to their baggage regulations which look more than "spartan". To be honest I got what I wanted boarding on time landing on time seats comfortable and the prices for beverages were definitely lower then those at the airport. They look like a very good alternative to the not-low-cost airlines which are expensive and do not worth the money. I will fly them often for short trips in Europe and small vacations around the continent. Their business model seems to make a difference since they are expanding their network all the time. Looking forward to see what they can do.

### easyJet customer review
I have been flying with easyjet over the last 10 years and my recent experience with them was a disappointment. I took a return flight from Edinburgh to Iceland last month and in general from ground staff to cabin crew most were rude and impatient. I was disappointed with their lack of helpfulness and customer services considering my previous experience with them were mostly good. On the return flight our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours Easyjet gave us £3 voucher each which was even insufficient to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee in an expensive airport likes KEF. Easyjet used to be my first choice of low cost carrier in the UK but their staff attentiveness really need to be improved.

### easyJet customer review
Copenhagen to London Gatwick Flight EZY5370 and EZY5365. November 1st - 4th. I will not fly with easyJet again. Sure it is very cheap but you don't actually get what you pay for you get much less. For a vacation it will make you stressed that you paid 50 euros in additional fees there and 50 euros in additional fees back. For a business trip it will make you uncomfortable for the rest of your journey abroad knowing that you had no space to breathe and sat in a poorly-maintained aircraft as transportation. It was my first time flying easyJet and definitely my last. Listen to the reviews above because these are true stories and I just experienced a common negative review above. EasyJet forced me to check my bag in for 50 euros one-way at the gate even though I have taken this bag every time I travel as a carry on. The surprise fees at the gate were more expensive than my ticket. Don't let the low prices online fool you.

SEN-BCN-LGW. First time with Easyjet and very impressed. Outward everything ran like clockwork-flight left and arrived early. Pre boards etc all carefully looked after. On the return got caught up in heavy delays caused the 'big storm' in SE England. My return was amended to Gatwick with no charge - just a smile - and pax handling at a very busy airport with lots of delays very well handled. I was a refugee from the now defunct BA flt LCY/BCN and very happy to use them again. Only comment would be the fare was the same as BA (one checked bag and booked a seat number) and seat pitch a tad tight but bearable. Will use again.

London Gatwick to Prague and return 3 11 October 2013. Online booking and check-in was straightforward. Boarding quick and efficient. I had a small bag but ones larger than the new maximum size seemed to be permitted in the cabin. The Airbus A320 was modern and clean. Despite being over 6ft. I was able to fit in to a standard seat (although being on the aisle helped). Both flights left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The three cabin crew carried out their duties efficiently. Overall a good experience.

I flew with my partner and my 3 year old toddler to Venice and back from Southend Airport. I must say this was the second time we have ever flew with them because we have always opted for Ryanair which I have found cheaper. In these two last instances Easyjet was cheaper the airport we fly from is convenient and quiet. They let us board first because we travel with the a kid and they are much more relaxed with regard to the hold luggage and carry on one. After years flying with Ryanair and feeling completely stressed because of all those restrictions flying with Easyjet felt like a breath of fresh air. We will fly with them again.

First time flying with EasyJet and quite impressed for a budget airline. It is a bit of a scramble to get on board even though we had 'priority boarding' but the flights were on time and staff excellent. Flight was Luton to Paris. Service on board was really good and aircraft spotless. Look forward to flying EasyJet again which is something I would not say about some budget (and non budget) airlines both in and out of Australia.

Checked in around 17.00 and was served by one very nice lady who even offered to check in one of our small bags for free so we could be a little bit mobile and free as we had two other bags and a buggy. Really appreciate the help and very friendly mannerism. Will not forget the service and was grateful.

### easyJet customer review
On 6th October we flew with Easyjet from London Luton to Corfu we took off on time at 6.30am. We were told 20 minutes into the flight that we had a problem with the engines that we had to turn round and land back at Luton. On arrival the engineers came over to the aircraft and we were told that the problem could not be fixed so we were off loaded and went back into the airport terminal. We were given a voucher for £3 per person and we went back into the departure lounge. Easyjet flew a replacement aircraft from London Gatwick and we took off 5.5 hours late. Now a few points: there were people moaning and groaning the usual but I cannot praise Easyjet enough. Onboard the aircraft before we were off loaded the pilot kept us informed and invited us to the cockpit to ask any questions we had. The logistics off replacing that aircraft from another airport was I thought brilliant. The service was brilliant on board. The return journey was fabulous and the crew were brilliant as well and I have great respect for Easyjet and enjoy flying with them and they have no comparisons with any other low cost carrier. And another thing on return we had an email from customer service apologising about the delay.

### easyJet customer review
Rome - Paris in October. Despite having checked in online (after having virtually been harassed to do so) we encountered a massive queue at the bag drop in Rome. Way too many passengers and way too few open desks. With our flight nearing the cut off we wouldn't have made it if they hadn't called us over to another counter - a blink- and-you'll-miss-it announcement. With boarding starting in ten minutes desk staff was not even able to tell us our boarding gate. Having made it there boarding was slow and confusing with no announcements made of any kind. We were bussed to the plane but could only board through the front door which slowed things down even more. Flight was uneventful staff was polite but not especially friendly. All in all the only positive aspect of this flight was the fare. Everything else just showed that this airline is operating on the cheap and isn't even trying to hide it.

### easyJet customer review
Gatwick to Moscow. Family of four. I was quite wary of booking with EasyJet for a mid length flight but the experience was absolutely fine. Check in and boarding was simple. Staff both ends were friendly and efficient. There were a lot of Russians on the flights but EasyJet have employed some English speaking Russian flight attendants to handle them. Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings. Even with the food added to the ticket price costs were less than half of a comparable flight with other airlines. Maybe on a longer flight I would yearn for an in flight movie and some free drink but if I go back to Moscow I will use EasyJet.

### easyJet customer review
5 return trips with easyJet this year and all have been eminently satisfactory: no hitches no delays no unwelcome extra charges. If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through "manually" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said "Never mind you're here now". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.

### easyJet customer review
Alicante to Gatwick 11th October 2013. Hand baggage only and checked in on my iPhone the app was very easy to use. There was a little confusion at the gate about which queue was what (i.e. Speed Boarding and the Other Queue) however announcements were made to clarify the confusion. One bag policy was an irritation (as was their militant- style checks of it) given that Monarch have now relaxed this as long as both bags fit within the allowance. Very warm welcome onboard by the crew. Seating tight but not too uncomfortable for a short flight - wouldn't fly with them mid-haul in those seats however. Allocated seating is a great improvement although there is still a mad rush to board for locker space. A fear seems to exist on low cost carriers in regards to this but I don't find this same mad rush on BA flights (when passengers tend to carry even more hand luggage). Selection of food and drink very extensive. Not too many announcements and no pushy sales. Service very warm and friendly. On time arrival and quick disembarkation. If easyJet can get smooth out the last remaining 'low cost feel' ruffles from their product (issues with hand luggage and more options to pay extra for space i.e. a blocked middle seat) I would consider them on par with BA 's product in Europe. easyJet have come a long way and overall I was quite pleased with the journey experience.

The fares are cheap but it's like paying to be tortured seats extremely cramped. They will not allow you to put anything under the seat in front of you so your purse is your carry-on and they'll charge you to check what should be your carry-on bag. Most European rollers are smaller than U.S. ones so your roller won't work. Our first flight from Brussels to Berlin cost us 50 euros extra when they took my roller at the gate. My husbands roller was allowed. On the second easy jet flight from Berlin to Paris we paid the counter charge of 30 euro for my roller only to have my husbands roller denied at the security line adjacent (literally) to the ticket counter for which we paid another gate fee of 50 euro even though we hadn't left the lobby. While in the security line a woman on our flight was worried about the time. She said "I know this airline and if you're not at the gate a half hour before departure they will deny you boarding". So we begged ourselves to the front of the line and ran to the gate. At least in Brussels they were calling people up on a flight that was next to depart. If you are under 25 and making a short trip then take easy jet. If you are an American on an extensive trip avoid them. What you save in air fare is not worth the fees you will pay at the airport. I will say the inflight crews were very nice.

Flew Gatwick-Chania and return early October. Both flights arrived on-time and there was enough legroom. That is apart from the guy sitting behind me on return trip when the in-flight magazine proved sufficient padding at my back. Seemed well organised and would use again.

Last November I travelled from Portugal to Egypt and my departure was on Madrid. I had to catch a connecting flight between Lisbon and Madrid. The flight to Madrid a short travel of 45/50 minutes arrived on scheduled to Madrid so I had a stopover there of about 4 hours. I didn't have problems with the luggage. The boarding was a bit confusing (due to speedy boarding) and the flight was full so the experience on the ground and on board was poor. The space between the seats was also very short a thing that is normal on these low cost companies. My returning flight was threatened by a ground strike on Barajas. Even though the flight was delayed 1hr 20 minutes the crews kept passengers informed. I'll choose this low cost option to travel between European countries.

Flew with from Hurghada to London Gatwick on a one way ticket. I travelled with Thomas Cook on the outbound flight nowhere near as good as EZY. Brand new A320 excellent new seats which give you more room friendly crew pilots and on time! Onboard menu no different in cost to any other airlines! Excellent 5.5 hr flight much better than my TCX departure to HRG! Would definitely recommend! Online check in was a breeze and bag drop easy to use and find at Hurghada. 10 out of 10 for comfort.

LGW-PSA-LGW. Flights on time aircraft clean and tidy and staff courteous and clearly enjoyed their job. PSA 'international departure lounge' awful. Cramped (even with only two flights going) and little room to sit down. easyJet continue to offer a great product all based around customer choice - so if you want a free meal free newspapers free drinks inflight entertainment free blanket and free pillows go to an airline that advertises it!

### easyJet customer review
Had no problems at all with Easyjet. Flew to Rhodes from John Lennon. Seat pitch was better than some other aircraft's. Cabin staff were very friendly and helpful. We could actually make out the captains announcements. Outgoing and incoming flights were both on time and check in was swift. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with EJ again.

### easyJet customer review
Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick on an Airbus 320. We had no luggage so we did not use drop off counters (they were almost empty without queues). We booked priority boarding and extra leg room sit (first row). When they opened the gate we waited more than 20 minutes at the terminal's door before opening it and let us board. Hard seat with no possibility to adjust it leaning down. Easyjet e-application helpless as for an unknown mistake I was not able to do the check in online. Very annoying the fact of receiving Easyjet e-mails every week before the flight. Globally good price for the transportation only: do not except more.

### easyJet customer review
LGW to Split with 2 adults and 2 kids under 2 which could be a nightmare but Easyjet staff made it a pleasure. We initially had a third adult in our row of three but we were swiftly moved to a row with a spare seat before take off. The crew were terrific with helping us out with milk for our 2 year old and even invited him into the cockpit after landing! It was a thrill for our little guy and a rare treat these days. Great value and outstanding service.

Flew to Berlin from Southend and back. No issues at all. Flights both departed on schedule and actually arrived early at the destinations. EasyJet have really got their act together and are now a serious rival to any 'full fare' airline in Europe.

### easyJet customer review
LCA-LGW. Historically I have been a fan and supporter of EZY but this was my first long flight with the airline and taught me that the business model translates very badly to longer stage lengths - I don't expect a hot meal and free newspapers - my flight was a nightmare due to a simple collision of demographics. The two passengers behind me were incredibly badly behaved obviously drunk when they boarded and the cabin crew served them each two Stellas and 6 double G&Ts. Cabin crew on commission are never going to not serve someone another round of drinks. These particular passengers made everyone around them's flight absolutely miserable. I don't even mind a bit of bad behaviour on a short flight going to EDI or HAM or somewhere it can even be a source of comedy but on a 4+ hour night flight I and my neighbours should not expect to have our seats kicked deliberately and be sworn at. I will fly EZY again on short haul but over about 2hrs the risk is simply too great of being mixed in with people who don't know how to behave and are in no fit state to fly. The 20 minute delay on the taxiway after landing and parking at the“wrong”terminal (South instead of North) because they wanted the aircraft parked at the South terminal for the first flight out the next morning caused a lot of inconvenience and was a final twist of the knife to finish off a horrible experience.

### easyJet customer review
On my recent journey from NCL-PMI the ground crew forced me to pay extra for my case which was over my free allowance I also had the embarrassment of having to put my carry case into the measuring device to ensure that it was meeting the companies carry on policy thankfully it was. Once I found my way onto the plane I was pleased to see the first officer greeting passengers. The flight attendants were very friendly. Obviously being a low cost airline I expected to pay for refreshments some good deals and quality food. Over all the flight was good got me there and back did the job. Even got a nice "cheerio" when I disembarked.

### easyJet customer review
My most recent flight to Krakow from Edinburgh (29/9) has been my 7th with Easyjet since January 2013 and once again they have provided service of the highest quality both at the airport and in the air - their customer charter seems to be working a treat! I look forward to many more enjoyable flights with them - some 'scheduled' airlines could learn a great deal from them about customer care! Obliged to submit low score on in-flight rating since 'not applicable' category unavailable.

### easyJet customer review
Flew from Berlin to Amsterdam with my wife and 3 friends. There was no help no elevators for a friend who was not able to walk due to knee pain. Inconsistent implementation of rules. One person in our group was told that she could not take her purse as it was too big other one with the same size purse was not stopped. Other passengers carried two pieces and there were not stopped. I was told at the ticket counter that I could carry my empty back pack but the lady at the gate said no. We had to walk in rain outdoors no umbrellas no covers on the ladders.

### easyJet customer review
Travelling from London Gatwick to Paphos on 24/9/2013 with my wife. Had 2 bags weighing approximately 14kg and 16kg and a hand luggage which we and also our daughter took on the plane in more than 10 different Easyjet flights. At the check in procedure an impolite female employee asked us to put our hand luggage bag in the gauge. No problem at all. Although the whole bag went in I had to put a little force to take it out since it is a hard plastic one and stuck in there. She refused to let us take it to the plane and charged us £69.00 (25 for the bag and 44 for 4kgs overweight of our 3 bags). When I informed her that we used this bag many times on Easyjet flights before - the last one being 5 days before on our travel from Paphos to Gatwick - she refused to accept. Our lovely 5 day London holiday was ruined. Needless to say that other people on the flight had much thicker and bigger had luggage allowed on the plane. Furious and Disgusted.

### easyJet customer review
Always said "will never fly again with Easyjet" but then because of the price we did it again. But what you get for the price is a flight back and forth - that's it! No service meaning being friendly attentive professional. It's not a bus ride it's a flight! Either my husband (who is 2m tall) always has to argue why he needs to sit at the emergency exit due to legroom or staff are just unfriendly or there is always this fight at the check-in cause of 10 grams too much weight or 1 cm of too large of hand luggage. It's not fun and only stress flying with Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
Why does Easyjet humiliate women at the gate - making them put their handbags into their already small cabin bags yet allow anyone with duty free bags to take these on board as well as their cabin bag allowance. There is no consistency in this requirement and until you arrive at the gate no clear advice. So you seat on an aircraft with no money to buy refreshments no accessible passport and none of the other items that make a flight more bearable. It is humiliating to have your boarding pass confiscated while you struggle to put your handbag (even a small one) into an already full very small cabin bag while other people sail past you with their duty free bottles of wine clanging merrily away. The bullying tactics used at the gate will make me think twice about flying with easyjet again. Please make clear what is required and be consistent.

Travelling from Belfast-Faro on Aug 15th 2013 my car keys fell from belt connection under seat on plane I didn't realise this until arrival at taxi outside Faro airport. I immediately went to lost and found office at airport staff very casual about my situation I then contacted my daughter in Belfast who got in contact with EasyJet customer services and at 11.30pm the same night my daughter called to say that staff had found my car keys and they would be at Belfast Intl Airport on my return 2 weeks later.

### easyJet customer review
Gatwick to Funchal. Flight left on time and arrived a couple of minutes early. Speedy boarding worked well. Cabin crew excellent cheerful and helpful. This positive approach makes the flight more enjoyable (unlike some other budget carriers). As a budget airline Easyjet is one of the best. Looking forward to the return flight.

Used Easyjet again and again. Never had any complaints last flight from Barcelona to Newcastle (flight 6401) was a really treat. The staff were friendly and a bonus of being able to hear the pilot (or 1st officer) explain how long what height where we were throughout the flight.

Gatwick to Seville and return for short break. Online booking and check-in flawless. Bit of a queue at the bag drop but nothing horrendous. They appeared to have laid on extra staff to cope. Both flights actually arrived early. Crew great and service very good. Overall excellent.

### easyJet customer review
STN-GLA: Last flight of the day to GLA and Stansted Airport was very quiet. The flight was uneventful but did manage to leave and arrive 20 minutes early. Usual slightly cramped seating cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The only real issue was Easyjet's new hand baggage policy - why should I take care to adhere to their requirements when there was nobody policing this at Stansted and the passenger in front carried on 5 pieces of hand luggage?

### easyJet customer review
My son and I travelled to Gatwick on 3/7/13 from Belfast International. I had hand luggage bearing in mind I travel with the same case every time I go to visit my son. It would not fit into the grid by a quarter of an inch the wheel stopped it and she insisted I pay £40 which I refused. My son got the case in passengers behind were looking and getting very impatient because of the hold up. People do not need the this kind of behaviour when travelling. To be honest I find Belfast International staff not very helpful at the best of times.

Geneva to Nice on 29th August 2013 - 1st flight in the AM. Obviously got up extremely early to make it to the aeroport on time (checked my phone and email before hand just in case flight was delayed). Arrived was informed by other passengers (not check-in person who conveniently forgot) that the flight was +3 hours delayed. The official reason was "Technical issue with the plane" (the agent then added we'd rather passengers were alive and late than the alternative). 2 hours later we find out it's actually missing crew members because of poor organization. I nearly missed my connecting flight. Easyjet does not care it's not their problem. I will never fly Easyjet again.

### easyJet customer review
Gatwick - Venice and then Rome - Gatwick. Booked these about 6 weeks prior and paid to choose my seat and speedy boarding - a worthwhile investment! I could not fault them - it was a cheap flight so had little expectations but everything was done professionally and with a smile. No real queues at either end to check in staff were all really friendly and dealt with some very difficult people without losing their cool. I was impressed and will definitely use them again.

### easyJet customer review
We were asked to board at Milan Malpensa only to find we were left in a hot and stuffy jetway for 30 minutes this wasn't an error as it happened two weeks later on another easyjet flight at Milan this is obviously done for the convenience of the staff not the comfort of passengers.

### easyJet customer review
Luton to Geneva. Always surprised by their baggage policy. I was just 1 kg over (21 kgs) and the check in assistant charged me. It's not a problem but I was just thinking the person in front of me weighed at least 95 kgs and is not charged for their 20kg bag. I weigh 65 kgs and have to pay for 1 kg over. Appreciate you cannot charge based on a person's total weight but for some reason it seems unfair. Also they are not very consistent - I often carry 21 kgs on Easyjet and they do not charge anything - could depend on the mood of the Easyjet check in assistants. At Luton the assistant said the Managers had asked them to charge every person on that day.

Has anyone flown an airline which fails to take any luggage on board. Arrived at arcelona airport mid morning last Wednesday 4 September and no-one had a case! No cases were onboard unbelievable. No information given as we landed or when we all stood watching an empty carousel. Next step of course was a huge 2 hour queue to talk to the one poor girl on the Easyjet desk.

### easyJet customer review
We flew to Turkey this year. We paid £400 each (3 of us). We were delayed at Liverpool for 2 hours and I couldn't believe for the price there was no inflight entertainment or inflight meal. They say you get what you pay for but I'm sorry this was a rip off! The seats were uncomfortable and squashed and staff were unhelpful and rude. On return we only had Turkish lira to which we were told they only accept euro or sterling so we couldn't buy a drink on the plane. We were offered tap water. This was the first and last time we fly with easyjet!

### easyJet customer review
We travelled Manchester - Tenerife on 2nd September. We chose Speedy Boarding and pre selected our extra legroom seats. Both worked brilliantly and we even shared 3 seats between the 2 of us. We departed 30 mins late and had a pleasant flight. The cabin crew were efficient friendly and pleasant. Arriving at Tenerife we had the excitement of a "fly - around" just as we were about to land the pilot accelerated and flew away. He announced that due to excessive tail winds he was going to attempt the landing again. To some cheers and applause he did so 10 mins later. I'm a fairly frequent flyer and I've never encountered this before but it was handled very well and we had above all a safe flight.

### easyJet customer review
EDI-MUC on 23 August and HAM-EDI on 2 September. Two more great flights with Easyjet. Slight delay leaving EDI due to another aircraft having a technical problem and delaying our aircraft's arrival on the stand but this was made up in the air and we arrived in MUC bang on time. Cabin crew exceptionally pleasant and friendly. On time departure from HAM and early arrival into EDI on the way back. Cabin crew not up to the same standard as the earlier crew but still fine. The aircraft were almost full on both flights which I hope will encourage Easyjet to consider serving even more destinations direct from Scotland.

### easyJet customer review
BHX to BFS and BFS to BHX 2nd September 2013. Had a great first two flights with easyjet! The cabin crew especially on the return flight were very friendly and clearly enjoyed their jobs as they were joking with us and other passengers. They were also very professional. The seats are comfortable with good legroom although if you have longer legs you may want to upgrade to the exit row seats. There is also a wide range of items to buy as gifts at good prices which we took advantage of. The aircraft (same both ways) was in excellent condition and very clean; the flights both left on time and arrived at the destination early. Only had hand luggage and what was interesting in how quite a few people seem to have massive bags as hand luggage Easyjet were very lenient in not enforcing the rule a certain other airline would have made a fortune in oversized baggage! I only wish that Easyjet could open a base at BHX one day!

### easyJet customer review
Flown from AMS to LIS on 1st September nothing to say when comparing to KLM TAP or even Transavia which are so much more expensive on this route than easyjet. Went to the plane almost 45 minutes before departure time stress free boarding smart and polite crew onboard who I could see were doing their very best in order to accommodate a few last passengers with some musical instruments sit together. Very quiet flight great food onboard (loved the ham and cheese toastie) and flight arrived very early. Will keep using easyjet on this route as they are the cheapest tough still offering the same or even better service than its competitors.

### easyJet customer review
I travelled from Amsterdam on Monday the boarding was a nightmare. The gate they use H4 has 10 seats for a full plane of 180 people. We had to stand in this small confined place with little air conditioning for 50 minutes. Several elderly people looked very distressed . I love Easyjet but I would never ever travel with them on this route again. I suppose the airport gives budget airlines the worst gates. I was told this is always the gate for UK flights. Not easyjets fault but a nightmare nevertheless.

### easyJet customer review
Yesterday (25-Aug-2013) we flew from Amsterdam to Newcastle. I had one back pack and one handbag at the boarding desk I was told that a passenger should only carry one piece of luggage. So she told me to pay an extra £50 - which I was okay with. We waited in line for the flight (for a very long time +30 mins standing) then I saw many people on the same flight with two huge bags and she did nothing about it. The plane was half empty. I will never fly easyjet again.

Manchester to Bilbao over Easter weekend outbound 29/3/13 return 2/4/13. As I live in Glasgow this is the easiest option for me now to fly to Bilbao. I was impressed by the airport staff it was my first time at Manchester airport and they were very helpful. Both flights were on time. The cabin crew were professional and very friendly. The captain kept us up to date. The seat comfort is good with enough leg space for the 2 hour flight. The return flight cost me just under££223 over Easter Weekend and I only booked 3 weeks before. To me that was money well spent.

CPH-STN EZY 3096 23rd Aug and 25th Aug. Great flight. Easyjet iPhone app was flawless. Comfortable new seats. Friendly and professional staff. A massive improvement since I last used them.

### easyJet customer review
I was so disappointed in attempting to travel with easyJet. On Aug 4 my husband and I arrived 2 hrs 15 minutes early for a flight scheduled from Pisa IT to Paris Orly. We needed to check luggage. Although we could see our flight posted on the overhead Departo signs we searched asked and tried to manage baggage check-in for the next 2 hours. No luck. During that time I asked 3 easyJet employees for help thinking that the Orly flight was an intermediate stop and that I was just missing something in looking at the destination postings for baggage check- in. Staff refused to answer. I also asked other passengers in line. No one knew anything but the Departo signs continued to ask us to use Area "A" which was the area we were calmly/patiently standing according to guides on our tickets. When we finally had our turn to talk with an easyJet baggage attendant he was angry and blamed us for not seeing the flight destination posted. Yet at no time in the 2 + hrs we stood in line waiting to find where to check our baggage in area A was there a Paris posting. The "departo" sign now said "boarding". We had missed the flight. I will not fly easyJet again.

Flew Gatwick to Malta 13th Aug return 20th. Both legs fine. Outbound flight not full so boarding was quick although I must say the girl waving us through to boarding was more keen on getting us out than checking tickets and passports really lax. Plane was delayed 2 hours due to a technical fault. However staff were most professional and pleasant they kept us informed and entertained. The plane was spotlessly clean. Our return was also simple and easy with no hitches whatsoever. The airport was organised and calm (unlike Air Malta) We have given up on speedy boarding as with pre booked seats I don't feel there is a need for it. On our previous flight my son was asked to move from his pre booked seat to accommodate people with young children however this did not happen on either of these flights perhaps Easy Jet have listened to comments on here regarding this matter. I would recommend them.

### easyJet customer review
Southend to Barcelona returning one week later. Overall a very pleasant experience flying from my local airport at Southend and flying Easyjet. Bag drop queue was quick and security a breeze. There was no scrum at the boarding gate as everyone knew where they were sitting thanks to Easyjet's new allocated seating. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient and landed in Barcelona 20 minutes early. Return flight back to Southend was practically the same as the inbound flight quick bag drop queue and security in Barcelona Terminal 2C. This time we were bussed from the gate to the aircraft which was orderly and no scrum. We even had the same cabin manager on this flight as we did on the outbound flight. Landed in Southend 15 minutes early and was back home within 25 minutes after we landed. I definitely be flying Easyjet and flying from Southend again in the near future.

### easyJet customer review
Living in Geneva and in Budapest I have no other choice than to fly easyJet since they are the only one with direct flights. From my 20 last flights with them only positive points were that they were finally on time some staff were friendly and planes are generally clean and well maintained. But all other issues are catastrophic: from the reservation system to the boarding procedures. In Budapest passengers have to walk within fences on the airport field then wait on cattle-like ware-house without seats water toilets or food for minimum 30 minutes.

SXF-RHO. Another stress-free easyjet flight with no harassment about my bag being 1 kilo overweight friendly FAs and tasty food options that were reasonably priced. Better than any so-called "full-service" airline in the US although the price of the ticket was not exactly cheap.

### easyJet customer review
Gatwick to Kefalonia (LGW-KEF). Ticket purchase fairly easy online but printing the boarding pass and online check-in could be made simpler. Due to the early departure I checked my luggage in the night before. Arrived the next morning and saw that at 5.30am they were still full. Shocked that at security at Gatwick I went straight to an x-ray machine! No queues! Eateries rammed as it was the start of the school holidays. Gate announced on time. At the gate they called all those with reserved seats and speedy boarding first. Told to go to the front of the bus and cram in there. Non-priority pax got on the same bus. Longest journey to the plane round the back of the airport and across most of it. At the plane the driver opened only the front door so speedy pax could exit first but as easyJet allocates seats you don't get the disgusting crush and rush as you do on Ryanair. Clean cabin. Thanked by the captain for boarding quickly but then told that the flight was to be delayed due to Air Traffic Control not giving them a slot until 2hrs later! I missed my connecting ferry. Captain came on and said the slot had been pushed back even further to 10am. Crew came down with free water a couple of times. Eventually take off 2 hours late. Fairly uncomfortable for a long flight when you add the extra time on the ground in. Crew were very cheery and professional. The chicken wrap I got had limited fillings and was very dry. The box of crisps were over salty and very oily. Next time I'll buy something at the airport to bring on board. Arriving at Kefalonia we were behind another flight so had to wait to clear immigration a bit and for our bags to arrive. Mine was the last one off! Easyjet are preferable to Ryanair and in some respects to the charter airlines that fly this route so I'd probably fly them again unless the old BMI charter flies again under BA colours.

### easyJet customer review
Bristol to Olbia return on 31st July and 7th August 2013. Once Again I have nothing but praise for Easyjet. Both flights were on time and the crew were extremely friendly and professional. I was especially impressed with the way they took the time to engage with my young children on both flights. On our return flight the air con was producing vapour during take off due to it being so hot outside and the crew made a special announcement just to reassure passengers as some were concerned it was smoke. The captain also warned us to expect turbulence just after take off and took time to explain why it may occur. Whilst seating is rather tight it is no worse than many other airlines and the service is far superior to that of many major scheduled airlines. Snacks and drinks are not badly priced and the coffee is pretty good which is more than can be said for other airlines I have flown with recently. I will definitely be using them again in the near future.

Rome (FCO) to Athens - July 2013. We flew Easy Jet from Rome to Athens and found the overall experience pretty good. The crew were pleasant enough and professional. The airplane while a little dated worked fine with adequate leg room (economy). I believe a small snack was provided for this rather short flight. No on board entertainment again due to it being a short flight. Flight was on time and progressed without any issues. We would fly with Easy Jet again!

### easyJet customer review
Well it's a budget airline and you get what you pay for I suppose. I flew last year from Bristol to Inverness as I often do. I checked to see if the flight was on time before I left and it was. By the time I arrived at the airport it was delayed. So I went online to check the flight status and it still said "on time". I went down to the Easyjet counter on the ground floor to report this (politely at first) and was met by a miserable woman who brushed me off. When I (still politely) persisted she simply ignored me. I then told her (not very politely) that I would report the matter to Easyjet to which she replied she did not work for Easyjet but for another company contracted by Easyjet to handle enquiries! What a nonsense. The flight itself eventually left some time later and arrived without incident. But I made a full report of my experience with their staff at Bristol Airport known to them in writing for which I received an grudging apology.

### easyJet customer review
I am completely appalled by how EasyJet is managed. I brought a tiny rolling suitcase with me to London when I flew there from Nice and on the way back they forced me to pay £40 to check the suitcase. The staff member who forced me to pay was completely unprofessional and told me I wouldn't be flying if I didn't check the bag. I will never fly EasyJet again.

### easyJet customer review
Newcastle to Amsterdam. We found the check in lady unhelpful when we said we would like to put our hand luggage in the hold she said their would be plenty of room onboard as the flight was not full. We were in row 26 and upon boarding there was no room for my daughters luggage and it had to go in an overhead locker at row 3 when telling a crew member where she was sitting they shrugged and said never mind. The staff at Amsterdam airport were much more helpful and pleasant.

LGW-JMK-LGW easyJet now offer a good variety of the Greek Islands in their network and we got a good deal advance purchase of around £250 per person. Arrived at check in for our 6am flight about 90 minutes before expecting huge queues. However the new self check-in desks are spread around and staff directed us to one with few people. There was a bit of a delay getting the system to accept the bags but this may have been user error! Gatwick security an absolute breeze even at this very busy time - through in under 4 minutes and service with a smile. Time for a quick coffee before heading to gate. Onboard warm welcome by a very chipper crew and we were away bang on time. Inflight we were well looked after and arrived early. Return equally good with an especially lovely cabin crew. I genuinely don't understand constant negativity towards easyJet. They offer exceptional value and are reliable and customer focused.

### easyJet customer review
Having never flown with EJ before (by choice) I ended up flying with them 3 times in one week! I was very surprised at how professional everything was. Two out of the three flights were on time although the third one was late and pandemonium ensued at Faro airport. All flights were comfortable the in-flight food and drink was fairly priced and the staff cheerful and attentive. I now would certainly not dismiss EJ when next looking for a flight.

Flown back from Palma de Majorca on the 20th July. First rate service although the queue for bag drop was long although an agent was pushing through passengers held up with pending flights. Aircraft very new crew obliging informative and professional. Flight on time departing good seat pitch and not totally full. Despite the best efforts of the flight crew shaving time off the flight time ATC congestion meant we were late landing not their fault. Would always choose Easyjet as my preferred LCC please move back to Stansted for Faro flights.

Flew to Prague on 14/01/2013 the bag drop was good plenty of desks the boarding was chaotic no preference to speedy boarding. The girl just opened the door to the walk to the plane and shouted boarding now and walked away - as a result it was chaos. Outward flight very good but extra leg room not as good as Ryanair. Return flight on 17/07/2013 a complete nightmare bag drops desk completely unable to handle the number of passengers no priority boarding. Asked for a cold beer in flight and was told they were warm as they had not enough storage to have cold drinks although they offered to put ice cubes in the beer! Overall not a patch on Ryanair.

July 8th 2013. Flew from Bristol - Nice and back on an easyjet holiday family package. Could not fault the service as it exceeded our expectations from a budget airline. Flights both on time airport transfers brilliant and the hotel was excellent value for the money. I am a very nervous flyer so paid for allocated seating by exits and this also entitled us to speedy boarding which was a bonus and saved any additional stress. First time we used easyjet but will definitely use them again next year.

Flew Paphos - Manchester and then Gatwick - Larnaca. Flights on time excellent staff who were nice and polite on both flights and food and beverages were good. The plane was very bumpy at some points and a noise like the one when the seat belt sound appears kept being made every few minutes which was annoying and a bit more legroom would have been better as I felt squished. Overall it was 2 ok flights.

### easyJet customer review
Cagliari to Milan. Issues started before checking luggage in: I purchased priority boarding and priority check-in option to have enough time to eat something but the baggage drop started 30 min late and they didn't setup a priority counter which meant I had to wait for 1 hour. The whole boarding procedure was a complete mess: boarding gate was not clearly specified and the signs were not updated. They took the people with priority boarding outside on a mini bus 25 min before the aircraft was ready and they left us in the mini bus under the sun with broken air conditioning. On the aircraft we had to wait 1 hour. 1 additional hour while certain passengers were offloaded. Would not recommend.

Had an excellent EZ experience on flights from Gatwick to Mykonos and return which we bought in March for less than££200. Planes clean and punctual customer service excellent so much better than the dreaded Ryan Air if you need a budget airline. Noting to fault the flight at all really other than the normal lack of legroom. We checked in straight away without queuing at both ends and there was no Ryan Air boarding rugby scrum. All very civilised and very impressed.

### easyJet customer review
Monday 1st July - departing Glasgow at 19.55 arriving Gatwick 21.20. EZY894. I am fed up with the poor standards of customer service from Easyjet. Everything is geared towards themselves rather than the passenger it would appear we are there for their convenience not the other way around. I am fed up of standing around (particularly at Glasgow) when the board is flashing final call and yet we have not moved a millimetre onto the aircraft. Having encouraged us all now to take hand luggage rather than pay the exorbitant prices to put luggage into the hold they are now using gestapo like techniques to force you to put it into the hold as the flights are full. This latest ploy now - no check in staff - is another example of poor customer service. Their flights are no longer cheap and the seat/leg room is nothing short of ridiculous.

### easyJet customer review
Moscow Domodedovo-London Gatwick. Like the outbound journey a week before baggage drop was far too long! Over an hour! The most frustrating thing being the Easyjet Plus desk was open and hardly being used! Also I really don't understand why on both flights I had to carry my bag across the airport to "oversized baggage" when it wasn't and I wasn't charged extra. In flight crew were lovely really warm and friendly. They were having problems with my card while purchasing beverages but were patient. Flight was slightly delayed on way out (airport's fault not Ryanair) but made up for time and arrived early.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-GVA-LGW. Outward flight was with an easyJet Switzerland A319 which was older and was showing its age with the seat in front not being able to stay in any position apart from fully reclined. Return was on a newer A320 and the removal of the ability to recline made the flight much more comfortable. There was a huge queue at both London Gatwick and Geneva at bag drop and the boarding process is still a mess due to easyJet's new hand baggage guarantee making people rush to avoid having their bags placed in the hold. However they are still very good value for money and travelling without a hold bag would eliminate the problem with the bag drop queue.

I travelled on Tuesday July 9th from Liverpool to Bordeaux. Usually fly from Manchester as I live 4 miles from this airport. I was not looking forward to travelling by train from Stockport to Liverpool. Easy transfer from Liverpool Parkway to the Airport. The biggest joy was the airport itself - so clean and laid back. Easyjet staff were so helpful.

### easyJet customer review
Flew from Geneva Switzerland to Venice Italy. Had a good first experience. The rest of my flights with them were horrible. Second flight I flew from Milan Italy to Paris and I could not believe how rude the staff were. I thought maybe it was just a bad day for them so I used them again flying from London to Aberdeen Scotland. Again the staff were even more difficult to work with. The person I traveled with and I both had 2 bags each which was a mess in itself. Each of us had one bag and then one carry on however mine was a little bit bigger than the cart you have to put it in. All they needed to tell me was that I needed to pay extra for baggage and weight and I would have been more than happy to pay the extra. However they made a huge deal about it and were so incredibly rude in front of everyone. I could not believe the lack of customer service.

### easyJet customer review
I flew on EZY6419/20 on 28/06 and 05/07. Both were fantastic flights from NCL to ALC. The 6419 was delayed by 1.5 hrs due to crew sickness but everyone was kept well informed managed to arrive into ALC only 30 minutes late. The flight on 05/07 was fantastic and we arrived into NCL 25 minutes early. The Captain was the same one on both journeys and he was excellent and very informative. His scenery commentary on the 6420 was top notch! The Cabin Crew were excellent and helpful on both legs and the seat pitch considering the fact I'm just over 6ft was pretty good and even better than TOM and TCX on short haul. I wouldn't hesitate using Easyjet again.

### easyJet customer review
London Gatwick-Moscow Domodedovo. Extremely cheap fare flight uneventful and average aside from ridiculous queue of over an hour at bag drop also it seemed anyone going to Moscow had to have their visa number personally read to an Easyjet supervisor by phone which was strange and caused a huge wait.

### easyJet customer review
Geneva - London 11th June Flight U28463. Flight delayed 5 hours. On-ground staff couldnt care less. As a compensation I got a voucher which was not even enough to buy a sandwich and a drink. On-board staff were negative and not caring about passengers having a good flight experience. They acted like a nasty teacher at school reprimanding everyone. I fly a lot with many airlines but from the overall experience this one is honestly the worst. Avoid if you can - especially when often they are not the cheapest!

### easyJet customer review
Booked on a flight from Madrid to Lyon on Tuesday 2 July which was scheduled to leave at 1.15. After boarding the pilot informed us that the plane was defective and we were offloaded. 7 hours later we boarded a plane which had been flown from Gatwick. Apart from being given a 9 euro refreshment voucher which we queued for one hour to receive after seeing a line forming there was no information from ground staff. No attempt made to find alternative flights. We spent 9 hours in Madrid airport and I received an emailed standard feedback form which allowed me 50 characters to write my comments. Ground staff were rude to passengers at both boardings shouting at passengers about their hand luggage. I was extremely unimpressed that there was such little concern for the welfare of passengers. We lost a day of a very precious holiday arrived at our hotel in Lyon at 11.00pm.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-DME. Check in was very slow only 4 people at the desks for a huge line of people but check in staff were very helpful. Checks at the boarding gate was also very slow as was the boarding process but when we were eventually on board staff was very helpful and the flight was good.

### easyJet customer review
Flight was fine but bag drop (we checked in online) was dreadful. We arrived 2.5 hours before departure. No staff were at the bag drop before 1hr 50 mins before departure by which time there was a huge queue (back to the door of the terminal). At the beginning only two desks were manned and it took us over an hour to get to the front of the queue. However once our bags had been tagged we had to join a further huge queue with our bags to put them on a conveyor belt! The staff were rude and disinterested. Fortunately the security staff and passport control were quick and efficient and then we had to queue again to get into the gate. The gate had virtually no chairs and we ended up standing and queuing for over 2 hours. In fact the only free time we stole for ourselves was 5 minutes to go to the toilet. A truly awful experience. Very disappointed in Easyjet. Flight EZ5014 (Bordeaux - Gatwick) BOD-LGW.

London Stansted to Split 18th June 2013 returning 25th June. Boringly efficient and on time. Just about enough leg room. Only fly in the ointment was the theft of my wife's shoes from the security carousel at Stansted: good job we were hand baggage passengers so could replace them immediately.

### easyJet customer review
LTN-CPH. My 2nd flight with Easyjet in a short space of time and equally impressed. On-time departure and arrival into Copenhagen's GO Terminal. Very full flight so crew asked passengers to check their bags (for free obviously) to preserve space on board. I don't think anyone was forced to do so. Very friendly service on board the GO Terminal at CPH is very convenient for connections and the price at 30 Euros was just excellent. No comparison with Ryanair Easyjet is nicer to fly than SAS on the same route in fact!

17 June EZY5453 London Gatwick to Paphos Dep 07.40. Arr 14.15. Returning Friday 28 June EZY 5454. As regular fliers to Cyprus we used the country's own carrier which we thought the best. For their own reasoning it is now difficult and expensive to use so we tried a charter airline then easyJet. EasyJet wins. Very helpful pleasant check in staff at Gatwick. Easy security. Contact with Captain on board who was professional but had a sense of humour. Excellent cabin crew. Good food good service. Our choice for the future.

Flight EZY1974 Paphos to Manchester 21.55 21st June 2013. Travelled with my mother and 7 year old son after an extra weeks stay due to illness. Quick and easy check in on time take off and early arrival back into Manchester. Aircraft was clean with adequate leg room. My gripe is that the flight had around 25 English soldiers flying back to the UK! I have to say the majority were absolutely fine but we had 3 sat in front of us throughout the flight were joined by another friend that stood up directly at the side of me for me for the first 3 hours of the flight. I am all for having a good time but the steady flow of alcohol that was served then lead to disgusting language being used! I spoke to the stewardess about asking the man to sit down in his seat but was told that there was not much they could do. I felt she completely dismissed my comments and was not even willing to speak to them about their language. There should be a cut off point where alcohol is no longer served!

### easyJet customer review
First time flying with easyjet to Madeira from Lisbon. Arrived at the airport very quick to drop our bags off at the desk quickly got through security up to the gate. No rush for boarding like in some other low cost carriers mainly due to the fact that our seats are pre allocated. Plane was almost full however boarding and departure time were not delayed and we got to Funchal nice and early. Onboard crew was nice and made us feel welcome. Onboard food has got to be purchased however most products are quite affordable and of good quality (very tasty muffins by the way). Would definitely recommend this airline and will fly with them again in the future.

EZY5243 from London Gatwick South to Palermo Sicily on 11 June 2013. EZY8568 from Catania (Sicily) to London Gatwick North on 19th June 2013. I have previously read such rubbish reviews about easyjet and was apprehensive when our tour company used Easyjet for our flights. I was pleasantly surprised. From the online check in to baggage drop at the airport and then boarding. No hiccups. What a pleasure. The plane was almost new very clean and leg room sufficient. The cabin crew were courteous polite and extremely professional. On flight home I was taken ill and the cabin crew could not do enough for me.

### easyJet customer review
FNC-LIS-FNC. Easyjet always provides an excellent product for what is paid. Flights on time and professional crew. Much better than its disorganized main competitor. Will always fly with them on this route. The only thing that worries me is their new policy of baggage beginning July 2013 as they will restrict the size a little bit more.

### easyJet customer review
I arrived at the bag drop queue at Liverpool John Lennon airport at 15.30 for a 17.50 flight (Sunday 16th June). When I joined the queue there were about 70 people ahead of me and only one person a young man who was doing his best and to his credit remained very calm on duty the other staff member being on the Speedy Boarding desk. The queue moved very slowly and was growing I estimated about 120 in total just before they opened a second bag drop desk about 5 minutes before I reached the front after a wait of just under 50 minutes which is completely unacceptable. This complaint is not about the staff concerned but about management who had not foreseen the staffing level required. The number of departures and passengers departing are a known quantity and as far as I am aware there was no unusual circumstance so this is just poor planning or cost saving at the expense of the customer. I travel easyJet a lot sometimes 5 or six flights a month and rarely have cause to complain.

BRS-KRK. Flew to Krakow with Easyjet from Bristol. Online check in was straightforward and there were plenty of communications by email prior to the departure date. Check in at the airport was easy to drop our bag off. The plane was very clean and I was surprised at the amount of leg room we had. As the flight wasn't full the cabin crew allowed us to move seats so we had rows to ourselves. There was a good selection of items to purchase on board priced relatively the same as other airlines. The flights there and back left on time and we have absolutely no complaints with Easyjet whatsoever. We have used them quite a lot in the past and previous experiences have been equally as good.

### easyJet customer review
MAN-ATH and back. Never flying with them again unless I have to. The aircraft was an Airbus A320. The flight seemed cheap at first but the total was awful. They charged us for our baggage they charged us for in-flight services. There wasn't any in flight entertainment (which is usual on short haul flights). We look now and we can flight 3 flights (one journey) with Swiss and Lufthansa on the ATH-MAN route cheaper than non-stop with easyJet.

### easyJet customer review
I am writing this on behalf of my aunt who only just flew from Gatwick to Moscow. We arrived at Gatwick nearly 2 hours before the flight to be greeted by a huge queue to check in bags we had to join. I guessed early on that the queue was pointless as there was no way anyone could get through it in time for the flight. The check in staff were just calling people out of the queue just before their flight closed. We had about 5 minutes to check in the bags before the flight closed. I had paid for an extra bag through the web site. Not having used Easyjet for several years I assumed all would be well. But no buying an extra bag does not mean you have extra weight allowance. Told to speak to the supervisor and come back. As we came back we were told the flight had closed. In the end we went back to the supervisor and he managed to get her onto the flight minus the extra bag. I will never fly with them again.

### easyJet customer review
I flew one way to Vienna on the 26th May from Gatwick. Flight schedule was convenient at 16.55. The check in is great you are able to do so 30 days before your flight. To reserve your preferred seat cost me just £3. The downside was the boarding with people really being crammed into the shuttle bus to the aircraft. However the flight was good but delayed by around 15/20 minutes. The crew were professional. Good variety of refreshments. Baggage reclaim was quick. I would recommend EasyJet as they have become a much more modern and generally pleasant airline.

### easyJet customer review
We were booked on EZY8352 from Nice to Gatwick on Tuesday 12th June which was due to depart at 12.35. Due to the French air traffic control strike we were delayed until 8pm at night. Easyjet staff in Nice could not have been more helpful and we were treated well. When we eventually boarded our flight the captain explained that they had had a troublesome customer in London who had to be removed from the aeroplane and that meant they were further delayed and missed their slot into Nice. Staff on the flight were wonderful considering they had had a long and stressful day. When we arrived at Gatwick we had missed our connection but EasyJet again came up trumps and put us up for the night free of charge in a hotel. The information desk at Gatwick had not informed us about this and it was only by chance we found out as we thought we would be spending the night on one of the airport benches! EasyJet get a lot of bad press but I can't praise them enough.

### easyJet customer review
My fiancé and I few to Marco Polo Airport in Venice Italy from London Gatwick. We were in an emergency exit row with me at the window and her in the middle. After take off I slid up the window blinder as it was a day flight and I didn't want the sun in my eyes. The blinder stuck and I was unable to slide it down for landing. As we approached Venice we came within 100-200 feet of the ground then pulled up and out of the landing. The co- captain came over the speaker saying 'the pilot decided not to land and there would be more information shortly. After another fifteen minutes of circling Italy we landed. On the way back we'd noticed that every EasyJet flight was running 15-20 minutes late and every flight had it's gate moved. Our flight went from Gate 19 to Gate 28 for example. After sitting and waiting to board we were jammed into a bus and driven out to the plane. Waiting for takeoff I turned on the air blower above the seat and the panel fell down. The attendants fixed it but that is not at all comforting as you're about to fly. On the flight home I rolled my window blinder up and it stuck again. The flights were loud the seats didn't recline. The in-flight reading had to be purchased though a catalogue of duty-free items was in the seat-back.

Just returned from Malaga with easyjet unfortunately due to a French air traffic control strike we were delayed however our captain kept us all informed and regularly updated on our flight situation. The crew were exceptional and nothing was a problem.. After boarding we were all given water and then anyone who wanted was given a complimentary drink.

### easyJet customer review
I think the biggest issue with Easyjet is the unlimited hand baggage allowance. Easyjet are now making announcements asking passengers to volunteer to put their baggage in the hold free of charge. How can overhead lockers cope with unlimited weight? This is stupid beyond belief. You have passengers sticking 15 kilos in their hand baggage to save buying hold baggage. Did Easyjet really not see the absolutely obvious outcome of this policy. I constantly see passengers having to move items from hold baggage to hand baggage to avoid additional charges. Sort it out Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
Having flown Easyjet since 2005 I can certainly say they have gone downhill. What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair. I will not be looking to fly with them again any time soon if this trend continues!

First flight Paris Orly - Rome May 22. We stood for boarding for over an hour before being told incoming aircraft was 20 minutes late. Passengers were still getting off plane when we were on jetway and we had to stop for another 5 minutes. Took an hour to get luggage. If it could get any worse next flight Venice-CDG (1.30 hour flight) June 8th was supposed to board at 8.40 pm. Due to a crew change we did not board aircraft until 2.30am arriving 4.30am June 9th! Over 6 hours delay with everyone pretty much spending the night in the airport. Consolation: Food voucher.

### easyJet customer review
Flew to Athens and back didn't pay a bargain basement price either and yet the price kept hiking up further with every turn. When we arrived at Gatwick we had to pay an extra £100 for the 2 cases we had. I hadn't interpreted the message on the website correctly and assumed the charge option was given if travellers wanted to take more than the usual one suitcase per person so I ignored the option to pay for luggage online. Before the trip I received an email saying the return flight time was changed to a late flight (with no alternatives) so thought I'd pay another £16 online for extra leg room so we could sleep more comfortably. Got to Athens check in and even though we had no extra weight we were asked to transfer stuff into hand luggage. I told them I had paid for extra leg room for the flight and they had no record of this either unfortunately for us I had paid this extra online so I had no receipt. I attempted to sort it out and was told to go to see a woman on the reservations desk. I crossed the airport and was met by the most arrogant obnoxious woman I have encountered in a customer service role. It was clear I was going to get nothing and nowhere.

### easyJet customer review
Flew RT from Paris Orly to Rome FCO. Flight was on-time but service was lacking. This is a "no-frills" airline and you pay for everything. Snacks/drinks onboard are extra and pilot flies through turbulence instead of around to save fuel and you're limited to one carry-on bag. Even though we did online check-in we were still made to wait with all other passengers checking their luggage so that the baggage Gestapo could nail us for extra bag fees. My wife had a purse plus a carry-on bag so they hit us for 30 Euros. Spend a little more and fly with dignity.

### easyJet customer review
Flight FCO-MXP May 28th 2013. It has been one of the worst experiences no information in the airport. Only the crew onboard said what was happening! At the time of boarding (when finally staff in the airport had to show themselves) staff were rude. I am a frequent Easyjet flyer and I'm changing my mind (fare and getting comparable to other airlines and services were once good now are worsening and assistance is pitiful).

### easyJet customer review
We returned from Munich yesterday after the worse flight we have ever had we booked seats with extra legroom as my husband has sciatica and needs extra room as soon as we entered the plane we were told that we would be putting the plane at risk by sitting in our booked seats. When we complained we were treated in a very arrogant and rude manner by the cabin crew who seemed to think our plight was very amusing. There was no apology and no alternative seats offered. The plane was also old and scruffy. This was our first and last flight with easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
I travel regularly (once a month) ALC/LGW return and cannot fault Easyjet. Bag drop off at Gatwick is easy and quick cabin crew always friendly and helpful and the planes are clean. I like the fact that the hand luggage weight is unlimited. The only bugbear I have is that when booking a return flight and hold baggage is required one way only you have to call Easyjet to do this as the system is not able to book one-way hold baggage. As a regular traveller with Easyjet would also be nice if they offered some sort of frequent flyer reward (rather than offering Easyjet Plus for £149/year) on similar lines to the Vantage Club with Monarch.

### easyJet customer review
LGW to Fuerteventura and back. Trip out: At check-in / bag drop there was a n long queue despite the so called bag drop being quicker. As far as I can see this online service is just a way for the airline to save costs and printer ink. Check in took just as long as other airlines despite having my pre-booked seats and pre-printed boarding passes. I had to pay £50 fee to "check in" 2 cases as it turns out I hadn't completed the process properly. Around 40 minutes to do this. Boarding was chaotic at LGW with speedy board passengers sitting all over the plane and creating congestion with the non speedy board passengers. 30 mins late on take off. Crew were fine and polite. Food was just ok (at an extra charge). On return flight their web site wouldn't let me check in the hold baggage so had to call customer services from Spain who told me as I hadn't booked direct with them it could only be changed by my travel company or by phone with them. Charged £28 to "check in" 2 hold bags. Return: Long wait at bag drop in Fuerteventura. Check in was quite slow and boarding was chaotic. Despite handing over my pre printed boarding pass I was issued with a new one at the bag drop which rather defeats the object of the so called online service. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Plane arrived on time. Total extra charges for trip amounted to around £118 for hold baggage and food. Not good in my opinion.

London Luton to Bordeaux (Billi Terminal) 22 May 2013 13.00. Return Bordeaux (Billi Terminal) to London Luton 26 May 2013 16.10. I couldn't pre-book check-in baggage for the return flight only. When I arrived to the airport I was charged for £25/€30 to check in my bag. Even if the website doesn't allow you to pre-book your baggage on one flight if you book a round trip (£187 + £25) it would be better to book another airline. On an anther flight I had no food and beverages on board as the service was too slow so they couldn't save me before landing. I spent 1hr 20mins with no drinks.

### easyJet customer review
Have travelled on numerous occasions with Easyjet in the past. I hope I never have to travel with them again. Went to Amsterdam last Friday 24 May on 10.10 am flight. Had booked in one piece of luggage and we had a small trolley case. Check in staff told us to put case in size gauge. We had no worries as this piece of luggage was used in March to travel with easyjet to Geneva. We were wrong as the wheels were not fully in gauge and we had then to pay £25. We were angry and embarrassed re this. As we waited to be checked in not one other passenger was asked to even remove their luggage off trolley just us! Spoke to supervisor on site waste of time as expected. She just said she would ensure all staff were advised to check size of hand baggage. This didn't happen. Any way the case was classed as hand luggage on our return trip.

### easyJet customer review
Only complaint about this cheap flight to Nice was the bag drop at Stansted. Only two sites were open then after about 20 minutes another two which meant that with few staff a very long queue of anxious people including myself took around 50 minutes just to drop off the luggage and although we were on time getting to the airport it only left a short time to grab a sandwich from Pret before making our way to board. I recommend at least 2.5 hours with this system so that it gives you more breathing time. Coming back via Nice Airport was a delight - they had 10 baggage drop off sites and it only took about 15 minutes - Easyjet get your act together!

LGW-LPA-LGW - 20th May 2013 - Flew easyjet on holiday to Gran Canaria. Lovely modern clean plane and very friendly crew. Arrived early baggage already waiting in the arrivals area after disembarking. So efficient. Only thing that really let them down was the queuing at London Gatwick's North Terminal to drop our luggage in. We printed our boarding cards at home but still queued for almost an hour at Gatwick to check bags in. Very slow service and only 4 desks open of a possible 20. Staff were available calling customers on flights departing before ours so that was something but more staff required at bag drop for sure! Certainly didn't deter me from flying easyjet again though.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-Dubrovnik return. I agree with the last few comments now easyJet has allocated seating it is a much better experience. Both flights were a few minutes late departing (air traffic congestion according to pilots) but arrived on time. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. A good experience at least equal to that offered by many 'traditional' airlines.

### easyJet customer review
Flown twice with EJ in recent months (BRS-BCN-BRS and BRS-KRK-BRS). The new seat allocation process is fantastic such a massive improvement. Both flights were early taking off and landing (even allowing for the padding in the flight times). Nice plane and good flight crew and seats are comfortable enough for a 2 to 3 hour flight. EJ are now approaching BA as a premium airline. Since we use them 3 or 4 times a year I am more than pleased with the changes and would recommend them highly.

### easyJet customer review
LTN to Sharm. Travelled with infant so joined speedy boarding queue on both flights. Outbound flight was ok as there were a few empty seats so that gave us a bit more room. Few gripes on the inbound flight. The first been that they ran out of hot food and virtually everything else by the time they reached us in row 17 and the second been that despite there been a number of babies/kids on board they still insisted on putting the cabin lights on when a lot of people were asleep to do another trolley run. I understand there is a business need but a bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss. Legroom wasn't too bad given that I am 6'4". I just wish the cost of flights to Sharm would be a bit more reasonable with Easyjet especially when flights to Dubai are so much less with other airlines.

SEN-FAO-SEN. 2 great flights especially now you have allocated seating better late than never. My only gripe is please stop calling passengers for boarding (at SEN) when the aircraft isn't ready to board and you are stuck in the freezing cold for 10 minutes. Carry on with making flying enjoyable again it really is getting back to the good old days.

Flew to Malaga and back. We booked speedy boarding which is an excellent idea. Lovely nearly new aircraft polite and efficient cabin and flight crew. Will always try to fly with them again. To those who complain about missing a check in or gate - it is your responsibility to turn up and allow sufficient time to get through security etc and to the gate this varies at each airport and the time of day - it is not the responsibility of the airline!

Manchester to Alicante. Have flown with many airlines but this was a first with easyJet. The cabin crew and service were fantastic and they were always smiling and friendly. The plane was very clean better than some more expensive airlines and I would definitely fly with them again. A nice start to my holiday.

AMS-NCL-AMS. Both full flights but the job was very well done. Paid 170 for 2 incl. one bag which was almost half the price of KLM at almost the same departure times. Friendly crew - also at drop off no constant harassment with product selling like Ryanair on time performance and fair prices for drinks. EasyJet shows that low cost travel doesn't mean you want to be treated like cattle.

BEG-MXP-BEG. First time flying with easyJet it was a really good experience. The easyJet-terminal 2 at MXP is a separate from the rest of the airport but with all the regular facilities. Travelled with hand luggage only. Both flights were full still the boarding was smooth and effective. Allocated seating was good as there is no rush experienced with other low costers did not pay extra to get the option to choose the seats yourself but it would be great if they offered at least a few seats per flight to choose from without extra charge like regular carriers. Legroom was ok for a budget airline . Italian crew were good only tried some snacks and wine price was ok. Quite cheap ticket so really good value for the money. Recommended.

### easyJet customer review
First the Easybus service was nightmare as we weren't able to get on the right bus as it was late and when it arrived my kids and I couldn't get on. When we got to the airport we were forced to pay £25 for luggage being 1 kg over weight. If that was British airways that would be fine. For the flight you have to pay for food which the prices are ridiculous and the food isn't that amazing. 1 year prior to this occasion my kids and I had to fly to Spain and unfortunately Easyjet messed up our booking and we had to miss a weeding! My advice is only go on Easyjet for a weekend out with your friends other than that better fly on British Airways or another airline.

LGW-RAK-LGW and as ever an excellent experience with a polished airline that some people still love to slate normally because they don't bother to read the T&C's of travel! Outbound on a clean A320 with great crew left on time and arrive 30 mins early. Coming home an A319 which left 10 mins late but still arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule. Allocated seating GREAT and crew again happy and attentive. I think easyJet are still way ahead of the game even compared to holy grail of BA! Reading other peoples negative reviews makes me laugh because they haven't read their terms and conditions of travel - that's hardly easyJets fault! Great airline great service and normally great crew - and always at a great price.

### easyJet customer review
They sold me 4 one-way flights instead of 2 flying out and 2 return between Rome and Basel. The 14th I flew out to Basel. On the 15th I showed up at Basel and they explained I had tickets to fly out of Rome again - without ever returning of course! No problem they allowed me to either change the two tickets for 289 euro or throw out the old ticket and buy two new for 279 E!

### easyJet customer review
Refused to check me in to my flight from Paris Orly to Nice because I arrived at the check-in desk 43 minutes before the flight. Forced me to buy a pair of new airline tickets at a cost of 150 euros on the next flight. I was in line for 13 minutes. At the next flight I made it through security in 8 minutes. They didn't start boarding until 18 minutes before departure. Forced my husband to pay 30 euros at check-in because his carryon was 1.8 cm taller than their published standard threatened to charge us 50 euros if we took it to the gate. My carryon passed at check-in and at the gate they tried to force me to check it for 50 euros because it would not fall all the way into the baggage sizer of its own force. First experience with EasyJet will be my last.

### easyJet customer review
Very happy with my flight to and from Geneva which I make 2 or 3 times a year. I didn't pre-book seats as I saw no point in the extra cost. My hand luggage was put in hold free as not enough space in upper lockers. This was fine as I then did not need to cart my baggage around with me. My return flights included my grandson aged 4. Twice on trips he has been invited into the cock pit for a photo. when at Gatwick and parked.

### easyJet customer review
Luton to Belfast International. I paid extra to pick my seat. There was a biting cold wind with gusts to 50mph. Boarding was really slow so I got to stand around on open steps for several minutes whilst people got their stuff packed. When I got on board my carefully chosen window seat turned out to be next to a screaming baby. I swapped with one of the parents so I was then one row away from a screaming baby. On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat. However with Easyjet if I am queuing outside I want everyone onboard and seated as soon as possible. When I've got a choice I will use some other airline.

ATH-MAN-ATH 28/4 - 08/5. All flights on time or slightly early. Got 3 seats together without having to pay extra. Boarding easy for both flights. Check-in quick. All in all good experience and as I booked the flights months in advance very good value for money.

### easyJet customer review
On my way back from Berlin I missed my flight although I checked-in on time. Security check at Schonefeld airport was so tight so after I passed it - it was impossible to reach the gate on time. The gate number was 34 (out of 35 gates) and it was located about a mile away from the security check point. When I reached the gate - it was already closed. There were no announcements from airport speakers nobody tried to find out what had happened to me. The check-in desk closes 40 minutes before the flight and as per EasyJet's customer support explanations - it is my duty to reach the gate on time (30 minutes before the flight). To reach the gate in 10 minutes (if you've checked in 41 minutes before the flight) is impossible in this airport! I do think that EasyJet flights from this airport suffer from very bad organization!

### easyJet customer review
Flew Gatwick-Gibraltar on 10th April 2013 had to board via the stairs and not the airbridge at the North Terminal making us about 3 mins late. Seats were fine and legroom ok for a short flight Snacks and refreshments were priced ok and so was the duty free. Crew were friendly. Landed 10 Minutes early. Return Gibraltar-Gatwick 12th April 2013 boarded via stairs again but that's the only way to board in Gibraltar turns out it was the exact same A319 aircraft we came out on! Just as we were about to pushback a 15 minute delay due to paperwork quite lucky as the Monarch A320 to Luton had a 3.5 hour delay! Seats were fine and legroom ok like outbound snacks and refreshments priced ok and so was the duty free. Crew were friendly. Landed 4 minutes late. Overall I would fly easyjet again as they are cheap and get you from A to B efficiently!

### easyJet customer review
LGW-LPA-LGW. April 2013 - To be honest I wish BA would start flying to LPA direct as it would make things much easier but as it stands you've got either easyjet or ryanair and I would say (after many flights) that easyjet does have the advantage on this route by a small margin.

### easyJet customer review
London Gatwick-Inverness return. Excellent experience flights pretty much on time cabin crew friendly and helpful. The new pre allocated seating is a vast improvement and no longer an uncivilised scrum when boarding. We didn't pay extra but still got seats together. As long as the price and service is right we will happily continue to fly Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
Luton to Faro and return. Bag drop off very good no waiting at Luton but a longer wait at Faro to check in. Both flights on time aircraft clean and comfortable for leg room given. Cabin crew pleasant and regular information from flight deck. Will use again.

### easyJet customer review
Flew with Easyjet from Gatwick to Madrid and then back again from Madrid to Gatwick on 18/4/12 and 22/4/13. Excellent service good flight times very impressed love the pre-seat booking - makes travelling much easier. Good cabin crew and all in all a very professional service from Easyjet. Would not hesitate to use them again.

### easyJet customer review
Booked Easyjet flight to Tenerife. Booked extra legroom both ways. Got it on the outgoing journey in seats 1A/B/C/D. But there was some complaints behind us as 8 people had booked extra legroom in rows 12 and 13. But the aircraft was changed since they booked and rows 12 and 13 were no longer extra legroom. I was a little concerned as I had booked those extra legroom on the return journey ! I thought it was a blip but you guessed it - the aircraft was also changed on the return journey and our seats were no longer extra legroom. There were 8 other people who were disappointed to. Now interestingly the cabin crew confirmed to us that this was not a last minute change of aircraft as it was shown on their schedule since they were issued some considerable time before. Therefore it seems obvious to me that if Easyjet can't fill a larger aircraft then they put on a smaller one and ignore those passengers who have paid for extra legroom seats which don't exist on the smaller plane. So beware booking an Easyjet flight and booking seats too far in advance because they seem to change aircraft a bit more frequently than you would think.

### easyJet customer review
I flew to Faro on the 9th April from Gatwick using easyjet for the first time in a few years and found it an excellent service the staff at the airport and on the flight were first class and the pilot was standing at the front of the aircraft once everyone had boarded. The flight was early arriving and the pilot once again stood at the front to say goodbye to passengers. Will definitely be using easyjet again.

### easyJet customer review
INV-LGW purchased a seat at the front of the aircraft for faster entry and exit. Worth the few extra pounds. Cabin crew were very friendly and the food was more than acceptable. Flight delayed by 30 minutes which was annoying as missed connecting trains at Gatwick. Overall a positive experience. Seats comfy aircraft clean. Much better experience now with allocated seating.

### easyJet customer review
Just flown easyjet from Luton to Tel Aviv and return and I was very happy with them after having avoided Easyjet for quite a few flights because of the stampede for the plane but now they have gone for allocated seating which is pre-bookable now and very reasonable priced. The staff were very good and the plane although one of the more recent to the fleet was nice and clean. The leg room was also good having said that I am 5'6 but my knees were not banging against the seat in front. They also boarded nice and early so everyone had plenty of time to get to there seat.

### easyJet customer review
With seat allocation a good airline just got better. London Gatwick to Geneva with a Swiss crew who were charming and helpful and efficient. Boarding well organised and unstressful. Return on a very busy Airbus 320 and a bit less calm. People claiming not to know they had allocated seats had to be shunted around the cabin but we still got away on time. Great short haul product at a good price. What's not to like?

### easyJet customer review
EasyJet are getting better. Just flew to Geneva and back paid for premium seats and speedy boarding (it wasn't that much extra) and it was well worth it. Does what it says on the tin!

### easyJet customer review
London Gatwick to Rome Fiumicino family of four. No bags checked so we went straight to the gate. Boarding started on time take off was on time and we arrived 15 minutes earlier. Perfect flight really. You don't get as much leg space as you would get with British Airways but for a 2 hours flight is absolutely fine. Seats needed some attention but overall appearance was good. No concerns over aircraft safety anyhow. Cabin crew was polite and helpful aircrew kept updated regularly (more than other major carriers do). Overall as usual very satisfied with Easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
My wife and I recently went on holiday to Malta booking the flights and extra length seats online through EasyJet. This coupled with the rapid check-in and boarding was completely hassle free with the flight time out and return being on time. All the staff throughout were efficient and courteous making our holiday experience relaxing enjoyable and stress free.

### easyJet customer review
London Gatwick to Edinburgh International and back on the same day. Generally ok flight from Gatwick to Edinburgh was late by 3 minutes however the flight back was delayed 30 minutes. However staff were helpful and friendly in getting information to passengers. Despite having little leg room the seats were comfortable and fine for a short flight. Food was ok. I gave a zero for Inflight Entertainment because there was none. The price was fantastic at least £20 cheaper than British Airways (on an equivalent flight). In general a good experience. don't expect them to be on time or to be as good as the more pricier companies but for a short flight (anything less than 3 hours) you really can't go wrong.

LGW to Marrakech return on A320. Both flights arrived on time. Service was reasonable as you get what you pay. Newish aircraft's.

### easyJet customer review
Malaga to LGW LGW to Nice return. On time on all 4 flights no problems with the flight. The problem is the airports. At Malaga we were sent down the ramp and then had to wait about 10 minutes while the previous passengers disembarked. We were right behind large glass panels and the sun was baking! No way to shelter. At LGW Easyjet has a sort of add-on terminal which is at least 400 yards along endless corridors from the exit into the main terminal. It carries the numbers from 100 upward and most North Terminal Easyjet flights use it. For anyone who finds walking less than pleasant it is a long way!

### easyJet customer review
I fly regularly between Amsterdam and Luton. Except during ash clouds and extreme weather the flights were punctual. Pity about the extra charge for credit card payment. Only train tickets to London via first capitol connect for sale in the plane pity as people are not aware that if they get in the wrong train they will have to pay again. Also other destinations eg Bedford not for sale in cabin. A shuttlebus to the railway station don't forget to buy your ticket for this in advance! Only plane tickets bought far in advance can be had for a reasonable price at the last minute very expensive. However this is a good airline if you are travelling to the Luton area London or using the railway service from Parkway. Overall I am a satisfied customer and would recommend easyjet.

### easyJet customer review
LIS-EDI 13/04/13. Half hour delay in departure due to incoming flight experiencing high head wind. This was explained by captain once boarded and as promised lost time was recovered as same wind considerably shortened time in air to Edinburgh. Clean plane smooth flight and pleasant crew. Easyjet now offer broad range of destinations from Edinburgh and will happily use them again.

### easyJet customer review
After reading previous posts was pleasantly surprised. CDG-VCE chose speedy boarding. Priority check-in and priority boarding. Crew extremely professional and helpful. Comfortable courteous on time easy. Would use them again.

### easyJet customer review
Flight was fine but the check in was appalling I got charged a fortune for a second piece of luggage - a camera less than 6x4x4 - but women with much larger handbags were allowed to take them on the plane in addition to their cabin bags. Customer service dreadful - utterly useless - and there is no Easyjet UK phone number.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-VCE PSA-LGW. Both flights on time and operated with clean and quiet A319's. Crews professional and attentive with informative flight deck announcements. Fares excellent considering it was Easter week. Amused on both flights to get off the bus ahead of the "Speedy boarders"!

### easyJet customer review
LTN-CDG a short flight and my first with Easyjet in almost 10 years. There's no comparison to Ryanair: the process is much smoother flight attendants and ground staff are friendly and accommodating. Flight departed and landed on time even early and arrival into Terminal 2 in CDG is very convenient. Will absolutely fly again. Price was competitive with British Airways flights to ORY and a good 30% cheaper than CDG flights.

### easyJet customer review
MAN - Antalya - MAN. Flew as a family of 7 paid for speedy boarding and extra legroom which I though was excellent value for money. Both flights were on time with announcements from the captain throughout the flight the cabin crew worked hard and the food and drinks were reasonably priced. The only issue was that in Antalya you are still required to have a standard boarding card so you still have to queue at check-in. Overall for a budget airline they were very good.

### easyJet customer review
Dead on-time out of CDG to Marrakech the same on return. An excellent airline. The only downside was the lack of a jetway on returning to CDG with the accompanying sardine-packed bus to the terminal but a small price to pay for a ticket that was only 175 USD RT. I would fly them again.

### easyJet customer review
LGW-RAK-RAK-LGW. Both flights departed on time despite poor weather in the UK. Not as in your face selling onboard as Ryanair do so no complaints. Crew were efficient and got the job done and got plenty of information from the flight deck en route. For what we paid I really cannot fault them if you follow the rules 99% time all will be ok.

### easyJet customer review
MAN-TFS return. Comfortable flight on a fairly new Airbus 320. Paid extra for exit row seats as this was a 4 hour flight and that gave us the option of Speedy Boarding. However not so important now that easyJet have started offering pre-assigned seats which removes the scrum. Speedy Boarding does mean you can drop your bag at a special Speedy Boarding desk rather than queue with the majority of passengers. This saved quite a bit of time at both ends. We had checked in online and the airline's website suggests you just turn up and drop your hold baggage. However Easy Jet's definition of "bag drop" sees the same lengthy queues at desks that you would get if you were checking in at the airport. Seats were comfortable with the extra legroom that goes with exit seats. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food offering is perfectly adequate for the length of journey. Plenty of information from the flight crew. Bit too much use of the PA system by the cabin crew. Altogether I find easyJet perfectly adequate for short haul flights.

### easyJet customer review
It was not Easyjet's fault that we were delayed by bad weather and so we missed our connection to Edinburgh but they tried to profit from our distress by demanding £120 to transfer us on the next flight to Edinburgh the next morning. No offer of a hotel. Turned to British Airways for help who got us on their last flight that evening. What a difference better seats free drink and snack and happy staff.

### easyJet customer review
I flew easyJet from CDG in Paris to Biarritz this week. Before I left I measured the size of my carry-on luggage to ensure it fit the easyJet requirements. It did. Yet when I arrived at the gate I was told I had to check my bag and pay 30 euros. I complained and asked to speak to a supervisor. This was the worst experiences I have had on a low-budget carrier. Ground staff were tenacious about my luggage. Completely unacceptable especially when the luggage fit the parameters of easyJets policy. Ground staff didn't like my laptop bag and wouldn't define it as one.

### easyJet customer review
I've flown EasyJet from Bristol-Nice Nice-Paris and Bristol-Geneva (and the corresponding return journeys). I've never found them to be anything less than excellent especially in terms of value for money. The flights are efficient and clean and the staff friendly and professional. Food is reasonably priced and tasty. They are always the first carrier i check when looking for flights.

### easyJet customer review
In January 2013 my wife and I booked and expensive one week Italian tour now spoiled by EasyJet! We were attracted by the premium departure time of 11.35 from Gatwick on 13 May 2013 and return from Verona departing 15.10 on 20 May. We have just been advised that the flight departure time from Gatwick has been brought forward by a massive 4hr 35min which means we loose a night sleep and to add insult to injury our return flight has been brought forward by 4hrs 10min again loosing a nights sleep and breakfast. We are both retired regular fliers and have not experienced this level of disruption before.
