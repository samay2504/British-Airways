OPO-MIR return. Cabin crew friendly breakfast served it was nothing special but not bad for plane food. There was no entertainment onboard but the planes were clean.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
It wasn't all that bad. Food wasn't great cleanliness was not great. We found the cabin crew to be friendly and they all had smiles and were tired from Ramadan.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
The food wasn't that great and there's no in-flight entertainment but we were comfortable and had our iPods! With regards to the cleanliness of the aircraft we've been on worse. We found the cabin crew to be friendly (their English is not great!) and they all had smiles. I think if you expect high standards from a 3 star airline you're bound to come home and write negative reviews. Overall we were happy with what we got.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
We have just returned from a week in Tunisia flying with Karthogo. I can agree with the other comments that have been made with regards to the cleanliness of the plane and food. The food was awful on both outbound and in bound flight so I would suggest that you eat beforehand. Also the plane wasn't very clean at all and most of the seats looked very tatty. There are no TV's on these planes so I suggest that you take an IPOD or something. This is the first and last time that we could use this airline. If I had known before hand I wouldn't have used them.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Never again! Flight out was delayed with no information. Food inedible staff unhelpful. The plane was dirty and tatty and very cramped. Turnaround time did not allow for aircraft to be cleaned and passengers rushed on board. We have a child in a wheelchair and it was very clear that we were holding things up. On the return journey only a half hour delay and slightly cleaner plane however they did not inform Gatwick that we would need our wheelchair brought to the aircraft from the hold so we had to wait on board for 40 mins after everyone else left. Again it was clear we were an inconvenience and one of the pilots went to the other end of the plane and had a smoke! We were handed stale ham rolls no tea or coffee as our meal and there was very little duty free available.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Arrived back from a week in Tunisia yesterday. We had our two young sons with us (6 & 5) and a great week was ruined by the comedy of errors that is Karthago airlines. It's amazing to read some of the older posts here in that they are so similar to our own experience. Let's forget about the passport guard asking us with under his breath to give him our unspent Dinars. When we said we had none left his mood changed and the passports were thrown back at us. The four and a half hour delay was made even more unpleasant by incredibly rude and unhelpful airport staff and the disgraceful snack they are obliged to provide when passengers are delayed. The aircraft cabin was worn and tired looking and did nothing for my confidence in the safety of the aircraft overall. We sat on the tarmac for another 30 mins without aircon in the Tunisian heat. When we finally took off we got "apologies for the delay" from a cabin attendant nothing from the captain and no explanation as to why we were left waiting for 4.5 hours. One elderly lady who was a little frightened by some turbulence during the return flight asked for a glass of water to relieve her dry mouth. She was told she would have to buy a bottle at €2 they don't do free glasses of water. We had a great week in Tunisia but sadly our Karthago experience will make us think long and hard about ever returning or indeed if we will ever use the travel company that sees fit to use Karthago as its agent.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
It was with great concern that I learnt our flight to Tunisia was with Karthago having gone onto this site to check them out. Tried to changed the flight with Thomas cook but they were most unhelpful and told us if we wanted to change it we would lose about £700 so decided to suck it and see what happened. After arriving at Gatwick we were told by the check in staff that the e ticket we had received was not acceptable to them and had to get tickets printed at a cost of £40 (taking this one up with Thomas Cook). The plane did take off on time which was the only good thing about it - plane was old and very worn food on the way out was a stale sandwich coffee offered was cold. Staff unfriendly which is a shame as in Tunisia all the people we came across were lovely. On the return flight food was awful and staff rude.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
I am not surprised to see that the reviews of this airline are poor. I have not flown with Karthago Airlines as they decided to cancel our flight and did not bother to tell us. We were supposed to be flying to Monastir today and just happened to call up on Wednesday to check we had the correct documentation and were told our flight was cancelled and I still have not been given an explanation. I think if I hadn't I would be stood at the airport right now waiting to go on holiday. I will certainly not be booking with this airline again. In a way I am glad I never boarded the flight due to the reviews of the poor maintenance of the plane and continuous delays together with the appalling customer service I have received it sounds like a blessing in disguise.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
We paid £639 for the tickets. Flight severely delayed due to mechanical problems. Had to wait while as they interestingly put it "try to find someone to come and fix the plane with a new part". Ten hours later after we were due to depart we were finally seated on the plane. The aircraft was old and dirty. Seats ripped and broken and not affixed to the floor properly (screws loose). Tray tables broken on some seats. Unhelpful staff. Vile tasting tea with no milk tepid food. The pilots door was left open a lot thus posing a security risk. Had the most terrifying landing of my life on my return flight to London Gatwick. There was an announcement from the steward that there was a problem with the landing gear and in broken english it was also announced by the steward "we should land okay". As the plane hurtled closer towards the runway it hit the tarmac with such sheer force that everyone screamed. When we eventually came to a stop there was no apology from the cabin crew no one asked if the passengers were ok. I'll never fly Kathargo again and the planes do not feel safe. That landing has made me nervous to fly again. They need investigating.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Gatwick to Monastir return. We took off on time both ways the aircraft are dated but seat was comfortable. Food going was fine but only a stale sandwich coming back. Crew pleasant. The toilets are a lot to be desired and we made sure that we used the airport facilities before boarding on the return flight.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Doncaster to Monastir. Plane clean cabin staff were quite friendly and onboard meal compared favourably with those of other budget airlines. We had the same experience on the return flight from Monastir with no delays. Seating was a bit tired and would benefit from a refurbishment but otherwise more than satisfied.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
We travelled from Manchester to Monastir return. If the fixtures and fittings give an indication of how well the whole aircraft is maintained then this airline is an accident waiting to happen. At Monastir on the way back of all the flights on the info boards only the two Karthago flights were delayed! Avoid if possible.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Monastir to Gatwick. The aircraft was an absolute disgrace. I was given a broken seat (6C) and the very unhelpful crew finally offered me a seat at the back. The trays were broken my armrest was falling off and the toilets were in a disgusting state. The crew are not interested in customer service. There was no milk for the coffee. If planning to travel to Tunisia do not travel by Karthago. They have no concept of customer service including the ground staff who had no courtesy to keep us informed about the 4 hour delay we had. No apology or explanation given. Had I read the other reviews on this site I would have never booked my trip to Tunisia. By far the worst experience I have ever had and my husband and I couldn''t wait to get off the plane.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
On arrival at Manchester we checked in and were informed that there would be a half hour delay. The planes are dated and there aren't any televisions or music. Food was served tepid on both outgoing/incoming flights. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes. The crew were friendly and the captain informative.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Doncaster to Monastir. We were supposed to take off at 1650 - ended up leaving at 0120 next day. The airline did issue £25 pound meal vouchers whilst we waited. Seats were broken. The trays on back of seats in front were broken. No TV no Radio. Food was cold. Toilet would not flush. Seat pockets ripped and broken. Was glad to land and get off. But coming back not much better - food rubbish no butter for bread roll no milk (not even powdered) for coffee.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
We booked our 3rd visit to Tunisia through Thomas Cook flying from Doncaster but discovered we were travelling with Karthago - we arrive at the airport at 1.45pm and didn't leave until 1.15am following morning. We were not given any explanation only that it was technical food vouchers were issued as we were checked in. When we finally boarded it was on seats that were broken and actually lifted away from the main structure the backs were broken and would not stay in a upright vertical position seat pockets were ripped and generally the plane was way past its sell by date. Meal offered was unedible crew were rude and offish. The return journey was on time and the plane was very slightly better but still in awful condition. We are surprised that Thomas Cook are using this airline for their customers as there have been bad reviews on Karthago for over a year. This was not a cheap holiday so we didn't expect a 2nd rate service!

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Flight to Monastir. They were on time outbound/inbound the plane was cramped and spent the flight with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me - I was in the very back row 25. On the way back though it wasnt as bad in the middle of the plane. Seats ripped arms broken fabric coming off & bits of metal sticking out. Comments regarding food is true worst ever plane food. Found the cabin crew okay but I do speak some Arabic so that helped & they loved that.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Five hour delay on way out to Monastir from Manchester no explanation or apology given. No flight details given by captain the attendants were surly rude and unhelpful. Flight home on time but filthy dirty. All in all a horrible experience and by far the worst airline that I have had the misfortune to travel with.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Manchester with Karthargo and had a 5 hour delay - but we had read all these comments so were well stocked and got an £8 voucher for food for our trouble. Flight ok - clean food was ok outbound and generally fine apart from the delay. Return spot on time wise and flight equally as fun. Food was awful but that was personal preference. All in all cheap flight which included food so you get what you pay for - just go with an open mind mini-picnic plenty to read and you will be fine.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Do not travel with Karthago unless you are deseparate. Our flights were from Gatwick to Monastir. We had 7 hours delay both ways. There was little to no information available from the handling agents at both ends and Karthago staff were non existant. The drip feed of information was suspect late arrival technical flight crew out of time etc etc. The planes were past there sell buy date. Broken seats and tables torn fabric surly flight attendants etc.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
We have just travelled back from Tunisia. After a 7 hour delay flying from Gatwick with no explanation only to be met when we boarded with a grumpy crew with no interest in the passengers and a plane that was borderline on the unsafe. Broken seats tables and a tatty cabin. On the way back there were four Karthago flights the first was delayed for 14hrs a Manchester flight delayed for 9.5hrs ours for 7hrs and another one indefinitely. Again with no explanation other than a technical fault. So as per the comment below two technical faults in a week not reassuring. The plane coming back was worse.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
I have just returned from Tunisia flying Monastir Manchester with Karthago and can safely say that I will never fly with them again. The two hour delay on the way out was nothing compared to the nearly 10 hour delay on the way back. A brief apology was made when we were finally on board but no explanation offered other than that "they'd had a really bad week". What made the experience even worse was the misleading or complete lack of information about what was happening and no obvious presence of staff from the airline at the airport to keep us updated. We were initially informed of a six hour delay by our tour operator (Just Sunshine) on the way to the airport and were transferred to a nearby hotel to wait. We were provided with lunch (though the quality of food was poor). Our tour rep seemed unable to keep us informed of reason for the delay or keep us updated - some passengers resorted to the internet or relatives in the UK for information. When we were taken to the airport after six hours we were informed we would be taking off around 7/7.30. However at 7.30 we were still waiting at the departure gate (although the information boards were flashing 'last call'). The departure time shown on the boards then changed to 8.30 then 9.30. Just after we received a free soft drink for our troubles the boarding announcement finally came and we took off nearly 10 hours late. We were not alone in our experience - the other 4 Karthago flights shown on the information boards were delayed including the Gatwick flight which had a 6.5 hour delay by the time we left I don't know how much longer they had to wait.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Just come back from a week in Tunisia and flew with Karthago Airlines - shocking! Had a 4 hour delay flying out and staff were very surly and unfriendly. They served one side of the plane drinks and not the other. The airline food was awful - I usually eat most airline food given to me but this was awful. Coming back was even worse - 6.5 hour delay and a complete fiasco - no one told us anything - started at 2 hour delay and then kept going up. we were transferred to a hotel near the airport and were given an awful meal. Picked up a few hours later and finally boarded the flight having had to clear customs again and being asked for our visa forms even though we had already handed them in. Then we had to find our duty free and hang around. Once on the flight - a short apology was given but no explanation why we were delayed. The FAs were rude and too busy talking about what they were up to than being interested in the passengers. I would avoid this airline if at all possible - they only have a fleet of 6 planes and we had two with technical faults in one week!

### Karthago Airlines customer review
My outward flight from Gatwick airport to Monastir (Tunisia) was delayed by four hours; no real explanation was given and apologies seemed less than sincere. Worst still was the return journey. There was a seven-hour delay and there were no ground staff available. The announcement that passengers were to be taken from the airport to a local hotel were so disorganised and unintelligble that several passengers missed the announcements altogether. Again no representatives from the airline showed themselves. The meal provided at the hotel - burgers lukewarm vegetables and potatoes followed by melon pieces - was to say the least poor. While the in-flight cabin service and catering were reasonable the airline seemed not to care a jot about the inconvenience to passengers on both outward and return flights. Unless there is absolutely no other option I shall not fly with Karthargo again.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Thomas cook changed our flight to go with Kathargo. On time plane clean and comfortable and staff most friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our meals on the outbound and inbound and drinks were plentiful at no charge only for alcoholic drinks. Overall the airline was equally as good as any others we have flown.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Flew to Monastir. The flight was on time with a crew who were efficient and friendly. The plane was clean meal excellent and there was more leg room than usual for a charter flight. On the return the plane was obviously older! One or two passengers had broken seats and the meal was not so good. However I would still be happy to fly with Karthago again.

### Karthago Airlines customer review
Cardiff to Monastir return. Never again with this airline. Dirty cabin seat pocket full of rubbish ripped seats I had a person in my lap all the way home as the seat wouldn't go vertical and my rear end on a broken spring all the way there. On the way back we could actually see the flight deck as we took off as the door wasn't shut - again very off putting. Food was ok but tea and coffee sparse and cold. A lot of the duty free goods were unavailable.

Cardiff to Monastir return. Both flights on time staff pleasant and the food was hot. The 737-300 did look a little old and decor seat backs etc a little torn but no worse than many other airlines I've flown. This airline is adequate.

Kathargo Airlines charter flight Dublin - Monastir return. Operated by a Boeing 737-300 The leg room was adequate for a charter hot meal service both ways which was good . Cabin crew no problem meals and drinks served with a smile soft drinks free with alcoholic drinks priced between 2-3 euro alot cheaper than what other airlines charge. We had a four hour delay on our return flight kept well informed which was due to the inbound flight being delayed in Vienna. Given vouchers to use in the departures cafe for refreshments / sandwiches which was more that adequate for a mid afternoon snack. Outbound flight from Dublin left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. After reading a few of the negative reports on them on this site I expected the worse but I would have no hesitation flying with them again it seems a lot of the reports about them is over rated. It's not a UK airline it's based in the country that you are flying to try speaking a little French to the crew - that brings a smile sit back and enjoy your holiday!

Flew to Monastir 1 October. Supposed to fly out to Monastir at 18.35 hrs but didn't fly until 01.00 hrs no explanation given. On boarding the cabin was smelling of cigarette smoke - it was old and shabby some seating armrests and seat belts were broken the toilet door woudn't close. Just one look at the food - tea and coffee were undrinkable. There was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were not pleasant. The return flight was a little cleaner the staff more pleasant but the food wasn't fit for consumption. All was reported to our holiday representative on arrival at our hotel. Would never fly with Kathargo ever again.

Edinburgh to Monastir - aircraft was an old 737-300 which had shabby broken seats with worn coverings on seats armrests were broken. During the meal our temporary tables sat an angle because armrest was broken allowing meal trays to slip off. There was no inflight entertainment duty free service very poor indeed most items advertised in brochure not available crew had difficulty in working out how much you paid. Cabin crew were courteous and helpful. On return flight same conditions as before good points both flights were on time. Can't say we were impressed the aircraft has to be upgraded to give the passengers comfort and service they expect. Seats very uncomfortable for three and a half hour flight.

I flew on Karthago Airlines last week from Moscow-DME to Tunis and from Monastir back to Moscow. On the first flight the interior of the 737-300 looked pretty old. Some of the fabric on the seat backs were torn. On the second flight on a seperate 737-300 the interior was newer and in general more comfortable. Meals were served on both flights. There was no inflight entertainment or inflight magazine. The best part both flights were the exceptionally friendly and helpful cabin crew. There was also a decent selection of duty free items available on board.
