### “Airline offered no help”
1.5-hour flight departed and arrived two hours late, resulting in a missed rail connection and an unanticipated night in Paris. Airline offered no help and took no responsibility - their response made clear that they will only do the legal minimum for their customers. I will never use them again.

### “staff was well trained and very friendly”
Not Verified | I had a wonderful flight experience with Eastern Airlines. Aircraft was clean, well maintained, and most importantly comfortable and on time. The staff was well trained and very friendly & professional. We need an alternative passenger airline. I think everyone agrees with that. Let's think of Eastern Airlines for our travel needs when they begin destination and set route service.

### "turned into a nightmare"
Not Verified | What should have been an enjoyable trip to Washington, DC turned into a nightmare. A long delay at Detroit, and a return trip which had hundreds of us sitting in a waiting area for better than 8 hours, and then another delay of about 2 hours while sitting on the tarmac. While the flight attendants did their best to make us comfortable, no explanations were provided except for the excuse that the tower would not give the plane permission to leave. I have my doubts about the claim. This was one of, if the not the worst experience I have had with an airline. I'm providing one star for the flight attendants. I'd like to give them more but I believe the credit would be given to the airline.

### "beyond incompetent"
Easily the worst experience I have ever had. As a seasoned traveller I’d thought I’d experienced it all. Eastern Airlines is beyond incompetent. Absolute disastrous experience, which will never be repeated and I hope to inform others not to take the risk.

### "It was a highly stressful ordeal"
On May 12th, 2022, EA flight number 2D 322 that was to take off at 6:55 am from JFK to GYE was cancelled without warning. For more than 24 hours, we were kept waiting at JFK by EA agents while the plane underwent mechanical and electrical repairs. We were repeatedly assured that we will depart as soon as the plane was fixed. In their first announcement, EA agents announced to waiting passengers that the flight was rescheduled for 3pm of that day only to have it changed to 11pm. Again the flight was rescheduled to May 13th, 2022 at 2:00 am, but it failed to take off despite repeated and multiple assurances from EA agents. While waiting at the boarding lounge, we were forced from there to outside the security cordon so that we had to go through TSA check-in and immigration twice. Throughout the day we were bounced from terminal to terminal and gate to gate. We had to lug our luggage from one part of the airport to another. Not only did we carry heavy luggage but some of us have disabilities, medical conditions children while others are elderly which made movement around the airport torturous. We endured more than 24hrs without food and water. It was a highly stressful ordeal that EA put us through.

### "very dissatisfied and disappointed"
Back in December of 2021 my family decided to go for our mothers funeral, she passed 2021 and due to COVID we were unable to attend. Two days before our travel this airline canceled our flights and we were obligated to purchase tickets with a different airline. Although it was a very bad experience we decided to give them a second chance. This time purchase a ticket for my elderly father (we live 5 hrs from the international airport), for May 8, a week previous to the travel day received a msg stating the flight got rescheduled to May 13. A day before the flight I received a message that the new time switched from 3:30pm to 10pm, My father gets to the airport on the May 13 at 6pm and the flight is completely canceled, we did not receive any messages, No emails, no phone calls. I paid someone to take my dad to the airport but the driver is not allowed at the airport so he dropped my father off and left. I called customer services they started it was 11pm and to call back during business hours. I had to jump and literally do magic to have him in the next flight with a different airline. This airline lost my respect and will never purchase another ticket. I called them this morning and their answer was we had to cancel this flight for major reasons. I understand things happen, but be ready to be responsible to take care of your customers and communicate as soon as possible. You have no idea what people go thru to even purchase and paid a flight ticket .. very dissatisfied and disappointed.
