### "They lost our luggage"
Not Verified |   We flew with this company in November from Madrid to Cuba. They lost our luggage in Madrid and didn't give it back to us until almost a month later. After we claimed the whole case they still did not get back to us with the result after 4 months.

### "never fly this airline again"
I will never fly this airline again. Their website and app were full of glitches and wouldn’t let me pay for baggage ahead of time, and even though I did web check in, when I tried to go to security with my boarding pass, they send you all the way back to the luggage drop desk which is far away (I saw this happen to 5 other people). When I got to the desk just 60 minutes before the flight left (stress!) the line was huge because the desks were so slow and they were being so strict about baggage policies that almost everyone was being forced to check bags despite sizes being normal. To my surprise, when I got to the desk (with 2 small bags that I travel the whole world with and carry on) they charged me €100 ($120 USD) for ONE checked bag. They also forced me to pay in cash so I had to go to an atm. Of course I had to do this all very rushed and was left with no choices because they were taking so long and I didn’t want to miss the flight. They’re more focused over petty expenses that are more expensive expensive than the flight, than running a proper business.

### “No responses, No communication, No refund”
Not Verified | We were flying from Madrid to Havana the 14th of November and the World2Fly lost on the way 300 lugged ! I really don’t understand how it is possible! Our luggage has been lost too. We spent our holiday in Cuba without everything. No clothes, No creams, medicine etc. Help from Worl2Fly? NONE! No responses, No communication, No refund, No emails, No calls, Nothing. We got the luggage the last day in Havana airport and what’s funny about that is that we still don’t have any response from World2Fly customer service. If you read answers from them when you read reviews online then you will see how they respond and always ask you to stay in touch with their customer service but in the end you will don’t get any answer back. What a horrible customer service! I will never fly with this company again and I recommend you to don’t do it neither.

### "terrible customer support"
The flight was alright, on time and service during the flight was good. However, afterwards, communication with their customer support was the worst experience ever! Simply the customer team brings shame to the company and I don't know if they have any supervisor over their team. I asked for simple request but they refer each time new email or refuse to work via phone call and simply don't get the work done. So I'd not recommend anyone to use this airline as you are highly likely to engage with this terrible customer support team!

### "don't want to refund me the full amount"
I wanted to cancel my booking due to a national security alert for the destination country. The alert is on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs webpage of my country. I've paid for a plus package and I've selected the seats and also paid for them. I've chosen this Plus package for a full refund max. 16 days before the flight. Nowhere in the payment process, it says that the seats are non-refundable. It says vaguely if you search on the website. Now, almost 2 months before the flight, I want to cancel my booking and they don't want to refund me the full amount. They want to keep 200 euros for the seats (2 people round-trip).

### "uncomfortable and unnecessary situation"
Tuesday 27 July I call to cancel my flight, customer service suggest that I keep my booking and change it later. I agree. Tuesday 5 August I call to rebook because it was to late to cancel obviously and a women tells me that I will get a email confirmation. Friday goes, no confirmation, Saturday customer service is closed, Sunday I call their emergency number, the man behind can’t help me out. Monday I reach customer service and instead of listen to what I’m explaining she inform me that it’s to late for a flight change, that to make a change I have to send them a email. I’m furious, but on their website you’ll find a different information. See for your self under ”How can I manage my flight bookings?”  Feel free to call our Customer Care Department and we will take care of the procedure for you. Over 10 email with text explanation, prof of calling them in form of screenshot with date and the exact hours they stop answering me. In one of the email I’m clear about having to take my flight if they don’t gonna make the change for me. The day before my original flight still no answer, I call them and the tell me to wait for their email response. Next day no answer. The day after I call them same answer, The day after I send them a new email with out any response from them. Finally I get a response but not the one I was expecting. We are sorry for all the bother and please, accept this e-mail as a formal apology. We understand how frustrating this has been and we believe the situation resulted from a misunderstanding. Again, we are sorry for what happened and we will try to help you on future occasions. Is obvious that one from the service group forgot to do one task, affecting my booking and putting me in this very uncomfortable and unnecessary situation. If you can’t change my flight as previously agreed I will be forced to traveling back on the 13 of August.
