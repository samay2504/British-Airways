### "Overall I have no complaints"
Check-in at Gatwick Airport was smooth and efficient. The airline uses the No.1 Lounge which is nothing special but with comfortable seating and is Wi-Fi more than adequate. Boarding was done quickly and the cabin crew was super diligent in helping each of the passengers find their seat and stow their baggage. Although the business seats on this 777 were not new they had ample storage space, the flat bed was comfortable and everything worked. The food was well presented but tasted a little bland and the cabin crew were extremely quick in removing trays when passengers had finished. The Wi-Fi on the aircraft was patchy at best and, being Chinese, quite a few sites seem to be blocked. Running a VPN actually made it quicker with no blocked sites. There were a few Western movies but the choice was limited. Loos were spotless. Overall I have no complaints and would happily fly with the airline again.

### “the cabin was spotlessly clean”
Not Verified | I like that Recaro seats were used. The seat was very soft and legroom was actually the most I have gotten thus far, even for such a tiny plane like the A320 neo. It was very well kept and modern, and the cabin was spotlessly clean. There was even a meal on the short flight of 1 & 2/3 hours. Excellent experience. However, there was no screens for IFE, but there was a cool magazine that kept me entertained, so yeah. However, there, unfortunately, was a karen or kevin or whatever you call it, on our flight. The crew were very professional.

### "improved dramatically"
China Eastern Airlines customer service has been improved dramatically since before the pandemic of COVID. In economy class, I feel well treated by cabin crew and everyone was so kind and well motivated. I have ordered the vegetarian meal and I was not enjoyed, the the cabin crew brought me nice food to replace. Especially flight MU715 compared to MU716 I flew with this month, the cabin crew did really fantastic job. The only thing I was a bit disappointed is there is very limited option of in-flight entertainment especially in A330-200 which was MU716 flight. But overall, both two aircraft’s had fantastic leg space for a 180cm tall guy.

### "Fares were very competitive"
It's ok" would be the best way to summarise my experience with China Eastern on a trip from Frankfurt via Shanghai to Japan and back. The Boeing 777-300 appears reasonably well-kept even though you clearly notice the difference to their fleets newer A350. Food was very unspectacular on all legs except one (where it was quite decent), makes you understand the jokes about airplane food. Entertainment is very limited, only a small selection of movies in English is offered. Staff isn't unfriendly. Only weird thing is that you're asked to remove all headphones 40 minutes before landing already, which is unusual and slightly annoying. Fares were very competitive and about 400€ less than the next comparable offer by another airline. Taking all this into account, China Eastern may be a good choice when looking for a lower-price (but definitely not budget, neither regarding cost nor amenities) option for flying to different Asian countries, but stays behind in their offering compared to the Eastern elite airlines like JAL, Singapore or Asiana.

### "Diabolical at best"
Not Verified |  Diabolical at best. I have travelled budget airlines which has better service and offering. From the time we boarded it was all about what they wont or cannot offer. No soft drinks, only Soda. Food limited. Soft drink menu only tea and coffee, 6.30 flight only one tepid meal. Toilets were dirty. My seat inflight entertainment did not work. Selection was awful. So it might They should not sell business class at full price. I have travelled many a budget flights on business but this was by far the worst. I had to take this return flight as my original flight on a different carrier was full. Made in China at its best

### "economy seats were fine"
Solid airline, will fly again. Professional, spoke English, polite, efficient, good value flight. I was scared to fly this airline as I read so many negative views. This is my experience. - I flew from Sydney to Rome - Back from London to Sydney - Could not beat the price for a full service flight I was 10-15mins late for check in for my return flight from London (as my earlier connecting flight was delayed significantly which caused this) and the last two ladies remaining at the check in desk were more than accommodating. I couldn't be grateful enough. Even though they had signed out of the computers, packed up the online check in and closed off the online roll call, the manager asked her co-worker to check if the passenger list had been submitted or if she could open it up and add me - they were unsure if they could if it was submitted. They managed to access the list and added me! They could have easily not helped me too as I was far past the check in time. They told me I had to run for my flight as I might not have made boarding (I literally made it running through security and the airport). I had to sign a waiver that my bag may not arrive on the same flight (it did). My bag was oversized too and I had no issues taking it (kite/golf bag). They accept oversized bag - I recommend booking directly with them (not through a third party website like booking.com like I did, so you can check in in advance, and deal with them directly if you need to change flights) - their food is very mediocre, bring your own if you are fussy, or pay $1k more for the same flight with a Tier 1 airline that serves better food - If you are vegetarian or fussy I would recommend bringing your own food - They serve Chinese food like noodles, rice, veggies and meat, red bean soup ... may be unusual if you have not been exposed to real Asian food - I'd recommend being certain when booking your seats and flight day/time as it may be hard to get a hold with them to confirm anything - Note that the last row of seats do recline, however if you need to change your seats after choosing, go slightly earlier to the airport and request the change when checking in. - The air hosts are lovely and professional. - The economy seats were fine and standard per any aeroplane - Limited Hollywood movies but you will find something. Couldn’t be more grateful for being able to check in to my return flight. For this price would definitely fly again.

### “wouldn't hesitate to fly them again”
China Eastern really surprised me with this recent flight I took with them. Their business class product is pretty solid and competitive in my opinion. Cabin crew were very hospitable and spoke excellent English. Meals, drinks and snacks were free flowing and quite scrumptious. I had the Asian option and their three course meal didn't disappoint. I was even taken aback by pajamas being an amenity that was offered. There was free wifi too albeit slow. I have a couple of very minor gripes though. First, is my dislike for the slanted seating arrangment which obstructs the feet when in the lie flat position. Next, had to do with their website which is barely functional. I also would of liked a few more film offerings. Nevertheless, I arrived well rested and well fed, so ended up with a completely different outlook of China Eastern for the positive. If they can remedy their website and invest a bit more onto their AVOD system, they would be a force to be reckoned with. I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again!

### "strange and frustrating airline"
China Eastern is a very strange and frustrating airline, and a real world of contradictions. First of all, if you are not a Chinese citizen with an ID card, it is extremely difficult to book, manage, and check-in for flights. When booking you should be aware that the booking system for the app and their website are not linked, so booking on one will immediately preclude you from accessing the reservation on the other. The app's English version is extremely limited in a way the Chinese version is not. At the airport, ground staff's command of English within China is usually limited, but it's functionally the same process as at any other airport, so just do what you always do and you'll get checked-in. I do like that they give you meals on shorter domestic flights. It's nothing extravagant but it's a hot meal and nice to have. Flight crew is kind and their command of English is usually better than the ground staff. Ultimately the frustrating tech issues just barely edge out the more competent parts of the experience.

### "A real disappointment"
A real disappointment, only snacks are given on a 4 hour flight in Business. Only 8 seats so could offer a full meal service. Limited choices of drinks, basically red or white wine, beer or soft drinks.

### “staff are unpleasant”
Not Verified | Without a doubt, the worst company I have ever seen in my life, the staff are unpleasant and with no willingness to help you. I don't know how they can continue working with the terrible service they offer, in my case was with an airline official at the Bangkok airport. If they are not willing to serve their customers, customers who have paid a lot of money for their tickets, let them go do something else. The company moves at the pace of the type of client it has. My opinion for them is 0. I will never fly with this company again, before flying with them again, I will walk.

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
This is my review of China Eastern Airlines. I was late for the first stop of my three-day vacation, causing me to miss my connecting flight. The offer was to stay in the hotel until the next day and then fly to another city, arriving at the destination at 11:30pm. This way I would lose 2 out of 3 days. I had to book another flight to my destination and they also canceled my return ticket. I had to buy another ticket to go home. Basically, I had to buy 3 tickets to stay in the city of my choice for 3 days. It cost me 3 times the money. China Eastern Airlines is required to refund the last leg and round-trip air tickets. They will refund a small portion of the tickets. Worst airline I have ever flown. Be careful with their connecting flights 这是我对中国东方航空公司的评论。为期三天的假期，第一站迟到，导致我错过了转机航班。报价是在酒店住到第二天，然后飞往另一个城市，晚上11:30飞往目的地。这样我就会失去3天中的2天。我不得不预订另一班飞往目的地的航班，他们也取消了我的回程机票。我必须再买一张票才能回家。基本上，我必须买3张票，在我选择的城市呆3天。它花了我3倍的钱。要求中国东方航空公司退还最后一站和往返机票。他们会退还一小部分门票。我坐过的最烂的航空公司。小心他们的转机航班

### “Be careful of their connecting flights”
Not Verified | This is my comment on China Eastern Airlines. During the three-day holiday, I was late for the first stop, causing me to miss the connecting flight. The offer is to stay at the hotel until the next day, then fly to another city, and fly to the destination at 11:30 p.m. In this way, I will lose 2 out of 3 days. I had to book another flight to my destination, and they also cancelled my return ticket. I have to buy another ticket to go home. Basically, I have to buy 3 tickets and stay in the city of my choice for 3 days. It cost me three times as much. China Eastern Airlines is required to refund the last stop and round-trip tickets. They will refund a small part of the tickets. The worst airline I've ever taken. Be careful of their connecting flights.

### "They should be shut down"
Not Verified |   Zero customer service. Requesting wheelchair assistance is an absolute nightmare. They promise you it will be provided but then leave you high and dry. All phone numbers provided reach only Chinese speaking staff who play a recorded message which is of zero help. I have travelled the world and have never dealt with so much incompetence in my life. Countless phone calls, emails and online form submissions get left unanswered. Frustrating to say the least. Never will I fly with China Eastern Airlines again. They should be shut down.

### "look forward to flying with them again"
Economy return from Hong Kong to London via Shanghai. All flights departed and arrived on time, planes were very clean and comfortable, with plenty of legroom and recline and compared favorably to other airlines I have taken between the UK and HK over the years. The biggest surprise for me was the tasty food, which was plentiful and the excellent, friendly cabin crews on the four flights. The food was above average to good and much better than the last two European carriers I flew with. The cabin crew were polite, impeccably mannered, hardworking, and on the last leg between Shanghai and HK, the kept reminding everyone on the tannoy that the significant turbulence was nothing to worry about. They were so calming for the nervous flyers and it really helped my wife. There aren't many movies on the entertainment system compared to the hundreds that other airlines have, but I enjoyed watching a couple of flicks I had not seen before as well as fabulous episodes of All Creatures Great and Small on the tv section. The airline flies over Russia, so flight time is currently faster than most carriers. Transit in Shanghai is efficient, though it is true that security there is stricter than most transit cities. But it has to be done. I'll look forward to flying with them again.

### "So disorganised in the 21st century"
The plane had mechanical issues and the flight was cancelled. Still spent 3 hours on the plane whilst we watched our luggage being offloaded. Only to be served food so that by the time we got off the plane the airport was closed and all systems were shut off. We finally got out of the airport on a bus at 5am, 8 and a half hours later. Why so long for such a small number of people. So disorganised in the 21st century. The team acted like this was the first time it had ever occurred and had no idea what to do. Would i travel with them again - not willing to take the risk.

### “lack of flexibility and understanding”
I'm deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and understanding from China Eastern Airlines regarding my recent booking for flights to Turkey. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to obtain a visa for my trip. Despite my efforts to cancel the flights in a timely manner, I have encountered significant obstacles in obtaining a refund from China Eastern Airlines. The lack of flexibility and understanding during this difficult situation has been extremely frustrating. As a loyal customer, I expected better customer service and support from China Eastern Airlines. It's disheartening to see a lack of empathy and willingness to accommodate customers facing genuine issues. I urge China Eastern Airlines to reconsider their refund policies and provide better support to customers facing unforeseen circumstances beyond their control. I hope that in the future, they will prioritise customer satisfaction and provide more flexible solutions in similar situations.

### “no responsibility for they own mistakes”
I purchased a ticket premium economy, they swap the aircraft from Shanghai to Rome and no premium economy available anymore. No communication to advise that no premium economy available, no effort was made to upgrade to business, no responsibility for they own mistakes and poor communication.

### "The worst Business Class"
The worst Business Class I have ever taken. Lack of space for leg just like Economy Class. Without clean enough. The table was broke (and caused a glass of cola was poured on my clothes). Food was also bad (vegetables were too salty and fried chicken were really tasteless but not crispy). 去上海辦點事，沒想到刷新了我對公務艙的認知下限，WUH天河-PVG浦東-HKG赤臘角，武漢MU國內出發休息室都比較小，麵也沒有以前的好吃了，機上居然沒有歡迎飲品和毛巾（跟後面比都是小問題）？MU在PVG的國際休息室也沒有那麼高品質，食物都不太行，就麵還算行？飛香港的飛機同樣是737-800，公務艙只有小臂那麼長的地方放腿，而且飛機保養根本沒做吧，衛生方面也很不乾淨，小桌板一拉就歪，可樂直接潑身上了，只能說飛機維護了，但只維護了一點點。。屬於是花公務的錢去坐了超經？毫不客氣的說，超經除了寬度比不上，其它樣樣爆打。而且PVG不是MU基地嘛，機餐只能用慘烈來形容，一餐中最好吃的是水果⋯⋯主菜的炸雞和配菜幾乎沒味道，炸雞外皮還是軟的，冷菜卻齁鹹，米飯是硬邦邦的，加熱好的蒜香法棍卻是軟塌塌的⋯⋯以敝人淺薄的旅行經驗來說，這次的公務艙是所有國內國際航線最差的，無論是MU自己，還是國內外其它航司，前一程WUH-PVG相同的機型737-800都比它好太多太多。。

### "absolutely shameless"
Lanzhou airport is an absolute disaster for non Chinese speaking international Traveller as nobody speaks English. China Eastern is suppose to depart from terminal 2, but my check in counter could not be found as my flight did not appear on the flight departure screens. Information counter staff unable to help. I found the counter finally in a remote corner of terminal 1. Check in had to be done via Google translate, no Lounge available. I received one cup of water throughout this almost 4h flight. No food, nothing! Budget carrier are offering food for sale, but China Eastern offers nothing on a 4h international flight; absolutely shameless. Never again!

### "staff with very limited command of English"
Check in at Bangkok airport swift and friendly. Boarding well organised. Seats on the rather worn aircraft not very comfy, but ok legroom. Food not very good. Service was decent, but staff with very limited command of English. Flight departed on time, and arrived 20 minutes early.

### “This is the worst airline I have flown”
Not Verified | This is the worst airline I have flown with. They cram everyone in the back section and there is a whole middle section empty but they won't let you move. The food is inedible and you can't even get a glass of wine on a 12 hour flight. The movies are very old.

### "food and beverage very bad quality"
No inflight entertainment updated, food and beverage very bad quality and no fresh products. Plane got redirected to a different airport per 4 hours, not much help or extra food from the airline.

### "Attendants wasn't quite helpful"
The Flight Attendants wasn't quite helpful. The ticket is quite acceptable for RMB $4114 for 4 People including 1 children. The food is good, it includes snacks, main course, dessert and juice. The seats is comfortable although the seat haven't include a TV and the seats headphone jack is broken.

### “New aircraft both ways”
New aircraft both ways, meal service - cold box. Pretty bad on incoming leg, very good Japanese bento on incoming. No additional drinks but bottle of water, no IFE.

### “It was quite disappointing”
Not Verified |  It was not a very good flight. I flew MU 543 from Shanghai Pudong to Singapore Changi on the overnight flight. It was quite disappointing. First the aircraft arrived from Singapore was late which was still ok. But the product is very old. The touch-screens are not functioning and had to use the console to control it. There was no headphones given and the service was very limited. The departure time was delayed and even the flight next to us pushed back first even though our departure time is earlier. This is quite a disappointing for a full service airline to provide such a service.

### "the food was horrible"
Brand new A350 plane from Shanghai to Tokyo. Seats were comfortable. Cabin crew was courteous. But the food was horrible. Transiting in Shanghai was chaotic and very rushed although had about 1 hour between flights. Will fly with them again but will probably not if a transfer is required at Pudong airport.

### "avoid Chinese Eastern like the plague"
Check in at Shanghai Hongqiao airport was abysmal. The rudest agent I have come across in years. The lounge was full at the time I used it, think school canteen and that's about it. Seat onboard was comfortable enough, but grubby as were the rest of the cabin fixtures. One female staff serving this cabin was courteous but couldn't speak a word of English. Sat in bulkhead row with briefcase etc by my feet, and nobody applied the expected safety rules to stow them for take off and landing. Meal box passed to me after boarding, in complete silence. The food was inedible, and working in China I normally like Chinese food. As always with Chinese airlines, not a single word from the cockpit - do they even use humans to fly their aircraft? If you have a choice, avoid Chinese Eastern like the plague.

### "Clean fairly new aircraft"
Clean fairly new aircraft, not like the one we flew out of Gatwick to Shanghai which was quite old. The seats on the flight to Heathrow were modern and comfortable. The entertainment films are rubbish and there for Chinese people. The head sets are the small old fashioned cheap ones and after a while very uncomfortable, not noise canceling The food is just awful. The crew were very nice and helpful but their command of the English language is not good. Difficulty asking for sweetener it took 3 stewardesses. Flight itself was excellent. Will I select China Eastern in the future, no, even though it's cheap.

### "food is delicious and fresh"
The cabin is clean. Flight attendants are friendly and kind. The seat is comfortable. The food is delicious and fresh. Flights departed on time. The price is reasonable.

### "I would recommend them"
It's a pretty standard airline, they fed us well, came around with water a lot (which is more than can be said for a lot of airlines), and the seats were fine. Which is all you can ask for when flying economy. In terms of value for money, it's pretty impressive. Getting through Shanghai airport was a bit of a hassle, but that's about the place, not the airline. Check in was fine, the guy who checked me in was really nice. At the end of the day, flying economy, you're never going to be in the lap of luxury, but I would recommend them as an airline.

### "don't fly this airline"
I had an entire back row to myself, my flights were on time and my bag arrived with me. This is where my compliments end. Frankly, I don't really recommend China Eastern unless you don't have any other choice. With being conservative with my criticisms, I'd say its a barely mediocre airline at best. Moreover, MU is really an airline tailored for Chinese people. I based this on the language skills of the crew, food options they serve, and the limited availability of international film choices from their AVOD. The stewardesses kept speaking Chinese to me despite asking to not have Chinese spoken to me since I don't speak it. Additionally, one word for the AVOD system: boring. I flew on the newest A350 and there were only like a dozen movies on offer where most of the choices happened to be Chinese movies. As for the food, it was the worst airline meal I've ever eaten. Ordered a special LFML and the chicken that was served was the stalest and driest chicken to ever enter my mouth causing me to nearly choke. Also, ordering the special meal was a mission as I had to physically go to the airline office while on holiday since there was no way to do so online or over the phone. My advice is, don't fly this airline unless its really cheap and if you do, come prepared with your own snacks, entertainment, etc.

### "absolute worst experience imaginable"
It was the first and last flight with them. 11-hour trips are always challenging and exhausting, but China Eastern makes it the absolute worst experience imaginable. From leaving you famished for six hours to not having a functional USB outlet to charge your electronics or a simple blanket for the cold. After waiting for food for six hours on the return flight, there was no alternative for a snack; I was forced to eat one of the untranslatable vegetables. After an hour, they served me a chicken sandwich that was out when I first ordered it. The male commissioners were really unfriendly, and it appeared as though we were interfering with their stroll. Additionally, communication has been made considerably tougher by the fact that they don't speak any English. The return flight somehow managed to be worse. Firstly, the check-in agent, who resembled the commissioners without the slightest semblance of professionalism or reluctance. No options, cold food. Again, we had been without food for almost 3 hours when that was all that was left. The commissioners were at least going by and offering water on that particular trip. The poor quality of the company may make any trip miserable. The "stay seated" light was on the entire time on both flights, making it impossible to know whether or not it is safe to stand up. The staff gave a bag of sandwiches at the end of the return flight as though we were on a flixbus bus. The entire journey appeared to have been on a flixbus bus, by the way. The distinction is that they never cost more than 30EUR, as opposed to 1000EUR that I’ve paid to China Eastern. Not related to the flight but with the stopover: In China, the 3-hour stopover was similarly challenging. A hundred individuals were left waiting on the ground for more than an hour by extremely uneducated staff, while a worker slept behind the desk before releasing them to board the next flight through a different gate.

### "it offers good value for money"
I was a bit worried about flying with them to Japan, as it was the cheapest option, but was pleasantly surprised. The ground staff were very helpful and the flights left on time. The crew were pretty decent, they were quite laid back but were helpful too, and were kind to an old lady who got sick. The food was nothing special but decent enough and the seats ok - certainly no worse than you get in economy class from more prestigious airlines. You could take two fairly bulky bags into the cabin without any argument, too. The biggest downer was the in-flight entertainment. Very limited choice of rather cheesy movies, so if you fly with them, bring a good book! China Eastern feels quite no frills and very much aimed at Chinese customers, but I'd say it offers good value for money and above average service.

### "not have words to express how bad it is"
c✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with my two kids business class from Seoul to Beijing. I must say it is the worst lounge i have ever been. To start with the toilet - someone had peed in one of the cabins and it was just left there, no one really bothered to clean it. The staff who was responsible for cleaning was just chatting with her friends. The dirty dishes were around the lounge and again - chatting was much more fun for the personal instead of actually doing their job. The food - there were snacks like crackers, there were also some instant pasta which was left there. There was no wine, bier or any kind of alcohol. There were 5 oranges - thats enough for fruits. No one really bothered if there is still something left for the passengers. All the guests were very quiet but the lady working there and her friends were the most noisy ones. Do not expect a real coffee as well - just take the instant one. I do not have words to express how bad it is.

### "do not fly with them"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline, do not fly with them, don’t expect any sort of customer service of any kind. My ear drum ruptured mid flight no one cared, for my connecting I wanted to upgrade to business or premium economy so I called them they said there were seats available and all I would have to do is pay at the boarding desk. The people at said desk refused then on the plane I asked the air host who said it’s full, then proceeded to upgrade the Chinese lady a couple rows away and explained to the people next to her in English which is how I know what happened. They don’t care and everything about them is terrible, so is the airport. There’s no inflight entertainment the games don’t even work it’s like a Ali express tablet has been taped to the chair with stock movies. The food is terrible, they only give you one small cardboard cup of drink.

### "flights were very good"
Not Verified | The flights were very good, cabin crew were very nice and helpful but our baggage never turned up. It's six weeks since we returned and we cant contact anyone. At Rome they gave us a file reference number. We made so many calls but no one seems to know where the hell our bag is and some don't even answer your calls.

### "quality of the flights is very low"
Not Verified |  4 flights taken (Rome-Shanghai, Shanghai-Jakarta, Bali-Shanghai, Shanghai-Rome) and 2 of them with at least 1 hour of delay. I am still waiting in Shanghai to take my last flight. Waiting from 1 hour, no news about how much I have to wait. Moreover, the quality of the flights is very low, the airplanes are old and not comfortable.

### "The 12.5-hour flight flew by"
What a pleasant surprise. We were welcomed on board a new B777-300 by a friendly and helpful flight crew. The last five rows of this 3-4-3 seat configuration economy cabin are 2-4-2 - and we lucked out with the 4th row from the back. The 12.5-hour flight flew by. We were worried about being so close to the lavatories, but they were kept spotless the whole flight by an amazing crew. On par with and in many cases exceeding other 3-star airlines, I believe this carrier deserves at least a 3.5 Star.

### "fresh and airy cabin"
A pleasant surprise. Contrary to our expectations of an ancient, dirty aircraft with a sad crew, we were welcomed on board, to a fresh and airy cabin by a friendly and helpful flight crew. On par with and in many cases exceeding other 3-star airlines, I believe this carrier deserves to be re-evaluated.

### "still shocked by what happened"
Not Verified |  The staff do not let me with the child on the plane. At the airport they gave me a strange explanation for why I can’t fly. I bought the tickets a few days before the flight because there was an emergency and I had to fly urgently. I was shocked by the plane denial. I left the airport, and I started working with the airline to find out what happened. I was promptly replied to my email and promised to give a written explanation of the situation. A month later I've got nothing from them and they ignore my emails. My money were returned with penalties and they don't think they need to apologize or give my full return. I’m still shocked by what happened.

### "not recommend for long flights"
Not Verified |  Very average. They will get you from point A to point B on time but that's pretty much it. Seat are very small and very hard. Not adequate for long haul. Food is really poor. Small portions and poor quality. Entertainment is less than average. I would not recommend for long flights.

### "It was a run of the mill flight"
China Eastern is not a bad airline overall, but there’s a lot to be desired. The flight schedule worked out really well for me which is why I chose to fly them and connection through Pudong airport wasn’t too complicated although there is another round of security screening for transfer flights. The cabin service was attentive and efficient and the seat pitch and recline were nice as I didn’t feel squished as a person of 181cm. The food felt ample and enough to satiate. We also saved time on our flight since they still use Russian airspace to fly to Asia. Here’s what was bad. The airline’s website is glitchy and not functional. I wanted to order a special meal, but the website didn’t allow hence I called it in months in advance and got a confirmation email. Fast forward to the day of the flight, no special meal loaded and I ate the default meal without fuss. The IFE is extremely limited. There were maybe 20 films in total with half of them being Chinese movies and the rest were older Hollywood movies. It was a run of the mill flight that got me to my destination without any distinguishable quality.

### "worst airline I have ever flown with"
This was the worst airline I have ever flown with. We went from Auckland to London via Shanghai and returned the same route. On two out of the four flight out onboard entertainment did not work, so we had no entertainment whatsoever. The airline staff did not seem to care and said there’s nothing they can do. They also ran out of meals as we were in the back of the plane and so gave us tasteless vegetable with dry rice. On the flights where we did have onboard entertainment, they only had a handful of old movies of which we had seen most years ago already. The table tray was also broken on one flight so the food kept sliding off and the window shutter was filthy.

### "definitely recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Return from Taipei to Frankfurt (via Shanghai) was nearly as good as the outward flights from Frankfurt to Taipei. Onboard I was very pleasantly surprised by the attractive and tidy cabin, the toilets were spacious and clean, the smiling welcome. The cabin crew spoke relatively good English and were very attentive. For economy class the food was good and plentiful (the breakfast on the outward flight from Frankfurt was the best economy class Breakfast I have had on any long-haul flight!). Only major downside is they don't serve any wine at all in economy and one has to almost insist on getting a beer - they need to address this for an international airline flying many routes to Europe! The choice of movies isn't the widest either but that's not a major issue for me. I recommend seating in seat 70L and further backwards as the row reduces from 3 seats to 2 making it easier to get up without having to disturb anyone although on my own flights I was fortunate to have the seat next to me free - which also made it easy for me to work. Legroom is pretty good too and much better compared to Lufthansa's A350 which is tight. I definitely recommend this airline and would opt to use them again from Europe in future.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  It is way beyond terrible, I bought tickets from NYC to Shanghai and then to Qingdao. They cancelled my 2nd flight 2 weeks before I take off without any explanation, not to mention any refund! And that means I overpaid them with $1,700 only for the trip from NYC to Shanghai! The worst airline ever.

### "won't let me refund the cancelled flight"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my flight to Shanghai with no explanation or apology and told me to use the app or call for a refund. When I called I was told they won't be able to process the refund because I don't have a Chinese ID (I'm British). Their response to my question "How will I get my refund" was "Cannot!". The app also won't let me refund the cancelled flight without a Chinese ID. I booked my flight on the app using my UK passport. Thats $1000 (USA) I'm owed and apparently won't get back because I'm not Chinese. In any country other than China they would lose a discrimination law suit. If you're foreign and used to being treated with equality, don't book with China Eastern.

### "worse flight that I have had"
Not Verified |  New York to Shanghai in economy class. I flew during COVID-19. I went with my baby, two-month old. Everything was so horrible. I will not say that much since it is a public review, but it was so horrible. I would rate a minus for this flight (worse flight that I have had!) JFK转PVG，经济舱。 我在COVID-19期间飞行，所以我被要求戴上口罩立即回国。 我和两个月大的婴儿一起去了。 一切都太可怕了。 由于这是一次公开审查，因此我不会说太多，但这太可怕了。 我会为此航班打负号（我曾经有过更糟糕的航班！）

### "boarding counter is not well"
Shanghai to Luoyang. The boarding counter is not well. Because there is not a prominent sign at the boarding gate to tell us which is the first-class queue or eco queue. So many people. waiting at the wrong queue. Because of the epidemic, only a bit of food were supplied.

### "The seats are quite spacious, very good"
China Eastern Airlines is the best service company among the three major airlines (Air China, China Eastern and China Southern). In the airport, China Eastern has a lot of automatic check-in machines, and there are special tutors, which is very good. There are also few people queuing at the check-in counter. After boarding, the flight attendant service was very good. When I saw that I was sweating, I took the initiative to pour ice water for me. I already took the paper towel (yes, I was in economy class). The cabin entertainment system had a small TV, but there was no WiFi. This is not good. The distance between the seats is large enough, and the seats can be adjusted at a large angle. The seats are quite spacious, very good. The bathroom is clean. The most important thing is that the air ticket is cheap. The air ticket from Beijing to Luoyang is only 200 yuan! In addition, due to the epidemic, the meal is only a small bottle of mineral water. Before that, there was dinner (fried rice).

### "certainly value for money"
Singapore to Shanghai Pudong return in December 2019. Refurbished A330-300 was used where business class seats were new with direct aisle access. Warm and kind service given by the crew, better than many five-star airlines. The areas they should improve on is catering and IFE. Meal standards are below average for business class, with no western meal option. The Business and First Class lounge at Shanghai Pudong Airport  was very nice but again with only Chinese meal options. IFE was limited but acceptable for a five-hour flight. Overall though, for the price I paid, it's certainly value for money.

### "on board service was very simple"
Kunming to Shenzhen in July 2019. The weather that day at Shenzhen was terrible for flights to land, so we were running into a delay and the departure time was not ensured even till 22:00. The China Eastern lounge in Kunming was not bad, with food options including Yunnan noodle, but the environment  was not excellent, the light was very dim and the decoration was very old. I really that they prepared sandwich and bread for us because the typhoon was affecting Southern China, so many passengers were waiting at the lounge. We got on board at 22:10 and the plane pushed back at 23:00,  not a bad delay at all. This flight uses a newer Boeing 737-800, featuring a PTV for business class and the legroom was 97cm comparing to 91cm in the old planes. The on board service was very simple because it's a night time flight, and the snack on board only included biscuits, fruit and drinks. Finally, we landed at Shenzhen at 00:30, just 10 mins later than the schedule, not bad. Overall, I paid $184 for this flight, I should say nothing did bad, but also not eventful.

### "dinner service was very fair"
Guangzhou to Kunming in July 2019 on a Boeing 737-800 The flight experience was fair, not among the best Chinese domestic business class, but acceptable. Checkin in Guangzhou airport was very efficient, and a fast-track security check is given. The lounge was not highlighted, very common and a bit crowded during the afternoon time. The dinner service starts at 5pm, the food choices were quite limited, but the quality was good. The seating was a 2-2 configuration, common short haul narrow-body flights, but no personal entertainment. The space was not quite spacious, and if I get it right, China Eastern's 738 actually features one the shortest legroom. However, they give out slippers on such a short haul flight. The service on board was very delightful, I feel very welcomed on board. The dinner service was very fair, the bread was quite crispy and fresh; the main dish was steamed fish, the fish was OK but the rice was very dry like sands. But the flight arrives 20 mins earlier than the schedule, and also the fare was quite cheap, $173 for one way. So I should say it worth the price.

### "definitely the last time"
Not Verified |  New York to Shanghai. We re-booked on China Eastern as our original flight with United Airlines was cancelled due to the ongoing issue in China. We paid extra about 90USD / seat to get an emergency exit seat. Once boarded the aircraft I found that the seat was broken. I changed to another one as our row was not fully booked. No blankets and no pillows available even on request. Once airborne I found that the screen could not be turn out from the seat. But even if it would be there were no ear sets provided at all. My wife was watching movies reading the subtitles. For the food I can't give any comments as neither I nor my wife have tried it but I found it very funny that they serve breakfast at afternoon time in Shanghai. Drink selection was also not so nice, just standard soft drinks, Chinese Qingdao beer or Chinese red wine. The aircraft was pretty new however for the seats I had the feeling that they are really old. The head rest could not be pulled up enough, the seat itself was quite thin and after almost 15 hrs. of flight it was really hard to stay inside this seat. I have flown China Eastern quite a lot for domestic but for international flight it was the first time and definitely the last time.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  I took 4 flights with China Eastern from Vancouver to Phuket via Nanjing and back to Vancouver from December 28 returning to Vancouver on January 8. Business Class cabin is worn out, very old seats. Cabin crew doesn't speak any english, food is awful. Asked for an extra blanket as I was shivering and they said we don't have, Asking for a stomach pain medicine was a nightmare. They didn't understand a single word I was saying. The captain or anyone from the flight deck did not say a one single word to the passengers during the entire 14 hours in the air. At the end of the flight, once we made it to Nanjing he started circling around for 40 more minute taking turns between descending and climbing again several times, and again not a single word from the flight deck on the why this was happening. One single worst flight in my entire life. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "What a joke of an airline"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Melbourne via Shanghai. Booked this flight for my 73 year old mother who a month prior had had her knee replaced. Wheelchair assistance was booked for every leg of her London to Melbourne flight. However, when she got to Shangai, China Eastern staff treated her like garbage for her 11 hour stopover in which she was given no assistance. Staff yawned in her face, turned their back on her and refused to look at paperwork confirming the wheelchair had been arranged. Even worse service was to follow with some mumbled email apology came a week later which was then ignored when I replied to it. Phones are never answered. Finally got a second email from someone a few weeks later, no idea who as they had no signature to their email, which ignored all the issues raised in the complaint and said "I'm sorry that we didn't receive your service at the first time. It's extremely inconvenient for your subsequent itinerary. Next time I come to Shanghai, please email me in advance. I'll let our regional manager come to protect you! The Vegetarian meal on the flight was either fish or chicken. Both are my favourite kind of vegetable. What a joke of an airline.

### "did not see a single flight attendant"
Bangkok to Shanghai. I received an email message from the airlines stating that my flight was canceled and for me to contact them. In the email they sent me, they never provided a contact number. I had to google for their website and contact number. I called them more than 15 times on different occasion and all I got was answering machine with no option to leave a message. The email they sent me says do not reply as it was sent through an auto-messaging system. It was difficult to reach them through the phone. I have no other option but wait until I get to the airport and talk to them in person. When I get to the airport and ask them to issue me a new itinerary since the original one was canceled by the airline. They still can't help me but provide me with another phone number to call customer services. I finally got a new itinerary for my flight with China Eastern. The flight was a little more than 4 hours. The minute we boarded the plane, I can feel the air inside the plane was extremely warm. I thought the Flight Attendant will turn on the air conditioner once the plane starts to leave the tarmac but they did not. I waited for a long time for the Flight Attendant to come down the aisle so I can ask them to turn on the AC but I did not see one came by. I looked for a call button on my chair but did not find one since it was so dark in the plane. I waited for a long time no flight attendant came down the aisle. I felt exhausted and fall back to sleep. I sat in the middle seat so it was hard for me to climb over another passenger to find the Flight Attendant. On my way to the lavatory, I tried to look for a flight attendant and hopefully have them turn on the AC but did not see a single flight attendant around. It’s been like this throughout the entire flight. We were never offered drinks or meals. The seats are tiny. Even with my arms close to my body, my arms still rubbed by other passengers sitting next to me.

### "avoid at all costs"
Paris to Sydney via Shanghai. An absolute shocker - avoid at all costs. It's hard to know where to start. Two of our daughters recently flew with China Eastern Airlines. The food, particularly the vegetarian options, was very poor at best and the in-flight entertainment very limited. However, the main difficulties occurred whilst transiting through Shanghai. The personal security checks on these 2 young women was very invasive. The information provided during their time in transit was extremely poor, there was a need to re-check in luggage checked through to the destination and to apply for temporary entry permit to move between terminals. After a 6 hour layover, with no contact from officials, one of our daughters was told as she was boarding her connecting flight that there was a problem with one of her bags. In a very intimidating manner she was given the 'choice' to miss her flight so the bag could be searched or to get on the flight and sign a form giving permission to have the bag searched, the offending item removed, and the bag put on the next flight in 3 hours time. I might add at this point that this bag had already cleared security and customs in both Oslo and Paris. The bag was not on the next flight and 12 days later, with too many to count calls and e-mails, we were finally reunited with the bag. Over this time China Eastern did not answer a single phone call (the phone just rang out) and replied to approximately 1 e-mail in 10+, and with limited information provided. Throughout this time they refused to provide the standard 10 character file reference code for the check delayed bag status/file information form. In the end it was calls to Qantas and the baggage handlers in Sydney that resolved the matter. We are yet to hear from China Eastern that the bag has arrived even though we picked it up 2 days ago. Oh, and there was nothing missing from the bag when we ended up getting it - so nothing had been packed that was on a banned list for China. When we finally picked up the bag we were told by the baggage handlers that in their experience we were very 'lucky' as in these sort of circumstances they have found that very rarely is the bag reunited with the passenger... No amount of discounting makes this experience worth it.

### "it's been headaches and frustration"
Avoid at all costs. If you have something important like a well-deserved vacation or business trip, you'll have it ruined by taking this airline. From start to finish, it's been headaches and frustration. The website is old, buggy and online check in is impossible. You need to arrive at least 3 hours before to avoid getting bumped, however on both trips the gates never opened until 2 hours before. Phone customer service is very difficult to reach and you'll be dialing a few phone numbers to reach someone barely able to speak English. Hostesses barely speak English. You won't hear from the pilot at all. If you have a layover with this airline in Asia you will be routed through Shanghai Pudong, a terrible airport with three security checks, passport control and a feeling that you're selling your soul for a discount flight. Food is mediocre. Online entertainment consists of a handful of heavily censored vanilla Hollywood flicks. Expect half of the passengers to stand up the minute the landing gear hits the ground, sparking a very loud shouting match in Chinese Mandarin between the hostesses and unruly passengers to put a nice finishing touch to your experience. It never ceases to amaze me how this airline became a Skyteam member. Any other airline for your flight to Asia should be used if you want a pleasant beginning and end to your journey. You deserve better.

### "hassle is simply not worth it"
Taipei to Frankfurt via Shanghai. The first leg from Taipei to Shanghai was operated by China Airlines, the Shanghai to Frankfurt leg by China Eastern Airlines, both members of Skyteam. Upon checking in at Taipei with China Airlines I was told that due to Mainland China's regulations, China Eastern Airlines cannot check through my suitcase at Shanghai, since this can only be done when connecting "on the same day". Incidentally, in Shanghai upon re-checking in my luggage I was told a different tale, namely that it's due to being "two different airlines". My comment that the implication of this justification would be that no transfer at any other global hub would ever work - more so given that they are part of the same airline alliance - was met with baffled faces. The arrival of my flight from Taipei in Shanghai was at 18:35hrs, the onward flight to Frankfurt at 00:10, so "on the next day": the ridiculousness of this cannot be overstated. The implications of this I knew from a previous Air China flight from Taiwan to Germany. It means an arduous procedure of being confronted with the increasingly aggressive and assertive Chinese surveillance state, having fingerprints and iris scans taken and having to apply for a 24hr transit visa (!) in order to then have the privilege to collect your suitcase, clear Shanghai customs and queue again for a good hour at the China Eastern Airlines check in desk. To add to this is the hassle of getting a stable Wifi connection (only available to non-Chinese nationals after a passport scan, so more data collected) to spend the time in Shanghai Pudong. At the end of the experience you are so exhausted and glad to get away that the measly service and poor food onboard China Eastern won't phase you any more. China Eastern Airlines are trying very hard to appear to be modern and service-oriented and have cheap and very tempting offers from Europe to the rest of Asia via China, but the reality is the opposite. Don't fly via China on China Eastern  to save a few bucks! The hassle encountered is simply not worth it.

### "Frequent drink rounds"
Shanghai to Hong Kong. Came from Budapest and had a smooth transit in Shanghai where I boarded the China Eastern flight to Hongkong on an A321. It was early morning 2nd January 2020. Priority boarding at gate as SKY team silver card. Onboard, newspapers were given (Chinese). Shared monitors showed some educational movies from underwater sea world which was nice and informative, texted in English. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1½ hour while the flight lasted additional 50 Minutes. During descend services closed down until landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Fair legacy carrier service without pay. Cheap ticket, better product than for most European carriers. Luggage transfer faultless (in custody inspected by customs which left a note – nothing missing). Full flight. On time. Mileage rendered to Skyteam account. Jetties availed for aircraft entering and exit. What is needed is a hot meal, extended time of service, and individual IFE.

### "really not that bad"
Taipei to Sydney via Shanghai. We flew return SYD-TPE with transit in Kunming on the way to Taipei and Shanghai Pudong on the way back to Sydney in December 2019. It was our very first time travelling with China Eastern and did not have high expectations, to begin with since reading many of those bad reviews. Here is how it goes for us: Upon receiving my e-ticket, I cannot use the ticket verification function on their website because the purchase was made through the third party. However, I was able to select seats on their website - so that was good. Check-in in Sydney was easy and quick. Only then we were made to realize that transit in Kunming requires us to get our luggage and go through check-in desk again, the staff, however, said that 3 hours layover should be more than enough for all that process. Flight from Sydney to Kunming: spacious seats compared to the newer plane from PVG - SYD, however lack of padding so it's a bit hard to sleep on. Entertainment was not too bad, not extensive but since my flight was overnight, I slept most of the time. FAs were all smiley but felt a bit robotic. Meals (both dinner and breakfast) was ok for us - my husband enjoyed his braised pork belly dinner. Didn't have the alcohol so can't comment on how good or if they had enough throughout the flight. Do not expect to see nice amenities kit here. Check-in in Kunming was a problem due to the language barrier. She kept insisting we don't have proof of residency but didn't relay the message to us. Wasted about 30 minutes on things that could have been cleared right away should the staff able to relay her concern to us than going around to her manager to finally realised she made a mistake. No apologies whatsoever. Lounge at Kunming was just sad and had so little to offer. Flight from Kunming to Taipei: good seat, really good FA service, she tried her best to communicate with us in broken English and we really appreciated her for this - redemption point after what happened in Kunming airport. Check-in in Taipei was easy and she informed us that no need to pick up the luggage in Shanghai, they will be transferred to our next flight to Sydney. Good lounge at Taoyuan Airport, was very quiet when we were there. Flight from TPE to PVG: same good seat as Kunming to Taipei, good light meal served, not so friendly FA, unfortunately. Flight from PVG to SYD: I had the best service on this leg. The seat was comfortable for sleeping with nice L'occitane amenities kit. I have to applaud the FA serving my row, he was thorough. sincere and speaks English well, personally explained the new procedure on landing at SYD even though there is an announcement later on. The FA on my husband's row, however, was not as attentive, she didn't even ask what breakfast he likes and suddenly a western set was served. Overall, I think it's really not that bad and I wouldn't mind flying with them again if there was a good deal. It probably not as nice service in Economy class as many bad reviews point at - but we didn't have those issues in Business class. All four flights left on time. Do notice that the FA will tell you to not use headphone anymore around 1 hour before landing.

### "Don’t fly with China Eastern"
Vancouver to Shanghai. Poor ground staff service. The person who helped me check in threw tantrums at me when I did nothing to him. His attitude totally made me feel miserable, and ruined my trip with China eastern. This airline needs serious training for these ground staff. When I asked him if there’s empty seats in premium economy, he said “there’s no such thing” without even looking up. I guess he just never flew with his own airline? What does he even mean there is no such thing. And I picked a seat I wanted, he asked me “don’t you want you original seat?” I said “ cuz that was given by Expedia (Which means I didn’t pick the seat and I don’t want it). Without letting me finish, he interrupted me and said “that’s not what I’m asking, I need a yes or no” in a really really rude tone. No one ever talked to me like that. I believe their staff need to know how to respect other people. I wanted to complain this to the airline but I haven’t found a way to contact them. Don’t fly with China Eastern.

### "devastated and disappointed"
Sydney to Rome via Shanghai. First of all i need to shame Qantas for selling me this flight via their reward system. As a platinum frequent flyer im deeply disappointed you associate yourself and expose your customer to this airline with sub-par services. We started the journey from Sydney in a very small cramped economy seat. If you are taller than 178cm and weight more than 80kg then you are going to feel squashed in their economy seats. The staff barely speak any English and leave us stuck in our seats without water or liquids. The inflight entertainment is sub-par. Mostly Asian films. The food onboard was horrible. Absolutely inedible and tiny tiny portions. No snacks offered during the flight. China Eastern airlines also didn't recognise my platinum status at the airport in Shanghai and therefore i was not allowed lounge access. To top things off, they lost my luggage. It never arrived in Rome. I had booked my luggage straight through from Sydney to Rome at the checkin desk and had my luggage receipt handy as proof. Apparently it will take at least 3 days to find my bag and no compensation offered. I have no spare clothes, toiletries or shoes. I was just given a reference number and told to wait and hope. Qantas should not be associating with this airline and nobody who is expecting a decent flight with good service should ever fly China Eastern, I'm devastated and disappointed.

### "good food and service"
Hong Hong to Budapest via Shanghai. Flew on A320 on HKG to Shanghai while in a newer B787-9 on the long haul to Budapest. China Eastern marketed flights. The long haul leg was flown by their daughter company Shanghai Airlines to Budapest. Amazing experience, pure adventure. Bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to Europe as a huge bargain for 347 USD including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near X-mas. It costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which I volunteered as I needed the extra miles for my elite status. However, I was notified (2 months before travel) by my online travel agent (Travelgenio), that the return flight from Budapest was preponed by 1 hour. Then, I was forced to change as I would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure. I then decided to change plans completely and celebrate New Year in Budapest instead of Vietnam. Thus, I postponed my return travel from Budapest by 3 days. This was done by emails to the Travel Agent (no response) and then phone calls to Ch. Eastern in Brisbane and Shanghai. Eventually, it went smoothly and I was changed to my wish without added costs (apart from changing onward flights beyond Hong Kong with another airline). That even allowed me to do another, cheap detour to Hanoi on my way back to Hue. The homepages of China Eastern and Shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from. Unless one has a Chinese telephone number. However, 10 days before departure I could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats, even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat. However, one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with CE’s flyer program in which I am not interested. Apart from that it was a good adventure: a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong, but all went smooth. Arrived in Hongkong early and was able to check-in 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily. No queues at the check-in and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking English. Two BPs issued immediately. Flying HKG-PVG is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic. That give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving HKG and passing PVG. First flight was on an aged A320. Extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers. Onboard, newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered (bring own headset). Shared monitors showed some educational movies. Food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits. Drinks were unlimited (water, tea, coffee, beers), but only for 1 hour out of the 2½ hour long flight: during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 Minutes after kick-off and again 40 Minutes before landing. That leaves passengers with very limited time of service. FAs were fine. The second flight were by Shanghai Airlines’ Dreamliner. It was a very positive surprise and was faultless. Modern aircraft, good food and service, 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast. Frequent drink rounds. Button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly. Individual IFE on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of Western and English translated movies. Toilets clean. Both flights took off earlier than scheduled.

### "I have no real complaints"
Not Verified |  I found a really good deal on business class flights to Singapore from Chicago. I was very leery at first due to some of the reviews but I had a very pleasant experience. The staff was helpful and the plane was nice. Dealing with the US customer service to pick seats etc is a little frustrating but overall I have no real complaints.

### "lousy and regrettable experience"
Not Verified |  Special Needs for a Wheelchair passenger by China Eastern Airlines is ignored during flights from Vancouver to Shanghai. The in-flight service between Vancouver to Shanghai has substandard meal service and inflight service staff ignore you to provide any drinking water. The shocking encounter is that the Shanghai Airport wheel-chair porter left me abandoned in the end-corner of the terminal because I did did not give him cash. The service support is a very poor, lousy and regrettable experience. I will never ever recommend anyone to fly with China Eastern Airlines again!

### "unprofessional and liars"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Cebu via Shanghai. I had knee replacement 13 weeks prior to this trip so I ordered and paid extra money for bulkhead seats. Upon arrival in China my knee was sore and swollen so I asked for a wheelchair. I was promptly told no, you don't need a wheelchair. On the return flight we did not get the bulkhead seats I paid for. I asked for an upgrade or a refund for the last leg of the flight. I was told the plane is full and that to get a refund I need to call this number. I took pictures on the plane of 12 empty business class seats. I called the number and gave them the confirmation receipt and was I ordered the upgrade too long ago and their is nothing they can do now. They are rude, unprofessional and liars.

### "Save yourself money and time"
Not Verified | Shanghai to Bangkok. Save yourself some money and time, don't book with this airline! 1) They rescheduled my flight 3 times (all inconvenient times) 2) they didn't allow route changes when calling to change the flights they cancelled. 3) Their US office has 8-5 workdays so if you work you may not be able to reach them to change the flights they cancelled. 4) They finally cancelled my flight last minute and didn't provide any alternative options. Basically, they are a scam company and will make your life a living hell, stay away and book with a reputable airline.

### "a decent domestic flight"
Taiyuan to Shanghai. China Eastern has a dedicated check-in and security screening area at Taiyuan airport for business class customers, which is nice. However, the lounge was very small with no toilet. The aircraft cabin was similar to domestic short-haul equipment in the US, with recliners for business class. Cabin service was excellent. Meal was nicely presented, though I don't find it tasty. Overall, it was a decent domestic flight.

### "Passport validity only until March 2020"
Los Angeles to Colombo via Shangai. In Shangai i was issued a boarding pass to Colombo. At the gate I was refused boarding stating that my Passport validity was only until March 2020. I requested that they let me go through & I will get help in Sri Lanka & I am a citizen of the US who will be in CMB only for 2 weeks. They refused to listen or help & used my return air ticket without my knowledge or approval, changed the date on it & put me on the return flight to LAX. Had this happened at LAX I could have got a refund on my air ticket. Now the Airline says the first leg & last leg of my ticket has been used & therefore they cannot refund. Any part of this air ticket was used only because the Agent made a mistake & did not do her job. You can't speak to anyone at Customer service as they are very arrogant & rude.

### "I'd travel with them again"
Chicago to Shanghai. Great flights. The plane was clean. I had a window seat in the far back of the plane. I spite of other comments, this area of the plane is quiet. Yes, it's near a restroom, but it doesn't smell, there was never a line of people, and in this area are only two seats near the rear so, lots of extra space to stretch out and stand around for a bit during the long flight. They provide a blanket and pillow and complimentary earphones. The seat backs have touch screen entertainment with movies, music, and games. I'd travel with them again.

### "They said I needed a visa"
Kathmandu to Seattle via Kunming / Shanghai. I flew to Kathmandu, Nepal with China Eastern without any problems. When it was time to fly home I was denied access to my return trip home. They said I needed a visa before I can leave Nepal since my layovers in China would put me over 2hrs in China. Instead I had to rebook a one way flight home some other way. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "very good experience"
Chengdu to Nanjing, very good experience. During the flight. I got sleepy and I cannot find my glasses. Cabin crew help me for finding. The cabin crew never give up when I all ready dropped. At last they find it. I quite appreciated about this. Thanks a lot for their help.

### "airline is 100% frustrating"
Not Verified | San Francisco to Shanghai. Every aspect of my experience with this airline is 100% frustrating. I completely regret everything about this flight. Even before my flight I could see that it was a mistake to choose this horrible airline. Booking has been difficult, the website is broken. Trying to fix my ticket requires a call to customer service - which means losing hours out of your life on hold. Once I finally got through to a customer service representative, they were useless to the point of idiocy. Thanks to their broken website and miserable CSR's, I was unable to select my own seat, resulting in my entire family being spread around the aircraft, my children sitting alone in center seats between two strangers. My family checked four bags. One of which was lost and another was broken. I haven't filled out a claim form yet for the lost bag, but I already know that the customer service team is staffed by subhuman, uncaring scumbags. Judging from other people's comments, I will never see my luggage again. This lost bag has had a pretty bad effect on my vacation. My children are crying. Thank you for nothing, China Eastern Airlines, you pile of garbage.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
Los Angeles to Male via Shanghai. I was a bit skeptical of flying China Eastern but I will have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The crews on all four flights where great. While their English wasn't top notch it was better than my Chinese so have to give them points for that. Service was decent if a bit more subtle than say CX or SG. Food was on par with US international long haul in business, but did notice the crew tended to not give the non-Chinese passengers the Chinese snack option. After the second flight I realized this and ordered the Wonton Soup as my snack on the remaining two. The seats where fine, again on par with standard long haul business even if the cabin was a bit warm. Couldn't figure out how to get the WiFi to work and yes we did register prior to boarding with their app. We did the 144-hour transit Visa and spent a couple days in Shanghai before heading to Male. Was laid out in easy to follow signage. On the return we did a longer layover and the Lounge in the new terminal was good. It did tend to get crowded in waves over the course of our 6 hours there. My only gripe was none of the showers where operational because “new and water no good yet”. But all in all, have to say it was certainly worth the money and would fly them again.

### "absolutely no customer service"
Not Verified |  Shanghai to London. Awful experience. Rude staff with absolutely no customer service. Food inedible. Poor choice of films for such a long flight. Only saving grace there was adequate leg room. It would seem that there is no customer service training given or the staff simple do not care. I would not recommend this airline

### "Service was excellent"
Gatwick to Shanghai. Check in was efficient. Nice new plane. Welcome on board was standard for business class travel. Seats and beds were very good. Service was excellent throughout, as was the food. I ordered fillet steak - a good test, it was delicious, pink in the middle. No issues at all, so I am surprised by negative reviews. IFE was a disappointment for a UK passenger.

### "Rude staff. Poor service"
Kuala Lumpur to Vancouver via Shanghai. Ever get that feeling when you realize that you are a fool for making a certain purchase? That's China Eastern Airlines. Horrible food. Rude staff. Poor service. Uncomfortable Seats. It's like they take pride in giving awful service. The only good thing I can say is the seats were cheap but having said that, you will get much better value paying more for any other airline.

### "flight delayed due to weather"
Shenyang to Shanghai. I was scheduled to fly to Shanghai on 9.6 at 1:15pm. The airline informed us that our flight was delayed due to weather (typhoon Lingling). We didn’t get on board until 2:30pm. After getting on board, the captain announced that we didn’t get permission to take off from PVG due to weather issue. However, there were 4 other flights to PVG scheduled to take off between 12:00pm and 3:00pm, all of which were able to take off before 4pm, including one flight with Shanghai airline, which is owned by China eastern. I would have no problem with being delayed. However, flights scheduled to take off before and after our flight were able to take off, and some even took off right after the announcement from the captain. I am questioning the real reason that we are getting delayed. Also the in flight meal is plain as usual.

### "The worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Shanghai. The worst airline ever, the customer service is very, very bad, they cancel flights as they like, and often they sell your seat in the plane to someone else and they tell you that you are late for the flight and the plane is then at the airport, the worst thing I've ever met was Shanghai Airport. Neither respect the mother nor the child. They keep us in China for five days with my twin children without apologizing.

### "not that good"
Wuhan to Taiyuan. The experience was not that good. It is a mid-night red eye flight, however, the cabin is so noisy and none of cabin crew come out to maintain the order. The snack means just a pack of peanuts.

### "Dreadful service!"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Paris via Shanghai. Airplanes are relatively new but the maintenance on board is low. Broken USB charging plugs, broken remote control for the entertainment system, broken headphones jack, broken lock in the lavatory etc. It is worse especially due to the fact Chinese airlines do not allow you to use power-banks onboard. Means you can't use your phone as an alternative for long. Another part is the service, China Eastern provides very basic service, not to say rough. It is all very technical without any understanding of what service means. Don't expect a smile or nice gesture, you won't get it. One lovely thing is the free WIFI access on the flight, but it is so restricted to western site that you can forget about Google, Facebook, VoIP, most messaging apps, Yahoo search etc. Eventually, when I arrived at my destination, I've noticed major damage to my suitcase. I've reported the damage, filled up a form, send several emails etc, 3 months passed and I haven't got any compensation yet. China Eastern doesn't answer online, they don't respond on Facebook, on their website or to emails. They are practically not there. Dreadful service!

### "above my expectations"
Rome to Seoul via Shanghai. I traveled with this company that I was a little skeptical of but I must say that not only was it far above my expectations but it earned my esteem. Rome-Shanghai (and back) with a new A350-900, comfortable seats, clean plane and with assistants present and kind. Classic food of the economy class while actually somewhat disappointing on-board entertainment considering that it was a flight departing from Italy was expected titles at least in the Italian language. But where I must congratulate the company is the way they managed the typhoon emergency in Shanghai, I had to take a flight to Seoul and was canceled with the closure of the airport, but the company not only provided escort to the hotel with a shuttle bus but also food and accommodation for two days. Although the information was lacking (it all happened suddenly) have, within 4/5 hours settled thousands of people in the hotel with their transfers. That was really impressive.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Siem Reap via Shanghai. Worst airline ever. Customer service is the worst. On July 25 we were scheduled to fly out of Los Angeles at 1230pm on China Eastern Airline flight 586 to Shanghai; however, the flight was delayed by two hours and we departed at 2:30pm. When we arrived in Shanghai on July 26, our connection flight to Siem Reap, Cambodia, flight number 513, had already left. The China Eastern Airline agent changed our flight and said he would give us two connection flights: the first connection was to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, then to Siem Reap. But, when we arrived to Ho Chi Minh city, the flight to Siem Reap was not booked by the China Eastern Agent; therefore, we had to buty 2 new tickets to Siem Reap. The flight delay from Los Angels to Shanghai was not our fault but the airline’s and were greatly inconvenienced. This was a horrible experience. I called and went to the office. Heard nothing yet.

### "They had the cheapest tickets"
They had the cheapest tickets from Bali to Amsterdam via Shanghai with a layover of 17 hours. (visiting Shanghai is worth it, but bring cash because credit cards won't be accepted). First flight departed before scheduled time and arrived 20 minutes early. Quite new plane Airbus A330 (2 years old) with big screen for in-flight-entertainment. Clean, comfortable and looked luxury even in Economy Class. Staff can improve their hospitality a lot. They only know few English words. Second flight departed 15 minutes later but arrived 1,5 hour earlier. Plane was the modern new Airbus A350-900 (only 6 months old) with again great in-flight-entertainment system. Plane has three camera's outside, so you can watch from your own screen what the pilots are seeing. Again staff can improve a lot. Meals on both flights were good. Expected worse. We arranged when booked a special meal because of gluten intolerance, and this meal was good as well. Also we had WiFi on both flights. Worked good.

### "no Customer Service for non Chinese"
We bought a Lisbon to Melbourne flight from Air France, the leg between Shanghai and Melbourne was operated by China Eastern Airlines. First we were unable to check-in for this China Eastern flight online, at the airport and in Paris, while in transit. No one from Air France could help us with this and the explanation was that the systems did not connect between airlines. When we got to Shanghai we were given boarding passes. But it was after this that all the mess started. First the flight was delayed 1 hour, no explanation given. Then the flight was delayed 3 hours. After 4 hours we were board but the plane did not take off. We were stuck in the plane for another hour, and the stewardesses could not explain why. A meal was served in the taxied airplane. We finally left 5 hours delayed, at 1am, and instead of arriving in Melbourne in the morning we got there around midday. Coming back home I tried to complain to Air France, useless, it was not their flight, although sold by them, we had to contact China Eastern. Where? There is no global European site. There were some phone numbers that answered in Chinese, big help for most of the foreigner clients. Finally I got some email from someone saying he was my complain commissioner, asking me for all the documents, which I sent. This was on 19th March. By 29th March he said he had all he needed and they would deal with it. Since then I contacted every month and had no answer back. Resuming, there is no Customer Service at all for non Chinese citizens and buying China Eastern flights in other companies is also a big no no.

### "wheel chair assistance not provided"
Delhi to Brisbane via Shanghai. The requested wheel chair assistance was not provided in New Delhi airport. In Shanghai Airport we got wheel chair after a long wait, the wheel chair assistant was highly impolite and very very rude person, can't expect someone like him working at an international airport where people from different nationalities commute. At the time of boarding at Shanghai airport it was raining heavily and staircase to the aircraft was uncovered causing the passengers to get wet.

### "my worst flying experience"
Shanghai to San Francisco. This was my worst flying experience. On our way to Thailand, our flight was delayed in San Francisco causing us to miss our connecting flight in Shanghai. No big deal we thought, until we got to the ticket counter and the guy working was trying to blame us for missing our flight. I tried explaining that our flight was delayed causing us to arrive late and miss the flight. Never did he say sorry or show any sympathy. I explained to him how we were missing a day in our already paid for resort, an excursion, and our pre paid car. He said 'so what, were getting you free tickets'. No, we already paid and missing this flight was their fault not ours. Whatever, we made it work, rerouted to Bangkok and then Phuket. Lost out on over $400. On our way home, leaving Shanghai our flight was once again delayed. They sent us an email two hours before in Chinese. This once again caused us to miss our connecting flight back home to Denver from San Francisco. I understand things happen, but they showed no sympathy and instead of offering us compensation for our lost time and money, they made us feel uncomfortable the whole time. The extra money to fly with another airline is worth it.

### "tickets were extremely cheap"
Flew with China Eastern from Gatwick to Bali via Shanghai and back to Heathrow. Flight from Gatwick was poor compared to the flight back to Heathrow. On the return leg the food was good and flight attendants attentive. However, the flight from Gatwick could be much improved. We were served food within an hour of departure and then didn't see the flight attendants again until two hours before we landed; an almost 8 hour absence. No snacks. No water. 8 hours. Flight to Bali on old a330, no entertainment and again, limited FA presence. However, tickets were extremely cheap and so long as you stock up with water and snacks before the flight it is worth travelling with them for the cheap tickets.

### "never fly China Eastern again"
Chicago to Bangkok via Shanghai. I am a physician, normally fly at least 1-2 times/year, for volunteer medical/surgical mission work. I used China Eastern airline for the first time, flying out Jan 30. I had problem at the airport when checking in, which never before in my traveling experience. My passport has printed out my first and middle name in short and not spelled out in full as in ticket. I showed 3 different government issued IDs to identify myself. The counter agent would not issue me a boarding pass and insisted that my traveling agent change my ticket name. When I called the traveling agent, they would take 2 days, and advised me to ask the airline agent at the airport to do that for me. However, the airport agent and her supervisor refused to help me at all. They were extremely rude to me, literally man-handled me to step aside so they can help other customer. I stood there for over 1 hr. Finally, I asked my traveling agent to book me with the different airline at the same day or tomorrow flight. When I asked the supervisor to do in writing that they refused to issue me my boarding pass and the reason, she came out later and told me that she can now help me correct the name on ticket to be exactly same as the passport. The aircraft was quite old, not a lot of comforting equipment. WiFi was not working, and when asked the flight attendant, she said will let me know when function return, but she never told me for the rest of 14 hr flight. Flight attendant never once ask what I need during the entire flight, I had to press call button and wait for 30 min each time I need something. In conclusion, the service was worst than economy class, despite being business class. On the way returning from Bangkok, I did not have any problem at the counter at all, although took extra 15 min to check in due to my name on passport again. The food was also just tasted like coming from a vending machine. Even though the ticket in business class is $1,000 cheaper than other airline, I will never fly with China Eastern again. Furthermore, my brand new luggage was completely destroyed

### "bus to and from the aircraft"
This is a generic review for China Eastern. As usual, I need to add 30-49 minutes on each keg at both each airport because Chiba Eastern is too cheap to pay for an actual gate. 85% of the time when flying on MU you will need to take a bus to and from the aircraft which causes so many additional delays.

### "would never use again"
Cebu to Chicago via Shanghai. This was the worst flight I have ever flown. The staff was not very friendly. The food was terrible, and this has been the only airline that didn't have me verify your food choices before the flight. I was told that I needed to have done that before somehow (never has this happen before), this meant they didn't have anything vegetarian to eat unless ordered before. There was only one food option for the other people and again never had a flight with only one option. Staff did dig up a couple small things like a fruit cup, donut etc which was greatly appreciated for the 14 hour flight. Hugely dissatisfied with this flight experience and would never use again.

### "recommend it for the price"
Toronto to Cebu via Shanghai. I stayed up the night before my flight, petrified of of the terrible reviews I was reading. It wasn't a bad experience, well worth the price of my roundtrip from Canada to the Philippines with a quick stopover in Shanghai. You can't expect premium service for bargain prices, but I'd say nothing was bad about this airline, just average quality (minus the wi-fi, which was non-existent). I found the food perfectly fine- no vegetarian options, but it was served hot and was serviceable, though definitely nothing to write home about. The staff were pleasant enough and had decent English, the in-flight entertainment had an average selection of movies with Chinese subs, and the plane itself was very clean and comfortable enough, if a bit cramped. What matters was every flight left on time and got me to my destination in one piece. Overall I'd recommend it for the price.

### "Absolute worst"
Kuala Lumpur to Toronto via Shanghai. Absolute worst. Booked a flight with China Eastern for May 16th (Kuala Lumpur 2a.m. To Shanghai arr 7:30a.m./Shanghai midday to Toronto 2:25pm. That same day). I then booked a independent ticket to my final destination Montreal couple hours after my planned arrival in Toronto. After couple weeks, get an email that the airline has modified my itinerary. My flight from Shanghai to Toronto remained the same, but my flight from Kuala Lumpur departs at 4p.m. And land in shanghai at 10:30pm. How am I suppose to then leave from Shanghai at midday if I only arrive hours later. Obviously I can’t. Trying to contact the airline is the worst, no email address, totally useless on Messenger, several phone number for HotLine. Unfortunately, they keep you on hold for ever and if you luckily Finally get to talk to someone, they just hang up on you. It is a rather stressing process, and costly as having to pay for all these minutes of International calls while oversea. Luckily for me, I booked through an agency which finally managed to get me on a flight a day earlier which would get me to destination. I tried still to contact the airline has they usually would have to accommodate me for the now 27 wait I have in Toronto, but they refused to do so. Even worst, they did not even apologize for the inconvenience and extra cost this is causing me. They were also denying they changed the flight at first, trying to blame the agency, telling me I should had ask for support while on layover in shanghai, etc. She finally admitted the first flight I was booked on had been cancelled,etc. Still no kind of compensation, no apologies. i had tried contacting the airline for more than 6 weeks by now, which I had proof of. For the flight experience it is not terrible but pretty average. The flight attendant were not helping people store their luggage in the overhead compartment, so boarding was a bit chaotic. Also many customer were too short to access these compartments. Seat area is spacious, thank God on a 14 hrs flight. Flight entertainment offers an average and limited selection. Flight attendant were not rude, but not really friendly or helpful. They did not respond to the service button request. We got served two meals and a snack on a 14 hrs flight. The snack was a tuna sandwich (quite hard and dry), since I don’t like fish, I asked if there was another option. The flight attendant told me next meal is at midnight. Next meal was awful, plane food is not usually that exciting, but this I could literally not keep in my mouth. Sides are really light too so can’t rely on that to fill up. Luckily they serve butter and bread so I just asked for extra. They ran out of many drinks option. On a 14 hrs flight, not being able to get any other juice than orange, or no wine available from mid flight is pretty lame. This is my first time ever writing a review for an airline, and I fly quite frequently. I have use low cost airline which offer better customer service than this. I live on undeveloped islands in Cambodia, I am not a princess nor fussy. But this was a truly frustrating experience. So much stress for weeks not knowing if I would have to buy a different flight myself and loose money. I had confirmation from agency that my flight was changed, but on airline website, no departure info was available after the modification. It only showed my return details. So until I checked in and got my boarding pass, I still wasn’t sure I was truly booked in.

### "the cabin was outdated"
Beijing to Dongying. It's a short domestic flight in the evening. Shouldn't expect a lot for 1 hour flight in single aisle aircraft. It's good that they still offer desserts and drink in business class. But the cabin was outdated, entertainment screen are smaller than most economy screen in intercontinental flights. Limited choices for movies and everything, hard to operate and hard to switch off.

### "a very pleasant journey"
Shanghai to Rome. For economy this is was a very pleasant journey. Had a seat by the exit which allowed for plenty of leg room. Hostesses were all friendly. The IF system could do with a refinement as the volume wasnt good and the choice limited. Also the food was not great but ok overall.

### "I had modest expectations"
Beijing to Hong Kong via Shanghai. I had modest expectations for these flights with China Eastern, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are still vestiges of the airline's struggle with the smoking culture of China. - they seem to have managed to quash the habit of the flight crew to surreptitiously smoke, but in some other places, the smell has lingered. The van used to transport business class passengers to the parked aircraft smelled like we were traveling inside an over-used ashtray. Other aspects of the experience were more positive. The aircraft was clean and neat. The flight attendants were cheerful and attentive and did their best to communicate in English - I was impressed considering that the first segment was a domestic flight from Beijing to Shanghai. The meal options were well presented. Beer and wine  generously offered, but no harder options were available. We departed and arrived on-time, and my suitcase was on the belt when I cleared immigration. The lounge experience was acceptable, but I will address that in another review.

### "cancelled my pre-booked seat"
Kuala Lumpur to Toronto via Shanghai. The worst airline ever. KUL to PVG May2 and PVG to YYZ May 3. They lost my check bag on the first flight, and on the second flight they have cancelled my pre-booked seat. When I talked to them, the attitude is, I will simply give you a seat, take it or leave it.

### "food was surprisingly good"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Beijing via Shangai. My experience was very good for the flight itself. Boarding was easy, crew was friendly, the plane looked new and very clean and the food was surprisingly good! We were 2 hours late leaving JFK with no announcements as to why (turned out the weather in Shanghai was bad where we had a connecting flight.) So, I missed my flight to Beijing and no one could speak English to help us. The only next flight was 2:45 the next day which meant we missed a day with our tour group. We also had problems finding our luggage. The airline did provide us with a hotel that night which was comfortable. My only real complaint was that none of the airline employees at the airport seemed concerned about anything or wanting to help.

### "no airline staff were available"
Our ticket was from Beijing to Delhi, flt no MU563 dated 28 April 19. We checked in at Beijing, counter staff couldn't tell us whether flt to Delhi via Shanghai was on the same aircraft or a change at Shanghai was needed. Single Boarding pass was given from Beijing to Delhi with seat nos. My seat no was 38H. Aircraft at Beijing itself was delayed by 2 hours, however, no proper intimation given to passengers. Language was another problem at Beijing airport. On boarding, none of the cabin crew could clarify whether we remain in the same aircraft on landing at Shanghai or deboard and change the aircraft. At Shanghai when aircraft was almost empty, we were asked to deboard without further directions. On arrival at Shanghai terminal, we were at loss for some time as no airline staff were available to direct Delhi passengers. Wheelchair passengers and senior citizens faced special problem. After 30 minutes, seeing large number of people asking about Delhi flight, one airline staff appeared, probably on pressure from airport security. The staff herded us to various counters of immigration and full security checks (again). We had to run at every counter to catch the flight. Things could have been well handled airline by making proper announcements at Beijing airport, in aircraft and at Shanghai airport. China Eastern Airlines should take corrective measures in future.

### "Very bad experience"
Shanghai to Sydney. Absolutely rude staff at the check in. We were travelling as a couple and were given two seperate seats 30 rows apart. We asked staff to see if they could reunite us given that my wife was pregnant and I couldn't leave her alone for the duration of the flight. Staff were very reluctant to help and had a very aggressive and rude attitude towards us. It looked like staff were not expecting such a simple request and were looking at us as if we were criminals for making such a request! Very bad experience with this airline. In-flight service was mediocre and very basic.

### "friendly, helpful cabin crew"
SYD-PVG then AMS-PVG and PVG-SYD (three long-haul flights) over Feb and March. Each flight left and arrived as scheduled and was a pleasant experience with friendly, helpful cabin crew. Meal options (4) were each very tasty (especially the Asian options) and alcohol generously served throughout the flight. An assortment of self-serve snacks were available between meals. The lie-flat beds were a little tight around the feet, and the cabin a little warm for a perfect sleep on the three overnight flights but nevertheless a reasonable number of hours of Z's were achieved. If requested, the crew will leave you asleep and not wake you for meals. IFE had a reasonable selection of recent release and an assortment of foreign films. Not the greatest in the world, but OK for the average 10 hour sectors. The spoken English standard of the crew was variable, but communication overall was not a problem either in the air or at check-in.

### "scary and costly experience"
Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai. 48 hrs into our hazardous experience trying to get home, I wish I had known about China Eastern Airlines. My husband and I arrived in Kuala Lumpur on April 18th around midnight to catch a connecting flight on our way home from vacation (leaving Borneo headed for Reno, NV). Our connecting flight was to leave approx 2am. I was held up because my ticket said Jill Hansen and my passport said Jill A Hansen. No amount of common sense would apply. No matter how many countries or check points I had crossed. Nor would China Eastern change the name on my ticket per my authorization. They insisted Malaysia Airlines needed to make the change. My husband requested by phone that Malaysia Airlines make the change and they refused saying China Eastern could make the change. We were effectively trapped in the Kuala Lumpur airport. Also China Eastern said we had missed the connecting flight much earlier (anyway) as their flights close one hour prior to take off? We found that quite unusual, but the front staff supervisor insisted this was accurate. China Eastern staff also assured us all flights were booked the next day. We could not understand what was happening and grew very frightened of this company and their staff. We called another airline, Cathay Pacific and booked a flight out. It cost us $2400. We were not alone. Several other families were being trapped under the same ruse. We escaped, but a warning needs to go out to US travelers. It is very scary and costly experience. Please start communicating this. I’m still not home after almost 3 days of travel, but wanted to share this story. When we asked them to provide a letter or some documentation on our missed flight and the reason we were not allowed on the plane, they directed us to an office on another floor. They assured us someone would be there to assist us. We hiked to this office only to find a dark hall and a locked door.

### "Total chaos at check-in"
Not Verified | Shanghai to Melbourne. MU737 on 19th April 2019. Total chaos at check-in. Ground staff was not able to manage the queues. Arrived at checkin gate 2.5 hours prior to departure, almost missed the flight

### "uncomfortable and unpleasant"
Not Verified | Yangon to New Zealand via Kunming. Do not fly to NZ on this airline. You have to get de-embark and reembark in China and Sydney, luggage and all. China is a terrible place to fly through, rude, officious, uncomfortable and unpleasant.

### "never choose this airline again"
Kunming to Shenzhen. My wife and I went up to Check-in Counter E36 at about 7:15 am on 2 April, about 3 hours before the time of our flight --- fortunately. After checking our China permits and HKSAR passports, the lady told us that the reservation list did contain our names. But the corresponding numbers for our names are totally different from our permit/passport numbers. So she couldn't give us the plane tickets, even though we had paid for them on-line at Expedia website. At first, she did not want to help us at all. Then we insisted to see her supervisor. Shortly afterwards, a man came and simply told us the problem was with Expedia and not with the airline, that we should call Expedia and asked them to change the numbers for our names accordingly. After more arguments, he asked the lady at Counter E36 to help us. She took us to another counter where many more phone calls were made. Finally, they fixed the problem and gave us the tickets. The whole fuss went on for about 45 minutes and at the end we were not given any explanation for the problem. Nor was any apology given. They kept insisting that the problem was ours and the airline was not responsible for the mistake. During all my trips, I never experienced anything like that. I will never choose this airline again.

### "most unprofessional experience"
Not Verified |  Paris to Sydney via Shanghai. By far, the rudest and most unprofessional experience I have ever encountered with airline and customs staff! I used the bathroom when we boarded the plane, only to find that the toilet was dirty and there was no hand soap to use! This was before take-off on an 10-12 hour international flight. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. I have no idea how or why they are even in this industry at all. When my partner politely asked for a glass of water, the air hostess rolled her eyes at him, let out a huge sigh and pulled a face like it was the most inconvenient thing to be asked. Another hostess had an almost identical reaction when a woman asked for another blanket. The food was reminiscent of the really old, bad airline food of yesteryear. Also, the food was very few and far between. We went 8 hours without food at one stage. I asked for a snack at this point, & was told there were no snacks or anything to offer. Before the first trolley run of drinks even reached our row, all wine and beer on the plane had ran out. This was less than 1 hour into a 10-12 hour international flight. How can they run out of beer & wine?? When I asked this, the hostess held up 1 single bottle of red wine & said “it’s gone” and then kept pushing the trolley by us. We were shocked. The earphones provided allow zero sound to come through from the movie, so we didn’t end up watching anything at all, because it was impossible to hear any sound. The airport staff at customs were extremely rude and unhelpful also. When I tried to ask questions, I was ignored. My partner had to get angry and insistent before anyone would Listen or assist us. I had one female customs staff member scowl at me the entire time I stood in front of her. The other 2 females on the customs gate sat on their mobile phones whist the info was loading on their computers and then again between passengers. I strongly advise Westerners not to bother with this company and just pay the extra for an airline that will be respectful of all people and cultures, and also one that adheres to general hygiene standards and customer service standards.

### "Flights were all delayed"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Singapore via Shanghai. Flights were all delayed. Internet never worked. Even with in-flight staff giving assistance (restart your computer) it wouldn't work. Entertainment is old. Food is small and bad. I took a picture of one of my 'sandwiches'. It was 6" bun with 2" x 2" of bologna. It was all dry bread. Their idea of a sandwich is a small loaf of dry bread. Not one of the in-flight crew were polite or smiled. Seems that the Government run airline must not treat staff well since none of them smiled or provided much service. They were going through the motion but nothing positive.

### "how brutal this airline is"
Vancouver to Cebu via Shanghai. China Eastern is the worst airline I have ever flown. Their customer service is horrendous and when I asked to speak with a manager I was told their isn't one and they hung up on me. My issue was never dealt with and I never heard back from them after multiple attempts of trying to reach someone. If you find a cheap flight with China Eastern it is not worth it. I suggest paying a little more and flying a better airline. Not only was the customer service brutal the flight itself was as well. My friend and I paid for seats together, yes bought the seating option and then when we checked in they did not have our seats together and couldn't make it so. I'd ask for my money back on that but I know I'll never hear from anyone. The flight was so so so cold. The entire 12 hour flight was absolutely freezing. I had to cover my face with a blanket and not let any skin be exposed that's how cold it was. This might sound dramatic but it's actually how cold it was on the flight. So uncomfortable and unable to sleep because of the temperature I don't understand how this was happening. People were completely covered up and wearing massive winter coats. The flight attendants allowed children to just run around and swap seats with each other all around us through out the entire 12 hours and when I asked for earplugs they gave me headphones and told me I could listen to music. I'm sure they must offer first class passengers ear plugs but because I was economy I couldn't have them. The food was so disgusting. So much wasted food because most people didn't eat it. I can not stress enough how brutal this airline is and how much they don't care about their customers. Do not fly China Eastern.

### "recommend for the cheap price"
I flew with China Eastern Airline from Sydney to Frankfurt with a stopover in Shanghai. Both flights were on time. Crew was nice in both flights, they checked properly the safety things. Food was even alright. I can recommend the airline for the cheap price.

### "has no customer service"
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Shanghai. Outbound flight was ok. Inbound flight was ok until I arrived at LAX. I found that my luggage was damaged. The problem with this Airline is, when you call 1855-589-5530, you will get the worst customer service experience ever. It's so bad that it supercede the entire experience you had during the flight, and this will make you decide not to book with this airline again. First, when you call this number, 50% chances you will get busy single. Second, when the line finally went thru, you will have at least 30 minutes wait time. Third when you get to someone who finally talk to you, the rep is not helpful and will tell you something like "I can't help with anything, you need to go to website and file the claim" or "I can't wait on the phone you need to hurry up". Keep in mind that I wait 30 mins+ before I get to the rep. Finally when I went on the website to file the claim about damage luggage, I got nothing. No email confirmation, no response, no nothing, It's been 2 weeks and I have not heard from anyone from China Eastern. It's just like my complete went disappear in cyber space. It's obviously that this airline has no customer service.

### "level of poor care"
Krabi to Vancouver  via Shanghai . While in Thailand, I was in a bad scooter accident which caused significant injuries to my lower left leg. My employment provides me with Great west life insurance. (GWL) GWL has arranged for my new flight itinerary which included a nurse for my care. The arrival at Shanghai airport. The plane landed and parked on the tarmac. All passengers were ferried from the tarmac to the airport building by bus. I was told there was no wheelchair for me. GWL had pre-arranged this detail with the purchase of the tickets. The flight crew had me walk with crutches to a ramp which lowered me to the tarmac. It was pouring rain and I was offered no cover while I was left there to wait for any assistance. I was very unstable due to having to stand for that period. Finally, a ground crew staff member (Porter) arrived with a child’s wheelchair, I barely fit into it. I was wheeled to the airport building. The ground crew worker was yelling at me the whole way to the building saying this was not his job and that I would have to find someone else to help me when we got to the building. The porter took me without care, he was walking very fast, over bumps and narrowly missing other people. I was told to remove myself from the wheelchair and was placed in a office chair with wheels at the entrance doors. I was soaking wet and shivering at that point. I was left there, with no help. My husband began asking the cabin crew staff for assistance. Every single crew member from our flight just looked at me, some of them pointed and laughed at me, but everyone of them just walked away without care. My husband wheeled me on the office chair away from the entrance door, as I was soaking wet from being left on the tarmac in the rain. The temperature was roughly 7 degrees. My husband made several attempts to get help from any and all China Eastern staff members with no luck. Finally, after another 40 minutes, my frustrated husband went upstairs to find anyone to help me. My husband arrived 30 minutes later with a China Eastern staff member. This gentleman took me through customs, he took me to the front of the line bypassing roughly 450 people. The female customs agent started yelling at the porter who was helping me. They yelled at each other for about 15 minutes when the female agent got up and walked away and never returned, leaving only two customs agents to deal with the roughly 450 people. 20 minutes went by and a man came to take the female agents spot. Eventually we were passed through customs. We got to the security section. The same level of poor care occurred while attempting to board our connecting flight. Rude, verbally and physically abusive.

### "Awful experience"
Vancouver to Kathmandu via Nanjing, Kunming. Awful experience with this airline - their flight combinations seem to be purposefully set so that they are just over the 24hr limit for a transit visa (most are 24.5 hours, how does that not look suspicious?). I was denied boarding/check-in due to my transit time in China being too long, despite looking into it, and the Chinese Embassy website and airline websites being very deceiving and unclear about this. My understanding was I could get a 72-hour transit visa given my transit cities, and nowhere does it explicitly say you can't have multiple cities to get a 72-hour transit visa, only one, so I was declined from boarding and lost hundreds of dollars to this airline. It seems they purposefully set you up for failure with *just barely* too long transit times in China - can't even imagine how much money they must make from setting people up for this mistake, and I did my research, but even the embassy website is unclear. They are completely unhelpful and impossible to understand if you call in. Half of the time they didn't pick up, and otherwise, they are completely unhelpful and rude if they do pick up at any of the support numbers (although some were out of service since 2017). If you don't speak Chinese, there's even less hope. Flight prices definitely reflect the service., but after traveling around the world, I have never been met with such ridiculously awful service from an airline. So disappointed and frustrated - this shouldn't be allowed to gOuge customers due to them offering flights with transit time just barely too long - but at the end of the day, the finger is strategically pointed at the customer and they make thousands of extra dollars in cancellation and rebooking fees. Completely unacceptable.

### "missing items from my baggage"
Vancouver to Delhi via Shanghai. Worst experience ever, first delayed baggage then missing items from my baggage. Locks got changed and the staff have no clue how this happened. I feel there is improvement needed in communication gap. I wish I could talk to someone who can at least understand English. Tickets are cheap and so is the service. I would never ever recommend this airline to anyone. Claim department is useless doesn’t even cooperate since, all they care if I knew Chinese.

### "is way behind competitors"
Not Verified |  I did a round-trip from Shanghai to New York. My experience was mixed. The flights left on-time and arrived early, the cabins were clean on both flights. However, I didn't like the 10 abreast configuration of a 777, which is very cramped. Secondly, I found it very poor for an airline like this to run out of beer 2 hours into a 14 hour flight. The cabin crew aren't particularly attentive or focused. The food wasn't great for an international airline. The entertainment provided limited options of music, TV and films. Finally, the airline advertises free wifi, but it almost never works, which was disappointing. Overall, while not a disastrous experience, China Eastern is way behind competitors like Emirates, KLM, Qatar, Singapore Airlines, Garuda and Cathay Pacific in terms of its service standards.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Auckland to Beijing via Shanghai. Very pleasant flight with China Eastern from Auckland to Beijing via Shanghai. This was the third flight with China Eastern on a return trip from Europe to NZ via Beijing. Phoned the airline weeks before the trip to make sure all our seats were together. That worked perfectly. All our flights were on time. The crew were polite, very efficient and attentive on all flights. The food on Auckland flights was lovely. Sometimes they didn't have our first preference but the alternative was very tasty. The seats were comfortable and had a good recline. The inflight entertainment was good with large responsive touch screens. There was a fine selection of recent release movies and other programmes. All the seats had usb charging ports but as expected, the free inflight wifi didn't function. Would definitely recommend and fly again.

### "staff has no respect"
New York to Shanghai. Food is disgusting and staff has no respect for passengers. I asked whether the meal served had ingredients I am allergic to, and the reply was “we don’t know, just try it”. I am allergic, how can I try something and have a reaction on a 14 hours flight! Tried to ask for something different and the answer was just: no, we don’t have anything else. Once in China, my luggage arrived 4 days later and I was left without assistance and clothes in the northern Chinese winter. I was told no information about the whereabouts of my bag, despite calling them many times every day. In the end, they sent my bag to an airport near where I was staying in China, and had to go to the airport at my own expense to pick up my bag. Asking for compensation for this is nearly impossible, as they do not provide means of communicating to them and never pick up at any hotline.

### "the flight was very nice"
Shanghai to Brisbane. Overall the flight was very nice. Unfortunately bus boarding. China eastern do scan your boarding passes on the tarmac, which is a bit uncomfortable, considering the temperature outside in winter night. Seat pitch was ok. Meal was average, same for IFE. Flight attendants were OK.

### "terrible service"
Shanghai to Chicago. I was in need of a wheel chair and when I arrive in Shanghai there was no wheel chair, they told us we would get off on the tarmac and a bus would come pick us up. The food was cold I gave it back to the flight stewardess they were very rude wouldn’t smile, terrible service definitely not accommodating. They seem like they really don’t care about you as a passenger.

### "told that I should sit in Business"
Not Verified |  Shanghai to Los Angeles. The worse customer service. I ended up fracturing my leg in Thailand. The flight from Bangkok to Shanghai was good. I did receive good customer service and wheel chair access. However when I got to Shanghai it was horrible. There wasn't a wheelchair waiting for me. I asked if they could order me one and was told no and that one was not ordered by the flight attendants. I saw one of the flight attendants from the flight and she gave them the paperwork and informed them that a wheelchair was ordered. Yes, I was lied to. I had to wait 30 minutes and they would not give me anything to sit on in the meantime. After I finally got the wheelchair I was dumped at the gate. When the agent came to the gate I asked for a wheelchair to the airplane. I was told that one was ordered (which wasn't true). I waited and then was told that there wasn't one for me and that I would need to go down to the plane myself. I had to hobble  to the airplane without any help with crutches in one arm and my bag in the other. I was told by the doctor that I should sit in Business and keep my leg propped up. I went and spoke to the manager of the flight attendants. He told me that I could only sit there if I had 15000 yuan. Well I did not have yuan's on me since I was coming from Thailand. I was told by a different gate agent that I could pay by credit card. When I told the manager I had a credit card he said "sorry only cash". I then tried to show him the letter from the doctor. He would not take or read it. I BEGGED if I could just rest and that I wouldn't eat or drink anything during the flight. I simply wanted to rest my leg since I was in a lot of pain and would be on an 11 hour flight. He looked at my seat assignment and said you have enough leg room with this seat. Business class was only 50% occupied so there was room. For the whole 11 hours I had people trying to jump over and hitting my leg, including the flight attendants.

### "ask me to leave the flight"
Shanghai to Melbourne. Last minute trip booked for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children, 6 yrs and 2 yrs). Was originally scheduled to fly back to MEL from HK but had to double back to Shanghai and Cathay did not have any available flights to MEL til 12/1/19. Had to settle with China Eastern Airlines as they flew direct to MEL. MU739 was due to depart SH at 12:20am on 5th Jan. By the time we reached the gate, we had already been awake for 22 hours (funeral was on the morning of 4th Jan). Was advised by ground staff at gate to bring stroller onto bus and give to ground staff on tarmac to ensure it is taken on board. There was no airline employee on tarmac when the bus arrived next to the plane, either to control foot traffic or to receive my stroller. Most passengers crowded onto the staircase leading to the entrance of the plane, the bitter cold and wet weather did not help matters. China Eastern Airlines has a policy of re-scanning boarding passes right before boarding the plane (to avoid abscondees?) which they decided to carry out half way up the covered staircase, in turn creating a bottleneck situation with more than half of the bus passengers left on the tarmac exposed to the cold and rain. I had no choice but to carry the folded stroller, along with carry-on luggage and trying to hold on to my 6 yr old daughter, up the slippery and over-crowded staircase. She slipped and fell 3 times along the way. While I was complaining to a flight attendant, the Cabin Manager intervened and accused me of being disrespectful and threatened to throw me off the flight. The cabin manager took all of my criticisms of the airline's practices as personal attack and insisted that I was insulting him. I attempted to de-escalate the situation by going to my seat but he blocked the passage way and shoved me when I tried to go past him. I did not make any further contact with him after I found my seats. 15 minutes later, ground security approached me, to ask me to leave the flight. I tried to appeal to the Captain of the plane but was told that my emotional state posed a safety concern for the rest of the passengers and that an apology to the cabin manager could have rectified the situation but it was too late. My request for an interpreter was denied; we were given 1 minute to decide whether I leave on my own or together as a family; airline staff promised there would be assistance available back at the departure gate. However, we discovered there was no one to assist us, apart from two lowly ranked employees who brought our checked-in luggage. We ended up being stranded at Shanghai airport for 20 hours until the next available CE flight as the airline refused to refund me the airfare or transfer us to a different airline. I spoke to no fewer than a dozen CE staff at the airport and on the customer service helpline, no one acknowledged the desperate situation we were in. As this was a last minute trip to attend a funeral service, we did not carry much Chinese currency on us (Currency exchange was also closed), local sim card to make phone calls for external assistance. Since this incident, I have followed up on average twice a day with CE. To date, all I have received are broken promises (to call within x hours) and hand-balling of my complaint.

### "annoyed with the service"
Sydney to Los Angeles via Shanghai. My mother in law. was booked for special services as she had limited mobility and she couldn’t communicate in English. I was advised that she would be helped on Shanghai but she received no help at all. She was walking around airport anxious and scared showing the letter I wrote pledging for help just in case. Luckily I wrote the letter to help her and one kind women helped her after hour of walking around. She medically have knee problems. It is extremely traumatic incident for her and family. I am very annoyed with the service and would recommend no one to use the service.

### "an enjoyable experience"
Melbourne to London via Shanghai. Customer service Both customer service office in Melbourne and Sydney office were very helpful. Please note that the Melbourne office is only contactable by email (never answers the phone) If you want to speak to someone call the Sydney office. Crew Very professional in all flights. Thank you to them for making our flight an enjoyable experience. Time Keeping: all four were flights arrived on time, very unusual in my experience. PVG Terminal 1 Departures/Transit Depending on your ticket class, the airline offers a dining voucher (selected places) when having a long stop over in PVG, 80RMBpp. This is enough to get you a decent bowl of noodles each at Hope Star Coffee & Cafe. The info is on their website but difficult to find. See below for more transiting info. Check In - PVG Many check-in desks open, very quick and painless. CONS Food Poor, even coming out of Shanghai. Turbulence: At the first sign of turbulence the seat belt sign lights up and then stays on for the entire flight. This happened on all four flights. Everyone ends up ignoring it as a result. Website Hard to navigate and makes many errors Online Check In Pointless both in London and Shanghai, no bag drop for online check in (Only MEL). Check In - LHR Very few check in desks open, 1 hour to check-in. Boarding Passes When checking in online it asks you to print your boarding passes (no point as they print it for you at the airport). Our computer could not find the font to print the boarding passes. Another occasion, the website did not recognise our check-in. PVG Terminal 1 Arrivals: cash machine did not work on our arrival. If this is the case you need to walk to terminal 2 to withdraw cash. PVG Terminal 1 Departures/Transit Shops are generally quite poor and expensive and so to are the nearly all the restaurants. One cafe that stands out is Hope Star Coffee & Cafe, serves decent food nicely presented, by far the best place to eat in Terminal 1. There is also two Starbucks, one at each end of the terminal, one has seats inside the other just takeaway. Depending on your ticket class or your time of stopover you could instead choose a maglev pass or a hotel room for a number of hours over the dining voucher. But the airline said we could not leave the airport with a 7hr stopover. When waiting to go through immigration and number of people we told they could not enter on their transit and we directed through to the transit area. If you’re looking to stopover for a couple of days you can get a 144hr visa on arrival at no charge. This also allows you to visit selected provinces. The Bullet train makes it possible to do this. We visited friends in Nanjing, on our return leg to Shanghai the train took 1hr 11mins to travel 290km, costing around $35AUD one way.

### "I would fly China Eastern again"
Colombo to Toronto via Beijing. I was more than happy with the level of service, quality of flight and meals etc. Boarding was done efficiently, For a full flight I think it was done in record time. The B777 J class has full lie-flat seats with ample space and amenities. The PVG-CMB leg was on an A330 with pod-type seats in J class which were not lie-flat and I had the constant feeling that I was going to slide off the front of the seat. The IFE and software is a little stunted for someone with no knowledge of Chinese. There are some issues with dual language. Naturally the base language is Chinese but the software has not been translated fully into English and is a little difficult to navigate. There is also an online food ordering system which was not in service at the time. There was no problem with the meals - I chose the Chinese cuisine. The timings of the meal service was unusual though - I thought it was later than most carriers would do it. I thought the cabin crew worked well and communicated fine despite the language barrier. I would have liked to see another couple of rounds of beverage offered. One complaint which others have mentioned before. On the outbound YYZ-PVG leg, there were five occasions where the smell of cigarette smoke wafted around the cabin during the flight. I would fly China Eastern again.

### "still waiting for their reply"
My 83 year old father was traveling Kunming to Kolkata in July 2018. Before boarding on his flight, the airport agent told him he could not use the current ticket because his middle name was spelled wrong by one letter. He explained that he just flew on two previous airlines and no one gave any trouble. They made him buy a new ticket and had him pay $1,100 US dollars. They said he could not use a credit card. I wrote to China Eastern after returning from my trip to complain. They replied by saying they would look into the matter ASAP. Three months later, I am still waiting for their reply.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight from Vancouver, Canada to Melbourne, Australia via Shanghai Pudong with a 7-hour layover. Due to work demands, I needed to stay in Shanghai for a few more days. At the check-in counter, I asked for my checked baggage to be taken out at Shanghai, instead of being shipped straight to Melbourne, with the intention of rebooking once I landed in Pudong. This is where the nightmare began. The check-in personnel told me that they could only ship my baggage to Melbourne. Quoting verbatim: “You have two choices, either rebooking your flight this instant or shipping your baggage directly to Melbourne.” On top of all this, I was not able to rebook my flight with the China Eastern customer service, so I was forced to wait over the phone to rebook my flight while the minutes ticked by. When the flight was rescheduled, I was informed that it was too late for me to board the Vancouver to Shanghai flight. At this moment, I was informed that as a last resort, I could have signed a waiver to take out my baggage in Shanghai. Why couldn’t China Eastern have told me this before the check-in counters closed?! Due to the utter ineptitude of the customer service personnel over a minor matter, I missed my initial flight, was made to forfeit my entire round-trip itinerary, and on top of all this, my work obligations were forcibly delayed. No apologies and/or compensation were offered, but there were plenty of finger-pointing and shrugging off responsibility. I would not recommend this airline under any circumstances. Please save your time, money, and sanity and choose a better alternative.

### "the service is so bad"
Beijing to Qingdao. I focus on the lack or urgency of email request. I requested on 8 Nov by email for an aisle seat for flight of 13 November 2018. I was unable to find other contact email address in the official website. First contact was then impossible. There was no reply until 19 November. The reply requested me instead to contact customer service email. Looks like a standard reply with no human touch to it. So I wrote to customer service with no reply up till today 28 November 2018. On the day of check in I asked for aisle seat again. The counter at Beijing airport told me it is impossible although I am a Delta member. I do not expect much. Seriously the official website of China Eastern Airline should have a email contact address for passenger contact. Fair enough if a 3 working day lapse for reply is done. However, for my case there was no urgency to reply to me. I rate the service 2/10 and will avoid flying China Eastern since the service is so bad.

### "all the bells and whistles"
Flew business class between Kunming and Shangri-La. Excellent 55 minute flight. I had lounge access in KMG and was the sole passenger on the KMG-DIG flight. Coffee (Nescafe gold?) was quite good for inflight coffee. The flight attendant kept me up to date with arrival times and pointing out interesting scenery along the way. The plane itself was a brand-new B737 with all of the bells and whistles. I was surprised to find it on an intra-provincial leisure route. J seating is generous 2-2.

### "a pleasant surprise"
I couldn't pass up a business class fare for the same price as Thai Economy on this route. The experience was a pleasant surprise from start to finish. Check-in was efficient at the dedicated business counter. To my delight, China Eastern uses the Thai Airways business lounge, which is superior to the 3rd-party contract options at BKK. I got to enjoy a Thai curry and Singha before my flight, well done. On board, the business cabin crew were polite, efficient, and had sufficient English to assist non-Chinese pax. A variety of adequate but not memorable meal options were available. I had a Chinese chicken dish over rice with a glass of Tsingtao beer. The aircraft was neither brand new nor very old, but it was clean and in suitable condition. The 2-2 seats were fine for the 2.5 hour regional journey. On arrival (if you don't end up at a jetbridge at the airport), Business pax get a special van to the terminal, as opposed to a packed-to-bursting bus. This benefit is very welcome after a day of travelling. It's not SQ, but they're not charging SQ prices.

### "we had a good experience"
Chicago to Manila via Shanghai. It exceeded what I thought our experience would be. I have also set my expectation low so I wouldn't have regrets. We flew from Chicago O'hare check in line was long but it was moving fast. China Eastern airport crew was nice. Got in the gate we didn't need to wait in line since I have 2 kids with me so we were the first ones in the plane. We didn't had the seat number I saved through Cheapoair (don't know who changed it) so instead of window aisle we are in the middle aisle which isn't too bad since there's not much to see outside the window. I am only 5 ft tall so leg room was enough. Individual entertainment available. We're vegetarian so I requested for it since the day I purchased our tickets but for whatever reason the first meal they said we are not on the list of special request. We waited and later they came with a vegetarian meal. I am not very picky with food I tend to enjoy it even in the simplest way. Crew are nice too. The airline changed our itinerary from few hours to overnight at Shanghai before we head to Manila. It took one day off our vacation but it was good too because we get to see Shanghai. Both flights (to MNL & back to USA) are the same, overnight at Shanghai. Flight to MNL was good too, full meal on our 4hrs flight. So we had a good flight experience with China Eastern.

### "all pleasant throughout"
Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. My wife and I took a chance on our last trip to Asia and flew on China Eastern Airlines. The fare for the flights we chose on them were a few hundred dollars lower than what we were finding on more traditional Asian carriers. We booked our ticket through a third party platform (Justfly) in early October for a November 1 departure from Honolulu to Hong Kong via Shanghai. One thing that you will find out quick is that when you book your ticket through a third party, you are not able to then go back to the airlines website and check on the booking until the day before departure. You also cannot choose seats until, literally, you get to the airport and check in at the kiosk. This made us wonder if the booking ever happened. I even worked with Justfly to confirm and looked at my Credit Card bill in which China Eastern was indeed paid the money for the booking we made. So as far as I was concerned, on the day we left, there would be a booking. On that day, we went to the airport just a little earlier than normal to be sure that if there were any problems whatsoever, we could deal with them in time for the flight. What pleased me was that the booking was indeed in the system, our seats chosen and we could even change our seats right there. Another concern I had from reviews on this and other sites said that the bags would not be checked through to our final destination, meaning that when we got to Shanghai we would need to exit the airport, get our bags and re-check them into our Hong Kong flight. We were pleased that this was not the case and indeed, the bags were tagged for Hong Kong and, indeed, hours later upon arrival we saw our bags on the carousel there. Service on the flight was good. Coach class food that was served was perfectly fine. They did serve red wine on the flight and we enjoyed a variety of good food throughout the service to Shanghai, and then to Hong Kong. Keep in mind that the most safe food that one can eat is the food that is served on an airplane, so unless you are allergic to some ingredient that they use, you will find the food quite applicable and satisfactory. Later on when I was walking the cabin I noted a small bar in the galley that one could get a drink and a bag of peanuts. Aircraft was clean and seemed neatly taken care of, One thing that a passenger of a healthy girth may need to know is that the seat belts don't make it all the way. You will need to ask for a extender, which the crew happily gives upon request. The attendants spoke English as well as Chinese, and were all pleasant throughout the service we experienced. With more "effervescent" passengers, they still acted professional and held to standards at all times. The entertainment system at each seat had a decent variety of movies and the flight tracking program was as good as ones I have seen on American or Delta. Transfers at Shanghai for passengers going on another China Southern or Shanghai Airlines flight (the airlines are one in the same with Shanghai being the more "basic transportation" airline) are very straightforward, Just follow the signs to the transfer desk and go through security. Be sure to take out any electronic devices including power chargers for your phone - have them go through the X-ray without pulling out and most likely the security people will take the device from you with some excuse saying that it was too large or not applicable.

### "make me feel comfortable"
Hong Kong To Shanghai in  business class. The flight crew provide friendly and excellent services, and make me feel comfortable on this 2.5 hour flight. I will take China Eastern Airlines for my future business trip.

### "at the price really is a steal"
Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Shanghai. For the price, this can't be beaten. I paid lass than $1900 for round trip. Business class seat, thought the experience was great for the price. I'm sure some would find the food a little underwhelming - word of advice-go for the Asian meal. There could have been more entertainment, not sure how many movies they had, but it wasn't extensive by any means. The seats weren't the most comfortable, but they weren't the worst either. My main goal was to sleep most of the way and that was achieved easily. I'm sure some folks would think this is poor for business class, but look at the price, that really is a steal, so my expectations weren't too high and they overdelivered. Cabin crew were reasonably friendly and although English is a 2nd language on board again it wasn't a huge problem. If I can get seats at that price again, I'd certainly do it!

### "flight was overall fine"
Not Verified |  Flew on China Eastern from Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong in October. The flight was overall fine and I didnt really have a reason to complain. The food was average, nothing to win prizes with, but given that they offer a full service on a two hours flight that was competitively priced I assume this is not a drawback. Seat pitch appeared to be above average on this airplane as well. Would fly them again.

### "seats were way too small"
Vancouver to Phuket via Nanjing. We purchased our return tickets to Phuket from Vancouver for only $679 which was the only bright side of this flight. Our flight from Vancouver to Nanjing was cramped and the seats were way too small for two adult men who are 5'10 and 6'2. The service was efficient but the food, drinks (lack of wine) and in-flight entertainment were worse than the 4 other Asian airlines I have flow trans-Pacific. When we arrived at Nanjing for our connecting flight there was no international transfer area so we had to clear immigration and re-check in for the Nanjing to Phuket flight which was a horrendous experience: after an hour long wait for immigration, we were sent to a small transfer seating area to wait for another hour until a China Eastern agent arrived to escort us, along with a group of about 20, downstairs to the baggage claim to collect our luggage and then escorted back upstairs to the departures area to check-in which took another hour. We were then escorted to the departures immigration desks at which point we were finally given back out passports and released into the terminal. So instead of simply entering an international transfer area and relaxing until our next flight we were sent on a 3 hour goose chase all around the airport, including 3 separate immigration counters, without our passports and virtually no communication about what was happening. Some of the other transferring passengers were in tears. The Nanjing to Phuket flight was better but we were not given an arrivals card and when I asked the flight crew for one they said they didn't have any. So we proceeded into Phuket immigration clearance area and searched for arrivals cards to no avail. We then entered the immigration line and waited an hour only to be told to go back and get an arrivals card from our airline. There were no China Eastern staff anywhere so we ended up asking Thai airlines for assistance and finally received an arrivals card to clear immigration. Sorry, China Eastern, but there are way too many better options to ever waste our time with this airline again. In the future I will avoid transferring through China at all costs.

### "most infuriating experience"
Denpasar Bali to Washington via Beijing. Hellish barely begins to describe my one and (hopefully!) only experience with China Eastern. The problems began right from the check in desk; I knew my bags were going to be overweight, what I didn’t know was that this particular airline doesn’t allow charging an extra fee and checking the bags anyway as with practically any other airline. I was forced to open up my bags and repack them, then use two plastic bags the staff thankfully had the wherewithal to provide me to bring the rest of my baggage aboard the plane. The flight  was cramped and uncomfortable, and my seat just so happened to be directly in front of the couple traveling with their bawling infant son and the passenger who tilted his seat practically into my lap. I was tired from already having to be up at 1:30 am to catch this flight and it was impossible to get any amount of sleep on board. Had this been the worst of my experiences I might have ended up rating this airline a 4 or a 5, but the real problems began when I got to Beijing. In order to clear immigration at PEK you have to place your boarding pass, photo ID, and passport into a bag and give it to the officer for inspection. When I got the bag back after leaving the immigration office, there was no passport. Worse still, I couldn’t re-enter the office despite it simply being a flight of stairs away. I tried explaining this to the airport staff, who were incredibly unhelpful and spoke next to no English. They generally kept trying to usher me to the terminal to catch my connecting flight, despite my attempts to explain to them that I need the passport to be able to clear customs in the US in the first place. Either way, it felt as though I was going to be stuck in Beijing. I wasn’t wrong. After being sent all around the airport in a goose chase that lasted almost two hours, airport security finally retrieved my passport, and with an hour and a half to spare, I was finally free to check in to my next flight. Crisis averted, right? Well, as it turns out, the check-in desk for my connecting flight was in Terminal 3, which happens to be a 20-minute shuttle ride from the airport proper. Good thing all of this was explained to me in advance by the China Eastern staff- oh wait, it wasn’t! So naturally, after waiting for 10 minutes for the shuttle and then riding it to Terminal 3, I missed my flight (originally to Chicago) because the check-in desk had just closed three minutes prior. Three minutes! I explained to the staff that my family had driven all the way from Ohio to pick me up in Chicago and that I absolutely needed to catch this flight. But for whatever reason, possibly terrible English comprehension, nothing I said seemed to get through to them. They wouldn’t even let me on the flight to Chicago that left a day later - instead, I was haphazardly tossed onto a flight to Washington DC that I then had to wait another six hours for. So in the end, the backup flight (which I wouldn’t have needed had it not been for the incompetence of the immigration staff) was an inconvenience not only to me but to my family. All in all, flying with China Eastern has quite possibly been the most infuriating experience of my life. Trying to find anything positive to say about my experience is nigh impossible, and I would never in good conscience recommend this airline to anyone.

### "very disappointed with their services"
Not Verified |  I flew with China Eastern Airline Sydney to Los Angeles via Shanghai. I had a 2 hour layover in Shanghai and had 2 hours to get on my connecting flight to LAX. However, when I arrived in Shanghai, my bags that were supposed to be on my next flight were at Baggage Claim. I was then redirected to the ticket counter and told that I could not get on my flight to LAX. They then told me that the flight was cancelled, but I later found out it took off for LAX at the scheduled time of 8:57PM. The employees of this airline talked amongst themselves and were laughing, not willing to help me. They told me that the next flight to LAX would be at 1PM the next day. I was stuck in Shanghai for the night. I was very disappointed with their services. I was there on time with a connecting flight, yet they refused to let me on. I had enough time to get on that connecting flight. I do not recommend this airline at all. So unorganised and such a waste of money and time.

### "everything was very unorganized"
Chicago to Delhi via Shanghai. Prior to flying I read comments about China Easter and thought man this isnt good! Well, there is a reason why people are so upset with the service and quality of this Airline. Service in plane was horrible, I asked for bread they responded "no, may be next time" asked for wine "finish, no more. May be next time". I'm pretty sure there will be no next time. Pay extra fee bucks and fly with a reputed airlines especially for the fact that flights are so long. Ground crews were not helpful and everything was very unorganized.

### "pleasantly surprised"
Beijing to Yinchuan. Heard mixed reviews of China Eastern Airlines but was pleasantly surprised. Comfortable seats with ample legroom. Plane was new and looked brilliant in the silver SkyTeam livery. Food was decent although I noticed that they don't offer a drink selection and only give passengers a bottle of water. In terms of IFE, you can't expect much when flying within China except a movie or show being shown on the overhead monitors. I was asleep for most of the flight and was pleased with how smooth the ride was. All in all, a good experience.

### "it was a decent flight"
Hong Kong to Shanghai. I was scheduled to fly 2 days after Typhoon Mangkhut. Although both their English & Chinese website has very poor announcement on the flight status whereby I have to call to their customer service center China to check it out myself but to be honest, it isn't that bad after all. I was able to switch to an earlier flight without paying for anything at the check in counter and the flight to Shanghai was smooth. Very decent amount of legroom space (coming from someone who takes budget airline quite often) however there's no in-flight entertainment which is fine since it's only a 2 hour flight. The food was OK, well you pay what you get for. Everything was alright, my luggage did not went missing nor was it damaged either. Overall, it was a decent flight and for the price that I paid for it was worth the bucks.

### "avoid this airline for good"
Ho Chi Minh City to Kunming . I typed in the name correctly in their corresponding boxes and even on the ticket it shows the correct name but I got rejected at the ticket counter anyways because they claimed that in their data system the order of the name does not match the order on the passport. They basically said it doesn't matter if it's correct on the booking ticket because it's not correct in their data. This might be the scam from the airline or the agent (at that airport). How am I supposed to know what's going on with their system and what order they go by and how do I have control over that? Not sure what order they go with and if they keep in mind that half of the world has the order of the name as First - middle - Last and the other half of the world goes by the order of Last, Middle, First. They also did not allow name change (for a fee) and forced us to buy a new ticket. It is a cheap airline but the cost in the end was double the amount. The airline also refused to refund the original ticket. I will just avoid this airline for good!

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Shanghai to New York. Where to start with this airline. If I could rate a 0 or even negative I would. From the customer service at the check in desk to the actual flight. This is hands down the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Not once did I feel safe on any of the 3 flights I took with them. The food is terrible, the service is ghastly, the temperature is freezing, the inflight entertainment is boring, and the seats are tiny and I’m 5 foot. If you lose something on these flights, trust me you’ve lost it for life. Even their customer service is after the fact is horrible. Trust me when I say avoid at all costs.

### "the worst flying experience"
My flight from Shanghai Hongqiao to Seoul Gimpo was the worst flying experience I have ever had: I was lied to and forced to change to a flight leaving from and landing in different airports with no help or compensation. I was denied boarding at the gate, after having successfully checked in and passed security and immigration, by staff who told me that “the Korean government doesn’t like Russian nationals to fly from SHA to GMP”. I discovered this was a complete lie, as confirmed by Pudong Airport Immigration and Seoul Incheon Airport Immigration. In reality, staff at Pudong told me the China Eastern flight was likely overbooked, and I was lied to so I wouldn’t complain. I was forced to change to a flight leaving from a different airport (Shanghai Pudong), 4 hours later, and given no help in transiting to that airport (2 hour transit in rush hour). Staff were rude and said: “Take the subway if taxi is too expensive for you.” I was made to land in Incheon instead of Gimpo, adding two hours to my final destination. Every single airport official I have spoken to was shocked by how China Eastern would lie to me, and provide such terrible treatment of their customers to cover for their own mistakes. I left official complaints in both English and Chinese. Never heard back. Impossible to get through to an actual human being.

### "wasn't really bad at all"
San Francisco to Guangzhou via Shanghai. I was expecting to pass a really bad moment but it wasn't really bad at all, they were in-flight Wi-fi, good meals and all my luggage were at Guangzhou when i arrived. The only thing is that we got a 2h delay on Shanghai departure (layover) but it seems quite normal in China. Je m'attendais à une catastrophe à la lecture des reviews sur differents sites... Mais au final quasiment tout s'est bien passé, il y'a le wi-fi dans l'avion, la nourriture était trés bonne et enfin tout mes bagages sont arrivés a guangzhou sans problémes. Seul petit soucis, un retard de 2h au départ de shanghai (correspondance) mais cela est monnaie courante en chine.

### "luggage allowance only 20kg,"
The aircraft from Delhi to Shanghai was delayed for more than 3 hours. There are many passengers who connects through Shanghai, thus, the connecting passengers are very anxious to say the least as they are likely to miss the connections. The luggage allowance on this airline is only 20kg, much less than the competitors which is 30 KG. They will charge you $25 for each extra kilogram. On the way to Pu Dong airport, there is no boarding bridge, thus, you have to take the shuttle bus to the terminal.

### "airline was a total failure
Not Verified |  Sydney to Madrid via Shanghai. The airline was a total failure. The staff were rude and not helpful at all. My flight was seriously delayed because of typhoon and I didn't catch the connecting flight and they refused to arrange me to a flight with their code-share partners. They told me that they did not care even if I complained to their corresponding department. On my way flying back, my boarding passes could not be printed out because of some reasons I didn't know. The check-in staff called me a trouble-maker. They were very impatient and rude.

### "price was a winner"
Chicago to Shanghai. First trip with China Eastern in Business Class. Easy Check in, polite, friendly. Through the security line with out issue. MU uses Air France's Lounge at Chicago. Nothing special and gets a bit crowded, but all the same simplistic at best. Boarding was efficient. Business Class passengers had to make their way through the crowd, but once at the front, smooth and acceptable. Had seat 7L. Escorted to the seat with a warm welcome. Seat was spacious and roomy compared to American's 787 on the same route. Flight attendants went out of their way to be pleasant, spoke English well and the friendly service was on par with Cathay Pacific. There is a small business section with rows 6/7 behind First Class and eh galley, before getting to the main part of the business cabin. Take one of these seats! Movie selection was limited, but there were enough shows to help pass the time. Food was very good. Soup quite tasty and was offered seconds. Great Cheese Board with 5 selections, as well as Ice Cream and the normal other items. Seat was a bit hard, but was able to move around easily. For the price it was a winner of a flight. Give it a try and expect nothing and be pleasantly surprised

### "missed the check in time"
Shanghai to Hong Kong. I missed the official check in time for flight MU505 to Hong Kong by 3 minutes, which I admit is my fault, but given that a typhoon just hit and raining outside, not much empathy or sympathy by the staff. Without luggage to check in, I had plenty of time to clear customs, security, order a coffee and probably wait another 20 minutes at the gate before boarding starts. Instead the counter rep just says I've missed my flight without suggesting alternatives like "Let me put you on the next flight or something. He directed me to 2 separate other counters for no reason then says I have to purchase a new ticket at a premium to change to later flight. Later I found out this was not necessary after I paid. Tried to find the on shift manager and he questioned me by saying if I had bought the ticket at a China Eastern ticketing counter as if I went to the wrong place. As someone from Chinese descent and living in Hong Kong, I wish I could proudly say there's a world class airline from China. Clearly, China Eastern is not currently nor will be one anytime soon. China Eastern Airlines have not only not improved it services but have regressed to an airline not deserving of the privilege to operate.

### "Horrible customer service"
eanAmsterdam to Kuala Lumpur via Shanghai. Horrible customer service. They delayed our luggage. We were put on standby, but we got our tickets. So we took the planned flights. Arrived in Kuala Lumpur, they delayed our luggage. And nobody is responding, though email, website, phone and even nobody at the office! They say that we arrived to late at the gate, which is incorrect. We were there in time, straight after we dropped off our luggage.

### "the airline is cutting cost"
I took China Eastern airlines flight from Shanghai to Singapore which departed at 0005am on 18th July 2018, on a business class, the seat was spacious, the meal on board was a disaster, the dim sum basket I ordered was so poor presentation and so little, I requested some champagne during my meal period, but only half glass champagne served, there was no refill offered. I believe that the airline is cutting cost. Ground staff was robotic, cabin crews were friendly on board.

### "not use this company anymore"
Paris to Shanghai. The flight was on time and the flight crew friendly. Nonetheless I have negative points: the screens were put into service long after takeoff and we were told to remove our headphones long before landing, the meal was average and the amount Insufficient, the bread served after the meal, the wine was served in the bottle 0, 75cl and poor quality and finally my luggage did not arrive at destination. I travel very often but will not use this company anymore.

### "value for the price paid"
Los Angeles to Manila via Shanghai. China Eastern offers a good business class product on the Boeing 777. The seats were lie flat and the in-flight entertainment was good but limited with the selection of movies. I took all Chinese offering for the meals and they were excellent. My Advice is to stick with the Chinese options do not go for western selection which is limited as the majority of passengers are Chinese one should follow the locals for meals. The cabin crew in Business class has one or two people who speak  English. Seats are very comfortable I was able to sleep for 6 to 8 hours going to Shanghai. The bad is Shanghai as the new terminal is not open so all incoming China Eastern flights park at the new terminal then you get bused to current terminal. No issue with doing the transit it is  simple just follow the signs and complete it with the electronic machines that read your passport and boarding card. Then off to the Business class security line which is where you may have to wait 10 to 15 minutes. Finally the last flight to Manila was great on a smaller Airbus A321. The seats were good and the dinner offered was  either Chinese or Western. Again stick with the Chinese option. I saw one western guy take the western option which he did not eat and asked for the Chinese option after. Great value for the price paid plus the Sky miles earned.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Manila to New York  via Shanghai. I was hesitant to fly China Eastern because of the bad reviews I’ve read. But the fare was a bargain so I took the risk, and I was pleasantly surprised. Although the IFE was limited, there were enough good films that kept me entertained for 15 hours. Food was okay. The cabin crew were friendly and accomodating despite the language barrier. I would fly China Eastern again.

### "No updates and no service"
2nd time this week flown with Eastern and the usual no communications service given. 1 hour delay then sat in plane for an hour then deplaned and waited at gate for a new plane for hours. No updates and no service. This flight was booked about 12 weeks ago and they have moved the departure day twice. Chinese airlines are new to planes and they cant treat their customers like they do in a domestic sales situation. I trade out of hundreds of factories in China and most have a one sale attitude and dont understand they should treat customers well to keep reciprocal trade. Eastern still has that mindset but international customers won't tolerate flight changes, late service and lack of communications. Get your act together!

### "missed my connecting flight"
San Francisco to Shanghai was delayed by 2 hours and I missed my connecting flight to Osaka as a result. China Eastern put me overnight in a hotel and provided a shuttle bus to and from the hotel. The hotel provided dinner and breakfast on the following day. The airline provided 2 meals and a snack on the SFO - PVG flight. The food onboard and inflight entertainment are okay. The free Wi-Fi onboard is alright, but not many websites and apps can be browsed due to restrictions. I appreciated the airline putting me up in a hotel, rather than spend the night at Pudong airport.

### "unreliable customer service"
Bangkok to New York via Shanghai. Due to weather, the airline decided to dump us off at Chicago O'Hare airport instead of our final destination to NYC. At their counter, we were told we would receive a full refund for our flight from Shanghai to NYC plus any expenses for hotel stays and buying our own ticket to find our ways back to NYC. My refund took months! I had to contact customer service multiple times and each time I had to argue with them about what i was told at the Chicago desk. When I finally heard from them about the process of my refund, they would not refund me the flight from Shanghai to NYC. The only customer rep I trusted was the manager at the O'Hare desk. When I inquired why they left out the flight refund, he said their staff were incorrect in stating they would refund passengers for the ticket. When I asked why this happened, he said HQ at that time told them they would, but that they changed their mind on it. Shady airline, unreliable customer service. They only stay in business because their tickets are the cheapest.

### "uncomfortable seats"
Shanghai to Beijing. An uncomfortable configuration aircraft with difficult and uncomfortable seats. On Time flight, poor meal and no entertainment. Quick ground service, but: when you encounter a problem there is no reference, and customer service ignores any duty.

### "I wouldn’t recommend this airline"
Guangzhou to Shanghai. Customer Service is woeful. Unfortunately, I have to regularly fly with this airline so I became a member of the Eastern Miles Club in order that I could accrue some points. I didn’t want the points so much as recognition for the flights. Because I am a westerner, I am almost always get placed up the back of the plane with the other westerners. So, I thought, if they recognise me after all these flights, I might move to the front. For the last 3 months, I have had a new passport (a renewal). We are not allowed to update our accounts with the passport number, we need to call the hotline. I called the hotline and they told me helpfully to email the details to their help desk. I emailed the help desk and they told me I need to call the hotline. And so it goes, back and forth, neither party willing to do anything at all beyond what they want to do or need to do. After 7 emails, with the same request, I am frustrated and stuck. They wont upgrade the passport number and they wont recognise the points. I cant “start again” because that would mean buying a new mobile phone number. When flying with them, could someone please advise the airline that airline issued earphones plugged into their entertainment system, does not affect flight controls. With religious fervor, literally 30 -40 mins before we land, everything is cleared and closed. No phones, no headphones, no entertainment, no kindles - nothing. Sit still and read Chinese Duty Free magazines. Ground staff at check in - very business like, process bound and perfunctory. They remind me every time, what I am about to face over the next few hours. Generally speaking, I have found cabin staff good. They just don’t enforce the rules, particularly as it relates to other passengers playing videos on high volume while we are taking off! I ended up fixing the problem myself. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone.

### "no customer service"
I had the worst time with China Eastern for my flight Paris to Brisbane via Shanghai. I only found out at Paris airport that my 2nd flight was cancelled and that the company put me in another flight 24 hours later. I got stuck in Shanghai for 29 hours while I was supposed to be back at work. They didnt apologise, didnt give me any explanation, didn't try to put me in another flight, staff were extremely rude and I had to ask to have an hotel booked and paid by them. (I went to see 3 different desks and all of them acted the same). The hotel they took me was in the middle of nowhere, dirty and no-one could speak English. Yes, the tickets are cheap but I would not recommend this company because if something happens they would not care and they have no customer service.

### "never fly with them again"
Los Angeles to Cebu via Shanghai. The flat bed was okay but that’s all. It is very annoying that they don’t have a menu for each passenger to read, they just go to your seat and show you the menu and you don’t even have time to think because there’s only 2 choices! So after the take off i slept and missed the dinner but when i woke up I asked them what’s for dinner and they gave me 2 choices. I got the chicken but it was so bad like it was a bit cold and they did not even bother to heat it up. In the menu there were lists of dessert like ice cream so I asked them if they have any and they just laugh and said “oh no ice cream”. They don’t have some chips but they have some left over chocolates. The entertainment system has very limited choices. I mean if you will spend for business class maybe just go for a better airlines and you’ll pay the same amount of money and will surely get what you’re paying for. My luggage was supposed to be part of the priority ones but it came out very late! Also the flight from Shanghai to Cebu was also very disappointing as they dont have dinner and the flight attendant told me it is because it is only a 3 hour and 50 minutes flight. I will never fly with them again!

### "how bad this airline is"
New York to Manila via Shanghai. I booked December 2017, my mistake was i read the reviews after I booked the flight. From then i kept on checking my flights online and until march 30 it was valid until i didn't see my flight from Shanghai to Manila. I called the airline right away, but their customer service cant speak enough English that the only thing they told me was “no information” 5 times. Every week i kept calling until a manager told me that my Shanghai to Manila flight was cancelled and its either they rebook my ticket or refund. But according to reviews, they dont really get the refund so i just asked for a rebook. I arrived in Shanghai in 7pm and the flight they book me going to Manila was the next day 6:55pm. I didnt argue and just accept the flight without any compensation, free hotel. I waited in the airport for almost a day without social media. After I arrived in shanghai, i didn't know that i have to get out and get a 24 hr transit since my flight will be the next day. And i couldn't check in a well because it was to early for the next day flight. I can go on and on about how bad this airline is.

### "the flight wasn't too bad"
c✅ Trip Verified |  vSingapore to Seoul via Shanghai. Decent flight with reasonable entertainment and price worth. I bought my tickets to 2 weeks before the trip. It was about at least SGD500 cheaper than Korea Air, Asiana and SQ during cherry blossom season in Korea. Noting that this flight was cheaper than Scoot (budget airline). This was my first flight with this airline and I was prepared for the worst and hoping that I am safe and my luggage were in the right place. Turns out that the flight wasn't too bad. Service was nice, food and drinks were ok. I have a 2hr stop over in Shanghai and everything was on time. The seats were clean. Other customers may not give you the most pleasant experience (a lot of noisy tour groups) but that is not within airline's control. They gave out pillows if you need. Blankets can be taken off plane if you want. One thing I dont like about this airline is their lack of control on how many cabin luggages a customer can bring in. So many customers brought 2 to 3 big bags that cannot even fit in cabin and a lot of customers were not able to use the cabin due to these greedy customers. It will be dangerous if this plane were to get any accident if you need to evacuate but you will probably get jammed along the way because too many luggage blocking the path. I haven't seen any other airlines allowing this before.

### "They yelled at passengers"
Los Angeles to Ho chi Minh via Shanghai. I traveled With my spouse and 2 little infants, I purchased children's seat and somehow they given separate seats. Two of under 2 old sons can't sit without us. System need to improve. Flight Shanghai to Ho chi Minh was delayed for 90 mins without any announcement. Ground staff need to improve. They yelled at passengers without any reason. All flight entertainment and meals was okay. Free hotels if flights layovers 12 hrs.

### "there was no entertainment"
Honolulu to Shanghai. Old, dirty and unfriendly. The dirt everywhere was unimaginable, probably not cleaned for years. On the 11 hour flight there was no entertainment, no screen. Staff didn’t understand when we asked for cleaning material, as we didn’t even want to touch anything on the flight

### "Chinese Fawlty Towers in the air"
Shanghai to Melbourne. Our flight on China Eastern resulted from a delay in our original Qantas flight (delayed 8 hours) and we were able to obtain this alternative, direct flight instead. Check in was pain free. Boarding was efficient and everyone on was on board in time for our scheduled departure time. The flight pulled out on time, but it did take about 20 minuts before we were airborne (busy time at Shanghai Pudong). Staff were relatively friendly and most spoke some English. The aircraft looked new and clean. A pillow and sealed blanket provided. The leg room was quite good for economy. In flight entertainment pretty good, except for the inflight advertising that occurred following completion of each program. Good screen size. The inflight meal services was memorable (awful). The food would have to be the worst I have encountered on any airline & air staff seem to go about it all about face. The drink cart rolled out first, but before it arrived at our aisle, a hot meal was handed out. On completion of the meal, we were offered a drink. Yes please, I will have a red wine. Given about one centimetre of wine, being the end of the bottle. I did ask for a bit more (the stewardess looked shocked, but I did get another couple of centimetres). The wine was quite good. After all this, they came around and asked us if we wanted a bread roll. desert, some cut up water melon. Tea or coffee not offered. It was a bit like a Chinese Fawlty Towers in the air. I did notice a couple of (presumably) Chinese passengers eating food they had brought on board with them. Obviously they were aware of what the meal service was like. Breakfast was equally as bad as the dinner service. We arrived in Melbourne about 30 minutes ahead of the scheduled arrival time. Except for the meal services, the flight and aircraft were good.

### "Worst airline I've seen so far"
Seoul to Singapore via Shanghai. Worst airline I've seen so far. I took a flight for Christmas, they suddenly changed the departing time, so I tried to contact them on the phone and by email several times but never got any reply. I decided to give them a second chance. This time I had to fly from Seoul to Singapore transfer in Shanghai. My first flight took off 3 hours late (of course they didn't warn us in advance so I enjoyed waking up early to then wait doing nothing in the airport for 3 hours), and I was supposed to have only 2 hours to transfer, so I thought I'd miss the second flight. Thankfully, they told me the second flight was still there when I arrived. I hurried up only to find it was delayed for 3 hours too. I then got in the plane, but it didn't take off. We waited 2 hours in there, with absolutely no explanation nor apologize. The only good news is they told me there would be free wifi in the plane once it takes off, but it turns out it never worked, half due to chinese laws banning facebook and many other sites and apps, and half due to the fact their wifi was shit anyway. At the end, we landed 5 hours late, therefore arriving at 3am, meaning there was no public transportation so I had to pay for an expensive taxi, and yet still received no explanation, no apologize and no compensation. To this day I still have no idea what happened. I contacted them, but of course they didn't reply. 100% will never ever use this company, again, even if they have $1 flights.

### "the most incompetent airline"
Los Angeles to Tokyo via Shanghai. This is the most incompetent airline that I have ever seen period. Me and my daughter (16 years old) were given separate seat in 3 flights! My daughter was very nervous to be alone. I had to ask a lot of people to move around to accommodate ourselves! The airplanes are so cramp that you can not move at all. In a 13 hour flight the served a dinner and for another 10 hours not a single time they offer even a glass of water. The attendants don't show up when you request! They brought the dinner roll about 30 minutes after dinner serving. There is only one person serving with cart. Our return flight from Osaka to Shanghai was delayed 3 hours and we lost the next flight to LA. The most interesting part was that there not a single cancellation from other airline. When we got to PVG airport since we were late we were going around for 30 minutes until airplane stopped far and we were transfer by bus (cold at night). Since there were so many flight canceled or delayed it took us 3 hours to get a transfer for 24 hours later. Then took us another one hour to get a bus and go to so called hotel. OMG, motel is much better than that. Our flight landed at 9 PM and we got to bed at 2 AM. The next day out flight to LA was delayed again for 2 hours. This time they said they wait for transfers! I asked them why did not you wait for us yesterday. They said we only wait for 10 people or more! About 35 people came from Bangkok to PVG (trasnfer) to go to Los Angeles but their boarding pass was only till PVG and their luggage were stranded in Shanghai because they could not leave that terminal in airport to transfer them!! This was the strangest thing I have  heard.

### "thought it a fair price"
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Shanghai. I travelled with my 4 sons on this flight. We paid roughly $2500 per ticket and thought it a fair price for the services rendered. Flights were on schedule in both directions. Stewardess were dressed beautifully. The attention to detail was 3 star, they were efficient and always in a hurry. Didn’t take time to talk much to us. The seats were a wishbone style, 1-2-1 in business. Me being a big man 76 inches 290 lbs, I really didn’t enjoy the room for my legs in the lie flat position. My kids enjoyed their space. I would definitely fly them again.. They still need to work on smiles and a friendlier attitude. Just for comparison sake, Japan Airlines has a better customer service from stewardess and an attention to detail and very polite and humble. Price is higher but still fair for the service they render.

### "No one speaks English"
Chicago to Manila via Shanghai. Flight to Manila Clark leg was cancelled after ticket purchased. Never informed us. Chicago told us not to worry Shanghai knew of the problem and would take care of getting us to Clark. Shanghai knew nothing when arrived. No one speaks English and it took several hours to get assistance. The next day we were told Manila knew of our issue and a bus would take us to Clark. Never happened and we were stuck in Manila. No help and nobody knew anything. We had to hire an expensive van to take us to Clark. We expect something done about this horrible experience. Now we have to worry how to get back to Manila on return trip. Clark is closer but is now our problem getting home since China eastern failed in helping us.

### "service was good"
Shanghai to Los Angeles, both flights were on time and service was good. The meal quality was good and food was tasty. Much better than United, Delta or American Airlines. They also provide free wifi so you can use the internet on board. Slippers were provided too. Cabin staff were helpful and polite. Lavatories were kept very clean. Legroom was 32 inches, just enough to stretch the leg. No need to pay a fee for extra leg room, like UA or AA.

### "kindness seemed to be forced"
The business class hard product is very nice. I was fortunate enough to sit in the small business class cabin near the front of the plane. There was Wifi free on the flight but it was slow and botchy. The service from the flight attendants was cold and kindness seemed to be forced.

### "I will not fly China Eastern again"
New York to Shanghai. I would discourage travelers from flying China Eastern Airlines. Their fare is cheaper than many competitors but you get what you pay for. My flight from JFK New York to Shanghai was unpleasant in many ways. First the seating area was not cleaned. There were crumbs in the arm rest. The pillow and blanket came unwrapped which makes you wonder if they cleaned it between flights. The food choices were limited. They show you the menu but two out of three choices were unavailable. Lastly, the flight attendants were absent mostly and not helpful. There were kids squatting in the middle of the aisle talking loudly during a night flight from NYC to Shanghai (mind you this was in business class where passengers were trying to get some rest or trying to get work done) and the flight attendants were nowhere in sight to help escort the kids back to their seats. Also, the flight attendants were not the friendliest. When I asked for a seltzer water I was met with annoyance then a curt hand off of the can (no cup). I will not fly China Eastern again if I can help it.

### "What a nightmare experience"
Jakarta to Los Angeles via Shanghai. Ground staff in Jakarta did not tell me I should becollect my luggages at Shanghai Pudong airport, til the rude Transfer staff at Shanghai airport told me, meaning I have to exit the Immigration. They didn’t give me any paper, so the Immigration Officer lady didn’t let me out, she told me to get back to the Transfer desk ask for a boarding pass for the next flight. There were 3-4 staff at the transfer desk, no one understand what to do and directed me to the fist staff I met. That  lady was still there talking on the phone again n talking to other staff, completely ignored me and other customers behind me. Finally, she left, changing shift I guess, the man gave me a piece of paper (flight itinerary). After second time in line, the Officer told me to fill in the blue paper, not the yellow given by the airlines, she pointed me to the back table, meaning I have to get it n back in line. Frustrated enough, at the third time in line, the Officer complained in Chinese and made a phone call to the Airline Transfer staff, I assume he did not give me a proper paper, took her n other staff to work on my paper, finally I got out. The trouble was not finish here. The lady at the next check in for transfer was not nice. After weight my luggage she told me to exit and go to the third floor to enter the departure gate. As I didn’t get what she said at the first time, I repeat what she said which was wrong. She yelled “go exit and go to the third floor”. What a nightmare experience at my first flight with China Eastern Airlines.

### "never recommend this airline"
Dhaka to Shenyang via Kunming. Disgusting service and the quality of the airline. Would never recommend this airline. This is by the far the worst airline i have ever took and i'm a very frequent traveler. This had a 6 hour delay before it departed. Never use this airline.

### "well worth the price"
Toronto to Shanghai. This is the third time I have flown with china eastern in business. This time I noticed some improvements, I was offered pre departure champagne which was not the case a year ago. After departure from Toronto was offered pajamas, the service was good and food from very good. I found the crew very good and language was not a problem  IFE could be better with some more choices also the remote control at my seat did not work at all but the touch screen worked so I didn't find it a big problem. The amenity kit is very basic and could use an upgrade also the seat while being very roomy and private could use a pad when using it in the bed mode. The lounge in Shanghai was deserted when I was there so was plenty of room and lots of staff there to assist you. All in all well worth the price (far less than EVA, Cathay or Korean Air).

### "Do recommend it"
Vancouver to Manila via Shanghai. China Eastern Airline offers free on-board wifi. Besides that, food and service are good too. Their Business Class Lounge at PVG is decent in size and amenities. Do recommend it.

### "flight attendants were very pleasant"
I purchased ticket economy class on China Eastern for about almost half price of competing airlines, then after reading reviews was somewhat scared that I had made a big mistake, but I had no problems. People posted that flight attendants were rude with bad movies and lots flight delays and no baggage transfers, I had no issues at all. This was my third trip to the Philippines and had used two other airlines before and had delays, my trip with China Eastern went great with no delays, baggage was auto transfered, movie section good and flight attendants were very pleasant. As meals go we were served two meals and it's airline food, no worse or better than competing airlines.

### "cannot expect anything from them"
Shanghai to Prague. Flights were on time, went well, service as expected. But both of my suitcases got lost. One was received the next day but another one got held at PVG for security check. I was asked if the staff at PVG actually can destroy my lock (my suitcase is Commodore brand, meaning if they did, the whole suitcase would be destroyed!)! Then I was asked to send my suitcase key to TPE airport and that they will deliver it to PVG to open my suitcase! So I did and when they received it at TPE they told me that China Eastern staff refused to take my key to PVG with them, because the person who asked me for the key hadn't asked them before she asked me for my key! Then I was even asked to deal with this issue myself. I refused all of it, meaning to destroy my suitcase and to go personally to PVG to retrieve it! Somehow they got my key to PVG and 4 days later I finally received my suitcase, obviously no threat was inside and all of my stuff was there, even though messed up. After this horrible experience I decided to complain to China Eastern only to find out that there is no email address to complain in China. I called their Taipei office where I was given 2 strange email addresses, to one of them my email was not even delivered and I have never heard from anybody from the second email address ever. Then I found that there is an option to submit a complaint directly on the UK website of China Eastern, which I did. I complained that nobody answered my emails from China and asked them to kindly forward my complaint to the corresponding office explaining all my experience! Never heard from anybody! Submitted another complaint a week later and still till today no message from China Eastern whatsoever.Conclusion: average, mostly cheaper airline with average service aboard, until something goes wrong! Then you cannot expect anything from them at all!

### "prompt with drinks and food"
Shanghai to Singapore. After being initially concerned about our travel team booking me on China Eastern (prices were high due to Chinese New Year) I conceded to China Eastern. GATE: Quick and efficient. We were promptly placed on a bus to the plane. At the plane, the staff were waiting to check boarding passes (this was the only feeling of rush with passengers pushing to get onto the stairs for some reason) Boarding was friendly, they quickly identified me as a westerner and spoke decent English to welcome on board. Take off I was told to take my headphones off before take off which seems normal for China Eastern. The crew in Economy were young, but good with English. were prompt with drinks and food. They rotated the cabin with water almost every 20 minutes. Food was okay some Pork thing with rice and watermelon as the desert. Standard Economy food. IFE Screen was clear, but limited options. about 8 Blockbusters and only 10 TV options. Headphone socket was temperamental, but this seems to be the norm in economy now. I have to be honest to say it was more enjoyable than the Singapore Airlines flight I did on the way to Shanghai. In saying that, this was my first flight with China Eastern.

### "chose because of it's low fare"
I chose China Eastern from Guangzhou to Kunming mainly because of it's low fare and Kunming is the hub for China Eastern. The aircraft is Boeing 737 which is new and could provide 12 first class seats. However  the cabin crew were too busy to provide a good service during the fight. The foodsin flight are too salty and the coffee is not hot enough.

### "this is very untrustworthy"
New York to Manila via Shanghai. I tried to get my middle name to delete one letter which a 3rd party made me put on. I went to the airport to try to get this changed as it was almost impossible to get anyone on the phone live and I did not have the time to wait. When I went to the airport with all the supporting documentation they did absolutely nothing to help me on the then scaring me into thinking that I would not be allowed to get through emigration in that I should buy in additional last minute ticket at 2 to 3 times the price. I tried numerous times while on vacation to rectify the problem and all they did was talk to me like I was in the 3rd grade and did absolutely nothing to help the which was a scare tactic. Of course on the very intelligent person and did not listen to anything they said and when on my trip and took the risk and of course immigration let me pass as I hide all the supporting documentation. I write this review because not everyone has the same intellect nor experience that I have and many people get scared and to find another last minute ticket which could be 2 to 3 times the price of the original ticket which to me and again this is just my opinion but to me this is very untrustworthy and is a scam in my opinion which is my right to state.

### "Service is awful and messy"
Horrible airline! I supposed to take Jan 29tth China Eastern flight from Toronto to Shanghai, (too much to describe the details of the mess). Now on Jan 30 I am still stuck in the airport waiting with all the other same people. It’s horrible! Service is awful and messy. People are getting angry because we are just told the system still not fix yet and need few more hours to fix. That means we need to wait another day. And there is no any arrangement yet. This is my first time to try China Eastern airlines, I feel very upset!

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
This is by far the worst airline I've ever flown. Flight was delayed for three hours causing me to miss my connecting flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou. The chairs were narrow with little to no leg room. Most flights allow you to use cellphone after 20-30 mins take off but phones are prohibited for the whole entire flight with this airline. After I landed in Shanghai, there was three employees to help about 70 people who needed accommodations. They just wrote a flight number on my boarding pass and told me to get my bag with no further instructions. They did provided transport to and from the airport but I almost missed it because they didn't announce that they were leaving in English, which I get that it's not a English speaking country but there were many foreigners like me that didn't understand what wasn't going on and just needed reassurance. We were driven to our hotel, more like cockroach tower, thirty mins away from the actual airport. The next morning I was driven back to the airport three hours in advance for a domestic flight. Needless to say after my first experience with China Eastern I wasn't looking forward for my trip back to Toronto with them. But oh boy, it got worst. My route was from Guangzhou to Shanghai then Toronto. On my flight was Guangzhou to Shanghai, a trip that usually take 1 hour and 30 mins took about 3 hour and 30 mins. The flight took off on time but due to some fog i Shanghai  the plane landed in another airport to refuel. This was what they said and even writing it out now it made no sense. There was obviously a technical error on their end where they needed to stop at another airport to refuel. When I arrived in Shanghai, my flight to Toronto was actually delayed so I had a chance to still fly out that day. But I wasn't informed of this until after they told me to wait for my luggage, which took about 1 hour to come out, and by the time I got my luggage the flight already closed their doors. There were once again only three people to help ~40 people to redirect their flight. I was forced to stay a night again, another cockroach tower and this time even further from the airport. After all of this happened, when I was checking in, the employee was using his phone the whole time while checking me in. He was so invested on his phone that I had to tell him to give me back my passport after everything was done. This is not just one act of horrible customer service executed by china Eastern but multiple and to many paying customers.

### "food options were all tasty"
Shanghai to Sydney. A complimentary limo service from Shanghai hotel to PVG which luckily arrived early, as the queues for security at PVG seemed endless. The PVG lounge was well equipped with showers and plenty of quiet zones with charging facilities and a good range of food and beverages. Better and more quiet in the upstairs area though. On board and closed up ready to go on time and arrived in SYD a little early. Seating layout was the older 2-2-2 but OK for a good sleep with the seats flat, although the cabin was kept a little too warm for my sleeping habits. Sleep took priority over IFE so I cannot comment on that. The food options were all tasty, with good, attentive service and plenty of snacks during the flight if needed. Spirit offerings eventually had to be refused as the servings were becoming a little too frequent. Good service levels on the return international flight. This was the first flight allowing phones to be switched on in flight mode following a relaxation of the rules by the government.

### "friendly staff and tasty meals"
Sydney to Shanghai. Complimentary limo service to airport was appreciated with quick check-in on arrival. Skyteam lounge at SYD OK. Closed up and ready to go on time, but delay experienced at gate of 20 minutes with no explanation. Made up most of lost time on journey. Good service by friendly staff and tasty meals, both Western and Chinese options, with regular offers of wine and spirits throughout the trip. Lie flat seats were not tested as it was a daytime flight with the IFE system providing adequate entertainment options. Internal flights in China taken later to Harbin, Xining, Chengdu and Shanghai were on time with same good service levels.

### "overall impression is positive"
Madrid to Shanghai, "old-style" Business class configuration (2-2-2). Seats are quite comfortable, fully reclinable, but very little privacy (if any). Boarding quite smooth. Entertainment system good but not the latest version, and headphones not noise-cancelling. Despite business class not completely full, they didn't have enough menus for everyone: me and my neighbor had to change choice as they didn't have enough Chinese menus on board, as well, not all wines listed are available. In any case, food was quite tasty. Overall, a good flight with China Eastern Airlines, had a good sleep, and overall impression is positive. There is WIFI on board (albeit, not really fast).

### "professional, and customer-oriented"
Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Shanghai. The service has always been excellent and the flight attendants on China Eastern are the most hard-working, professional, and customer-oriented. Just because their English skills may be lacking doesn't mean they are providing subpar service. I've had the same positive experiences with China Southern and Shanghai Air regarding customer service, and they all post generous partner mileage accrual with little delay, and offer elite status member benefits at airports (like priority boarding and lounge access) without having to make a request. And the China Eastern and Southern lounges put our stateside lounges to shame in terms of food offerings and comfort!

### "disrespect to me as a customer"
Krabi to Moscow via Shanghai. Quality of service is very low. Me and my wife checked in 3 bags in Shanghai airport, but got only 2 tags. We didn't notice it at first. Then right before the flight a manager of China Eastern approached us, showed photo of one of our bags and told that due to some issues they were not able to send it with our plane. He said that there was no problem and that the bag would be sent with the next plane. When we arrived to Moscow, another manager of China Eastern met us and confirmed, that everything was okay and the bag would be sent with next plane. Sounds good, right? But since then we didn't get not only our bag - we were not able to get any information from China Eastern! Shanghai hotline doesn't work, people in Russian office know nothing and can't get any information. Eventually they just stopped answering my phone! Even baggage claim service of Sheremetyevo airport can do nothing! They send requests and get no answer from Shanghai office of China Eastern! It's is utter disrespect to me as a customer and total lack of management skills. It's been 6 days since we arrived and I'm losing faith in ever getting my bag back. And to add cherry on top of this mess - due to lack of luggage tag I wasn't able to get insurance for lost luggage. ((( Speaking about other impressions from the flight: food was good when we were going from Shanghai to Moscow, and OK when from Krabi to Shanghai. Seats were narow and not really comfortable, entertainment was OK, Wifi was poor.

### "poor and unprofessional"
Madrid to Brisbane via Shanghai. My baggage went missing for 15 days and the customer service provided, if you can call it that, was poor and unprofessional. When I noticed my bags were missing, I reported it at Shanghai airport. The guy at the baggage claim desk at the airport asked for my flying ticket and, while I was filling out the PIR, he took off my baggage receipts which (this I found out later on) were necessary to claim compensation for the delay. During this 15 days, I tried to call to their Shanghai base several times but nobody ever picks up the phone. After two weeks, I received a call from one of their representatives who told me they would send my bags to the airport, because they don't deliver to the customer's address. On top of that, there was no way to talk or complaint to this person because he didn't speak English, or any other language than Chinese. So, my baggage was lost more than 2 weeks, they provided no costumer service at all, and after all the inconveniences they caused, it is me who has to pay for the transport of my bags. Booking with them was a terrible mistake.

### "horror stories became true"
Seoul to Bangkok via Shanghai since the price was around 400$ when Korean airlines were literally double for our Christmas trip. I had heard many horror stories about the Shanghai transfer process, and unfortunately, they became true. Be sure to leave enough time, at least two hours. Pudong Airport has very few gates and it seems that every plane uses a bus (even airlines like Korean Air use them). This adds about 15-20 minutes to getting to the terminal once you land. The transfer staff is very unorganized in stress, as many staff were calling for LA flights but completely ignoring anyone going to Bangkok. Tensions and tempers flared among passengers as everyone was trying to cut and get around slow people. Staff always says "hurry, hurry, go go" when there's actually not enough time. Our connection was missed because of this, and by the time we waited in line to get our new flight tickets, go through immigration and go upstairs we missed the last flight of the night. The system could be vastly improved. China Eastern did put is in a clean hotel (20 minutes from the airport by their shuttle bus), gave us a bowl of cup noodles at night (and some dumplings/soy milk in the AM). But the one thing they never did? Say sorry. The planes themselves were in clean condition, way better than I expected. Flight attendants were just ok. Nothing special, nowhere near as polite as Korean or Japanese airlines. Food was definitely subpar, about only 70% was edible on all our flights. Price is king, and you pay what you get for.

### "worst airline I traveled with"
Shanghai to Toronto. This was easily the worst airline I traveled with. The staff both ground and flight were rude and not accommodating. I requested vegetarian meals and was told to speak to the flight attendants. This was after trying to do this over the phone and being on hold for over 15 mins. I was also unable to do this online. When I spoke to the flight attendants they said my name isn't on the list and I won't be given any food. Finally when I was given food a all 3 times it was non vegetarian including a sandwich that had pork in it. When I asked what was in the sandwich the staff didn't seem to understand my question. In today's time where many people have allergies, health concerns, and other dietary restrictions this was ridiculous. Even general questions seemed to go unnoticed by the staff. Ground staff and check in was really unorganized. My overall experience was disappointing and in future I will not be traveling with this airline again.

### "my mother was denied boarding"
Bangkok to Seoul via Yantai. I  purchased a round-trip ticket from Seoul to Bangkok for my mother (cannot speak English with minimum tech ability to use a Smartphone) from China Eastern Airlines official Korean website. I also purchased the same Seoul to Bangkok, but only one way as I was going back to my work in UAE after Bangkok. My flight was 3 hours earlier than my mother's return flight. The ticket I purchased for my mother had 1 stopover each way: Seoul to ShangHai Pudong, ShangHai Pudong to Bangkok, returning Bangkok to Yantai and from their to Seoul. However, on 30 Dec, when my mother wanted to check-in at the CE counter, the airline staff said that this flight goes from Bangkok to Shanghai Pudong to Yantai to Seoul, and two stopover within China is not permitted, showed a piece of paper regarding transit regulation within Mainland China, therefore boarding is not permitted. Suddenly, there was magically a new stopover at Shanghai Pudong. This makes the Shanghai to Yantai leg a domestic flight. Seven passengers including my mother was denied boarding. CE staff did not provide any assistance, closed the counter and left, leaving these passengers stranded in Bangkok Airport. None of the Korean passengers had good enough English language skill to dispute with the Airline, and nor CE spoke proper English. Disputing with them would not yield any positive results anyways since CE staff do not care at all about customer grief nor complaints. Since I had left already to Dubai, my mother was all by herself and had to seek help from two other kind Korean young men (also same ticket) to purchase another ticket using their Credit card from a different airline to go back to Korea (direct flight BKK-ICN from EastarJet). This practice is practically a scam, since this Shanghai stopover was not  shown during the website search, not shown in the receipt nor the itinerary email I received. Also the information that "two stopovers within China is not allowed" cannot be verified, and we don't know if this is true. My mother had to wait nearly another 24 hours at the airport as a result. If you cannot speak Chinese, forget about everything, even if they deny for no reason. This kind of practice should not be allowed. CE may look like an excellent budget airline: 30kg checked in Baggage, full in-flight meals, spacy seats. And you will save $300~600 per trip. But when it happens, it will happen to you, and you will be delayed and stranded with no options, no assistance, no staff to talk to and helpless. There's no rating to be given when an airline leaves pax stranded. Everything becomes irrelevant.

### "My flight was cancelled"
Colombo to Male. My flight was cancelled for January 2018 and they have taken no action. Ticket price was 228$ and the only option they have given was refund which is 110$. Such a shame airline which has no responsibility over their customers. Even when we call the customer care  ask to hold the line and it was also a money lost for us by taking international calls.

### "cancelled my transit flight"
Tokyo to Chaoshan via Shanghai. Very not recommended China Eastern airline. My flight was a roundtrip between Tokyo and Jieyang, in the between had to transit in Shanghai. On the way to China, my flight was delayed about 1+hour and they automatically cancelled my transit flight without any explanation and guiding. I had to stay in Shanghai airport for about 7hours for the next flight. I was a bit mad at this because they should at least guide us along this but they did not, we were like running and asking around to see what can we do. Next, during the return. They arranged my flight to be about 1+hours to make a transit in Shanghai and the point is I was told that my luggage cannot be direct pick up in Tokyo during check in, which means I had only 1+hours to go through the transit progress and luggage pick up. I called the airline to ask for help because this timing is arranged by them and I got a reply said “Do Your Best”. I ran like a hell in the airport and felt disappointed in how they treat client like this. I have never thought of such a big airline gives service like this.

### "quite satisfied by my flight experience"
When I read about the reviews of China Eastern before my flight, I was expecting the worst. Having only paid 375 euros for a round-trip from Hamburg (Germany) to Shenzhen (China), I wasn't expecting much either. However, I was quite satisfied by my flight experience with China Eastern. The A330 from Paris to Shanghai was quite new, had a decent inflight entertainment system and the seats had a good pitch. A little minus for the service: flight attendants weren't that friendly and there was only one round of beer for the whole plane on the 11-hours flight from Paris to Shanghai. Furthermore, there is room for improvement concerning ground service and online check-in. Reserving seats was only possible via telephone, online check-in did not work at all. Probably the biggest minus was the ground personell in Shanghai - very little English skills and very rude. There is no "western" food on China Eastern flights, however almost all meals were tasty. Another plus: I was assigned an emergency Exit seat on two of four flights. All flights were on time. All in all, I would fly China Eastern again, especially with regards to the extremely low fare that I got.

### "served passengers politely"
Hohhot to Nanjing via Shiajiazhuang. The first route to Shijiazhuang was less than 1 hour, so the airline only provided a bottle of  water. The second route from Shijiazhuang to Nanjing was almost one and a half hour, the airline provided a dinner of noodles and rice, meal was delicious. During the flight the crew served passengers politely.

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
San Francisco to Guangzhou via Shanghai. This was honestly one of the worst airlines one can experience. On my trip, I was going to Guangzhou, which required a connecting flight in Shanghai (there are 2 airport in Shanghai). On the day of, the airport informed us that they gave away our seats on the connecting flight (originally we had our tickets booked to be in the same airport) and instead made us go to the other airport called Shanghai Airlines. The flight experience was pretty standard, but the aircraft arrived 1.5 hours late, which only gave us less than 1.5 hours to check out of China Eastern Airlines to Shanghai Airlines, which is about 1 hour apart. This caused us to miss our connecting flight and it also caused our return trip home to be cancelled. We purchased new tickets to go to Guangzhou and once arrived, we attempted to get the airport to re-book our flight home, but they stated that our current return flight home was still there and even gave us a confirmation print out, so we chose not to worry about it. However, on the day of, we were informed our flight was indeed cancelled and this caused us to buy new tickets for the flight home at the last minute prices which are much more expensive. When I contacted customer service for a refund the original tickets (I assumed we couldn't get it for the new ones purchased), they said that they were unable to refund those tickets, even though it was their fault we missed the flight You would think that because there was a flight delay, they would at least given us a partial refund, but there was no refund at all. Instead of a nice cheap trip to China, I had to pay over $1,500 (last minute tickets were expensive) for a trip that should have been less that $500. Avoid this airline if you can.

### "We had a great experience"
Vancouver to Ho Chi Minh via Shanghai. We read reviews before leaving for Vietnam which seemed to be quite negative. We found the opposite on our trip. We had no issues with staff understanding English, there was more food, drinks including beer and wine offered than we have had on other airlines. The meals were good and frequent. The staff offered beverages throughout the flight. If you needed one and the staff weren't in the aisles you just needed to find them on the plane and they would get what you wanted. Plenty of room in the seats and lots of choices of movies etc to watch on the long flight. We had a great experience.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Toronto to Manila via Shanghai. Very pleasant  team of staff on all sectors of my trip. Very clean and prompt service. The staff were smiling and trying to help with anything. Amazing experience and I will definitely fly with them again.

### "definitely fly this airline again"
New York to Bangkok return via Shanghai. My flight was wonderful. New plane, great helpful onboard staff, and food wasn't bad. After the reviews I expected a ride from hell but it was one of my best experiences on an overseas flight and I am a very frequent flier. I can't speak for the service in coach, but in business class the flight attendents try hard to make everyone happy. The only negative thing that I will say is that a better English speaking staff would be helpful. I will definitely fly this airline again.

### "blatant disregard for customer service"
❎ Not Verified |  Beijing to London via Shanghai. Stupid rules regarding electronics. I can work on my laptop on Wi-Fi but I can't use my mobile phone even with Flight mode enabled. Food was inedible brown slop from Beijing to Shanghai, with no explanation give my crew other than that it was Breakfast. Food from Shanghai to London was barely edible, melon frozen, butter frozen, prawn noodles tepid. Drinks were few and far between with me constantly having to badger staff. Inexplicable delay over nearly 1hr 30min before we took off and inflight announcements were barely audible above the din of the cabin and in terrible English to the point you simply couldn’t understand what the ‘incident at Heathrow’ was. As for the in-flight entertainment, it was poor, outdated twin socket headphone ports, very little in the way of shows or movies and certainly nothing current or recent. Trying to upgrade my return flight as I had done my outbound to business class was met with blank looks and a telephone number that never got answered clearly China Eastern has no interest in taking my money. At Shanghai I enquired again and was given an absurd quote of £5,000 upon asking further what class this was I was informed it was business. This was the first and last time I fly China Eastern. Never have I flown with an airline that has such blatant disregard for customer service and wellbeing.

### "cancelled with a simple text message"
❎ Not Verified |  Shenzhen to Shanghai. Would like to review the booked flight but it was cancelled with a simple text message - flight cancelled. No alternatives, nothing. Fortunately as had booked business class through the Chinese agent Ctrip was able to arrange a replacement flight for us, but only after I called them. Actually it’s not worth complaining about. This is an airline from the cultural revolution, customer service means nothing. Rebooked on MU5356 as expected, rubbish service - seats that should be used in military vehicles. Tourism in China is not exactly a pleasure, and even worse with China Eastern as the carrier.

### "seat is excellent"
New York to Hong Kong via Shanghai. I have to say I was motivated to write this review in large part due to the generally negative reviews I had read on China Eastern prior to taking my first flight. These reviews are so negative I almost cancelled my booking to use Avios points on Cathay. However on actually flying them I was truly impressed by the flight. The seat is excellent and felt the same as the one I had flown on in Air France recently (also excellent). I managed 9 hours of sleep, a record for me. The service was professional if a little robotic although the FA constantly checked if I needed anything else during meal service. Once meal service was done the FAs pretty much disappeared until breakfast although there was a self service food station left out. Entertainment system was limited but that’s my only negative.

### "The attendant just shrugged"
Vancouver to Kathmandu via Kunming. In February this year, my husband and I found a great deal on a flight to Nepal for $903.61CAD. The flight was with China Eastern Airlines, booked through Flighthub. We thought it was too good to be true, we were right. Icouldn't find any reasons as to why the tickets were so cheap, so we purchased them and began to plan our trek through Nepal. The itinerary clearly stated 2 layovers, one in Vancouver, and one in Kunming China. We would fly Vancouver to Kunming China (arriving at 19:25) where we would have an overnight layover. Our flights to Kathmandu left the next day at 16:05. I made sure to  research the Visa requirements for China and we did not require a Visa for this layover. I booked our hotel in Kunming for our overnight stay. Fast forward to our departure date. We flew from Edmonton to Vancouver without any problems. As we were waiting at our gate to board our flight, I was paged to come to the boarding podium (10 minutes prior to boarding). I was informed by the China Eastern  attendant that my husband and I would not be allowed to board the flight as we did not have Visas for China. I explained to her that we did not need them as we were flying into and departing from the same city, and we were in China for less than 24 hours. She then informed me that there was an additional layover in Guangzhou, which put us in the country for 26 hours (2 hours over our time allowed without a Visa). I was furious and demanded an explanation as to how an additional layover (that makes the difference between being able to enter a country or not) was not listed on our itinerary. The attendant just shrugged and told us to downstairs to the China Eastern Air ticket desk. We watched our flight to China depart as we scrambled through the airport to find the desk. Upon arrival we were greeted with someone who I can only assume was a robot. We explained our situation numerous times and requested to be reassigned to a flight that could get us to Nepal. The attendant found numerous flights that would get us there, but refused to book us as she said we had to call  China Eastern air even though we were standing right in front of her. The only thing she could say was "sorry" with a shoulder shrug, over and over and over. We called, and low and behold, we were transferred to another robot with three phrases "Im sorry" "I don't know" and "I can't. So as my husband attempted to sort things on the phone with the China Eastern rep, I called a Flighthub rep. The Flighthub rep informed me that this was China Eastern's fault and that they needed to fix the situation, while the lady at the desk is telling me that it is Flighthub's problem. The Flighthub rep asked me if he could speak directly to the China Eastern desk rep so I handed her my phone and informed her that he wanted to speak with her. She threw up her hands and kept saying "NO," refusing to take my phone. This went back and forth, each attendant blaming the other, acting like a bunch of children.. Meanwhile, the only solution that the China Eastern rep (on phone) had was that we could get on the exact  same flight in two days from that time, which would leave us with the same Visa problem. Not a solution at all.

### "the worst airline experience"
San Francisco to Osaka via Shanghai. Flying with China Eastern was the worst airline experience I've ever had. On my way back to the United States from Japan, I was told at check-in that although my reservation was supposed to be Osaka > Kunming > San Francisco, that I would actually be stopping in Shanghai for a quick plane change before going to Kunming. I asked them if I needed a 3rd boarding pass for that in-between time or if they could provide an itinerary with the times and they said it would be unnecessary because it wasn't a full layover and staff would help us once we were in Shanghai. When I got to Shanghai, we had to go through Chinese customs. All of us with this route were taken together by staff. However, I was the only non-Chinese citizen and was held back. They said they needed my new boarding pass or an itinerary to let me through. I went to the China Eastern desk in Shanghai to see if they would provide this, they refused, so I went back to customs. Basically I kept being sent back and forth between customs and the China Eastern desk for hours that I eventually got left by staff and all the other passengers were taken to Kunming and I was left stranded in Shanghai with no clue what to do. After about 6 hours of this they finally re-booked me on a direct flight back to San Francisco from Shanghai. But the staff was extremely rude and yelled at me for not forcing my way through customs (although all they needed to do was print my itinerary for me and it wouldn't have been a problem). After being re-booked I was taken to another area to wait for another hour for a shuttle to take me to a hotel (it was about 1am at this point). The shuttle finally came and it was an unmarked van driven by two casually dressed men. I waited in the shuttle for an hour with no update about where we were going and when we were leaving. Eventually other passengers started being loaded in. They filled up the van completely, with people standing in corners (and once again, this is just a normal van, not a bus or anything meant to be stood inside of). We got to the hotel and the hotel told us that we were going to have to share rooms with other passengers. Luckily there were some Chinese people in the group who knew they were just trying to scam us and talked the hotel staff into giving us our own rooms. Therefore, it's clear what sort of sketchy hotel China Eastern had chosen for us. Luckily the next morning I was able to get out on my new flight but only after about 8 hours of being mistreated by their staff. I will never fly them again no matter how cheap and would never suggest anyone else do either.

### "customer service is zero"
Vancouver to Delhi via Shanghai with my family (my two daughters 9 and 2 yrs, my wife). On check-in I requested to give me front seat, they denied to me, told me its 1st come 1st serve. After boarding they serve dinner. I already booked Asian vegeterian meals which was confirmed. But they served my family non veg. I showed my itenary which shows all veg meal confirmed. They told me they dont have any information about it. Then they serve us a dessert, rice, pok choy and bread roll - we returned our meal. After 9 hour they serve the meal again, and I thought the crew will find some veg meal for us as we were super busy ate nothing for last 12 hours. But at the end I find all the pessengers were served meal except us. I ask them where is our meal, they replied only non veg left and run away. It was disgusting they know we are vegetarian - they even dont try to serve fruits or some veg salads. I asked one of the crew member to call the supervisior or give me the complaint book, and finally she went and bring two asian vegeterian meal. I was shocked they told me they dont have this meal twice, and only when i got mad they give me this meal. Also most of the crew dont know the basic English, it was hard to communicate with them. Their customer service is zero.

### "much below what you expect"
Moscow to Xian. worst ever experience. The baggage was 3.5 days delayed! No compensation were given for the clothes I needed to buy. The customer service redirected me to the airport and stopped replying. In general, service, food, drinks are much below what you expect from business class.

### "No signs or help from ground staff"
Kuala Lumpur to Toronto via Shanghai. Flight delayed from 2am to 15.00 so after complaining was transferred to Cathay Pacific (good) via Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Return flight on 26 Sept. delayed from 2am to 4am and sat in departure lounge until 4am and then told to come back for 10am departure, only given $4 food voucher for burger King! We were told bad weather in Shanghai (checked online and 32 deg and raining only). So they delayed telling us to come back at 10am to avoid the 8 hour hour notice to avoid giving us hotel. Left at 10am and arrived at Shanghai 3pm, connecting flight at 12:15 pm was missed. No signs or help from ground staff. After 2 hours manged to get flight for next day at 9am via Tokyo to Toronto. Again had to queue for visa and then then for hotel. No one spoke a word of English! After another 3 hours (9pm now) put on bus to hotel 50 mins away. Arrived at 9.50 pm and after getting room got a terrible meal, and told them I need to leave by bus at 6 am. Slept at 11.45 pm but hotel manager banged on door at 4.55am telling me to check out and take bus for 5 am. No time so missed 5am bus and waited for 6.30am bus (again no food). Bus broke down 10 km from airport at 7.30am!. No explanation no instructions!. So flagged a taxi and taxi took me to wrong terminal even after I showed him the flight info! By now its 8.15am so scrambled and pushed my way through security and immigration to board plane at 8.50am. Relief but not for long - my seat screen not working. Glad to land in Tokyo (different world) and board Air Canada to Toronto, arriving 27 hours later than original flight and after traveling for 52 hours!

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
Sydney to Hong Kong via Shanghai. By far the worst airline I've ever flown with in my life. Staff are terrible, can barely speak English, food is inedible, no spirits are available, customer care is non existent, entertainment systems are extremely poor, cabin was dirty etc Etc. We are Qantas platinum frequent flyers - we agreed to fly with China Eastern after being assured that our Platinum status points/frequent flyer points would be equal to those given on Qantas and that we would have the same level of service. This was a downright lie - no status credits, barely any points ans non existent service. I was horrified at the lack of care from the China Eastern staff - they clearly don't care about the customer, they turn the lights off as soon as the first "meals" are served and you are expected to simply be quiet for the remainder of the flight. We fly home on Tuesday and I am dreading the flight. I thought Jetstar was the most budget-style airline you could get, but CEA takes the cake. The worst part about it is that the Qantas flights were actually cheaper. I've learnt my lesson, never ever again! Avoid at all costs.

### "people smoking in the bathrooms"
Flew business class roundtrip from New York JFK to Shanghai. On the return trip, we had 15 hours of turbulence, the cabin was hot, and there were people smoking in the bathrooms. I notified a flight attendant and in in broken English she responded "Yes, it's ok". I was woken mid-flight and asked if I wanted meal service and was unable to get back to sleep. Unlike most airlines and business class, on China Eastern you cannot get any refreshments outside of scheduled meal times. The bathrooms ran out of toilet paper and required cleaning.

### "terrible treatment of passengers"
New Delhi to San Francisco via Shanghai. This was probably our worst flying experience. The worst part was our treatment in Shanghai, we had to spend 18 hours in Shanghai and the airline did not provide any food or accommodation and did not take care of food preferences on the next day flight. Worst of all, they asked for money to store out luggage for extra 18 hours as if it was our fault that were stranded there. Our flight from Delhi to Shanghai was delayed by 6 hours. We were provided food vouchers but no place to stay in a lounge. This was inconvenient, but treatment was okay. Our layover in Shanghai was only 1.5 hours, so we missed Shanghai - San Francisco flight. They put us on the next day's flight, meaning we had to stay at the airport for 18-19 hours. They did not provide any accommodation even though we asked for it repeatedly. We are from India and eat vegetarian food, and no food was provided for all 18 hours. They asked us for 13,000 INR (about 200 USD) for storing our luggage for 18 hours. That is ridiculous. We did not pay. As a result, they gave our luggage back and we had to check it in again the next day! Our preference for Shanghai to SFO was vegetarian food, but they said in the next day flight that the preference applied to last day's flight only, and they don't have any vegetarian food. So, we were without food during the flight too. I cannot recommend enough to keep away from this airline. Terrible service, and terrible treatment of passengers!

### "meal was so poor"
Xi'an to Xining by MU2307 on July 6th. My seat was 7L in the first class. The seat is light color. I haven't sat in any seats like this before. The meal was so poor that it was only contain six pieces of fruit and two cakes. However, cabin crew were patient and friendly.

### "attendant was very rude"
Beijing to Sydney via Nanjing. I checked in at about 12pm midday on 1st September at the Business Class counter in Beijing. The male attendant was very rude. He snapped at me and during the entire 10 minutes or so, he did not look me in the eye, say hello, please, thank you or good bye once. He did not smile at all, other than when he asked his assistant to explain to me that they didn't know where my bags were and that there was no lounge in Beijing. When I was boarding, I was the 2nd in line. When I reached the counter, another male ground staff member snapped at me to stand to the side. I watched as dozens of Economy class passengers passed through. When I asked what was wrong, he snapped back at me, again while looking at the table rather than at me, that Business class passengers had a VIP bus. Then when there were no economy class passengers left, he let me through. When I reached the boarding access-way we had to go down the stairs. A female ground-staff member asked for my boarding pass, and when she saw that I was a Business Class passenger she shouted to the bottom of the stairs, what I presume to be “He’s Business Class, he’s Business Class”. When I reached the bottom of the stairs I was directed away from the transport bus which was right there, to another bus about 20m away between some pylons and other things on the tarmac. The VIP bus then arrived last at the plane and we waited again for all the Economy passengers to board and I was about the last to board the plane, having been about the first in line when the gate first opened.

### "our flight was cancelled"
We booked First class tickets from Xi'an to Shanghai. In the morning, we got message on our mobile that our flight was cancelled due to thunder shower at Shanghai and were asked to rebook our ticket. We tried almost whole morning to get connected. There was no special line for First class passengers. Then we were informed that all flights on the same days were fully booked and we had to fly on the afternoon of next day or we had to rebook the tickets at airport. We rushed to airport just to find that hundreds passengers were waiting and there was no First class counter. After long time waiting, we were given 2 options: one to fly the next afternoon and the other to fly to WUX, an airport 150km away from Shanghai. When asking possibilities to transit somewhere, I was told that MU can only fly us once to any airports we wanted and we had to pay for additional flights to PVG. What a joke! We had to accept flying to WUX. We sat in the lounge from 6PM to 2:30AM before flight took off at 3:00AM. To my most surprise, after 10:30PM, there was no staff in the lounge and there were no snacks or food any more. There were only very loud automatic announcements saying “We are sorry to announce that flight… was delayed or cancelled” repeated endlessly. Arriving at WUX, we booked a taxi to Shanghai, of course paying all costs ourselves. I recommend to take airlines other than MU should you wish to travel in China. HU and CZ are much much better. Or high speed train is another good option.

### "Very unpleasant staff"
Shanghai to Moscow. The departure delayed 2 hours. All the passengers waited before a departure gate all this time with no information about a current departure time. The airline provide an extremely old plane A330-200 for a long (almost 10 hours) flight. The seats are almost broken and uncomfortable. No entertainment system like TV, international radio,veriety of music etc, except few main TV's in a main row of seats with a Chinese movie without any translation. Also radio was in Chinese? but the earphone plug was broken. Staff speaks English in intermediate level. After the take off I ask the person for changing a place, since the first row was free. She allow me to do it and I move all my stuff to a new place. After few minutes she returned and told me I must go back since this place cost additional money. Very unpleasant staff. China Eastern it is a far cry from Aeroflot I usually fly. It was my first, but definitely a last flight with this airline.

### "crew helpful and friendly"
Xining to Xi'an on July 9th. It was my first time to flew in first class with China Eastern Airlines. The crew were helpful and friendly. I'm not satisfied with the food because there were only two cakes and some fruit. The seat was very comfortable so I fell sleep in a short time. The inflight entertainment contained latest films.

### "Avoid taking China Eastern"
New York JFK to Fuzhou via Shanghai. Avoid taking China Eastern Airlines at all cost. First of all, the flight from JFK was delayed for four hours. The scheduled departure was 4:25pm, and the plane didn't leave until 8:15pm. Upon arrive on PVG, the customers were informed that the transferred flight from Shanghai to Fuzhou has already departed. The flight from PVG to FOC is under the same flight number MU588. The flight departed as the customers are arriving at PVG. Worst of all, they don't have anything arranged for another flight until the next day.

### "attendants keep shouting loudly"
Tokyo to Xian via Shanghai. The female cabin attendants keep shouting loudly to passengers seated on aisle seats "Be careful, Be careful! as they pass by pushing food/drink wagons, instead of "Excuse me! Their level of English proficiency is very low. Almost none of them speak Japanese, either. No information is given by China Eastern on Internet that passengers with economy tickets must pay for wine on international flights. No charge for beer, however. The flight from Xian to Shanghai on Aug. 7 was delayed more than 90 minutes; however, no explanations for the delay were made available to passengers at all. Consequently, I missed my connecting flight 539 from Shanghai to Tokyo Haneda. Again, I was left in complete limbo as to if I would be able to get on another flight. And if so, which flight? Even if I wanted to ask for somme information at the boarding gate for Haneda flight, there were no ground crew available there for two hours! Where as the Japanese keep on apologizing in such circumstances without giving enough information for delays, the Chinese never apologize whatsoever.

### "food was low quality"
I have never been on a more neurotic airline than China Eastern. Let me explain. For the flight from Diqing to Kunming you cannot use headphones upon take off or landing, which is absolutely ridiculous. They refused to take off in the rain which delayed my flight 6 hours. The food was low quality, but expected given the price. There is no beverage choice.

### "worth cheap price of ticket"
New York to Fuzhou. The crew was really nice and seats were also comfortable since it can be rotated 180 degrees. They gave us free wifi. Even though it wasnt that great you can still watch something on youtube on 240p with a vpn. The food was not that great though. For the inflight entertainment there was a selection of western and eastern movies and tv shows. The experience was worth the cheap price of the ticket.

### "impolite and unprofessional"
Sydney to Beijing via Shanghai. The cabin crew was impolite and unprofessional, hostess do not speak English (and one could ignore that as well), but the airline service is just appalling. First, my connection flight was cancelled but this was written nowhere. The next available flight (Shanghai to  Beijing, not exactly an uncommon route) they propose me is 5 hours after the one I had. Then, this flight was late, God knows for how long, because not only it was not signaled on the departure boards until one hour after it was meant to leave. I asked if it was possible to know more or less, I didn't needed the exact time, just if we were talking about 1 or 5 hours. Staff said that they had no idea. If you want to have an awful flying experience, I recommend China Eastern, otherwise run in the opposite direction.

### "check in is the worst of all"
Beijing to Bangkok. Flight time is 1950 hrs. I arrived Beijing Airport at 1600 hrs. I went to check-in counter. The airline check-in officer asked me to wait till 1720 hrs for checking-in. I went to the check-in counter again at 172 0hrs, the check-in staff told me to wait till 1830hrs, saying that the flight is delayed. To my understanding, there is priority check-in for business class and first class passenger. Passengers of these priority class should be checked in, even in the flight delayed situation. They can be comfortably hosted in business lounge, not just waiting uncomfortably in all passenger waiting place. I have travelled with many airlines in business class, and I am very comfortable with their hospitality. The Beijing airport check in is the worst of all. The ground staffs have problem in communication with passengers too.

### "emotionless but helpful"
Tokyo to Male return via Shanghai. On our way to Male all went smoothly - everything was on time, service was good, food was ok. The plane was new and clean with wide screens. On our way back though the flight to Shanghai was 5 hours late and the reason seemed to be a change of aircraft. All passengers were calm and seemed to be used to these kind of problems. We missed our connecting flight. However we were lucky and had helpful staff helping us get back to Japan on the next flight to Haneda. The staff are sometimes emotionless but helpful. I would recommend the airline but if you want to play safe with no delays and good inflight entertainment, maybe better to choose a different airline.

### "the worst experience"
San Francisco to Kathmandu via Kunming. This was the worst experience in my travel history. The flight made unknown stop in Qingdao that was not listed in the ticket; makes you get out of the plane and go through security and put you back on the same plane again (whats the point?). Cannot use cell phone in airplane mode as well, but can use a laptop (dont get this logic either). Worst of all I was told that I would claim the baggage in Kathmandu (final destination) during my checking in Denver, but they made me claim the baggage in Kunming where I had to stay with my luggage for 17 hours layover. The return flight was as painful as the going one where I had to stay with my checked luggage for 12 hours in Kunming and 3 hours security check in qingdao. The flight experience is total disaster -  when the flight attendant asks you to close the window and if you open in between, they come and yell at you, if they tell you open the window and if you close it, they come and yell; if you ask for additional food or drinks after the serving time, they tell you its over - and zero customer service. I never recommend anyone using China Eastern Airlines : poor customer service.

### "staff was patient and helpful"
Shanghai to Toronto. A very nice experience with nice cabin environment. The staff was patient and helpful, they provided three meals include Wine and many kinds of bread .The lounge in Shanghai is one of the best I have experienced and it's new! The leg room is wider than United Airlines and Air Canada.

### "return flight the most horrifying"
Seoul to San Francisco via Qingdao. I am doing this review for the sake of the passengers who are thinking of taking China Eastern Airlines as their carrier to their next destination. Your hard earned money will never be worth it by flying this company. The outbound flight from San Francisco to Seoul Korea via Pudong Airport was seamless. However, you cannot check in online if the ticket you purchased was not directly from their website. Check in in San Francisco was prompt. No hotel accommodation if you are changing flights between two different airports. I used the Mercure Hotel outside of Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai. The return flight was the most horrifying. First, the check in agent could not use my ticket. Someone perhaps already “checked me in online”. I have informed the check in agent that I have not done so, and basically they are calling me a liar for saying that. The whole ordeal of trying to figure out what happened to my reservation, after calling the Shanghai office, took about an hour; just to sort out the problem of which CE could have handled properly. The hotel accommodation I was provided was located at the outskirts of Pudong. I was arriving at Hongqiao about 9:45 p.m. local time, and the travel between these two airport is about an hour with no traffic. The person who picked me up transported me into a family size car with no signs whatsoever that it partners or contracts with CEA. One will be freaked out if they do not put enough courage to trust the driver and staff who spoke no English. Handsome Hotel in New Pudong Area, this hotel makes you feel as if you were in North Korea. Morning came as I connect to my other flight, I made it Qingdao. My flight from Qingdao to San Francisco was scheduled to depart at 12:30 p.m. local time. 12:00 p.m. came, no announcement that the flight will be delayed. No reason, no staff, no explanation. One, two, three hours passed no staff to explain to their passengers what the deal is. You get one staff who spoke only Chinese and a bit frustrated if you ask her to translate in English whatever she just announced in the paging system. Finally we were provided with packed meal with a whole bunch of preserved side dishes. Still no explanations as to why our flight is delayed. Came 8 o’clock p.m., finally our plane was on-sight and the gate agents started to finally show up. Passengers were aggravated and just angry about the whole ordeal. CEA should always  put a gate agent or a customer service representative to provide information regarding up to the minute information about the flight. We were left out with no clue for 8 hours, we were not allowed to leave the airport because our passports were already stamped as “departed” and we were not allowed to do so by the immigration officials. We were delayed for a total of 9 hours, with no palatable meal, no explanation, no sense of compassion from the staff about our flight. At 8:30 p.m. we boarded the flight to San Francisco and some of the passengers became very physically obnoxious to the CEA agents. I could only understand their frustration. CEA should not even be in business if they continue to observe this kind of business relationship with its customers.

### "would fly with them again"
Chicago to Denpasar via Shanghai. I was a bit nervous about this airline, but actually I was fairly impressed. The aircraft was new and clean with TVs in each seat. The economy seats were comfortable and had some recline. There was a selection of Hollywood movies as well as Chinese movies. Some of the foreign movies had English subtitles, some did not. There was also some Chinese TV but very few American shows. There was no WiFi on my flight, and they ban cell phone use. The staff was courteous and understood English, but don't expect to have a conversation with them. This flight was overnight. My main gripe was that they would turn on all the lights in the cabin and make announcements every 4 hours or so to serve food, even in the middle of the night. The food selection was hit or miss. They had the option of Western or Chinese food and some sodas to pick from or tea. They came through the cabin every hour or two to serve water. Overall, exceeded my expectations and I would fly with them again.

### "No rebooking. No refunds"
Shanghai to Melbourne. We got off to a bad start when after my JFK - PVG flight landed I was told the Shanghai to Beijing portion was cancelled. As I collected my bags and headed up to the ticket counters to rebook, get a hotel, and wait for the next flight, I was stopped by a young man who was Airport Services looking for lost tourists and he took me to a grumpy ticket agent. A scrap of paper was handed over to me with a new flight number and time. I asked for a hotel. I was told there was no hotel because it was a domestic flight. I said I've just come in from New York, but I was told no hotel, no refund, just given a paper slip with a flight number and time handwritten on it. It gets better. When I said, I need a hotel to staff, he said he knew a place. He asked me if I had a credit card. Well, I could just get my insurance to pay for a night. He drove me to Hotel Land and negotiated a $250 AUD room with a scrummy Chinese breakfast. I paid. I was tired, in need of a shower and figured - insurance, that's why you get it. The next day, I have a 1:10pm flight and they said that getting the 10am shuttle from the hotel would mean I'd have plenty of time if there was traffic and security delays. I agreed. I did not want to be late or miss a flight. I get to the airport at 10:06am. Check in took 40 minutes. Security 10 minutes, and then the tranquility of a near dead terminal. Forty minutes until boarding and I'm ready to go. Oh - gate change, here's a boxed lunch for your trouble, flight's delayed for a bit. After all these announcements, I ask the woman next to me how long she thinks a bit of a delay will be. Her response, about four hours. After three hours, we are hustled onto a plane that has magically appeared. We actually board. On the plane, my seat has that concave, butt dent and forward tilt that makes me want to sit on my hands, a book, anything to stop me from tilting out into the seat ahead, but it doesn't matter. I fall asleep and then a stewardess says "We're not sure how long we're going to be here so, the captain has asked us to get off. Its about 5 o'clock now. Another dinner, more hours and finally  "your flight is cancelled! It's 8pm. That's when the fighting starts. No rebooking. No refunds. If you want out, its $3600 to get back to Sydney. Take it or leave it. I took it.

### "cabin staff service are terrible"
Kunming to Guangzhou. Ground service nice and I don't need to wait a long time to get my boarding pass, but I need to go through the the whole airport to get to the Lounge. Lounge offers meals and staff lead me to the airplane. Boeing 737-800 with entertainment system in first class and a new plane with 12 domestic first class seats. The cabin staff service are terrible and food taste bad. China Eastern is better than Air China but still need to improve their cabin service.

### "Very bad management"
Nanjing to Sydney. It is now 5.5 hr delays which they have been pushing back further every hour. No clear information and no solution to work out. Very bad management of the situation, and no clear information, and most disappointing. The cheap price isn't worth the uncertainty. I don't mind the lack of amenities, but it is an airline, not a parking space operator. Waiting indefinitely is not part of the deal, and if you are flying on congested routes then you ought to have a backup plan.

### "business like attitude from staff"
China Eastern website is net easy to navigate but I was finally able to choose a seat after spending some time to search. Check in at Los Angeles for my flight to Seoul via Shanghai was quick and professional. Agents at the gate were very business like. The B777 appeared very new and was clean. The business like attitude continued with the flight attendants throughout the flight - courteous but never warm. The plane was only about 60% full so there was a lot of room to stretch out. Food and IFE were adequate and not unlike other airlines I have flown. PVG is a big airport and the CE staff were again business like. I did not interact with the gate agent for my Seoul flight so nothing to say there. Flight to Seoul was 100% full. Left a little late but arrived on time. Flight attendants were methodical and never smiled. At times they could seem a little rude. Since I don't speak Chinese I could never understand them but they seemed a little curt to most of the passengers. Overall I got to where I wanted to go on a clean plane and generally on-time for an amazing price. Food and IFE were reasonable and my bags got arrived when I arrived.

### "very bad experience"
Avoid China Eastern if possible. I flew with them 3 times from Beijing to Shanghai and every single flight was delayed. When I asked them why? They always gave the same answer: "bad weather conditions" even there was no bad weather in China. When I asked how long is the flight delayed? They said :"no time". So you might wait up to 7 hours at the airport. Besides this they do not communicate with passengers, provide terrible service, and they have horrible food onboard. I think the real reason is the issue with a air traffic control. Very bad experience!

### "cancelled due to bad weather"
Shanghai Hongqiao to Beijing. I used mileage to redeem this flight and originally I booked MU5119 which departs at 1700. When I arrived at the airport, I was told that MU5119 and two more subsequent flights were cancelled due to bad weather in Beijing. At the ticket counter, I was offered MU5125 to depart at 2000, but at the check-in counter, the staff told me that MU5117 schedule to depart at 1600 but delayed until further notice still have a seat. Meals were provided at the gate during dinner time and we took off at 2128. This flight was operated by a new A330-300 aircraft, the IFE was responsive. I appreciated the help from the airport staff.

### "ridiculous refusal of check-in"
Shanghai Hongqiao to Shenzhen. When arriving at Shanghai about 2.5 hrs before departure, I was told that the originally booked flight had been cancelled and I was rebooked to a later flight. Flight delay and cancellation in China due to weather condition are quite normal. I went to check-in counter just to find that aircraft was still at Beijing and I was refused for check-in. I was told to wait till the aircraft departed from Beijing. I had to stand somewhere in the termincal with my big luggage. It is terrible and I never had such ridiculous refusal of check-in. After standing almost 30 minutes, I was pointed to a check-in manager, who helped me get my boarding pass and luggage checked in. Flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. Flight was smooth and service on board quite attentive. Seat was old version of business class seat, which was used as first class for domestic flight. Seat was very uncomfortable in sit position, but quite comfy when in flat position for a short flight of 2 hours.

### "Poor customer service"
New York to Seoul via Shanghai. Worst experience with this airline. Poor customer service round trip from the helpless crew in JFK to the rude and lost in Shanghai. They rather have empty seats unfilled, and customer comfort is not a priority wish I could say more. Never again for sure.

### "service is satisfactory"
Nice flight from Shanghai to Kuala Lumpur. Good service provided by the crew with friendly smiles. Food and beverage just nice. Entertainment okay with 2 movies by shared monitor. Time for departure and arrival is good. Luggage service also good. Overall, service is satisfactory.

### "a very bad airline"
Hong Kong to Shanghai. A disaster, flight MU508 on Saturday 10th of June 2017 (departure time 15:05) canceled. Boarding time was at 14:25, but no crew at the gate, a bit later 2 crew members told us that they have some problems with the aircraft. Half hour later we had to go on board, and the waiting tim was beginning, after we was sitting 4 for hours in the plane, withou any informations, we had to leave the aircraft and go to a counter where 2 China Eastern crew members didn't had more informations. After a long waiting time they tell us that our flight is cancelled and that they will organize a hotel, yes it was already about 22:00. First we had to wait another hour for the luggages, after that we was transferred to a hotel, and had to wait another hour for a room. Sunday at 01:20 i finaly got a room. The management of all this situation was a disaster, we all had the feeling that it would be the first time they have to manage such a situation. The China Eastern crew tried to do the best, but no chance, the problem was coming from the management. On Sunday morning 06:30 again on the way to the airport, they organized a flight, MU508A, departure time on 09:30, but again a disaster, its now 13:15, I'm writing sitting in this plane, again waiting, already again almost 4 hours - i just hope this aircraft will take off today - just a big disaster, again the same story, a very bad airline!

### "worst flying experience"
This was the worst flying experience of my life and I am a very frequent flyer. Travelled from Toronto to Bangkok via Shanghai with China Eastern. I experienced the worst customer service, no one spoke English and everyone in Shanghai was extremely rude and unhelpful, sending us from one person to the other without solving our problem. We were forced to stay in China for 24 hours instead of the 3 hour layover that I paid for. This resulted in us missing a connecting flight from Shanghai to Bangkok (which I paid extra for just so I dont have to have a long layover). We also missed our flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui and missed 2 days of our trip in transit and lost hotel bookings in Thailand which we pre-paid. We were not compensated for anything. We had summer clothes and it was -5 C in China and no one even offered us a blanket when we told them we were cold. They sent us to a hotel that had all its windows open and it was freezing. They gave us the worst food that we could not eat it (it was 1 am so everything was closed and we couldnt buy other food). I will never fly with China Eastern again and would not recommend this company. Seats were extremely rammed and tight, you can't use some electronics even if in airplane mode at any time during the 14 hour flight.

### "an extremely low fare"
Paris to Shenzhen via Shanghai Pudong. We got an extremely low fare (380 Euros for HAM-CDG-PVG-SZX) which made the choice easy. However, flying China Eastern was a relaxed expirience. The A330-200 was quite new and had spacious seats and so did the A320 on the domestic route. The IFE could have had a little more variety, but was okay even for an eleven hour flight. But bring your own headphones, the ones they distribute are a catastrophe. Food was okay as well, only criticism: I could only get one beer on the long-haul flight. The crew on the international flight was a bit rude and did not speak english very well. Nevertheless, the domestic crew was friendly. Check-In in Shenzhen was a little unorganized and we had to re-check our bags in Shanghai. On all legs, there were only minor delay (~30 Minutes PVG-CDG). Would fly China Eastern again.

### "asked for a blanket, instantly told they were out"
Shanghai to Hong Kong with China Eastern Airlines. Asked for a blanket, was instantly told they were out. Then see another attendant walk by with blankets to pass out to their own FFP members. I complained, was then told she will go look, came back to me saying very sorry there are no more blankets. Then 3 minutes later see that exact same attendant pass out blankets to couple other passengers. Same thing happened a third time.

### "worst service I have ever received"
Chiang Mai to Vancouver via Shanghai. I will never book with this airline again. China Eastern Airlines was the reason I missed my connection flight home, and they handled it terribly. There was no announcement saying we would be departing late or landing late. It was 10 hours into the flight when I found out we would be arriving late, so I showed my boarding pass to the staff. They were rude, and basically laughed saying I "would not make it, need new flight". No one helped me. When we landed it took about 2 hours of waiting with 15 other people to find out what was happening with our connection flight. We were finally told that we were put onto a flight the next morning, 12 hours away - then to be told that this airline would not put us in a hotel for the night. $10.00 food voucher and that was it. Reimbursement? Maybe we would get one in 2 months. Maybe. The flight staff was rude, and snarky. No empathy, and no apologies. The worst service I have ever received on an airline.

### "no interest in customer service"
Kolkata to Vancouver via Kunming. While in India I required an extension of my ticket to complete dental work. Cost in India; $300. In Canada, $3,300. Every effort to reach the airline by e-mail was ignored. Phoned twice, and received bogus e-mail address. Time spent on calls were more then the time it would have taken to let me know I was entitled to an extension. Only found this out in Kolkata airport 3.5 hours before flight home. Needed 4 hours. Lost time waiting to enter airport as received itinerary, not a ticket. On return wrote to manager in Vancouver. Also ignored. Feeling is they sold a ticket by computer, and had no interest in customer service. Total lack of humanity. As a result, despite the savings in airfare, I would highly recommend that customers not take this airline as outside of in-flight aspects, it lacks a human component.

### "by far the worst airline"
San Francisco to Phnom Penh via Kunming. This is by far the worst airline. Sure, I got my ticket $560 but that doesn't mean I have to take the trip to hell. I departed from SFO to Kunming with a delay. Their customer services seem to know very little of English, and nobody speaks English at all the transfer airports in mainland China. At all airports that we were transferring from, No WiFi, No signs to navigation to proper transfer points. Their meals sucked. I strongly suggest do not take this flight.

### "never fly with China Eastern again!"
❎ Unverified |  Okinawa to Rome via Shanghai. I don't be even know where to begin. First we booked our flight 3 months ahead and China Eastern kept changing the route which caused overnight layovers in Shanghai and Moscow. The flight from Okinawa to Shanghai was the worst. The flight attendants were rude and ignored us. The food was so-so. Then leaving Rome we had to buy a whole new ticket to fly with China Airlines because China Eastern did not let us know we needed a visa to stay in Moscow overnight. So when we called China Eastern to see if they could find us another flight they did nothing but look up one flight said it was booked could not refund us or give us credit for it. So we had to find a flight last minute and pay a grand. We will never fly with China Eastern again!

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Shanghai to London. I booked China Eastern with low expectations, however was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft was modern and clean. The business class seat was similar to Cathay Pacific, and seats have direct aisle access and recline into a very comfortable and private flat bed. The food I was pleasantly surprised. I'd read bad things so opted for the Chinese options. If you are flying a Chinese airline, then you would expect the Chinese food to be good and it was. One meal I would go as far to say it was delicious. On the return leg, I did try a Western option (lamb) and it was tasty. The crew were courteous and attentive. I can understand how non-Chinese speakers might come across frustrations as some crew had limited English. The lounges are less inspiring but ground staff were generally helpful. Priority boarding was well organised and efficient

### "$490 USD which I thought was fantastic"
Los Angeles to Hong Kong via Shanghai. I came across a round-trip offer for $490 USD which I thought was fantastic. However, I soon realized that China Eastern Airlines has horrible reviews. I took a leap of faith and went with them. I arrived at LAX, and line wasn't too long but the amount of agents helped it go quickly. I checked a bag without any hassle and made my way through security. When boarding was announced they had agents holding up signs indicating where you should line up. It was a pleasant experience and once I boarded I was surprised at how much leg room and space I had for a basic economy seat on this aircraft. Food service was mediocre but it's economy. The in-flight entertainment had a lot of good american films but not so much tv shows. The staff spoke fairly decent English and provided very good service. The only issue I had was with China Government regulation that says people cannot operate cell phones on flights but iPads and laptops are ok?? That doesn't make sense. We arrived in Shanghai on time and departed for Hong Kong on time as well. Both flights were fine and the same level of service for the return trip. I would highly suggest China Eastern given their price. However, I always prefer a nonstop flight if I can so the layover wasn't ideal but that wasn't China Eastern's fault.

### "satisfied with this flight"
Baoshan to Guangzhou via Kunming. Very satisfied with this flight: clean aircraft, comfortable seats, quite tasty food but the highlight  was service by a young female FA who professional, proactive and offering business class service. She even asked me for my Chinese name, in order to properly address me. To my surprise they offer white and red wines, something I have found unusual on China Southern narrow body domestic flights. I really enjoyed the flight.

### "never had big issues with them"
Guangzhou to Baoshan domestic flight on 13APR, seat 41L. The flight consists of 2 flights with an approx. 1hr stop in Kunming. The first leg newish aircraft, very comfy seats with adjustable headrests. The staff was very polite and helpful, however they didn't approach to say "hello" to SkyTeam Gold member (as they're required by their management). I saw them greeting their own program's FFs, also delivering them food before others - a nice gesture I think. The food was quite tasty and they're not scared to offer pork options. On other Chinese airlines it's just beef or chicken in economy class. On arrival in Kunming all passengers continuing to Baoshan have to exit the aircraft and exchange their boarding passes inside the aerobridge - I think this step is unnecessary and just time wasting. The other leg in a very old B737-700, just a water handed in during boarding but for a 50min flight it was OK. I saw many negative flight reports about China Eastern, however I have never had big issues with them and recommend them.

### "flight was brilliantly priced"
Los Angeles to Shenzhen via Shanghai, and my experience was fine. The plane was clean and new, food acceptable, we left and arrived on time, seats were comfortable, movie selection adequate, staff polite and efficient. Only slight annoyance was total ban on cell phones, even if in flight mode. So if you want some music bring another media source. Best of all the flight was brilliantly priced. So no complaints.

### "Food wasn't spectacular"
Booked my trip from Sydney to Shanghai due to special fare. Sydney to Shanghai leg was flown by A330, plane was ok, entertainment screen was quite big. Food wasn't spectacular but was edible, in fact, not much different to Qantas anyway. Crew members' English were reasonable, the only negative was the fact the cabin temperature was a bit too cold. HangZhou to Sydney flag was flown by A320, old plane, no entertainment at all, though it didn't affect me much, I slept pretty much the whole way through, crew were nice overall.

### "Very disappointing"
Beijing to Sydney via Hangzhou. Very disappointing experience flying with China Eastern Airlines as a family of four people. The seats on the plane were not comfortable and the space between the seats was not existent. The food was not tasty. For example dinner option included pork noodles or duck with rice. We all ordered different options but were quite dissatisfied with all of them. The flight attendants on international flight do not speak English so if you do not speak Chinese you are in a lot of trouble if you need to ask for anything. There was no entertainment system on the flight and you are not allowed to use any electronic devices including mobile phones on airplane mode. So you are basically stuck to your seat for 13 hours and your only entertainment option is Chinese newspaper. To top the list, it was very stuffy and hot and we were literally dripping with sweat during the entire flight. It is not in my nature to write negative reviews, however I thought that this might be helpful to know if you consider booking an international flight with China Eastern Airlines.

### "highlight was a free upgrade"
Hong Kong to Hiroshima and returning to Paris via Shanghai. This airline respects FFP status from their partners (Air France - KLM in my case). Arrived to HKG a bit early, and was offered to take an earlier flight, no extra cost. Access to lounges provided at all airports. Connections at Shanghai relatively smooth (no flight delays), but they parked their aircraft way off on the tarmac, so took quite a bit of time for the passengers to be bused to plane. Highlight of the trip was a free upgrade at the gate for Shanghai to Paris leg, so I cannot complain. Overall, the airline is about average in terms of in-flight entertainment and service in economy, and comparable to a Western carrier in business (they have lie-flat seats on their A330 on PVG-CDG flight). I was in the end happy with what I got; however, I have not fortunately experienced any issues while traveling, so I do not know how they handle disruption, which is where true quality of an airline is revealed, in my opinion.

### "seats were comfortable enough though"
Flew China Eastern from Sydney to Shanghai. The plane was rather old, the seats were comfortable enough though. The crew barely spoke English so it was not easy to communicate with the crew, luckily I had a really nice neighbor helping me with that! The entertainment system was quite old also, the same as the plane.

### "cold throughout the whole flight"
❎ Unverified |  The flight was a night flight from Shanghai to Sydney. The cabin was cold throughout the whole flight. Seated in seat 70H at the rear of the plane I asked the cabin crew (both male/female) to please turn up the heating as everyone with the exception of two male western passengers had their coats on. It was freezing. Both crew members said the heating was up to 26 degrees and this has been pre-set. I exclaimed that if this was the case, why are all the passengers sitting with their coats on. I asked both of the cabin crew to ask the flight service director to pop down to see me. I was told by both that she was too busy attending to passengers in First Class. When we got off the flight in Sydney, the flight service director was saying good-bye to disembarking passengers. When I told her my plight, she proceeded to follow me up the aerobridge apologising for this oversight. She told me that no one had brought this matter to her attention. While she appeared to be very apologetic, I can honestly say that I didn't see her once coming through the cabin in economy class. People are not comfortable sitting in their seats with their coats on. I used two spare blankets to keep me warm throughout the flight. The food was below basic with the same meals served on the way up, served on the way down. The bread roll was served after the meal and not with the meal, which was a bit odd. The in-flight entertainment (IFE) was abysmal and I was told I could not use my iPhone (which was on flight mode) to listen to my music, while the Chinese passengers were using theirs. This was my second time in flying China Eastern (the last trip in 2006 on a flight from Shanghai to HK) and it will be my last. The cabin crew do not appear to have the social or cultural niceties to satisfy their customers' expectations and comfort. Another thing, we did not hear from the captain once on any of the China Eastern flight sectors. Amazing for any airline that the captains of China Eastern do not introduce themselves or give you flight updates which are left to the staff. Perhaps that's a cultural or hierarchical difference only known to them. They talk about passenger safety, they forgot to mention passenger comfort.

### "cancelled with no explanation"
❎ Unverified |  Okinawa to Shanghai via Beijing. Terrible. Our flight stopped in Shanghai, but when we got off to switch to our Beijing flight, it has been cancelled with no explanation. Every single person has to be rebooked, and they had two people working the counter for multiple cancelled flights. Turns out a connecting flight to Osaka was also cancelled. It took hours to rebook, and everyone was stuck with nowhere to sit and no wifi, so those of us without Chinese cell phones couldn't make calls. They did put us up in a hotel, but we were in the airport for hours, followed by a roughly two-hour bus ride. It was awful. And they never explained the cancellation to either flight - or if they did, it wasn't in English. The English-speaking ticket agents didn't know the reason, either.

### "No announcement made in English"
Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo via Shanghai. Original Flight 2am on 20th December. Flight took off towards Shanghai but making a detour halfway through. The captain made an announcement in Chinese that the weather in Shanghai was so bad and couldn't allow our aircraft to land. No announcement was made in English. Most of the passengers were having international flights (connecting flights in Shanghai as I did) and there were some who didn't understand Chinese at all. They only realized it the moment we landed and there was a sign saying "welcome to KL". The counter only had 4 ground staff (2 men, 2 women) and only one of them was capable / authorized to rebook our flights via another airline etc. One of the ground staff told us 2 total different stories as to why we are back in KLIA - airspace in Vietnam restricted our plane from entering (however, the flight next to our gate was going to Xiamen using the exact route as we were, but they are able to fly regardless) and secondly that the air crews were now unable to fly as their "working hours were up". After negotiating for 2-3 hours, the ground staff finally said that they could get those who can reach their destination with a direct flight to another airline. I was able to get MAS tickets to Narita but leaving around midnight that day (I'll be only reaching Narita at 7am the next day). We were also given the choice to take the same plane later that night, 9pm but we would only arrive in Narita 12 noon the next day. Those who had to make connecting flights regardless were stuck with using the same plane. Compensation was lunch buffet and resting in a room until 6pm at Pullman Hotel. Poor management of the ground staff: We were made to bring our luggage to the hotel when they told us we didn't have to. No staff followed us to the hotel or picked us up. We had no update info on the flights. My flight was further delayed, the staff at the check-in counter couldn't tell us why exactly the flight was delayed again but there was another flight to China at 9pm (but not the same flight). Food on the plane was terrible. I asked for Chinese style breakfast which was plain porridge with no condiments/sauce, no side dish whatever sort (and small portion). Even the buns only came approximately 30 mins later and are served cold (they couldn't heat the buns up in time). In-flight entertainment: a screen that drops out from the upper compartment (mine was 6 rows in front of me).

### "Very low price, good service"
San Francisco to Osaka via Shanghai. Our China Eastern experience was excellent. Very low price, good service, good food, good entertainment. Only downside was that onboard Wi-Fi wasn't working, and they were a little overly strict on smartphone usage. Overall great experience.

### "incredibly low fare"
London to Melbourne via Shanghai. The crew were attentive, food was good, and seats were as comfortable as any economy I've flown. The entertainment wasn't the widest selection, but enough to keep me going, and every seat had a plug to keep my laptop alive. There was no wifi Both legs were on time, and everything was easy down to the e-transfer gate at Shanghai Pudong. Would fly again, given the incredibly low fare!

### "great flight service"
Vancouver to Ho Chi Minh City via Shanghai. I had a great time flying with China Eastern. I was a bit skeptical, because of all the negative reviews this airline has accumulated; but I personally had a very good time. The ground staff spoke in good English, and there were no delays. I did have a 5 hour layover in Shanghai, and the service there was also pretty good (except for the bus-to-airplane. It was a really bumpy ride!) The inflight entertainment was full of games and other movies/etc, which kept me satisfied for the 13 hour flight to Shanghai. The two hour flight to Ho Chi Minh City didn't have any personal in-flight entertainment. Just some little pop-out TVs on the roof of the cabin. Also, there was no wi-fi on this flight. The food was okay; it was good enough for me to eat the whole thing, but it could definitely be a bit tastier. There were beverages served throughout the whole flight, and the attendants kept me hydrated without me having to get out of my seat. Also, they really cared for the passengers; once, my two children had to go to the bathroom, but turbulence hit while they were going. The flight attendants took them in a safe place of the cabin, as our seats were pretty far away from the toilet they were going to (the other ones were occupied). They stayed with them them there, until the turbulence was over, and they escorted our children back to their seats after the shaking was over. Now that's what I call great flight service.

### "need more English speaking crew"
Hong Kong to Shanghai. This was my first time experience in China Eastern Airlines and it definitely needs to be improved. They need more English speaking crew and they also need to improve their food. The customer service was OK but was not up to expectations. They refused to auto transfer our luggage. They didn't respect our seat preference inspite of empty seats available. I would not recommend this airline.

### "appreciated their effort"
New York JFK to Tokyo via Shanghai. I had a great experience with China Eastern. My flight was cancelled together with other flights on the night of blizzard in NYC, and the airport was in chaos the next day; many people were on the standby and I almost could not be rescheduled to the next flight that allows me to be in Tokyo before important meetings and my friend's wedding. They put us into the flight with different airport from our original flight that is closer to the city for no additional charge. I originally had 7hr layover but it was also gone. They were quick and efficient with attitude to not make us worry. I sincerely appreciated their effort.

### "Avoid at all costs"
❎ Unverified |  Denpasar to Vancouver via Shanghai. Worst experience ever. This airline sold me a ticket that had a 28 hour layover in two different cities. Beijing and Nanjing. Not being told I had to get a tourist visa until arriving at the airport to not be allowed on the plane. They would not change my flight. And I had to re-book a whole new flight after booking with a different airline. For 1600$ vs 900$ I orginially paid. They are crooks. Who puts a multi city layover knowing full well it would require a visa to someone who's departure is out of their home country (which they are flying too) which makes it impossible for me to have applied for a visa in the first place. Not to mention they only issue a minimum of 4 day visas. Ridiculous. Stay away from this airline. I've had a previous bad experience with them but this is the last time I will ever use this airline. Avoid at all costs if possible.

### "friendly and professional"
My second time on China Eastern Airlines (MU565) from Shanghai to Singapore. Even though I had read many bad reviews about MU rude staff, the crews on this flight, (in fact all my MU flights) are very friendly and professional, they are willing to help passengers; the check in staff at PVG airport are  friendly as well. There was a travel group sitting around me, I noticed that the crews had taken care of them when they needed. The IFE screen offers a great variety of entertainment. Overall, I had more than a great flight onboard, will fly with MU again when I go back to China next time to visit family.

### "big improvement"
Flew on flight MU546 from Singapore back to Shanghai with China Eastern. I was impressed by the big improvement on meals, cabin services. There are many rounds of drink services after the meal. The IFE offers a great variety of entertainment. We departed and arrived on time. Overall, well done! I would recommend MU for this route.

### "Slack staff and very cheap airline"
❎ Unverified |  Amsterdam to Auckland via Shanghai. Would not fly with this airline again. First of all the crew onboard barely spoke a word of english, which usually is a requirement for international crew. Any queries I had about arrival cards in China, and New Zealand could not be answered because of the lack of English. Service on board was alright. Crew did not walk around asking for drinks, even though it was an evening flight, and I constantly had to get up to ask for something. Never come across that before. There is only option for type of wine: red. There is beer which is usually finished by the time they get to you if your sitting in the back. Another weird thing onboard on our flight from Shanghai- to Auckland was that it was a day flight, so flying majority of the time in the day time. our flight was blacked out with no light so we we were really put off schedule. Not enjoyable arriving at 5pm and having slept for 7 hours to then having to try and sleep that evening isn't ideal. Also check in is a nightmare. Never got a window seat (couldn't log in online majority of the time) even though they said it was possible 2 days in advance. We kept trying to log in with the info that they asked: Family names / First name. To be able to long in you do infact use your family name/ first name but at the end you have to add: MRS/MISS/MRS which is only specified 24 hours in advance and once you could check in all the seats are already taken. I noticed that check in and the whole website is very easy for Chinese people to check in but anyone who only speaks English it is very hard. Also when trying to ask the check in staff in Shanghai why all the window seats were already taken, even after arriving 4 hours in advance I couldn't get an answer. Again an incredible lack of English and it was like speaking to a brick wall - gave up after about 5 minutes of trying to explain myself and not getting anywhere. Apart from having a cheap ticket that was about the only thing that was going for this airline. Slack staff and very cheap airline. Honestly very dissapointed and a terrible way to start your vaction off on.

### "helpful and supremely polite"
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Shanghai. We booked China Eastern as an accidental alternative to United Airlines changes of flights. The lounges were first class, a pleasant surprise. The Shanghai connection was flawless, all you have to do is read the signs and follow them, plenty of time in the lounge where western and eastern food is served. Every one was very helpful and supremely polite. Onboard our 2nd leg, we were served more food, quite good, the cabin was very clean and so were the rest rooms, again polite, pleasant staff, we had to stop them serving us more wine. We arrived early in LAX and somehow beat the computer glitch that fouled many returnees later that day. Entertainment was great, we slept quite well too.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Shanghai to Tokyo. Unexplained delays of multiple (I believe 3+) hours. No English announcements to explain. Passengers waiting area open to the outside (very cold) outer elements. Evidently no personnel at gate who speak English. When I attempted to gain information, the airline's personnel waved me off in a completely dismissive, contemptuous way (a back-handed "go away" gesture followed by "not know" "can't help" pigeon English). The airline's personnel at other gates were equally rude and dismissive. I was booked on this flight as a partner of Delta, who must also take part blame for the airline they chose to represent them. China Eastern is likely the worst airline I have flown with in 40+ years!

### "fly this airline again"
I flew economy on China Eastern from Shanghai to Chicago (non-stop) on flight MU717. The flight was everything I expect from a long haul, and there were no surprises. The staff were helpful, and kept bathrooms clean. Food was pretty good, and much better than what I would have gotten on long haul United flight. The plane was relatively new. Everyone had a screen, USB charge port, and outlet in the economy cabin. I can't comment on the in-flight entertainment, as I don't use it. Boarding can be a little crazy, especially in Shanghai, as this airline doesn't use boarding groups. Also, I could not check-in online, which seems to be a common theme with China Eastern. Given the affordability of the airfare, I would fly this airline again.

### "staff wasn't friendly"
Brisbane to Paris via Shanghai, returning from London. When I tried to check in it was only possible to get the tickets from the first flight, so I had to check in at every stopover again. In the plane self I wasn't able to read my book on my phone - not even on flight mode. The staff treated me and other like a little kid who did bad things. We were about 8 hours without food or snacks or anything. There was no alcohol available, and one hour before landing we had to turn the screen off, so there was literally nothing to do, only staring. Sadly I had booked a return ticket, I flew for about 48 hours in total with China Eastern Airlines, every flight was the same. The staff wasn't friendly at all, and didn't speak much English.

### "seats are quite comfortable"
Kunming to Lijiang. This was my family's first flight with China Eastern Airlines. We were required to check-in at kiosk and drop our luggages over the counter. The check-in process is unique as passengers are allowed to select their seats. The flight departed on time and arrived at Lijiang 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The plane is a new Boeing 737-800 and seats are quite comfortable.

### "price almost half of Korean Air"
Toronto to Manila via Shanghai. At Toronto quick and efficient check in, lounge was fine, decent food drinks offered and seating was good. The crew managed to communicate with me in English just fine, the food choices were good and tasty - the drink list looked quite good but I stay away from alcohol when flying. Inflight entertainment was a bit limited but for my taste was ok - just a bit dated. The seat was perhaps a little too firm for me but being able to lay flat made all the difference. Transfer in Shanghai was simple, the lounge in Shanghai is very busy and it could use more comfortable seating and more food choices. Flight to Manila was delayed three hours do to atc issues and is common in China. For the price I paid (almost half of Korean Air or Cathay) they compare very favourably. Areas for improvement are meal presentation and for staff to come through the cabin more often inflight to see if the pax need anything. The IFE needs more choices and more recent titles. I didn't use the wifi as it was impossible to sign up in advance using the website from Canada - their website needs drastic improvement from the Canadian side certainly for non Chinese speakers. I found it impossible to register on the website for their frequent flyer program.

### "No screens, nothing"
❎ Unverified |  I flew China Eastern from Auckland to Shenzhen via Shanghai. I booked tickets for $650 one way, so the value wasn't bad. However, for a long haul flight (16 hours flying time in total) you'd expect there to be some form of inflight entertainment, but there was absolutely nothing. No screens, nothing. The food was average, and drinks were served occasionally - once every 3 or 4 hours unless you ask for one.

### "food is much improved"
Flew on MU565 from Shanghai to Singapore with China Eastern Airlines. I had a wonderful flight onboard this new B777-300ER. The check in staff was very helpful and efficient. The touch screen IFE is very sensitive and the seat is more than comfortable. The food is much improved compared to the past. Additional drink services available from the friendly crews. We departed and arrived on time. Overall, well done, China Eastern.

### "experience was not a great one"
❎ Unverified |  New York to Seoul via Shanghai. My experience flying with China Eastern was not a great one, particularly because of the small seats and the lack of decent entertainment to choose from. My shoulders were nearly in the seats next to me and it was a battle for the armrest for the 14 and 16 hour flights. The seats seemed very firm and weren't comfortable to rest in at all. It didn't help that the Chinese woman next to me kept spitting into a cup, making the loudest noises ever to do so. Aside from the small seats in Economy, the movie selection was not great by any means. I was able to choose from a couple that I found interesting, but I ran out of viable options pretty quickly thereafter. Lastly, I had purchased my tickets 5 months before the trip actually took place and had chosen aisle seats for every flight. On my way to New York, I was given my aisle seats. But on the way back, I was sat in a middle row seat, in the middle of the plane, for both legs of the trip. I was not at all thrilled. It didn't help that I became ill on the flight and was not able to freely walk around whenever I pleased. Overall, if it were up to me, I would never fly with China Eastern again. But with their prices being so low, it can be hard to pass up sometimes.

### "more than the worth it"
New York to New Delhi via Shanghai. I read all the reviews and was worried about travelling with China Eastern. Flight departed on time, check in crew did not even see my baggage weight (last time British Airways harassed me for check in baggage). Boarded flight, staff made every effort to communicate in English. They are pretty fluent and helpful, know the basics of conversation. Anyway, 10 hour layover in Shanghai, went pretty smooth and reached my destination. Book a premium airline business class ticket if you have higher expectations, more than the worth it for 500-800$ flights.

### "do not recommend China Eastern"
Kunming to Vancouver. China Southern Airlines is much better than China Eastern. I flew back home a few days ago, and in my eticket my transit was in Guangzhou and they gave me a hotel to stay as my transit was for almost 12 hrs. But when I returned my connecting flight was in Kunming, and it was China Eastern instead of China Southern. The story was same almost 12 hrs of waiting time but China Eastern didn't gave me any hotel to stay - I had stay the whole night at passenger rest room and it was so painful. This was the first time my route was changed and I thought that it will be same. This time travelling back home to Canada was really painful and exhausting with China Eastern. I don't care about food, language etc but what bothers me is comfort. Every time I travelled through China Southern they gave me hotel with free breakfast. I do not recommend China Eastern Airlines.

### "don't fly with this airline"
Melbourne to Vancouver via Shanghai. It's simple, don't fly with China Eastern if you don't speak the language or are traveling alone. I was an Australian solo female traveller and wow do I regret flying with this airline. The airline staff could not speak English in both Shanghai and Vancouver. The cabin staff could not speak English either and could not help me fulfil simple requests. The promises given to me by airline staff were not fulfilled by onboard staff and I was blamed for misunderstanding which was far for true. I found that customers who spoke the language were treated with first class service compared to those we didn't. Going forward, I highly suggest that the airline employ fluent English speaking people who can accommodate to those who don't speak the langauage especially when do operate out of Australia and Canada (both mainly English speaking countries). Don't fly with this airline.

### "you get what you pay for"
Chicago to Guangzhou via Shanghai with China Eastern. I booked the ticket just 2 days before departure. The fare was quite low, but you just get what you pay for. Headphones were not provided until the plane reached the cruising altitude. You could do nothing during the 30-min period when the plane was taxiing to the runway. WiFi was unavailable during the whole flight. Flight map was also shut down until late. A flight attendant explained that this is because flight map was not allowed to see in US air space. What an unbelievable explanation I've ever heard about! Meals were really bad and no fresh fruits were provided. During the 14-hour flight, no snacks other than peanuts were available. Cabin service was nearly zero aside from meal and drink serving, and it seemed that some of the cabin crews were not willing enough to help the passengers. The planed arrived PVG 35 min ahead of schedule, but it was hold on the tarmac for nearly 45 min until we reached the gate. The second leg to Guangzhou was also all about waiting. We boarded the plane on time, but were hold for an hour before push back due to air traffic control. I finally arrived at CAN at 1:00am, hungry and exhausted. I will definitely avoid China Eastern next time, even though they might offer the lowest price.

### "not satisfied with the food"
Beijing to Shanghai. I don't have any expectation on using this airline since I don't know much about it. Ground service was okay, nothing special. When I boarded the aircraft it was clean and legroom was okay but no inflight entertainment and for some reason the seat still have 3.5 mm jack. Cabin crew was helpful. But I am not satisfied with the food served, since they only gave a lemon tea and nuts for 2 hours flight! I get the same price for domestic 2 hour flight with Garuda, and Garuda serve a full meal and inflight entertainment!

### "food on China Eastern dreadful"
Melbourne to Paris CDG via Shanghai. Cheap, but on flight out the first leg (by Air France) was delayed by 9 hours meaning arrival in Shanghai while the airport was closed and there was no access through the Transfer lounge. Food and service from Air France, to be fair, was excellent during the flight. All sectors flown by China Eastern (one out and two back) were endured, more than enjoyed. In common with other airlines they like to fly long legs with lights out, irrespective of the time of day at take-off, landing or midflight locations. Inflight entertainment was OK for English speakers but poor for Francophones on the China Eastern legs. Food on China Eastern was dreadful and the dinner service was poor. You get what you pay for, I guess.

### "great value for money"
After having read so many bad reviews about China Eastern. I didn't have any expectations at all. I don't recognize any of this at all from the experience I've had with my flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Paris via Kunming. Both ground staff and cabin crew were friendly and able to communicate in English. Meal service was also good on both flights. Adding up their competitive ticket pricing it was great value for money. The only downside was the stopover at Kunming airport requiring to through immigration, collect luggage and check-in again, but I was prepared for this. It seems to be common among Chinese airlines.

### "total absence of any customer service"
I was flying China Eastern Airlines from New Delhi to Tokyo with a 4-hour layover in Shanghai to change airports. The flight from Delhi was 1 hour late. The transfer desk staff in Shanghai were nowhere to be found, so I waited in line at the immigration for 1 hour, because there were only two officers attending to 200+ people. When I finally arrived at Honqiao airport, the flight had already departed. I was told by the counter to go back to Pudong airport and wait on standby. I was finally able to board a 13.10 flight to Tokyo. The boarding started at 14.20. After that we were kept inside the aircraft for 3 hours because of "air traffic" issues. Despite the long wait, no meals or water were offered. The flight finally left at 17.10, arriving to Tokyo 6 hours later. Needless to say, no explanations or apologies were offered by the staff. Moral of the story: China Eastern does have cheap airfares, but given the total absence of any customer service and sense of time, I would strongly urge anyone thinking of taking this airline to reconsider. For my part, I will never fly with it again.

### "by far the worst of any airline"
My experience with China Eastern Airlines has been by far the worst of any airline I've travelled with. I was travelling three consecutive flights, the first of which (Seoul - Shanghai) was delayed 8 hours. No reason given. They changed my connections, gave me a $10 food coupon and all was well. Or so I thought. The airline then tricked me and the others with connections into signing a waiver, saying we would still make our connections as the flight was on time. Yet the plane was delayed again and everyone with connections missed their flights! I couldn't believe it. They had known the plane wouldn't be on time and we weren't going to make our connections and tricked us into waiving all their responsibility! How dishonest and slimy. Luckily I took a photo of the waiver before signing it, as I was suspicious about it. The staff were acting like dodgy salesmen tricking you into signing a bad contract or something. Turns out I was right. I should mention that they gave us 80000won (maybe $60aud) as compensation for the delayed flight. We spent a tedious 3 hours in customs, as we now had to leave the airport. They were so understaffed I can't believe the Shanghai airport can even function. I was told to go to one place, yelled at, told to go to another place, no one had any idea what was going on and hardly anyone spoke English. Or if they did, they concealed that fact to dodge responsibility for answering my questions. My flights were changed again and now I would be landing 26 hours after I was supposed to. 50 hours in transit, and currently stuck in Shanghai. Exhausted and angry, we waited for an hour and a half in the airport and another staff member shuffled us into a rickety bus and took us to a hotel. The hotel staff were lovely, and dealt with us swiftly and kindly, despite it being 4:00am now. We were fed too, but after heading back to the airport the next day, I asked 3 separate info desks but was provided with no food coupons and had to exchange my own money to buy food. The staff were rude and unhelpful. There is no information given to customers when things go wrong and the airline does their best to rip you off and dodge responsibility for their company's mistakes. The worst part is, there's nothing that can be done. I've signed a waiver that excuses them for any compensation, and there's nothing I can do.

### "I would give it a big zero"
Manila to Toronto via Shanghai. Worst airline ever. Was flying from Manila to Toronto via Shanghai with my wife and two kids. The flight was first and then diverted to a different airport due smog. That's when the nightmare started. We're not allowed to deplane for more than two hours due to lack of ground staff. Eventually upon disembarking, the ground staff said we will be transferred to the main airport in a shuttle bus for the connecting flight. We were kept waiting for the bus for more than 4 hrs without any proper explanation. It was hard to communicate with them and the staff was rude. Eventually when we reached the main airport, we were told the flight has left and there are no seats until the day after. Again no proper explanation. They transferred to a very crappy hotel faraway from the airport. We were stuck for two in this hotel with kids without proper food and staff that does not understand a word of English. Finally upon checking in for the two days later, the staff refused point blank to accommodate our food request. We survived on buns for 14 hrs. They were even rude when we tried to explain our dietary requirements. Kids fell sick. Never flying this airline again. I would give it a big zero.

### "worst airline I have travelled"
Paris to Ho Chi Minh City via Kunming. The experience flying with China Eastern is awful. First we have to start two months before the flight, when I got an email saying I had to write another email in order not to lose the ticket I bought several weeks before. I wish I hadn't done it and I had booked the flight with a different company. I flew with my wife and son from Ho Chi Minh to Paris (and return), with a nightmarish stopover in Kunming (China). Both times we had to go trough the immigration lines to get our checked in luggage and check it in again and go through the long immigration lines to get back to the boarding area. What may have been a quiet wait turned into a hell of long lines and rude Chinese officials. I can't understand why they can't have the luggage transferred for the passengers in transit, specially when we had over 7 hours of transit, which gives them a lot of room to do it. If we come into details about the flight, the food is average and, surprisingly for a long distance flight, scarce. Although they had available drinks and sandwiches at the back, the offer was poor. As for the flight attendants, they did their best but we couldn't find one who could speak proper English (or French, as it was a flight from Paris), which made communication difficult. The entertainment offer was also bad, with some good movies in the catalogue but really bad earphones that made the watching experience not very enjoyable. I am not a picky person with airlines but I believe this is the worst airline I have traveled with, even low cost companies have a better service.

### "ground staff in Shanghai was rude"
Bangkok to New York JFK via Shanghai. Upon boarding the plane in Bangkok on 7th January we smelled a burning electrical fire smell. We asked for information from the flight staff and nothing was provided. We waited about 2 hours before any announcement was made that they had a mechanical issue with the plane. Only after that did the flight staff offer any water or food. We and other passengers asked for an update and no information was given. It was obvious to the passengers on the plane that the plane would not be repaired however we were forced to sit in the hot plane for several more hours. Eventually all the passengers were moved to another plane which departed at 5:05pm. No communication or announcements were given so waited about an hour as staff attempted to find all the passengers and move them to the new plane. During the delay there were other flights departing that we could have been put on, however we were held on the tarmac and given no information. We requested information on our connected flight to NYC, and the staff refused to answer us. We asked if the connected flight would wait for us or if there were any other flights to the US and the staff refused to answer us. We landed in Shanghai around 10:30pm. We were still not told by any staff if our connected flight or any flight was available. We were not provided China arrival or departure papers and the staff refused to communicate with us. We spent another 2 hours at the Shanghai airport where we were finally told that the airline would not offer any connected flights and we had to stay overnight in Shanghai. The ground staff in Shanghai was rude, refused to answer questions or communicate with us or even look at us. At least half the flight was English speaking, and no staff would speak to English speakers or call for someone who could help. We were herded like cattle into a bus which took another 45 minutes and dropped us at a low budget motel. Again we were given no options or explanations. The motel staff was also rude and confiscated our passports against our will. They refused to give us our passports until we boarded the bus back to the airport the following day. The low budget motel did not provide us any food that we could eat, and there was no nearby place where we could buy food. We were given a plastic bag with dried beef ramin noodles and no explanation of how to heat them in the room. Furthermore, all our flight bookings for this trip were for Hindu meals as we don't eat beef. At this point I felt like a prisoner being held against my will. The room that we were provided was 12 degrees Celsius and we were shivering all night long. I had to wear my clothes and coat the full time we were there but I still got sick the next day because it was too cold. It was not clean or well kept. The sink was clogged and not draining properly. The tv did not work. There was no alarm clock. We were not given a king or queen bed, and instead had to sleep on separate twin beds shivering cold, hungry and thirsty. There was a dirty mattress sitting in the hallway outside our room so I was concerned about cleanliness. Because we arrived a day late to NYC we both lost a full day of income for our small business. No apology or compensation was given.

### "the crew was smoking"
San Francisco to Shanghai. When I read reviews before boarding indicating that the crew on at least one China Eastern flight was smoking, I was skeptical. But I am now halfway through a twelve hour flight on China Eastern 590, departing SFO January 6 at noon, and have smelled cigarette smoke four times. Each time I have raised concerns with the flight attendants and they acknowledged the smoke, have policed the lavatories and asked the crew, but claim nothing has been found. Then the head purser told me that there are two pilots, one the older one who is a heavy smoker but he claims not to have smoked since leaving SFO. I have to assume that there are smoke detectors in the toilets, and since there is nowhere else on the plane to have privacy, my best guess is that the captain cannot resist repeatedly smoking, even in the face of repeated customer complaints (not to mention regulations and basic safety principles for himself and his crew.) The airline needs to investigate this. The flight attendant did agree to make an announcement in economy class to ensure no one smokes. A 1 out of 10 rating because of the safety issue and inability of the crew to identify the source and stop this potentially hazardous situation.

### "offloading random suitcases"
Shanghai to Sydney. Luggage missing because they had started "offloading random suitcases" after exceeding flight weight limits. I knew this airline wouldn't be luxurious by any means, but this was truly disappointing. When arriving in Sydney I found out that my luggage wasn't there. The luggage service at Sydney Airport told me that my luggage 'didn't make it into the plane' despite a 10 hour overlay at Shanghai Airport (you'd think 10 hours would be enough time to load my suitcase on board). They told me that planes have luggage weight limits per flight and that my China Eastern plane had exceeded these on my particular flight. They had then started offloading random suitcases (! ), so amongst others, mine got thrown out despite being under the 20kg check-in weight limit. They were supposed to be delivered to my home the next day, but it's now been 3 days - it should be scheduled for today. They told me I'd receive a phone call in advance to ask me what time I want the luggage delivered - but instead I get a text message basically telling me to stay at home for 4 hours in case they come. Beware when flying with China Eastern - throwing out random bags is their policy, your luggage may not arrive when you do.

### "has been a nightmare"
Colombo to Vancouver via Kunming and Shanghai. Flying with China Eastern has been a nightmare. Initially I had a 12 hour layover and made plans to go out and see the city, the flight was changed without warning, to a 2 hr. layover with an additional stop plans canceled. The initial departing flight was delayed by 2 hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight. The flight attendants ushered us off the plane while trying to ask what we should do. Upon entering immigration, they took our passports and took it upon themselves to have the airline rebook our flights as you can't enter China without an outgoing confirmed reservation. No airline personnel were there to assist, at this point had things been bettter organized we could have made our connection. once through immigration we went to the service desk, where we literally spent 2.5 hours trying to re book our flight. when we asked why it was taking so long the "customer service agent" stated "do not talk please". When we pushed to speak management we were refused. The staff kept saying they didn't understand English. Once our flight was rebooked they informed us no accommodation would be provided although we will now be in China over 24 hours. The flight crew to the "customer service agents" could not care less that this change significantly distrupted our schedule. We spoke with several others on our flight that had the same experience.

### "food is unfit for consumption"
Toronto to Manila via Shanghai. No problem the plane, it is one of the finest I have flown. Thats the extent of my complements lets get on to the complaints. Cabin staff have a very basic grasp of English and have a very irritating habit of saying "yes sir" when they have no idea what you are asking for. Food is absolutely unfit for consumption. Flew into Shanghai Airport and was shocked when we were left the plane. Instead of a gate tube we were greeted by a ladder truck and de-boarded into a snowstorm on the runway. We were not warned in advance and most of us left the plane in t-shirts and had to stand in the freezing temperatures waiting for a bus. Thats right a bus. Same when boarding our connecting flight. One would think that the airport must have been overly busy and there were probably no airbridges available but upon our departure that thought was put to ease as we taxied past unused airbridge after unused airbridge. It probably boils down to a small cost saving by de-boarding passenger on the runway but I paid good money for my ticket and this is unacceptable. So many more things wrong with this airline that but I refuse to waste any more of my time. Be warned, this is not a world class airline and until it starts to look through the eyes of its customers and make appropriate changes it never will be.

### "at best a mediocre airline"
Sydney to Osaka via Shanghai. China Eastern is at best a mediocre airline. Service staff, cabin quality, food and entertainment are mediocre. It is only when you get to China itself that the poor processes associated with this airline come to the fore. Zero help or cooperation is available in their stopover in Shanghai. We experienced some dificulties during this transit. What really annoyed us was not the vagaries of international travel, but the inability for China Eastern staff to take responsibility for their errors, to raise or resolve issues appropriately or to perform simple tasks. They did not even bother to inform us that our flight was cancelled. I would recommend China Eastern to adventure seekers who do not have a firm destination or arrival date in mind.

### "really dislike this airline"
Singapore to Seoul Incheon via Shanghai. The previous review I read about hell on earth at Shanghai Airport is true. I chose this airline due to my own budget. My flight was delayed 6 hours from Singapore to Shanghai due to fog. Supposedly departing at 1225am, I depart at 7am. So I missed my connecting flight to Seoul Incheon. The inflight entertainment, for my seat on all 4 flights I took my the TV has a problem. It switched off and on on its own. I clicked English and it went to chinese. Their movies are all Chinese speaking even if its an english movie. On reaching the queue to transfer was a mess. I'm supposed to transfer to connecting flight, however the flight was delayed till 5pm. Not only that, I dont know why they asked us to enter China, meaning stamped our passports, exit and check in again. The staff are shouting at each other. They show attitude when passengers don't understand them because of their lousy English. When I approached China Eastern, I wanted to enquire about my flight delay, and ask if they could compensate because they took my 1 day in Korea. The guy immediately asked me to speak to his supervisor because he does not know how to communicate in english. So I spoke to the supervisor, and he blatantly ignored me. This guy is a representative of China Eastern, and he's the same guy that ignored all other people who speak English. I had ordered special meal due to religion but when I got on my connecting flight, my special order was not indicated because my flight was changed due to the delay. China Eastern claims there is WiFi on board, but we were told to switched of all devices throughout the flight. Never going to take China Eastern anymore. Once is enough for me to really dislike this airline.

### "hell on earth!
Okinawa to Siem Reap via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Hell on earth! Our first leg was late by an hour. That was both a precursor and the best part of the trip as it involves this airline. The crew was cold and the drinks were warm. When we arrived at our layover in Shanghai there were no representatives to assist passengers with directions. We ended up finding our gate with no assistance (and no smiles from any airport personnel). We arrived in Siem Reap two hours late. Luckily we had a great time in Cambodia! When it was time to return home the adventures began. While waiting in line at the ticket counter several Chinese tour groups started fighting amongst themselves. Then after we checked in and moved to the security lanes some of the members of these groups started skipping past the queue to get to the checkpoint. Mind you, this is still the good part. We were scheduled to leave at 2255 (10:55 pm). Our first delay was two hours. The airline counter said it was because of heavy traffic in Shanghai. We then sat around for another five hours with no word on when we'd leave or what the delay was. At approximately 1030 (am) we were given a coupon for food within the airport and told that the new time was set for 1230. By this time the tourist groups were literally in full revolt. Arguing with each other and verbally assaulting airport staff. No airline staff because they were nowhere to be found. Finally at 1500 (3:00 pm) we were put on a bus so we could board the plane. The flight from Siem Reap was uneventful but noisy. When we landed in Shanghai I asked on of the attendants for assistance finding where we needed to go in the airport. She led me and my family to the bottom of the stairs (at the airplane) and pointed to the bus. The transfer area in Shanghai is foreboding at best. When we walked to the queue a worker was berating a lady because she was asking where she needed to go next. Our process was uneventful that night but because of the delay we couldn't return home until the next day. Therefore we had to stay in a hotel out in Shanghai. That was another experience in and of itself but if dirty carpets, low water pressure, hard beds, and cigarette smoke smell is your thing, I know a place. At 0555 (5:55am) the next morning with no notice we got a knock on our door and a man speaking only two words - bus now! This part actually went smooth and the plane left only thirty minutes late. More cold flight attendants and warm drinks with one extra bonus. Not going to say why but we also got sick after the flight. Four days later and I'm still using Pepto Bismol (to help with nausea and diarrhea) . Funny part is my trip in Cambodia was only three days so the aftermath of the airline experience lasted longer than my trip. Never will use this airline again!

### "so rude it was funny"
Bangkok to Chicago via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Very bad food, I did not eat it was so poor. The plane was very warm inside. Flight attendants are robotic and just seem to want to get their jobs done and sit down, and they speak very poor English. One flight attendant reached over me and slammed my video monitor shut so she could set up my dinner table without saying a word. It was so rude it was funny. She didn't think she was doing anything wrong. The website was horrible and it is impossible to contact customer service by phone. to end on a positive note. The plane was very nice.

### "use if you're able to speak Mandarin"
Seoul Incheon to Vancouver via Shanghai. Check-in at ICN is horrible - flight scheduled to leave at 4pm, we arrive at airport at 12pm, took 1 hour at ICN just to get through lineup. Another 30 minutes delay due to "passport unable to be scanned, it was a problem with Canada". At least they tried to expedite me through Security with a Fastpass, but even then, with a 4 hour window, we barely made our flight. Nobody enforces the 1 Carry on rule - many passengers carrying 3-4 bags of Duty Free in addition to the Carryon, making Carryon Space unavailable. Whats the point of rules then? Landed at PVG, went thru transfers quickly, but recheck through Security for Vancouver flight. Boarding time was 11:05, and as we were seated in row 72 (yes - 72) - we supposedly to board first. However, as this is Shanghai, nobody follows the rules and as a result, everyone just mills around and pushes into a queue to board first. Unable to use "Airplane Mode" on cellphone due to Chinese Civil Aviation rules - therefore, even if I was to take my phone and try to charge with USB port, cabin crew frowned upon this - yet others were able to listen to music on their iphone? If you speak only English, God help you - you won't be able to communicate with airline staff. China Eastern Airlines Staff will randomly ask randomly selected passengers to join CE "club" thing - again, as they don't speak English, we declined whatever they were pushing onto us. At least we had 2 meals and had choices of 2 options each time. On a positive note, prior to landing, they had every participate on Tai Chi stretching exercises. Treat China Eastern Airlines as a discount airline that gets you to A to B. if you're going A to B to C, God Help you. On top of that, upon arrival at YVR, airline lost bags and apparently the Ground Crew are not China Eastern Airlines staff - they are from Swissport - therefore, any lost bags are not handled by CE and therefore, unable to get any sort of lost baggage number for insurance clams. Only use this airline if you're going to one destination without a transfer and able to speak Mandarin.

### "recommend China Eastern"
Wuxi to Beijing on A320 aircraft. Excellent service from the ground staff, lounge, and the crew. The breakfast served is delicious. All these came with a decent price. I would recommend China Eastern.

### "crew on board very courteous"
Chicago to Singapore via Shanghai. China Eastern had a great offer on the ticket price. I expected some marginal service and food but I was proven wrong. Good pilots and crew on board. They didn't speak English very well like but still very courteous to help you. My special meal order was average and inflight entertainment was loaded with movies. Leg room was larger than any other airline. Bathrooms were kept cleaned all the time. They did not offer any hard liquor but that did not bother me much. Onboard interior was nice and clean.

### "we were surprised"
Auckland to Bangkok via Shanghai. After reading bad reviews and wondering if we had done the right thing, we were surprised. Plane was on schedule for both legs. Okay,you don't get the service of some of the top airlines but you don't pay the price. Meals were pretty basic but edible.

### "nightmare hardly describes it"
Frankfurt to Tokyo via Shanghai. We chose China Eastern because I had travelled with them before and were satisfied. But it is most likely our last flight after experiencing amazingly poor behavior. We left Frankfurt and arrived in Shanghai on time and then began the nightmare. We were told that the flight to Tokyo would have a 2 hour delay because of mechanical troubles. At 3pm we came back to our gate and we were told that the delay could be longer and maybe the flight will take off at 7.30pm, meaning 6 hours delay but the information was vague and there was no real communication from China Eastern. Nobody really took care of us. At 7.30pm, the good news arrived, we can go onto the plane. We were really happy after a 23 hours trip from Frankfurt, we were waiting for take off 10 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, again zero communication from the crew about what was happening, "the weather is bad maybe we will take off soon, but it's not sure, we don't know". We try to keep calm and wait for more information and an exact time of take off. At 11.30pm after 4 hours in the plane without having moved or received something to eat, we heard the official and cold news: "the flight is cancelled, thanks, leave the plane". We went out of the plane, took the bus back to the terminal and in front of the terminal door we waited again for half an hour without any words or explanation from the China Eastern crew. After 27 hours from our departure, 10 hours delay from our transit flight, we thought that China Eastern would take care of us but nothing happened. Nobody took charge with something to eat, with a hôtel for the night. We went again to China Eastern desk to have some information about how we have to manage this situation and when we can finally go to Tokyo, but after have waited quietly during another half an hour, no real answer and no solution. These people wanted to hurry to close the desk. I took the decision to manage my family by myself and found an hôtel were all can sleep a little bit after nearly 30 hours on the trip. We saw that the first flight to Tokyo was at 7.30am, so we had to come back early to take this flight. The day after we came to the check-in and again there were no real solutions offered to the customers from the canceled flight MU539, but we could check in and take off to Tokyo Narita and not Tokyo Haneda. We were so upset, tired, unsatisfied that we took the decision to go to Tokyo as soon as possible also if Narita was the worst solution - but even better than stay in Shanghai. We finally arrived in Tokyo at 11.30am Sunday November 23rd in the wrong airport and China Eastern Airlines lost our luggage on the way, so that the nightmare continued... To sum up, we arrived in Tokyo after a 38 hours trip and nearly 19 hours delay. Wow, nightmare hardly describes it.

### "service quick and business-like"
Shanghai to Zhu Hai. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience with China Eastern. We took the first flight of the day, so we were on time and actually landed early. Anyone that flies in and out of Shanghai knows this is no small feat. The cabin was clean and the seats were comfortable with ample room. The surprise was on a 2+ hour flight, we received a full breakfast and a stuffed bun. The breakfast was passable, but the bun was actually quite good. The service was quick and business-like with almost all speaking English to the non-Chinese speaking passengers. Overall, I would fly China Eastern again without hesitation.

### "efficient and friendly"
Paris CDG to Sydney  via Shanghai. Paris to Shanghai leg left on time and arrived early. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly and included (on flights from Paris only?) a number of Western crew. The English standard of Chinese crew seems to be improving. Meals (Chinese and Western) were not up to previously enjoyed standards. Lie-flat beds and PJs did the trick. Shanghai-Sydney leg was ready to leave 15 minutes early, but due to airport congestion sat at the gate until 55 minutes past scheduled departure time. This delay was not made up in flight, so landed late. After 4 hours in Shanghai, another night flight to Sydney. Meals good this leg and plentiful beer, wine and spirits and the flat bed made for a good flight.

### "couldn't seat my wife, child or myself together"
Los Angeles LAX to Okinawa via Shanghai PVG with China Eastern. Flying with CE was not a pleasant experience. We chose CE because of price but, especially for international transfer with a child in our case to OKA, I would pay more to ensure sanity on future trips. Check-in at LAX was nightmare and staff couldn't seat my wife, child or myself together (all middle seats as well). We ended up not using our child's purchased seat because they couldn't figure out how to seat us together and of course, no refund. Attendants were cold but helpful (extra blankets) and my child ended up sleeping on floor at my feet. All flights inexorably delayed (30 min - 2 hours.) Worst part was connection in Pudong Shanghai. Expect extra screening and attention from military police. Although screening allowed our child's bottles, military took our child's milk on PVG-LAX portion just before stepping on plane. At least we were seated together this time. We will never fly CE or through China again.

### "only carrier on the route"
Xian to Zhangjiajie. Bought a business class fare on C-trip for the same price as a regular fare, so very happy about that. The Xian lounge was okay - decent range of cold drinks, and food. However the food was more miss than hit. On the flight we only received a fruit platter and tea for the 1 hr flight. Inflight entertainment selection was poor, but my partner and I both managed to find something to watch. Staff were friendly but their English was poor. Only chose this airline because it was the only carrier on the route but would fly again if required.

### "I will avoid China Eastern"
Shanghai to JFK New York. I flew 8 flights with China Eastern between October 16 and November 2, six of these domestic flights within China on Shanghai Airlines, which is owned by CE. On the international flights planes were new and clean, with seating you'd expect in economy class. Meal and drink service were fine, but food quality was lacking. Noodles were extremely greasy and fish was very fatty, not appetizing. Another dinner consisted of eggplant (again greasy) and rice, with a side dish of a cold white pickled vegetable, plus a packet of 8 saltine crackers. No cheese or anything else with the crackers. Water melon for dessert. Inflight entertainment was odd, perhaps chosen solely with Asian passengers in mind. Baggage handling : the outbound trip checked my bag from JFK to my destination in Guiyang, with change of plane in Shanghai. In Shanghai I learned that my flight to Guiyang had been cancelled because of weather so about 4:00PM I and 10 others in my group were taken to a hotel about 15-20 minutes from the airport. At 9:30PM our tour guide knocked on each hotel room door to tell us that CE required us to return to the airport to claim our bags. Why? If you leave it overnight it may get lost. We went. After Guiyang we headed to Wenzhou, again via Shanghai. We arrived in Wenzhou on a morning flight but bags did not. When would they arrive? Maybe tomorrow. This seemed strange since there were two more flights the same day. In fact the bags reached our hotel shortly after midnight, probably arriving on the second of the two remaining flights that day. My TSA-approved lock was missing, but bag contents were complete. These experiences did not raise confidence in China Eastern's ability to handle luggage. End of my trip involved a flight from Guilin to Shanghai leaving Guilin at 12:10PM on November 2. At dinner November 1st our tour guide received a call informing us that our flight had been cancelled "due to a change to winter schedules on November 1. We were re-scheduled on a November 2 flight leaving at 7:30AM, the only flight of the day. This required leaving our hotel at 5:30AM. If winter schedules go into effect on November 1, why did CE sell us a ticket for November 2 using "summer schedules"? And why was our guide only notified of the change the night before the flight? No traveler in our group received any email notification of the schedule change. We can only thank our tour guide that she had contacts that informed her of the change; otherwise we would have shown up at the airport about 10:00AM November 2 to discover that the only flight of the day had already departed. Our ongoing flight from Shanghai to JFK, summer-scheduled to depart at 7:30PM was re-scheduled to depart at 8:15PM and actually departed about 9:00PM. I'm glad I had no ongoing connection to catch the night of my arrival in JFK. This experience does not give confidence in China Eastern's scheduling nor its ability to inform passengers of schedule changes, though I see in reading other reviews that other travelers have had experiences much worse than mine. Improvements in scheduling, baggage handling and meal quality are be required if China Eastern hopes to succeed in competing against other airlines offering service to China. Personally, I will avoid China Eastern.

### "disappointed China Eastern flyer"
Honolulu to Bangkok via Via Shianghai + Wuhan with China Eastern. First off the ticket price was very good. The food was good, staff were friendly and helpful. Legroom on the seats were acceptable. The only big problem is that they can't get their flights going as scheduled. Every stop there was a long delay. Departure date from Honolulu was delayed 1 day. When checking in for my flight from Wuhan 2nd stop, to BKK the staff asked me for my baggage I said "it was checked thru to BKK in Honolulu". tHEY said "no you must pull your luggage here and check it for your flight to BKK" which I was not told in Honolulu. The flight from Shianghai was already late. If you have ever been to Wuhan the arrival baggage area is quite far from the departure area. The staff at the counter told me "You must go quickly or you will miss your flight to Bangkok". I had to run out of the departure terminal and all the way down to the arrival baggage area saw no signs in English. The staff wrote something in Chinese on a sheet of paper and said "show this to the security there," I finally got my luggage which was being held at the luggage security area. I rushed back to the departure area and the check in counter is closed. I ask the staff behind another counter and explain my dilemma. They check my 2 bags and gives me a boarding pass. I scurry to the gate and get there as they are boarding for BKK. The plane is half empty and was delayed - if not I would have missed my flight as the flight. Return flight from BKK was no different they changed the schedule by 7 hours twice I had to keep checking schedule in Thailand. Delay in BKK" arrived late in Shanghai. Got to the gate when they are almost done boarding for Honolulu already. I get on the plane, find my seat and buckle up and sit for almost 2 hours waiting to take off. The woman next to me says "This flight always delayed". No explanation, no water or beverages while waiting. Both meals were ok although I only ate one, the breakfast before arrival in Honolulu. This flight with China Eastern was quite an experience not to be repeated. I already booked for BKK again in February with KAL at $250 more but without the drama. The "China Eastern" check in counter in Honolulu needs more training to give the passengers all the information they need. They say never say never but in this case I will never fly this airline again. Disappointed China Eastern flyer.

### "poor food and customer service"
Xi'an to Pudong China Eastern on an A321. The priority/first class check-in area was difficult to find. For domestic flights it is located at the far-left check-in island (N) close to the security area. The N-sign is not visible from the departure hall. During the day I had a meeting near the airport, so I checked in about 8 hours before scheduled departure time for the flight to Pudong and for my connecting flight to Amsterdam. Check-in was OK, but staff barely spoke English. When I returned to the airport, the flight was delayed by 2 hours (because of travel disruption at Pudong Airport the aircraft arrived in Xi'an later than scheduled). As a result I would miss my connecting KLM flight from Pudong to Amsterdam. Airline ground staff were not very helpful, it took them 30 minutes before an English-speaking staff member arrived. They said they couldn't do anything for us, we should sort things out at Pudong Airport and made it KLMs problem (the flight was part of a KLM ticket). Because of all the hassle and because the staff where not very sharp we almost missed our flight. The MU A321 aircraft looked quite new, as do most MU A320s and A321. Good, soft seats, this time even with adjustable headrest. Good seat width and pitch for economy. Friendly flight crew. The food on this 2-hour flight was terrible. As it is on most domestic flights within China. We arrived with more than 2 hours delay and I missed the connecting flight to Amsterdam. Staff at Pudong were not helpful and it was quite chaotic at the transfer desk. They said I had to go to the KLM counter next day to check for flights to Amsterdam. Knowing that could be risky, as KLM flights are often fully booked, I called KLM to check for flight options. (KLM customer service was friendly and helpful and was able to put me on the first KLM flight of the next day). China Eastern arranged a hotel to spend the night. This hotel was old and shabby and quite far from the airport (30 minutes drive). Overall: good aircraft and flight crew, very poor food and customer service.

### "a disappointing experience"
Paris CDG to Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Overall a disappointing business class experience. The lounge in Paris CDG offered a mediocre choice of food. Onboard the seat space and privacy is good with space for cabin luggage and a good selection of meals - but astonishing bad service. I asked for a drink when entering the cabin which never came. I needed to ask 3 times for a single glass of wine - and they never asked if I would like something else. In the morning they did not bother service the breakfast - without removing empty water bottles remaining from the night. The cabin was heated to seemingly sauna temperature, without a chance to get indivudual fresh air to my seat. The seat was a nightmare : good while sitting but with poor upholstery - the more it reclined the more it became a graded patchwork - no way of getting a nice sleep.

### "never announce a rescheduled time"
Shanghai to Hong Kong. First time using this airline. The flight was delayed by 7 hours. I realize that this happens to other airlines, but what made it more stressful is that they never announce a rescheduled time. Basically we all had to sit down by the gate and waited until they finally made the boarding call. Even though Hong Kong was my final destination and didn't have any connections, other people that I talked to, lost their connections because we really didn't have the info to react to it. On the positive side, they did offer take-out food trays to all passengers by the counter, and the plane looked pretty new.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Sydney to Shanghai, flight departed at scheduled time and arrived early. Attentive and friendly cabin crew whose standard of English seems to be improving. Meals were relatively tasty and plenty of wine and spirits. Crew asks if want to be woken for meals if you are sleeping later. Good experience rounded off by courtesy limousine service.

### "offers good value for money"
Sydney to Hefei via Shanghai Pudong. I had an average experience on my flight. Seat comfort was decent, the meals were good, and the entertainment was adequate. Flight attendants sometimes have trouble communicating, but this has improved recently. Our flight home was delayed by an hour. China Eastern offers good value for money, but the crew members should work on their communication skills.

### "rudest behavior ever experienced "
Manila to Shanghai. I have flown China Eastern Airlines several times before but this flight was definitely the worst one I had with them. In general it's not a good airline but it provides basic service, getting from A to B. On this particular flight the ground staff was extraordinarily rude and privacy doesn't matter for them at all. They somehow introduced new company guidelines for the return flight where you are not allowed to bring a lot of additional things. They opened and checked from a lot of passengers the bags again by opening up the carry-ons completely but they didn't even check every customer. After asking why, there were no further introductions given and just told you can also decide to not take the flight instead. This was the rudest behavior I ever experienced with the airline but I guess nothing should shock you anymore flying with a Chinese carrier.

### "because of very cheap fare"
I have flown 3 times the same route from Chicago to Seoul via Shanghai since 2015. Two good things of China Eastern Airlines are the low fare and free hotel voucher. The bad thing is the below average standards of the food and beverage. I can't complain because of very cheap fare.

### "cabin crew were very helpful"
Shanghai PVG to New York JFK with China Eastern. The plane that I took was brand new B777-300ER and the cabin entertainment system was excellent. The beverage and meals not bad but not to my personal taste. The cabin crew were very helpful and had a good attitude. One thing that really impressed me was that if you are a student you can check in 2 large suit cases for free. The wifi on board requires you to apply with ground service crew but the speed was so fast that I could video with my mom during the flight.

### "for service I was not impressed"
Shanghai to Singapore. The plane was better than expected. Seat was comfortable for the price-point and a good entertainment system. Certainly better than a true budget airline. Food was average - not the best, but not the worst. For the service I was not impressed. The staff seemed to have a very selective enforcement policy and had attitude. I was asked not to use my phone, even if in flight mode (is this not 2016?). The passenger sat across from me had his phone on throughout the flight and was watching a movie. I was ordered to remove my headphones for landing - the two passengers sat next to me had no such request made. I am all for policy, but let's keep it consistent across all passengers.

### "never fly this airline again"
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Shanghai and a really bad service. No drinks and the staff dont speak English. On the way from Amsterdam to Shanghai I did ask for some drink during a flight off 11 hours, but the drinks were finished after 7 hours already! On the way back from Shanghai to Amsterdam also the same - no drinks. And each time I asked, I get the same answer that it is finished. Only water was supplied. Really bad and I will never fly this airline again.

### "stop your operations"
Shanghai to Manila. There is no separate or priority line for business class. The staff treat you like an economy class passenger or even worse. It was raining so hard but they let passengers walk under heavy rain. All our carry-on bags were soaked. Flight delayed for 3 hours. We were boarded after 45 min delay. While inside the plane, we were informed of another 2 hours delay. China Eastern, do a favor and stop your operations. You don't deserve even a single star rating.

### "no idea of customer service"
Beijing to Saigon via Shanghai on 25 Aug 2016 and returning on 09 Sep 2016. The crew doesn't understand basic English. The food is inedible on each leg. None of the flights was on time. I feel like motto of the airline is "Never on time". Crew training is appalling. On Beijing-Shanghai leg we had a group of Indian travellers who were allowed to heat up their own food on the airplane. Crew did nothing to stop it. On a way back in Shanghai we missed connecting flight to Beijing and had to wait for 3 hours. The ground staff instead of offering us a meal/drink voucher like any reputable airline would do, yelled at us in broken English, gave us pack of crackers and bottle of water, after which returned to her game on the phone. Absolutely no idea of customer service. Pay more, fly different airline.

### "comfortable and inexpensive"
Manila to Shizuokavia Shanghai. The flight was on time from Manila to Shanghai, connecting flight was on time. Shanghai Pudong Airport is nice and the airport staffs were approachable. Meals were served on both flights. Very comfortable and inexpensive. I would recommend this airline.

### "never fly with them again"
Manila to Amsterdam via Shanghai. China Eastern managed to confirm their worst-in-the-world airline status again. Yet again, whatever could go wrong, went wrong. I arrived at the airport 2h prior to the flight just to learn that the flight has been rescheduled by 4 hours due to runway maintenance. Obviously, China Eastern felt no obligation to inform anybody, even though airport staff informed maintenance was scheduled well in advance. Otherwise empty airport only confirmed that no other airlines treats their customers with such disrespect. After sitting on the ground for 4 hours we managed to check in just to realize the plane is further delayed due to late departure from Pudong. Arriving  in Shanghai all passengers scrambled to get to their flights, again no assistance or information given. After a lengthy queue I was informed at the transfer counter I was lucky my flight to Amsterdam was rescheduled (sic) by 2.5h so I still had a chance to catch it (of course, no prior information given on the "reschedule"). After a desperate run I arrived at the gate just to see a huge queue of people chaotically boarding 2 other planes from the same gate. My flight was of course even further delayed - this time by another 1.5h (no interim info given of course) granting a total 2h queuing time at the gate (standing as there were no free seat anymore). Just to add to the insult, all bags were lost and I only recovered them after a week. In the plane itself staff was rude, food was to be forgotten, entertainment system worked OK. Overall, this experience confirms no price can justify such low quality, I will definitely never fly with them again.

### "worst experience I have ever had"
Chengdu to Shanghai. I have not flown China Eastern since 2009 because I had such a bad experience with it. I decided to give it another go, and was handsomely rewarded for this largesse with the worst experience I have ever had in a business/first seat. I showed up to the airport and had 15 minutes to kill in the lounge. The hostsess meets me at the door and physically bars me from entering, saying that my flight is going to board early. I know this is utter nonsense, because I have never seen a China Eastern flight take off on time, much less early. I then explain to her that I have bad knees, and that I may need assistance to get to the plane on time if they are boarding early. I ask if I could catch a ride on one of the electric vehicles. She flatly refuses me, and after I asked why, she said it was a 100RMB charge if I did. I get to the gate, early, and of course, they are not boarding early. I wait 15 minutes again, and the counter person directed me to get in the back of the line for coach after I showed her a first class ticket. They boarded late, as I knew they would, and then upon getting on the bus, driving around the airport, we walk up the rickety steps to the plane. And no drinks for first class passengers - the flight is too short, the flight attendant tells me, followed by "maybe just this flight", and the worst meal I have ever had on a plane. On landing, we start down a jetbridge, and I think, great, we get a reprieve from the stairs. Nope. Halfway down the jetbridge, we are directed down more rickety stairs to another bus, even though the airport is literally five feet away. I give one star only because -4 stars is not possible.

### "attendants polite and correct"
Return flight on A330 in C with China Eastern from Shanghai to Auckland. Contrary to what was expected, A330 on this route also had the herringbone new business class seats. Very comfortable. Quite spartan business class service, with acceptable food, but poor service. Attendants polite and correct, but do not go further to cater for individual needs, make it a nice experience, serve another wine etc. But if you look for a good seat that allows you to get some hours of sleep, it is excellent. On the way back, the aircraft was old with old seats. However, the old seats are also full lie-flat and not at all bad. Both ways pyjamas supplied, and slept well. Inflight entertainment was OK, with some nice international films. Very acceptable and entertaining in fact. Flights also on time both ways. Food relatively simple, but imaginative and with good portion of vegetables. Chinese food really quite good.

### "don't know if I would recommend"
Shanghai to Phnom Penh. We were very disappointed to learn that we could not check in two bags per person at the time we checked in. The China Eastern Airlines website states very clearly that each person is allowed two check ins without further cost. Because we had to bring one of our smaller pieces of luggage through security we lost several items. Our flight was MU759 on the 18th of Aug from Shanghai to Phnom Penh. I don't know if I would recommend this airline.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Nanjing to Xi'an and later from Xi'an to Shanghai with China Eastern. Considering a large number of critical reviews I was somewhat apprehensive of flying with China Eastern. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The check in was easy, both flights arrived on time and on both flights meals were served: a hot meal on the first flight and a sandwich on the afternoon flight to Shanghai. The baggage was promptly delivered on arrival. Overall, a positive impression.

### "China Eastern has lots to learn"
The cabin offers nice full flat seats. Cabin staff were correct. The amenity kit does not offer much. Pyjamas are offered which I appreciated. The seat is good to sleep in, with a thick duvet, that can double as mattress, as the cabin was very hot. The food was acceptable, but not on par with that offered on airlines like KLM, Air France or Korean. No choice of wines, the menu is just opened and you have to make a choice on the spot. The portions are small. The Chinese dish was nice however. No choice of wines, just a glass is given (wine was good though). Not asking if any more was desired etc. Dining is more a necessity than something to look forward to. The selection of movies was quite good. The maintenance of the cabin was poor, with loose seats or cover elements. A bit cheap. The business lounge in Shanghai is the worst I have ever seen in a large airport. In fact, there are many lounges with every couple of gates. Seats very uncomfortable, rather poor food, lots of noise, not nice to spend a long layover. China Eastern has lots to learn from its Skyteam peers, even simple things that do not cost money. For a good sleep on a long flight without long connection it is good value for money.

### "attendants unfriendly and distant"
Beijing to Nanjing with China Eastern Airlines. The flight was seven hours delayed, every airline employee at the airport gave different excuses, so I assume none of them was right. Beyond that, staff at the Beijing International Airport was not able to speak English. They used some translation app on their mobile phone to "talk" to me. The comfort of the seats was horrible, far too small, seat pitch made for very small people, not for people like me (6'4"). Food was terrible (a cardboard box with a dry piece of bread and a dry piece of cake plus one bag of dried apple slices). Drinks were served in half-cup sizes, ie. the already very small paper cup was only filled half. Flight attendants were unfriendly and distant, in other words: a farmer treats his livestock much better than the flight attendants of this airline treat their paying customers. No in-flight entertainment except some advertising videos on the overhead screens (no personal screens). Terrible airline! Would like to give -1 stars in every category, if possible.

### "competent service for a very cheap fare"
Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong. I booked with some trepidation after reading less-than-flattering reviews of China Eastern. I was also aware that this particular flight was on average an hour late, and not infrequently several hours late or even cancelled. Fortunately, the experience exceeded these low expectations. The plane was quite new, the cabin airy and spotless, if relatively spartan. Seat comfort was good. Onboard service was professional and efficient. We were served a hot meal (spaghetti bolognese) even though this was a mid-afternoon flight. To be honest, this was filling more than anything else, but the dessert of fresh melon chunks was refreshing. The flight departed about half an hour late and endless taxiing on arrival in Shanghai added another half-hour delay. We had to take a bus to get to the terminal. All in all, nothing spectacular but a reliable and competent service for a very cheap fare.

### "procedure was lacking basic logic"
My experience wasn't as bad as some of the horror stories here, but they made my return travel unnecessarily painful, which could have been avoided. My issues are not with the on-board experience, which was acceptable. On my flight, there was no individual entertainment, but we had a collective screen. This means China Eastern had to find a compromise in terms of entertainment, a common denominator, which turned out to be - a cockfight. The real problem with China Eastern was their logistics. I flew with a partnership between Air France and China Eastern, going first from Geneva to Paris, from Paris to Shanghai, and finally from Shanghai to Phnom Penh, and three weeks later the exact opposite sequence. There were absolutely no issues the first time round, the Air France ticket counter issued three boarding passes, and my luggage was sent all the way through. However, for incomprehensible reasons, the return wasn't as easy. China Eastern check-in refused to issue all three boarding passes, giving me only the boarding pass to Shanghai, and insisted that I leave the airport at Shanghai, only to check in again, for a flight that was to connect four hours later. So I wasn't able to go through the regular transfer circuit, instead I had to go through immigration, customs, and then check-in procedures all over again. Chinese officials did not understand why I was to leave the airport since my flight was leaving a mere four hours later, and neither did the check-in lady, admitting that this procedure was lacking basic logic. It took me a lot of explaining each time, so the whole process took three hours. I did not have to check in my luggage again, because surprisingly, my luggage was allowed to transfer immediately to Paris, unlike me. However, this actually proved to be a problem. They refused to send my luggage any further than Paris, which meant that I had to leave the system again, to wait for my luggage and recheck it, even though by this time I had already acquired both of my remaining boarding passes in Shanghai. I had 1.30 hours transfer time in Paris, but due to significant delays in getting off the plane this was reduced to 25 minutes. In this time I had to pass the French border check, customs, wait for my luggage, run to another terminal, check in my luggage, and go through security again. Exhausted from a long flight, I ran all the way, begging the other passengers to please let me cut in line. Fortunately everyone in Paris (CDG) was very nice. Once more, the check-in lady admitted that this was all very unusual, not understanding why I hadn't received three boarding passes, and why my luggage had not been checked all the way to Geneva. Fortunately for me I made my flight in the nick of time, but not thanks to China Eastern, whom, through a serious lack of logic in their logistics made a stressful day out of a journey that could have been very straightforward.

### "ground staff were not at all helpful"
Sydney to London and London to Guangzhou via Shanghai with China Eastern. To be fair, the inflight staff service was alright and they were pretty friendly. The worst bit was that my connecting flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou was cancelled twice. The staff onboard and on the ground were no help at all, they were impatient, rude, and unhelpful, directing me to different lines. I spent 7 hours at Shanghai Airport being sent to different queues where the staff there just shrugged and didn't care. I stayed until midnight where luckily one staff member was nice enough to help us reschedule our flight (our flight was cancelled that night). They offered no accommodation, no apologies, despite it being their issue. I spent 300 AUD on accommodation out of my own pocket. The next morning I was again told my flight was cancelled, the main issue was that if I don't fly to Guangzhou and use that part of the trip, my flight back Sydney would be waived too. After struggling at Pudong airport for another 8 hours, the next day, I decided to go to Hongqiao Airport and was lucky enough to get a China Southern flight to Guangzhou. Although China Southern had flight delays, the staff apologised and offered free meal services. I was told to call the China Eastern service centre to check whether my flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai and back to Sydney was cancelled, the call centre advice was dreadful. Tired of their service, I spent another 1000 AUD and bought a ticket from Hong Kong to Sydney via Cathay Pacific, the Cathay Pacific service was much better. I would never fly with China Eastern again.

### "worst airline I have ever caught"
Seriously not worth wasting your money, China Eastern is by far the worst airline I have ever caught. I had to catch 4 flights (Sydney to Rome via Shanghai, and London to Sydney via Shanghai with China Eastern, all flights were international 10+ hours flights and I regret taking this airline. Flight is always delayed and they tell you after it is already delayed and you’re sitting at the gate or on the plane waiting. China Eastern never warns  it’s passengers or give them advance notice that there will be a delay. Every single flight I took had this problem, the worse was Shanghai to Rome. Everyone was waiting at the gate for 3 hrs and the board does not say ‘delayed’ and the airline workers do not tell you how long you have to wait for, they just give you a bad attitude and say “just wait”. On all 4 flights the flight attendants were rude. They complain under their breath right after you ask for a cup of water or if you are standing at the back to stretch your legs. It’s like they are trained to be rude, if you don’t want to serve people, don’t be a flight attendant! I heard 2 female attendants complain right in front of my face about how annoying I am in Chinese because I am standing with 4 other people at the back of the plane. They do not offer basic needs. No tooth brush set, no extra blanket. You cannot ask for another blanket if you are feeling cold, the flight attendant will say “one per person”, I had no one on the seat next to me so I asked to be given a blanket. the flight attendant says he “can’t find it”, I didn’t even see him try to find one. I was not the only one surprised by this on a 10+ hour international flight. Everyone who is considering this airline due to the low cost, please don’t. Just pay a little bit more and get China Southern or a better airline that treats you like a human. You will find that you wasted your money going through all these problems, and it is much better to be comfortable and treated like a person for a long international flight. This is going to be my first and last time with this airline.

### "experience was traumatic and unsuccessful"
Paris to Tokyo via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. The lay over in Shanghai Pudong was supposed to be 2 hours long with transfer to MU569. However, while checkin in in Tokyo that day we were issued boarding passes to a different flight MU553 leaving 12 hours later than the one we initially booked. This was done without  notice from the staff and we did not pay attention to the change indicated on the boarding pass. During the transfer in Shanghai we realised the boarding pass issued was different and tried to seek support from the local staff because my wife was 6 months pregnant and we in no way intended to wait 12 hours at this airport. This experience was traumatic and mostly unsuccessful : almost no english speaking staff in the entire airport - mostly lack of interest in the problem. After being sent from desk to desk for hours to only meet obviously annoyed staff from china Eastern airline we decided to wait for the given flight. As a result we had to wait 12 hours in this unpleasant airport and reached our destination with a delay of 12 hours.

### "worst airline I have used"
Vancouver to Sydney via Shanghai / Nanjing. I booked the trip myself online and thought that the routing was a bit odd as we landed at one airport in Shanghai, then went from another airport in Shanghai then flew from Nanjing to Sydney. I assumed the airline would at least assist us to get between the Shanghai airports but they gave zero help. When we got to the second Shanghai airport and looked for our gate we learned that we had to go by train to Nanjing. It took forever to find where we could get our train tickets. The airport staff - not China Eastern staff - were helpful or we would not have made it. Overall the worst airline I have been unfortunate enough to use and I have done a lot of traveling. Food was poor and cabin staff not friendly and service very poor for business class.

### "have a bad meal service"
China Eastern Airlines have a bad meal service. The Economy Class depart from Sydney to Shanghai, for Economy Class,two choices - Chicken Rice or Pasta, the chicken rice is very bad, the other dish also very bad. The ground staff is good, the seat and IFE system is OK, but next time I will choose Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific.

### "airline entered my never-again zone"
Amsterdam to Shanghai. They just started flying to Europe with their new A332 planes, so I went ahead and purchased the ticket. Big mistake. Please do not follow my steps, I am quite a bargain-seeker myself, but no price can justify such a bad experience. During check in my ticket was allocated a "standby" boarding pass, meaning I might fly or not. Due to that reason my bags were only checked to Shanghai, despite me having a connecting flight to Manila later. I insisted to check in directly to Manila. Not possible. At the gate I was allocated some random seat (not negotiable), despite willing to pay for upgrade to business, I was told not possible, no seats. Funny enough, some 6 or 7 people got upgraded from economy or standby to business right after me. The worst part was still to come - the seat. Literally, I have never experienced such small pitch in a intercontinental airline, they say it is 31-32 inch but it is not - 29, maybe 30. I could hardly fit in (I am 185cm), with my knees hitting the seat in front. Comparable to Ryanair, but that for a 12h flight. Recline was normal, but the seat moved even further forward - making it impossible to fit the leg straight in the gap between the seats. It was a nightmare. Inflight service was quite slow, staff English level limited, food normal. Mind, they only fill 1/3 of a cup of beverage, "so that it does not spill", granting a few walks to the back galley for refills (there is no further service after dinner). Entertainment system works, but there is a very limited selection of movies, which were all dated 1-2 years. I managed to find only one that I have not watched already. Shanghai Airport is big, and of course I had to go all the way through border control, customs and back again to check in to handle my bags 1.5h process, I wonder how that would work on a short connection, Connecting flight to Manila was delayed by 1.5hrs, of course no information or apologies given. In general, this airline entered my never-again zone.

### "had a wonderful experience"
Beijing to Chicago via Shanghai. I was very sceptical about flying this airline after reading reviews from different websites, but we had a wonderful experience. We were upgraded to 1st from Business as our PEK-PVG flight was late arriving in PVG because of bad weather. The flight attendants were outstanding and very polite and professional. The food was top shelf and the entertainment was equal to other airlines.

### "don’t expect to match competitors"
Fly frequently with China Eastern Airlines and an Elite plus member, but I have to say that their services are not great, a 3-star rating is not under-estimation. Flew to Toronto from Shanghai in Business class round trip at the end of May with family. Price was excellent, that’s the main drive I took them. Starting with check-in at PVG, check-in staff I met at PVG T1 First/Business Zone was not great. They processed our check-in with a bad emotion, and were careless. He printed out 2 boarding pass with same name, hence missed one. Lucky, I verified all boarding pass in front of him, and pointed that out, and asked him to double check. Then, he processed it again quickly, and pass to me without a sorry, and again with errors! If I didn’t pick up those errors, and made queue till border check, I would have had to return to make check-in again. The lounge at Shanghai PuDong T1 cannot be considered as a normal lounge among top tier airports, very limited choices of foods and drinks, and you won’t have desire to eat them. Seats are aged and not comfortable. The lounge is crowded, staff shout for boarding calls, noisy just like at a local market. China Eastern Airlines use Boeing 777-300ER for PVG – YYZ, the one I got has excellent condition, as only 1 month old. Inflight entertainment starts only after take-off and ends before descending, selections of movies and shows are so so, not very up to date. WIFI is offered during entire flight, but you have to register online before your flight, Internet Speed sounds like 2G, but better than nothing. Business class has 1-2-1 layout which has great privacy, seat is comfortable for sleep. But seat is not clean, you can see soup trace on the seat. I cleaned it up by myself. FAs were with commercial smiles and tried to be attentive, but you won’t feel warm. Again staff are efficient, sometime too efficient and become careless. You can tell they just want to finish their jobs. I asked them to push my 1st meal 2 hours later, the FA first-of all looks surprising, then keep asking me every half hour. Foods were quiet good, tea selections were excellent! Services on the inbound flights were quiet similar, but FAs were more attentive and patience, without issue with ground stuff. Overall, don’t expect China Eastern Airlines to match its international competitors, or even other Chinese airlines such as Hainan Airlines or CZ.

### "Flight attendants were quite rude"
Flew Shanghai to Ho Chi Minh return with China Eastern Airlines, and overall not a great experience. Check-in in Shanghai was an absolute nightmare. The rep didn't speak a word of English and insisted we needed a visa to Vietnam, although we were Spanish and UK nationals (no need for tourism). Eventually after much consultation and sign language, all was ok.. Outbound flight was delayed, still showed "On Time" on the screen an hour later than the scheduled departure time. Eventually left with 2 hour delay with no explanation or apology from the airline. Plane in good order, especially on the return as it was a newer one. We were stuck in the last row which does not recline. Flight attendants had very limited English and were quite rude. I got yelled at for having my table out, even though the announcement in English to put it back hadn't yet been made (they were in the midst of the Chinese announcement). Would probably fly again because they are far cheaper than the rest, but only if you have flexible travel plans and no short connections to make.

### "the cabin crew were rude"
Fukuoka to Paris via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Overall a pretty bad experience. We flew four times with them and every flight was late. The cabin crew were rude and visibly displeased with having to do their job. The entertainment selection was not so great and the in-flight game controllers were so bad they made the games unplayable. The bathrooms were disgusting and one didnt have a working sink. On the brighter side, the meals were ok, the seats relatively comfortable, and it was cheap.

### "have a schedule that can be relied upon"
Let me begin by saying I don't have a problem with staff or facilities of the airline, however, there is one thing and one thing only that an airline must do correctly and that is to have a schedule that can be relied upon. I've flown with China Eastern many times, each time I swear I'll never fly with them again, each time I'm attracted again by their cheaper fares. My last flight I flew business class from Chicago to Wuhan via Shanghai because there were no other cheaper fares available and I needed to be home in time for my mother's funeral. Once again China Eastern Airlines "delayed" a flight (in this case for 13+ hours), with no reason given and in increments of 2+ hours instead of simply canceling the flight and offering passengers alternative transportation or accommodation. No staff member could tell me anything other than, "I don't know". Fortunately, I was already familiar with this practice and so arranged to have a taxi driver me to my mother's funeral, Shanghai to Wuhan, an overnight trip at a considerable cost. If I had waited to catch the next China Eastern flight I would have missed the funeral by 4 to 5 hours. China Eastern's response to my dilemma,"very sorry, we can't do anything". I haven't had a single trip with this company that didn't have at least one delayed segment. My last trip has finally brought home how important it can be too have a reliable airline as my first choice.

### "never fly this airline again"
Shanghai to Frankfurt with China Eastern Airlines. This has been the by far worst experience and I will certainly never fly this airline again. Our flight has been delayed by 10 hours (entailing an overnight wait). No explanation was given at any time. No hotel or anything at all was offered to us and I was traveling business class by the way. We couldn't even take a shower because they were supposedly "out of towels". And maybe worst of all, no apology for this whole impossible situation was ever offered. Basically, there has been zero communication or crisis management throughout. Their so-called business class lounge is a dump, I've never seen anything like it with old stained chairs and a hot water maker which had signs in Chinese only and was not working, smelly toilets etc etc. All in all, I honestly can't believe this whole thing has actually happened and has cost me ten hours of my life. Thanks for nothing China Eastern, and see you never, ever again!

### "poor in all areas"
Nanjing to Los Angeles via Shanghai with China Eastern. The domestic flight from Nanjing to Shanghai was on time and fine. The flight from Shanghai to Los Angeles was a disaster. The lounge for business class was overcrowded and very loud. The boarding was delayed for over an hour without any notice on the board in the airport. Once boarding started we were not alerted! By checking the gate itself we determined boarding had started. Once on the plane, we waited a long time after all passengers were on before the door was shut. Next the plane moved 8ft from the gate and sat for more than two hours without an explanation as to why or what was the problem. We were not offered anything for over two hours. The given fruit, cake, ice cream- nothing to drink. Needless to say, we took off over three hours late from original departure time. I have flown business class to and from every continent in the world and this was the worse airline ever! The food, lack of service, and lack of effort by the staff was extremely poor. The dinner when it was finally served - there wasn't a cocktail with appetizer offered - was not edible. When Asked for water I was told I had a bottle in the rack! Breakfast was a joke! In the menu a western breakfast was offerred; however, the western breakfast offerred on the plane was pork and rice - when I replied that is not a western breakfast, the attitude was a shrug of the shoulders with oh well that's all there is! Then instead of going to get the cloth to cover my table, she tried to give me fresh fruit with a fork! I said, no please get the cloth for here. That took 30 minutes before someone else came back and did that. In the meantime I asked for coffee - after 40 minutes of waiting and asking two different stewardesses, I went to the galley and asked to please have a cup of coffee - I was told ok and to please sit down. It took another 10 minutes for my coffee and 10 minutes more for creamer and sugar! Needless to say the only edible part of breakfast was 2 slices of watermelon! The toilet in the business class bathroom was dirty, trash was overflowing and the sink filled with soapy water. Usually business class offers lotions in the restrooms. As to sleeping, after the lights were finally dimmed, people behind me continued to talk in loud voices. Overall I rate this international flight poor in all areas and recommend to not fly with them. I know there are better choices and I will not ever fly internationally with them ever again!

### "treated like animals"
On 13th June, an 8.5 hours delay because of rain from Beijing to Shanghai. Then 2 hours waiting in the plane. Only one comment: "We don't know", the  support is disaster. Today on the flight back, delay again without information. No respect of flying blue seat preference. Treated like animals. Take it only if you have no choice.

### "recommend to anyone on a budget"
Singapore to San Francisco via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Got an exit row seat at no charge. Flight was 2 hours late arriving into PVG and missed its takeoff slot, so an extra hour on tarmac. Ground staff were not able to supply any information as to why the flight was late. In fact, there were no ground staff at the gate. My vegetarian meal wasn't available (I had ordered it), but the staff improvised and I ended up with boiled cabbage and rice. I was starving but grateful. The cabin staff brought me an iPad with a roster of vegetarian meal orders to prove that my order wasn't on it, and I was therefore to blame - never mind. At least they offered me food. Plane seemed rather old, no inflight entertainment, no charging and no wi-fi. But it got us to SFO safely. Not the most comfortable experience, but I paid $580 for a round trip from SFO to Singapore, so I recommend China Eastern to anyone on a budget. The staff try hard (in a difficult corporate culture), to be friendly.

### "avoid flying with them"
China Eastern from Shanghai Hongqiao to Beijing on 31 May. I was confirmed on the 5pm flight but when I arrived at the airport to check in I am told that my flight was cancelled (for no reason, or the airlines feels there is no need to offer any explanation, the weather was too good to be blamed). I had a contact number and no one bothered to notify me. I am a confirmed passenger (flying from Vancouver to Beijing via Shanghai where I made a stop), yet when they cancelled the flight I am virtually not protected on any subsequent flight as is the trade practice. I was only asked to walk half a street block's distance and queue in another counter for 20 minutes to get my passage 'endorsed' on another flight. Only with that I can check in again. There are earlier flights but I was able to get only the 8:40pm flight, a 3hr 40min delay against the flight time of 1h40. This new flight was 'too early to check in' so I was turned away by the counter staff after some quering, and I was asked to come back to check in 1h 30m, holding on to my luggage. There is absolutely no sense of some form of apology - the trouble is all the passenger's bad luck, as this clearly is the airline's attitude. No drink or meal voucher is offered and we the victims are only new passenger with absolutely no responsibility on the airline's part, and that should consider yourself lucky to get a seat on a later flight they allow. Check in staff attitude was rude, and unhelpful, and I was unable to reserve an aisle seat or any seat, just get whatever available on check in. I got on the 8:40 flight and on arrival I lost my ground transportation in Beijing and had to stay in an airport hotel. There is drinks service on the flight but no snack, not even one to purchase. And to think that I should be on the 5:30 flight. I do not know whether there is any law in China governing flight cancellation and passenger's right, but all my blame will go to the attitude of China Eastern Airlines. They simply have the right to cancel without reason and if the passenger had it, it is the passenger's bad luck. I live in China and fly every month so I know airlines. Not all airlines are the same but China Eastern is for me, the worst airline of China, definitely. My advice is that if you have a choice, avoid flying with them.

### "better than I expected"
New York JFK to Tokyo Narita with China Eastern - the flight was decent, better than I expected, especially for the very cheap tickets. The flight from JFK was delayed a few hours so they gave out $10 food vouchers for the airport - this was good as the food is expensive and I was hungry. There was a decent selection of movies (some fairly new ones) and some classical music (my favorite). They even served food on a 2 hour flight. The apple juice was delicious and they served fresh watermelon.

### "staff service more than adequate"
Flew China Eastern Airlines from Vancouver to Shanghai. A smooth daytime long haul flight, quite comfortable though full. Cabin was clean and staff service more than adequate. Check-in was good. Seat pitch is not among the best but acceptable. But standard, not delivery, of food service is slightly below competitor's. Not much to expect of food on an economy flight but the food seems extremely economized compared with competitors. My seat was well-located but I had no choice of my preferred main course. The meal was the lowest cost option, no bottled water, and bread was served well after the meal by the time when you have finished eating. The food is domestic Chinese, for example the salad is beans in a sauce with seasame oil which suits me but doubtful if for foreigners. Good that the Chinese tea is decent. Cabin staff do speak adequate English, compared with flights on a Russian or a East Europe airline. It was a satisfactory flight particularly for value (I took a OW flight).

### "rude service by most cabin crew "
Shanghai to Paris was the first time I have flown with China Eastern Airlines, and I won't be using them again. It was booked as a package through a travel agent, so we didn't actually choose it. The seats were okay and the food was okay but the service was slow and some Chinese cabin crew were rude and annoying. For example one of them kept nudging and walking into me as we walked by and spilt cold water over me - I said be careful and she ignored me. No apology nothing. Then we had to sit through and watch a stupid exercise video all in Chinese for half an hour near the end of the flight when some of us were watching films, TV or the map and others were listening to music. Some very strange ways and rude service by most of the cabin crew so I won't be using them again.

### "avoid at all costs"
London Heathrow to Melbourne via Shanghai. Never fly China Eastern Airlines. We paid for Business Class due to the need for flat bed seats. We got an old plane with seats that didn't recline fully meaning a sleepless flight. The reason for the delay in departure was blatantly untrue (icing on the wings - the outside temp was 9ºC) as was the reason for the excessive cabin temperature (27ºC). We were told that was the normal temperature passengers liked, but after a couple of hours of complaining of the heat, an honest attendant told us the air conditioning wasn't working! We moved seats after a sleeping member of cabin staff was moved out of one of the seats. There was a poor choice of food and it was lukewarm, as the attendant seemed unable or unwilling to heat it to the correct temperature. There was a terrible choice of films. Our stopover was Shanghai, a horrible bleak airport, where we were met by rude and unhelpful ground staff and had to find our own way to a shabby VIP lounge. This was a very long way from where we had entered the airport. Our luggage was left out uncovered in the rain, so when we got to our destination, we found the clothes in one end of my husband's soft case, were very wet. All in all it was a dreadful experience. I can't stress enough that this is an airline to avoid at all costs,even if, as in our case, it came highly recommended. China Eastern haven't the foggiest idea of what good service is, particularly if the passenger has paid the extra cost for Business Class.

### "China Eastern was terrible"
Shanghai to Honolulu with China Eastern was terrible. Hope to never have to fly them again. Traveled with my pregnant wife and two kids both under the age of five. They had no personal tv on the seat back in front of you. Hoarded their water and ice, my wife had to beg them for more than one glass of water. The wine serving was tiny and by the time I asked for a refill they had no more wine. I think each cart had just one bottle of red wine for a few hundred people.

### "have understood nothing "
Shanghai to Delhim with China Eastern Airlines. A Hindu Meal (purely vegetarian) was requested with the booking, and the airline served me meat, rice and cabbage. I am an English speaking person, and complained to the cabin crew, but they pertained to have understood nothing - this was despite the fact they were speaking English as per their own convenience during other conversations.

### "journey itself was awful"
Phnom Penh to London Heathrow via Shanghai with China Eastern. The usual cramped seating, that we expected. A 7/8 hour stopover in Shanghai. We also knew about this but the company (cheapo air) emailed me to say it had changed and they said they would put £3.85 back onto my credit card? We were so confused by these mails that we had to go to the airline in Phnom Penh to make sure that everything was ok. The journey itself was awful. The meals, that you kind of look forward to on these long haul flights, were dreadful -  even the Chinese passengers were not eating them. We ended up hungry as we just couldn't eat. Then to top everything off, the steward spilled a cup of hot coffee over my boyfriend!!! They gave him a few dollars by way of compensation and apologised profusely, but maybe they need some extra training.

### "a really nice experience"
Sydney to Shanghai, and a new W330 with the latest seat configuration. We left on time outbound and arrived a little early. A little late leaving without an announcement but arrived on time. Lovely FA's each way with good English and the food was fine. Nice selection of wine and a reasonable drink menu. Entertainment/movies were average but ok. Only downside was the lack of quality headphones, certainly not noise cancelling. Comfortable seating with plenty of space for storage. The layout of 1-2-1 leaves plenty of room. Cabin temperature fine. Boarding etc was fine although the lounge in Shanghai is just terrible. Not even a handle on the toilet door! Overall a really nice experience.

### "disgrace of an airline"
Hopeless disgrace of an airline. At least two flights ex Guangzhou to Wuhan cancelled on evening of 17/04/16. Bad things hapoen, of course, but China Eastern could not have made a worse job of handling it if they had actually tried. No communication and zero apology for what is now a totally sleepless twelve hour delay, almost all of which has been spent in different lines/queues (four just to get my bag back, which took so long [but was not optional] that it was almost time re-check it by the time I found it). I fly in and out of and through China a lot. This is the last time I will use China Eastern. Avoid.

### "major attitude issue"
New York JFK to Manila via Shanghai Pudong with China Eastern, and I echo other reviews you get what you pay for. But this airlines has a major attitude issue with their cabin staff. I was trying to turn my cell phone off, the plane was not moving at all, the door was just closed. A cabin staff who was checking on seat belts saw me she screamed at me in Chinese, she saw what I was trying to do to turn off my phone. Her face was so red I was scared.

### "get what you pay for"
Flew Bangkok to Paris via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. After reading all the reviews I was a bit worried about flying with them, but in the end it wasn't that bad. You get what you pay for. My first two flights were operated by very old planes, and to my surprise, on the flight from PVG to CDG they didn't even have PTV's so it was a very boring flight. From CDG to PVG the plane was brand new, and entertainment system was nice. PVG to BKK was operated by Shanghai Airlines, quite new aircraft although not very clean. The worst part of the flight was transiting in Shanghai, it took me nearly 2 hours to validate my boarding pass and go over the security check. Food was also not very good, although crew came around with drinks quite a few times during the flight. All flights were on time and my checked bag arrived quite quickly as well. Maybe I was lucky, but this airline is not bad.

### "warm welcome from cabin staff"
I am extremely happy flying domestic first class with China Eastern from Beijing to Shanghai. At Beijing Airport with premium check-in and lounge. This something you will not find in the US. Onboard was a very warm welcome from the cabin staff who were friendly. At first I swapped seat with some guy who wants to sit with his friend. So, I got his window seat and didn't really like it. Later I asked to switched to an aisle seat and was no issues. The only problem I had with flying in China is I have to turn the phone completely off. This is a business trip and I needed to take some notes/emails on my phone. Ended up writing it on a piece of paper. On boarding, drinks and hot towel were provided. The food (I believe I had the Chicken) was the same as economy food and nothing special. The plane was very clean. All magazines were up to date.

### "flying experience is acceptable"
I flew China Eastern Airlines from Changchun to Hong Kong on via Shanghai Pudong. The first flight (an A321-200) was pleasant despite the fact is was near full capacity. The legroom was ample compared to similar aircraft from other airlines that I had flown. Inflight entertainment from drop down cabin screens. The cabin crew were courteous, but unable to communicate English fluently. The meal was served shortly after take-off plus drinks and hot beverages. The second leg from Shanghai Pudong was an older version A320 with classical seat and limited seat pitch. I found it difficult to move my leg and any movement is restricted. A big disappointment as it was not equipped with in-flight entertainment. Inflight meal was slightly better, probably because this is an international flight and provided with ice cream as well. Overall flying experience with China Eastern is acceptable though it is not the best China based airline that I had ever flown it.

### "should have a better grasp of English"
As other reviewers have stated, we were interested in the low fares offered by China Eastern. We actually flew out of Chicago on the first day the route from Chicago to Shanghai was offered. The check-in line was a nightmare, but we excused them given it was their first day in O'Hare airport. The flight left an hour late, but arrived in PVG on time. The plane itself, which was a relatively new 777-300ER, was comfortable and our seats were great (though we had to swap with another passenger so my wife and I could sit together). The long flight to PVG was one of the smoothest flights I have ever experienced, so I would give a high rating to the pilots. Unfortunately, that's about the extent of the positive aspects of this airline. Their flight attendants really should have a better grasp of English if they are going to keep adding North American routes. It was frustrating to communicate even simple requests. Perhaps the greatest downfall of this airline is being based at the Shanghai airport. That place is dreadful and cause enough for us to avoid China Eastern from now on. While the pilots and the planes earn nice marks, the language barrier and the horrific transfer experience mean we will be using another airline next time.

### "use another airline"
Tokyo Haneda to Shanghai Hongqiao with China Eastern Airlines, and if you have a choice use another airline. Seats uncomfortable, aircraft not cleaned. I moved the blanket to sit down and the previous passengers part drunk bottle of water was under the blanket. It was a mid afternoon flight and I was asked what I would like to drink to which I replied a Gin and Tonic. Flight attendant surprise and reply, we don't have cocktails. You can have Cola, tea or a glass of wine with the meal. I chose red wine as I was having what they described as western meal is pizza. Tray arrived, so called pizza was a slice of baguette and all the topping had fallen off onto the plate, what a mess. Glass of wine - a 1/4 glass was a better description.

### "uncomfortable seating"
My second experience with China Eastern Airlines, from Toronto to Phuket via Shanghai. This time I requested food I could actually eat, Western food. They called it western food but it was the same as what everyone else was served. Uncomfortable seating, a bad experience, same as the first flight. Why they have flight attendants with rudimentary English, working Canadian flights is quite remarkable, as there must be quite a few Chinese with English as a second language to choose from? It makes for a very poor rating in an area where service is highly regarded and incredibly important. Luckily the flights were on time but boring with limited programming and film in English.

### "was something close to hell"
Paris CDG to Manila via Shanghai, flying China Eastern for my first time, and it made me want to cry. The seats are incredibly unconfortable and 11 hours flight was something close to hell. The meals were different than the flight attendant told us (couscous with vegetable is not a rice) and if there would be any other option than to eat, I would go for it. The cabin staff did not go through the plane regularly to offer anything, and I had always to ring a bell to get a glass of water. During the 9 hour long transfer in Shanghai Pudong Airport we did not get any meal vouchers or drinks. We were trying to speak with the staff on the information desk but they did not help us at all. Flight was delayed for other hour but no one was concerned to announce it - people were waiting in the queue because on the table there was "boarding", but for almost 1 hour nothing happened. I am used to travelling long haul flights with different airlines, but until now I could not tell how bad air travel could be as it is with China Eastern.

### "do not fly China Eastern"
Vancouver to Kuala Lumpur via Shangai return. We spent 3 months traveling through Malaysia and Thailand. We traveled to Asia and back to Canada by using China Eastern Airlines so we flew on two different dates on 4 flights with them and I feel our experience was pretty common for them. This is the worst experience we have had with an airline. Their planes are good. Relatively new and in good condition and their prices for flights are good - however from there it is a deep slide downhill. From your first dealing with them to the last goodbye you will be treated poorly. My wife was yelled at for asking if her seat was close to a bathroom as my wife a medical bladder condition. There isn't a language issue going on here just an uncaring poor staff issue. The flight attendants do the minimum. You get poor meals and even though they have coffee, tea, wine etc on the carts at mealtime they will bypass you and offer you nothing. At check in or between flights they don't give you needed information for flights or connections and don't ask as you will be yelled at or treated very rudely. My wife and I try very hard to be undemanding and polite and were treated with indifference or rudely by airline staff. When we deplaned in Shangai to make a connection to Vancouver Canada in our haste an expensive hat of mine was left in an overhead bin. I enquired at their check in quickly after we were off the plane while we were dealing with our transfer to our next flight if somehow I could retrieve my hat. I was dismissed with a wave of a hand and told to go to lost and found (not told where this was). I was then told rudely that I would be gone there a very long time and never would get it back. Even though I was only off the plane minutes it was obvious they would not help and I would never get it back. I never did. This just fit with our overall experience with China Eastern. My advice is that there are lots of airlines out there that offer quality service at reasonable prices. You don't have to deal with airlines like this one. Vote with you cash and hopefully poor airlines like with will just disappear. Have a good trip by going elsewhere. Do not fly China Eastern.

### "10 hours of virtual torture"
Sydney to Shanghai on China Eastern. If you want to fly paying the least amount of money, this is the airline for you. If you want more than 10 hours of virtual torture think very seriously about flying with this airline. The way I got through the it was I thought about the alternative - it was about $400 more to get on Qantas. First thing to do is get some of your own food in your carry on. The food onboard is not fit for consumption. Second try and pick a seat. We didn't and despite being told we had "good seats" we were next to the toilet and smelled urine all the way. Be prepared with a good book because entertainment is non existent. If you have any money avoid this flight, it just isn't worth it.

### "pretty good food"
Shenzhen to Shanghai Pudong. Online check-in did not work for some reason and China Eastern Airlines website overall is pretty bad. But self service check-in at the airport was fine and flight too. On time, pretty good food for such a short flight and nice crew. Seats were reasonably spacious, but not so confortable. Announcements were in English and Mandarin, but hard to hear.

### "the service was good"
Vancouver to Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines, and the service was good, seats comfortable. The food from Vancouver was the best we have had on an airline. Staff were very pleasant. All the electronics did not work, and the movie selection was geared to Chinese audience, but we were a minority. But otherwise no complaints.

### "flight was the worst"
Delhi to Seoul Incheon via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. No source of entertainment, seats not comfortable, Food was ok. I had a stop at Shanghai where I had to change to another China Eastern flight going to South Korea - which was 3 hours late (despite our 7 hours transfer and 3 hours delay). It was the worst 10 hours of my life and the flight was the worst.

### "seats very uncomfortable"
Shanghai Hongqiao to Chengdu. Two full-price tickets for Chinese New Year but the flight obviously only sold half and have to merge with previous flight to Chengdu - so why no discounted tickets offered? Plane was delayed. The ground service is very unfriendly. Captain made no announcement and the crew apologized perfunctorily. Seats very uncomfortable and tiny, making it hard to fall asleep at midnight. Very boring movies and disgusting meal, not fully heated. Attendents refused to move bar cart to allow a passenger to go to the lavatory. I witnessed an attendent playing cellphone in the sky while all Chinese airlines forbid passengers to do that.

### "worst flight encountered"
Sydney to Frankfurt via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines was the worst flight and service I have ever encountered. Some of the flight attendants were arrogant and impolite. But the worst was the customer service in Shanghai. Most of the staff at the service counter for international flights can hardly speak any English. I had applied for a free transit hotel on their official website, but they never replied. So when asking about it in Shanghai they pretended that such offers did not even exist and I was forced to get a hotel at my own cost. Never again!

### "there is no courtesy hotel "
I bought a return trip from Auckland to Manila, with both trips having a 15-17 hour layover in Shanghai. A few days after buying my ticket, which I bought well in advance of my trip, I was told there is no courtesy hotel when I asked. One of the passengers on the same flight was also from New Zealand and on the same connecting flight. He was told that he can get a courtesy on just one way but not both and it is up to him to choose which one he'd like to avail the courtesy hotel. When I wanted to have my courtesy hotel, I was told that I sent my request under 7 business days but I asked for it when I bought my ticket! They lied to me. Another China Eastern person told me that courtesy hotel is only available if flight is delayed. When then was my friend offered a courtesy hotel when the flight has not even commenced yet? They lied a second time.

### "avoid this airline"
One of the worst airlines. Flew China Eastern Airlines from Delhi to Vancouver via Shanghai on January 9th. Flight cancelled from Delhi for no reasons. Got on to the flight next day. Old plane with no TVs on Seat, no alcoholic beverages. Flight Attendants rude. Arrived at Shanghai at midnight, was told that I will be able to catch 13:30 flight next day - but that never happened. Waited two days to arrive in Vancouver. Spent hours at Shanghai airport and of the worst travel experiences of my life. Avoid this airline.

### "what a disaster"
Colombo to Busan via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines was shambolic. The worst was the queuing at Shanghai for transfers. Multiple flights arrived pre dawn and had to wait for two hours for a boarding card. Most of those waiting already had boarding cards and had to wait all the same for their boarding cards to be rubber stamped. The queues were poorly marked and no staff guided them resulting in abundant cutting in line and queue hopping - some intentional, some not. At one point a member of staff bypassed a huge section of the queue leaving many trapped in a limbo loop. It was like a mob. Out of 9 counters, 5 were set up though only 3 were operating. Remaining staff lounged about cluelessly chatting behind the closed counters. Entertainment was awful. Food a disgrace to Chinese culture. Drinks barely existent. What a disaster you are China Eastern.

### "a nightmare and terrible"
Sydney to Dubai via Shanghai and Kunming, returning to Melbourne. A nightmare and terrible. Not just because of the the oil soaked food and entertainment which was horrible and limited (no alcoholic beverages), or the touch screen LCD which is not working, but China Eastern Airlines added a connection which was not there in the ticket. They added an airport called Kunming to the route. I did not know where we were. We were shipped like cattle - the whole plane - and squeezed into one small bus like a can of sardines. Then forced to go through the immigration / passports check, in other words forced to get a visa, then again had to go through security, who are impolite and uncivilized. The airport authorities forced me along with others to sign a paper written in Chinese. I don't know what I signed on, as they refused to give me a copy - I was in a city which I don't know it's name and was not in my ticket, and we are supposed to be connecting there only. Even at the security screening, passengers should expect to get pat down search by the opposite sex. They just do not comprehend what the word courtesy means. By the way, it is a big fat lie that China Eastern offers a hotel room if the layover time is more than 8 hours.

### "flights were great"
I flew China Eastern from Rome to Sydney via Shanghai, returning to Frankfurt. All flights were great and on time, they had in flight entertainment - except Shanghai to Frankfurt which didn't have TVs to my surprise. Nice hostesses and comfortable. Food was the only let down, which was greasy Chinese food, but for the price you pay is fine.

### "needs a big improvement"
Shanghai to Melbourne. Our family of 5 booked flights with China Eastern as they were cheap - what a mistake! Plane modern, departures were on time, food wasn't bad, entertainment was good, but I was very dissatisfied with the lack of customer service. On arrival at Shanghai China Eastern check in we were told there was a problem with my infant son's passport, that he needed a transit visa for Melbourne (we were only transiting in Melbourne before flying to Auckland). We were told to wait 10 minutes. There were no seats. We had 3 young children and finally after an hour of sitting on the dirty floor were given our boarding passes. No explanation. No apology. No transit visa. This is terrible! Left a bad taste. Onboard the flight, limited smiles from cabin crew who were clearly tired and were spotted sleeping in the business class section. Also no word from the captain - nothing. To hear from the Cockpit reassures passengers and is something most airlines do. If they want to compete with other airlines, customer service needs a big improvement! I will not fly with this airline again.

### "avoid this company"
Colombo to Incheon via Shanghai Pudong with China Eastern, with my family (3 children between 2 and 7). Both flights were delayed by more than one hour. At no time company has informed about the delay. At check-in counter staff assigned us separated seats whereas I was traveling with young children. I had to argue for more than 10 minutes and finally call the manager to have seat together. Staff told me that I could bring the baby stroller at the gate of the plane but when I arrived at the gate of the plane stewardess told me that she would not take care of the stroller and that I had to come back to boarding gate. I folded the stroller and left it in front of plane gate and she finally took care of it. The inside of the plane is like the service, very poor. The cabin seats were worn and in poor condition. Strips missing from seat armrests, seat cover had some old stains, and the headrest cover was marked with hair from previous traveler. Inflight entertainment is one tv for 20 passengers. Connection at Shanghai (PVG) was just a nightmare. We had to queue for more than one hour at transit counter. Fortunatly we had 3 hours to catch the next flight. Boarding gate was used for several flights at same time and there was no information on the displays so it created a huge traffic jam. When embarking I noticed that the escalator which was going to the plane gate was not working and that there was no elevator. So I asked someone from the staff to help me with the baby stroller. Staff just acted as if they did not hear me. Once again I had to complain several times to finally have someone help me. Just avoid this company.

### "avoid like the plague"
First time on China Eastern opting for a direct flight, as normally use Qatar Airways. What a big mistake, even if I saved about 5 hours in total! Whilst the fare was cheap I now know why from this experience. Seat comfort was okay, but had the misfortune to be squashed between two Chinese passengers that talked (shouted!) across me much of the time, and one proceeded to spit into the seat pocket on several occasions. The meals were awful - very cheap standard underlined by fatty and inedible meat. Staff started out okay with a smile, although they could not understand any English off a very brief script, but after the meal service they disappeared. Getting up and walking around midway through flight, I peered into second business class cabin and saw FA's were sprawled out sleeping there - 6 of them! IFE needed rebooting several times, and while okay for a Chinese airline, is pitiful compared to most airlines. If you're lucky you will get a thimble of wine, as they run out before they have even done one service in the economy cabin. Pilot maintained total silence from boarding to arrival - I assume there was one? Wouldn't have mattered as the other staff announcements could not be understood. I had high hopes for a direct flight, but will now avoid China Eastern like the plague.

### "excellent value"
Dubai to Narita via Shanghai return. Seats have excellent legroom and seats booked beforehand were honoured on all flights. IFE was excellent with plenty of movies. Food had 2 options, but not of great quality and sometimes it was inedible. Drinks options very limited. Friendly staff. Will use again and excellent value.

### "great value for money"
Sydney to London via Shanghai Pudong with China Eastern. The aircraft was modern and fairly clean. The cabin staff were polite and attentive, overheard them handle some anxious passengers who seemed to be asking for Kosher food that had not been requested. I was eating Hindu (because I like the food not through religious conviction) this was excellent outbound from SYD and okay outbound from Shanghai : seems to depend on airport more than airline. It is true there is limited alcohol available. I had no problems getting water, there was a regular walk up and down with a water jug. Seats are what you expect in economy, maybe a tad more spacious than some. Seemed like a reasonable range of Hollywood movies, good range of Chinese movies. Limited but sufficient range of European movies. Flights were on time or early. As noted elsewhere they put the aircraft into might mode more or less anytime (PVG to LHR was a long afternoon flight). You can open the blinds and look out but it is all quite organised. Personally I think the night mode does encourage young passengers to nod off rather than cry/laugh/shout. I asked for and got complimentary food vouchers via email to the London office. This worked very well and were met both times at Pudong by ground staff giving us vouchers. Baggage was checked through from SYD to LHR and arrived not much the worse for wear. Overall great value for money great staff.

### "lots of smiles"
Shanghai to Hong Kong. Flight left Shanghai late, although that seems quite normal. Crew smart with their uniforms and lots of smiles. Can't remember the last time a member of the crew, without even asking, placed my wife's luggage in the overhead bin. The meal on the short flight to Hong Kong was excellent and wine offered twice. All announcements clear and safety was top priority. No hesitation to fly with them again.

### "chose because of low fares"
Melbourne to Shanghai. The seat was average for Economy class, food was alright, and the inflight entertainment provided plenty of options. We chose China Eastern Airlines because of low fares, and would recommend it to people who don't want to spend much money on a trip to China.

### "seat almost collapsed"
We flew on a very old China Eastern Airlines plane from Shanghai to Paris, filthy in every aspect, no films nor music on this flight, no online check in or seat selection available, no white wine, limited red wine and beer that they didn't want us to have anyway, inedible food, almost no snacks and no water brought during the flight unless you asked for it. Seat had almost collapsed with no support, reclining was broken, no soap in toilets after 3 hours. Be careful when booking though Skyteam as although the flight had an Air France flight code that was not made clear until I received the online Ticket - very naughty. A word of advice on departing from Pudong Terminal 1. There is almost nowhere decent to eat in this depressing place, just a Starbucks with 4 tables and a Subway with 2 tables. Stock up with some munchies or better still, stop off at the Ramada Hotel just 5 minutes by courtesy bus as they have a pretty good International restaurant where you can get Western style food like pasta. After an 8 hour layover I was about to jump off the roof.

### "disappointed and frustrated"
Osaka to Singapore via Shanghai and Kunming with China Eastern. Flight from Singapore was delayed for more than 1 hr, causing us to rush like hell collecting  check-in baggage when transiting in Shanghai. Were given the few back rows and the crews behind were practically chatting non-stop during the whole flight. When returning to Singapore, 1 of our 3 baggage did not turn up. Reported to SATS baggage and had to call the hotline several times before our baggage was found in Kunming. The reason given by the airline was the baggage tag was until Kunming, not Singapore. When we were at Kunming, the airline staff even brought us to a waiting area whilst waiting for the inspection of our 3 baggage and confirmed to us our baggage passed the inspection and will be sent to Singapore together with our flight. If the tag is only till Kunming then what for we waited at the waiting area! Already 5 days since we came back to Singapore and the airline are still holding back our baggage at Kunming despite the fact that SATS had told them the tag indicated final destination as Singapore not Kunming! Very disappointed and frustrated with the poor service and low efficiency of China Eastern Airlines.

### "regretted our decision"
Bangkok to New York JFK via Shanghai Pudong. We attempted to book a flight with China Eastern for April 2016 and instantly regretted our decision to fly with this airline. The website is incompetent to say the least; when we booked, the page loaded for ten minutes before sending us to an "Error" page through their website. My credit card was charged despite receiving no confirmation email, ticket information, flight details, booking number, or anything at all even noting that the order was processed. We are currently living out of the country and called the Sydney office to see if we could fix the error; they told us that because we booked from the US website, they were unable to help us. After spending hours on hold with the offices in both LA and New York (to no avail), and sending out multiple emails to each office, we finally received an email saying that they only had a record of a canceled flight from us and that was it. We are still desperately trying to get ahold of them and fear that our money is lost. If we are having this much difficulty trying to simply get confirmation of our tickets, I cannot even begin to image how hard it would be to get our money back. I am dreading the day of our flight.

### "on time or nearly so"
London to Sydney via Shanghai Pudong. Both flights ran on time or nearly so. Aircraft modern and clean with smiling helpful cabin crew. Bags were checked through to SYD no problems. Food was no better or worse than most other airlines. Everything worked as it should. On the PVG to SYD leg a first class welcome even though on a bargain basement ticket.

### "tobacco smoke in the plane"
We took the China Eastern Airlines flight MU2421 from Shanghai to Kunming on Dec 5, 20155. Two times in the first leg and one time in the second leg, there was a strong tobacco smoke in the plane. As I could see nobody smoking in the cabin, I suspect the pilots were just smoking in the cockpit. This plane smelled like a ashtray.

### "never travel again"
Vancouver to Bangkok via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. The staff treated me like I wasn't even there. they didn't speak enough English to communicate with non Chinese. The food served was disgusting. I did not know I would have to fill in immigration form for Bangkok as my first time there, but no forms were given on the flight! I arrived in Bangkok with no idea on what to do or where to go. I will never travel with China Eastern Airlines again.

### "airline with horrible service"
China Eastern Airlines is a terrible airline with horrible service. Generally service on the plane is quite bad and the crew is not very friendly or proactive. This is not entirely their fault : I learned that the cabin crew is not even allowed to leave the plane after a five hours flight from Shanghai to Singapore and has to work on the flight back! No wonder they are very grumpy. All customers were forced to queue in a huge line to enter there tickets into an electronic machine which could not find the booking. After that we were split into two endless lines to queue again at the check in counter. After queuing for a long time they closed down one of the counters and we had to merge into the other line. People who know China can imagine how this went. Since this was a codeshare flight with Qantas I was able to earn 1,175 miles per sector on my trip Singapore-Shanghai-Singapore. In Singapore the check-in agent happily added my Qantas number and was very professional. In Shanghai she initially refused stating that it was no use. When I insisted in a friendly and polite manner the agent grumpily added the number, rolled her eyes and said "no use anyway! As the miles are in my account already, I can gladly say that she was wrong! I was really hungry and therefore ate the onboard food even though it was quite terrible. Please China Eastern Airlines : train your employees better.

### "worst airline I've flown"
China Eastern Airlines was the worst airline I've flown with. Starting with the wrong information given by the check-in agent at LAX about immigration and customs (you go through those in Nanjing, but she insisted we would not leave the plane there), we were in for a treat. Even though the plane was new (B-5902), if felt very old, with seats getting jammed when trying to move them and lots of noise. Food was horrible, so I would highly suggest getting a sandwich at the airport just in case. Sodas were served warm (and they only have Pepsi). Upon arrival in Chengdu, they offer no assistance whatsoever as to where to go for your luggage, and it's really easy to end up in the domestic terminal since there's no signs and nobody to help. On the way back, check-in opens at 8am for a 9.30am departure. Lines are not respected and people just cut in front of you. There's no separate line for business class, but that wouldn't have mattered much since the ones cutting in line were business class customers. Once you get to Nanjing, expect to have a choice between a local restaurant that doesn't look very good and a place that sells snacks at airport prices. You can actually see the McDonald's and Starbucks on the other side, but can't access them (I'm not a McDonald's fan, but at that point it would've been very welcome instead of China Eastern food).

### "don't get fooled by price"
I'd recommend passengers avoid China Eastern Airlines, especially if you're expecting any kind of decent service. At Shanghai airport, this airline is at a different terminal every other international airlines. Their check-in process for business class sucks- there's a long waiting line despite several agents lounging around. The lounges are even worse - uncomfortable and stained seats, stale and tasteless food, no cold beverages or ice, and completely packed, as they offer their lounge to other airlines. Their lounge is located below the departure level and there is an escalator down but none to go up. So if you have a heavy hand bag, you're going to be doing some hauling. And to top it off, flights to the US don't deserve a jetway. You get bussed there, and there's more heavy lifting to do. The airport and lounges are hot and uncomfortable. Don't get fooled by their cheaper price.

### "service was very basic"
I flew China Eastern Airlines, with an Alitalia ticket in business class from Rome to Shanghai on 31st October, and then returning from Shanghai to Rome on 7th November. Flights were on time and good schedule times. Both aircraft had confortable flat seat in business class. The service was very basic for business class. Food quality was very poor. On the return flight no menu was available. The champagne, served already in the glass without showing the botle, as were all the wines, was warm and of a different product from the one announced in the list. With a full business class they had only one or two bottles of champagne wich became unavailable very soon. I discovered that they had only one botle of the wine choices, and these were of low quality. It is realy unacceptable in a business class.

### "aircraft kept surgically clean"
Efficient check in with a 1.5hr wait in the business class lounge (don't ask!) before boarding on time. As new' aircraft which was kept surgically clean throughout the flight. Air traffic control delayed take off 20 minutes and flight deck kept everyone updated regularly. Arrived at the scheduled time. Professional, friendly cabin staff made for a pleasant flight, as did meal and beverage selection. Then into pj's for six or seven hours sleep.

### "seems to run hot and cold"
This flight was of the standard you should always receive. Clean (spotless) aircraft with everything working, crew happy and professional and on time departure and arrival. Brunch was a nice Chinese hybrid and just right for the time of day. Compared to the inbound Nanjing to Hong Kong flight, it was hard to accept it was the same airline - CE seems to run hot and cold on domestic sectors.

### "not as bad as I expected"
The checkin went smoothly. You could not get seats until you got to the airport which is annoying but my husband and I were able to get seats together. They were no more uncomfortable than other airlines. A plug for charging electronic devices is provided. The movie selection was good and several meals were served. The only real negative was the sparseness of alcoholic beverages. There was no white wine and very little red wine or beer. On the return trip, since we had a 9 hour layover, the airline provided our group with a room in Shanghai at the Lihao Hotel. It is one of the worst hotels I have every stayed. I would not plan to fly this airline in the future but it was not as bad as I expected.

### "don't go China Eastern Airlines"
Qantas doesn't fly out of Beijing so they codeshare with China Eastern Airlines. There was a fast business class check in at the airport but when we asked for the lounge we were told there was none, but we could sit in a few comfortable chairs in an airless alcove. And no, they couldn't give us a bottle of water. We were cooler waiting in the public areas. There was no priority boarding, no priority disembarkation at the stopover in Nanking but it did have a business class lounge with comfortable seats, drinks and unappetising food. The meal selected from the menu couldn't be provided even though business class was only two-thirds full and the standard of English comprehension wasn't good even thought the flight attendants were attentive. We received a priority card on landing which expedited our way through to the baggage claim where our baggage came off last and damaged. The handling was so rough an item packed in moulded styrene to fit its shape was broken in the suitcase which was also split and scratched. So if flying out of Beijing, don't go China Eastern Airlines just to collect Qantas partner points. It's not worth it! Oh, and my entertainment system didn't work either!

### "flight came as a shock"
After many international flights with China Eastern Airlines over the last few years, Nanjing to Hong Kong came as a shock. The aircraft was dirty, an overhead light and the tray table mechanism were broken. Catering of a light breakfast for eight business class passengers was a challenge that couldn't be met.The cabin staff approached their tasks with the enthusiasm of a press gang who had been ordered to cut off their own arms with the cutlery.

### "advice to avoid China Eastern"
Shanghai to Beijing in China Eastern Airline Business class. From inside the terminal I thought the A330 aircraft looked like it would be okay - how wrong I was! The cabin was filthy and everything so worn and in poor condition. Strips missing from seat armrests, seat cover had some unpleasant old stain, and the headrest cover was marked with hair from previous traveler. This airline seems to use cabin staff on domestic flight who really don't understand or speak English, and in the event of safety incidents I would be truly concerned with them. Despite this, there were about 8 other westerners in the cabin. Flight was delayed for over 1.5 hours, but that's not unusual in China these days. Of course during such delays, there is no offer of a drink, water etc while on the ground. The meal (light supper) was okay to poor - not the worst I've had with a Chinese airline, but far from acceptable. Managed to get a glass, or about one quarter of glass, of wine with my meal. Have flown China Southern and Hainan Airlines domestically in past 2 months, and they are both about 10 years ahead of China Eastern Airlines. My best, advice is to avoid China Eastern.

### "relaxing journey"
Quick check in and okay lounge. Very comfortable flight in a spotless A330, everything working in the aircraft. Professional, attentive cabin crew. Main meal offers Chinese and Western selections, desserts, ice cream, fruit etc. Wines, beers and spirits offered and large selection of entertainment options available. An enjoyable and relaxing journey.

### "worse than budget airline"
Shanghai Hongqiao to Chengdu return with China Eastern Airlines on an ancient Boeing 767 but with new seat. Luckily both 2 sectors were on time which was very rare as China Eastern Airlines is seldom on time. Check in at both Shanghai Hongqiao and Chengdu airport efficient. Lounge awful and always packed, food quality bad and fake orange juice provided (I always take my own food when flying with China Easter). The seat was uncomfortable and legroom extremly narrow. In general, China Eastern Airlines is a typical budget airline or even worse than budget airline.

### "fares cannot be beat"
San Francisco to Saigon via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Fights were on time departing and early arriving. Seats were comfortable and reclined nearly flat. FAs attentive without being intrusive. Meals were surprisingly good for airline food. China Eastern business class is not so posh as Ethiopian Airlines or Iberia, but is nevertheless good - and fares on the SFO-PVG-SGN route cannot be beat. Shanghai Pudong airport is another matter.

### "China Eastern experience was worst ever"
Me and my brother flew China Eastern Airlines. Our experience was worst ever. In flight we ask for pillow (they supplied to some passengers already) and the air hostess replied that I don't find more pillow. We asked for water more than four times but they did not provide this. When we asked for a beer, she said its all gone! When I go to their senior staff and ask her for complaint book she offered me some food from business class and a beer came also, but I could not take food because it's non veg. They gave 1 beer to me but not to my brother, but they continued serving beer to Chinese passengers. There behaviour is different for Chinese and other nationality of passengers. One couple we met at Shanghai airport, coming from USA with China Eastern Airlines also said they would never fly this airline in future because they also faced these type of problem in their flight from San Francisco to Shanghai. Other passengers were very unhappy with their hospitality. So my brothers if want self respect pl. don't fly in China Eastern

### "avoid China Eastern at all costs"
Avoid China Eastern Airlines at all costs. Our original flight was cancelled, when we boarded our next flight we sat in the plane on the tarmac for one hour before we eventually taxied and took off. When we arrived in Shanghai, my luggage never appeared. After repeated and questions and prompting at the baggage services I was finally able to get a delayed luggage report, they seemed very reluctant to do this. Four weeks later and I have had one phone call to tell me my bag is still lost. No offers of compensation whatsoever. Terrible airline, terrible service.

### "the worst experience of my life"
I flew with China Eastern Airlines from Paris to Fukuoka, with a transit at Shanghai. I have traveled quite a bit and this is the worst experience of my life! Due to the delay of the flight  and the incompetence of China Eastern Airlines staff at Shanghai airport, it made me miss the transfer to Fukuoka. In Shanghai, I found my luggage literally destroyed. The customer service at Shanghai refused to listen to my complaint, laughing with a sort of contempt. I was forced to sleep one night in Shanghai to catch a flight the next day. I could have sleept at the airport as everyone did not care to answer my questions in English. But, thanks to an American traveler who spoke Chinese in the same situation as me, I was able to sleep in a bed that night. The hotel management, the hotel Shuttle, the Airport and the meal was just dismal. The hotel was dirty and shabby and the food barely edible. I asked about compensation for the delay and damaging destroyed my suitcase, but China Eastern Airlines policy is to never give me a reply.

### "China Eastern Airlines are the worst ever"
I didn't even get to experience China Eastern Airlines terrible service because they cancelled my Beijing to Hanoi via Kunming flight right out from under me. Which I wouldn't mind, except it was 1 week  before the flight. Replacement tickets cost three times more than  we paid. All we got was some smug China Eastern Airlines customer service rep saying : "Your refund will be delivered in two to four weeks. China Eastern Airlines are the worst ever. Never again.

### "20 minutes waiting for the elevated car"
I flew China Eastern Airlines from Bangkok to Shanghai with my mother (who needs a wheelchair). The plane arrived Pudong airport without any equipment to help my mother out of the plane. On return the plane was delayed for 1 hour and again the plane was not at the gate (we had to take shuttle bus). I clearly asked the ground staff to prepare service to send my mother to the plane as she couldn't walk up the high. The ground staff confirmed that the plane was at the gate and no need for that equipment. Finally, gate changed and we had to go with all passenger on the shuttle bus to the plane and stood there for 20 minutes waiting for the elevated car. We couldn't book even the seat which usually reserved for disabled passengers. During the flight, the food was so terrible and I asked for a second can of Tsing Tao beer. The answer was "there is only 15 cans on this flight and they are finished".

### "constant deception and lack of integrity"
Bangkok to Toronto via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Everything was great until we were delayed and missed our connection in Shanghai. Total incompetence ruined our flight rebooking and trying to get into a hotel. Constant deception and lack of integrity by China Eastern Airlines staff prevented us from getting a hotel and we had to sleep on the floor in the airport with hundreds of others. The ground staff should be fired.

### "should be kicked out from SkyTeam"
China Eastern Airlines staff is not friendly at all. Check-in was okay, but our first shock was the lounge. Food and drinks are a total no go. Onboard a menu card was handed over, we choose a glass of champagne, and with the dinner white wine. Both were served at once! Food was served fully on plastic dishes, and this for over 6 hour flight. After dinner no hot drinks were offerd at all. Our request to get another glass of champagne was without success. The answer from crew was that they don't have more. Flight was not full at all. Cabin crew was really rough and almost Tunable to understand English. We will try to avoid this airline and China Eastern Airlines should be kicked out from SkyTeam.

### "cheap and nasty airline service"
I flew China Eastern Airlines return from Sydney to Shanghai and Shanghai to Moscow. Never have a I flown with a worse airline - especially the last leg, where at dinner they give you 1 alcoholic drink. If you are silly enough to ask for another one, they tell you there are no more - a cheap and nasty airline service. Cabin staff are rude and when I had the audacity to ask one young lady when I would be getting the Immigration forms, I interrupted her laugh and chat with her friend, and I was told to wait. She then begrudgingly said she would get them. I was not the only one concerned as we were pretty close to Sydney. Do yourself a favour and never fly China Eastern Airlines - or worse Shanghai Airlines.

### "temperature adding to lack of comfort"
Chengdu to Songpan with China Eastern Airlines. Chengdu airport is a nightmare for check-i,n as all airlines check-in at the same counters. Fortunately as a Skyteam Elite Plus member, I could check-in with my family at the business counter which made things a whole lot easier. Chengdu to Songpan is a quick 25 minute flight at best, as Songpan airport is about 3000m in elevation. Unfortunately airport delays usually mean this flight takes around 1hr. Being the first flight of the day, departure was not delayed too much and the 737-700 was comfortable enough for the short flight. One issue on all China Eastern flights has been the lack of air conditioning provided whilst on the ground and to some extent also during flight. No air provided on the ground (no ground power unit hooked up either), made the aircraft very stuffy and uncomfortable. The temperature during flight was also on the warm side adding to the lack of comfort. Same problem again on China Eastern for the return back to Chengdu. One bottle of water handed out on boarding which is all you would expect for a flight of this short duration.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Arrived early, made seat request. Check in staff totally ignored you and gave you seat that was allocated. No explanation, nothing. No smile, no apologies. First and last time I will fly on China Eastern Airlines.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
In summary, if you have another choice besides China Eastern, take it. The planes are modern and so are the entertainment systems, but that's about the only positive aspect. My main complaints are as follows: 1) The planes are rarely on time. I fly China Eastern frequently within China for business due to lack of choice (there are few domestic airlines and they're all about the same quality) and I would estimate that their on-time departure rate is less than 20%. If I'm only delayed one hour I feel lucky. On this particular flight we were stuck at the gate for ~1.5 hours. 2) Their policy on electronics is outdated. Mobile phones in flight mode cannot be used during the entire flight. Also, most other airlines now allow small electronics to be used during takeoff/landing, but not China Eastern. 3) I love Chinese food, but what they serve is awful. I'm from the US originally, and I thought US airline food/service was bad, but China Eastern takes "airline food" to another level of inedible. 4) The service is also not friendly and intrusive. When you want something like water it's hard to get their attention, however, when you're sleeping mid-flight they'll make it a point to wake you for the meal service.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I flew from Taipei to Dubai via Shanghai and Kunming. The experience was horrible from beginning to end. I often take low-cost airlines (WizzAir, Ryanair), so my expectations of service quality are not high. But the huge difference is that those low-costs clearly state the limitations, so you know what to expect. Not China Eastern. My Economy ticket included 2 pieces of baggage of 23 kg (46kg in total). It wasn't written on my ticket, maybe because I bought it through Airtickets24. I arrived at the airport with one suitcase of 31 kg. They strongly insisted that I have to repack it to 2 separate pieces, so I had no choice but to buy a box and to check-in with two huge pieces of baggage (both half-empty. I will never understand the logic behind this (Economy plus and Bussines can check-in 2 pieces of 32kg, so it wasn't the problem that 31kg is too heavy for one piece). I was told that my baggage would be sent directly to Dubai, so I don't have to pick it up for my 14 hour over-night layover in Shanghai. But when I arrived there, they changed the info, I had to pick it up and spend extra money to store it at the airport. The check-in at the Pudong Airport in Shanghai was a mess. My flight wasn't listed on the board. I had to stand in the queue to ask where the check-in is and then stand in the long check-in queue for an hour. The staff were not nice at all, the flight attendants probably don't know what a smile is and they spoke to me only in Chinese, only after my puzzled look would they repeat it in English. The food was not edible and I got the noodles for all of the 3 meals? To be fair, the snacks that came with it were edible and drinks were OK, so I could eat something small. You are not allowed to use your phone even in flight mode during the whole flight. However, you are allowed to use your laptop, tablet or Kindle in flight modes. On the first flight we were waiting 1.5 hour for take-off, of course without the possibility of doing anything except sitting straight in our seats (even no reading). It was hot onboard after 5 hours. As I said: terrible experience.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
1 hr flight within China. Booked in China but website doesn't take foreign credit cards. Booked via tour operator and that worked out fine. Surprised that MU-website showed sold out seats but there were plenty at the tour operator's site. Flight smooth. Limited English, snack literally thrown at me and attendants refused to collect the garbage. They just put it in the seat pockets. All in all quite ok.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I have never experienced such a dreadful service. The flight from Ho Chi Minh to Shanghai was delayed and I was notified even considering that was an overnight flight. At the Ho Chi Minh airport no one took responsibility or tried to communicate with Shanghai to report the delay and ensure that passengers in transit can be transferred as soon as possible to the next flight. When I arrive in Shanghai it was even worse. The ground staff did not speak English, no one could help me or tell me where should I go to change my flight to Beijing. I had to pick up my luggage and find the check in counters and someone who can guide. Staff had limited English skills in a large international airport and I had to consult about 6 counter desks without any positive response. Finally I was booked in the next flight. And while waiting the staff at the business lounge told me that my flight did not have a time of departure and offered me to change me in another flight 1 hours after! No one could ensure if my luggage will be changed to the new flight even. As I said really the worse airline ever. I'm writing this waiting at the Shangai airport for my flight to Beijing (whenever that happen).

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-SIN on Shanghai Airlines aircraft but operated as China Eastern flight. My previous trip with China Eastern Airlines a year ago was delayed 4-8 hours both directions, but I'd thought they would do better this time round. Both credit cards on ceair.com was repeatedly rejected and had to call the service hotline to make a booking. Airline hotline took the booking, but declined to take down my FF (told me to look for my partner airline, basically it is not their responsibility). Check-in directions were confusing at PVG (went to the wrong international flight counter) and check-in staff wasn't that helpful. Plane was new, but service left much to be desired. Blankets ran out halfway through the cabin and I was basically told "sorry but you are on your own!". The toilet was in a messy state (I will leave it at that). Passenger next to me decided upon himself to take up all 3 seats next to me and left his feet exposed while sleeping - the stench was unbearable and I had to tell the passenger off. The hard product means little if it is not backed by its service. There was good variety for food but it would have been unfamiliar for anyone outside of China. Considering that I paid over $1k for this economy ticket, this is one of the worst value for money I ever had.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I flew business class. The seat was uncomfortable, but the worst thing happened on the ground. In both cases, I had to layover in Shanghai for 24 hours. The first time, they said it was my mistake. The second time, the plane was late, and the fellow pushing my wheelchair told my Chinese traveling companion that the plain would be delayed until 4 pm and then left us in a crowded, noisy, uncomfortable waiting room. The staff said they were going to give the passengers lunch - although I couldn't see how that would be possible. We went upstairs, fortunately there was an escalator there, ate and came back to find nowhere to sit, and no new information. We went back upstairs, and 30 minutes later were approached by a young man with a wheelchair. He did not speak English, but informed my companion the plane had left without us. Finally, they gave us a ticket to Bangkok and I had to pay for a hotel and he flights to Chiang Mai - about $400. Through it all the ground staff was rude, inconsiderate and unresponsive.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
MU is certainly not my preferred airline in China, however on this route there is no choice. Plane left on time, clean and pretty new. The nuisances are: No recognition of your Gold Skyteam membership, bags even with priority tags always last on the belt, preparing for landing 30 minutes before actual touch down, which means they wake you up to put your chair upright and open up the sunshades. Cannot comment on food, as I do not eat airline food. Coffee is horrible watered down slightish brown liquid - no diet sodas. English? Forget it.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Beijing and Shanghai to Vancouver with 3 domestic flights: Beijing to Xi'an; Xi'an to Wuhan and Chongqing to Shanghai and was mostly satisfied. The long haul flights had pillows, blankets and headsets prepared on each seat. Three meals were provided with some choice and were decent by airline standards. A glass of wine was included with the main meal. Water was offered on a regular basis. Tea, coffee and soft drinks also available. Good selection of Chinese, International and Hollywood movies as well as games, e-books and other entertainment. On arrival in Shanghai Pudong we learnt that our ongoing flight to Beijing had been cancelled due to bad weather. Although we were transferred to an earlier flight we had to collect our luggage and collect new boarding passes which had already been prepared. This process was somewhat confusing and the boarding passes lay on the counter like a deck of cards with passengers randomly going through them to find their own. The information board showed that the new flight was delayed with no ETD or whether it would even be leaving that day. A rep came to explain the situation. He spent 10 minutes giving a Chinese explanation and in English, simply said we do not know. Suddenly he received a call on his mobile and said we may be boarding. After a mad rush to the gate it transpired that this was not the case after all and everyone returned to what seats were available, or the floor. Half an hour later the flight was officially called and we were on our way. The shorter, domestic flights offer food service but no entertainment. On one occasion we experienced a 2 hour delay after we had boarded the plane, due to a sudden storm. Dinner was served during this delay, before take off, and was a good use of time. I do not know what the flights cost as they were part of a tour package, but based on service and comfort I would recommend China Eastern Airlines.

One our recent trip to China we flew China Eastern Airlines on 5 different planes and all were on time. The planes were new. The food was edible and plentiful. No complaints about this airline. We would fly with them again.

PVG-ICN-PVG-SYD, all in business class and all on A332 equipment. This trip was an eye-opener. Pu Dong airport has issues, however the only thing there that is within the control of China Eastern is the lounges. They're pretty basic, and not of an international standard, or even close to what you might find in Singapore or Hong Kong. However rudimentary, they are still an escape from the over-crowded terminal 1 at PVG. The PVG-ICN-PVG sectors were on the older angled-flat business seats, which were entirely fine for 90-minute sectors. Full hot meals with two choices of main and a few wine choices were offered on both short sectors. Again, quite satisfactory. The English-language skills of the crew were not the same as those on the PVG-SYD sector, but one must remember that these were flights between China and Korea, and so it's entirely reasonable to expect that the crews will be best at communicating in Chinese and Korean. Blankets, pillows and slippers were provided on the short sectors. It's worth noting that the economy cabins were very full on the PVG-ICN-PVG flights, but business class was a ghost-town in both directions. Not so on the PVG-SYD sector, a ten-hour overnight sector on the A332 equipment designated as 33E, i.e. 6-abreast seating in business class, with 180-degree recline and a significantly larger entertainment screen, and two business-cabins separated by a galley. There was only one empty seat of the 30 in the split cabin, the passengers were about half Chinese nationals and half Australian, with a couple of Europeans and a Canadian to boot. On boarding we were met by the Purser/Service manager, a young woman of Chinese heritage who spoke excellent English with a distinctively Australian accent. We were escorted to our seats and offered sparkling wine, orange juice (with pulp, not the overly-processed kind) or mineral water. Soon after that, menus were presented. The flight had a full dinner service, from which passengers could choose Chinese style with two choices of main course, or Western style, with two choices of main course. Dinner was served course-by-course and there were no trolleys used for either drinks or food. Table-cloths were used. Breakfast choices were either Chinese or Western. The wine-lists had a (real) Champagne, three reds and two whites, which in my opinion is entirely enough. A decent selection of soft-drinks, waters and juices was also on offer. Amenity kits (with Clarins products) were already at each seat. Dinner service began soon after takeoff, and soon after the closing of all the window-blinds (this was common to all the MU flights on this trip, and I found it both odd and a little irritating, however this is what the crew are trained to do! ), after which pajamas and slippers were distributed. The seat reclined completely flat, the pajamas were soft cotton, and the duvet was soft and thick. Interestingly, the cabin temperature was kept quite low on this flight, in contrast with other airlines from Asian countries who, in my experience, keep the cabin temperature warm enough to grow orchids in Iceland. I was woken hours later by the clinking of cutlery in the galley, and having returned from the spotless bathroom, was offered breakfast. The dim sum were hot and tasty; everything on the tray was tasty. Breakfast was offered as passengers woke, rather than throwing the lights on and insisting people wake-up because the trolley is coming. Very civilised, and other airlines could learn a lot from this. We arrived in Sydney on time, and I must say that China Eastern was surprisingly good. I didn't have sky-high expectations, but that was wrong. The English skills of the crew on the PVG-SYD sector ranged from very good to excellent, and the crew were attentive and very polite. All in all, a positive experience on MU for a very very keen price. I would gladly fly with them again in business class.

PVG-SIN. Interesting experience. After some exercise walking around the terminal to check in found the Biz class check in and found the service courteous but the area run down in appearance. Made it through immigration and security easily but struggled to find the correct lounge. Once there it was not worth the effort. Uncomfortable seats and well worn furnishings. Strolled down to the gate and learned that departure time is the real boarding time. Fought my way through the line onto the bus and then shoved my way to the stairs and made the climb. I found if I didn't assert myself I would keep getting cut in front of the line. Once onboard seats were old style angled beds. Service was courteous and smiles were plentiful. My jacket was ignored until about 3 hours into the flight. My meal order was taken chicken ordered and beef delivered. Debated pointing this out but decided between my language skills and the crew's skills I should enjoy the beef. I think there were inflight announcements from the cockpit but they were difficult to hear. I did have to ask for water about halfway into the flight and after asking got regular top offs. Would I do it again? Probably but would not do a TransPac. For a five hour trip service and food was up there with service I have received on US carriers.

Economy Bangkok to Fukuoka via Shanghai on 22 May return 1 June. All flights new aircraft B777 BKK-PVG and B737 PVK-FUK. All flights arrived on time and service was excellent. This is the fourth time I have flown on China Eastern and this trip was typical of my previous experiences.

June 1 from Kunming to Shenyang flight boarded on time but did not take off due to mechanical problems. After one hour back to the gate no information - nothing. After 1.5 hours boarding again without any announcements. Then another 45 minutes on the tarmac before taking off - all in all 3 hours late. No apologies. Food inedible announcements (if any) not audible. Airplane (after change to another one) brand new and clean. As usual no recognition of your Gold Skyteam membership. Luggage last on the belt even with priority markings. Too bad there isn't a good alternative between Kunming and Shenyang at a decent time.

Flight from Xi’an to Hong Kong should take 2hr 25min. Flight departed on-time at 1pm but further delays resulted in arrival in Hong Kong 12 hours later at 1am. Delays were due to bad weather in Hong Kong leading to diverting flight to land in Guangzhou airport at 5.30pm. Cabin crew didn't notify passengers of the diversion until plane was about to land at Guangzhou 4.5 hours after departing Xi'an at 1om. Passengers remained on board for 1.5 hours until we were bussed to terminal at 7pm where we only stayed for 30-35 minutes and re-boarded the plane at 7.30pm. A very light meal and bottled water was provided to passengers who had a few minutes to consume the meal. Passengers remain in the take-off position at their seats for the next 2 hours without any clue until the plane finally took off at 10pm. After landing the plane in Hong Kong the passengers remained on the plane for 2 hrs until 1am. Due to many planes in the queue from the delay the baggage claim pickup added more delays along with the delays in getting public transportation to leave the airport. At this time the public buses had ended leaving only a few choices - taxis airport express train and private cars. The cabin crew failed to communicate clearly the delay to passengers failed to allow passengers to be in a comfortable position during the delay provide refreshments during the time (2+ hours) on board plane waiting for bus to go to terminal or waiting for gate to be available. The cabin crew needs to communicate better in the future. 12 hour travel time for a 2h 25m flight from Xi'an to Hong Kong.

DEL-PVG 6 May. PVG-Yichang 6 May. Guilin-PVG 15 May. PVG-DEL 15 May. We travelled with very low expectations. Even then we were surprised by the shoddy service. Firstly it is a bad idea to serve dinner at 3am as soon as the flight takes off. 80% of the passengers are asleep by then. Then when it is morning we don't get a meal before landing when we are hungry. Secondly on the PVG-DEL sector there was no choice of meals except veg and fish. Surprisingly the flight had only 6 cans of beer and 1 bottle of only red wine per cabin. It is not in good taste to tell a customer that the drinks are finished. Thirdly when we reached Guilin airport security check and departure area we were informed that due to a storm our flight had landed in Nanning so we had to wait. However no one spoke English in the airport CE office was unmanned for most of the day and no information was given to passengers as per time of departure. We were forced to sit in the airport for 15 hours. They took us to a hotel at 8 pm and immediately brought us back but the flight did not leave till 3 am on 16th May. The airport was not able to provide enough meals - certainly nothing vegetarian for my husband. We were made to wait for 2 hours at the arrivals before we were packed into a bus with 12 other persons and taken to a 3 star Chinese hotel - again no reasonable breakfast or any English speaking help. In all we would think twice before travelling by CE again in a long time.

This is the worst long haul airline that we have ever flown with from a customer service point of view. Cabin crew were miserable and down right rude when we asked for 2 white wines. We were told that only red was available in an abrupt manner beer cola lemonade or water which when you are on a 13 hour flight was disgraceful. The food was bad we were starving and nothing was available that met our palette considering that the seats had been pre booked by Mercury Holidays I would have thought that provision could have been made for European customers. The economy seats were very uncomfortable as there was not enough padding so a very long journey seemed much longer.

April 2nd return on April 17th. Outgoing flight MU552 plus MU2504 MU2342 MU5183 and return flight MU551. We have just returned from a 3 week trip to China. I had read all the negative reviews about China Eastern and approached the flights with great trepidation. We did long haul to Shanghai then several internal flights then one flight back to UK from Beijing via Shanghai. Apart from one very inedible breakfast I was completely satisfied with my flights. The staff were attentive pleasant and polite and the food good. My only criticism is that they don't really serve alcoholic beverages and my husband was only allowed 1 beer on the way home. For a budget airline the service was good and all flights took off and landed on time. Well done China Eastern airlines.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I was so impressed with this airline's offer to NYC from Shanghai especially given the price. Brand new aircraft (3/4 months old) professional and polite cabin crew reasonable food plenty of water/juice offerings blankets and to top it - emergency exit aisle seats offered on both legs for no additional fee.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Traveled between SIN-NYC via PVG (RT) on economy. SIN-PVG-SIN flights were old and had no in-flight entertainment but PVG-NYC-PVG are modern (777-300) and had good movie selection however they do not turn it on until an hour after take-off and turn it off 30 min-45 min before landing. Staff barely speaks English and sometimes act rude (specially in SIN-PVG-SIN sectors). Food (including the selection) is very poor and below average in all sectors. Sometimes they only serve Beef or Pork so good luck if you don't eat either. So overall you can survive but this is definitely not ANA or Japan Airlines. I might still fly with them if tickets are really cheap (at least 1/3 cheaper).

Great round trip from PVG to SFO non-stop. On-time both ways (although I know this is not common for CEA). Plane was a new 330-200 with a well-equipped IFE. Very clean very nice. The flight was only about 40% full going to SFO and maybe 60% coming back. The stewardess told me that this was pretty normal for this flight maybe a combination of it being a new segment as well as the low season? I don't know but it was lovely. The regular economy seating seemed to have fairly spacious legroom but I didn't have to experience it since I was able to switch to the exit aisle on both flights. The gate attendant in PVG told me that there were no exit aisle seats available but they were clearly all empty when I got on the plane so I moved myself. On the way back the attendant in SFO was able to get me into an exit aisle seat with no fuss whatsoever and no additional fee either (looking at you US major airlines and your "economy plus/economy comfort" seat class). The Chinese on the flight preferred to try to get an entire empty row to themselves allowing them to lay down across the economy seats so there was no competition for the exit aisle seats. Service was friendly and polite (I speak Chinese so I can't comment on their language ability). Food was just average but not a deal breaker. Looking forward to taking this flight again. Also in SFO I was able to switch my return flight from SFO-PEK to SFO-PVG without any change fee since the original Beijing flight had me transferring in Shanghai anyway. Class! Can't imagine Delta letting you do that.

Apr 2 MU 748. Apr 3 FM 9451. Apr 3 MU 757. Apr 3 MU 2583. China Eastern Airlines must be one of the most unprofessional non-service oriented airlines available for your air travel needs. As a first time flyer with China Eastern I experienced multiple-long two hour-delays uncomfortable seating rude unhelpful airport staff flight attendants that do not speak English and to top it off a canceled flight. A connecting flight in Shanghai was canceled just a few minutes before departure with no explanation given. The Flight Status app noted that the plane that was supposed to be in the gate for that flight landed at another airport. Maybe China Eastern needs to do a tune up on their flight navigation instruments. The ticketing staff in Shanghai booked me on another flight at another airport an hour away! No compensation was provided for food hotel or transportation to the airport. To add insult to injury the agent at the check-in counter did not book my bags all the way so I had to get them for a second time in Kunming and re-check them before the final leg of my journey. Never again China Eastern.

I am currently at Pudong International Airport with my wife and our flight has been delayed three times transferring to Nanchang and we have been stuck here for 12 hours. No apology has been acknowledged nor has there been any reparations since it is China. This is my fist time visiting China and certainly my last. I refuse to fly on China Eastern ever again and will see if we can pay extra just to avoid our trip back to Honolulu being delayed. I wish I had read this sooner so that's could've simply paid a few hundred dollars more to avoid this horrible mishap.

I recently flew with China Eastern Airlines and it was a terrible experience. Without any warning or explanation my flight from Bali via Shanghai to Toronto was delayed by two days and I was told I would have a 24 hour layover in Shanghai at my own expense (technically I would not be permitted to leave the airport without a visa). When I tried to speak to a representative in Bali I was informed that China Eastern does not have representatives in the country - only ticket agents. The website does not provide a customer service email (which is a fairly unique approach) and when I finally got through to an English speaking China Eastern office operating out of Vancouver (from my hotel in Bali) I was informed that I needed to speak with the Shanghai office. Finally when I got to Shanghai nobody from China Eastern was in the least bit interested in either explaining what happened. I will never fly with China Eastern again.

Our flight was from LAX to Shanghai. Our flight left on time both directions. The plane was clean and the seats were fairly comfortable. They reclined much more than a lot of economy class flights I've been on. We were served two full meals and one snack. The food was probably a 3 on a scale of 1-5. Not as awful as I expected. Usually chicken pork beef or fish with noodles or rice. We did get salads on the LA leg. They only served red wine and beer and when the two bottles of red wine was gone that was it. No mixed drinks. Our flight attendants spoke a little English and were courteous. My big complaint was I booked this flight through Webjet and it was difficult to confirm our flight. Tried calling several times and was on hold for over 45 minutes once with no answer. Web site was difficult to navigate I eventually emailed China Eastern and was told I was confirmed. I was unable to choose seats. If you can choose your seats try rows 70-74 with window seats as there are only two seats instead of three. I was able to score these seats on the return flight. The inflight entertainment was excellent with over 50 English speaking movies to choose from as well as some foreign films and games.

Flew Kunming-Dhaka return and back to Shenyang with MU they should change their code to AL (always late). I must admit however that there were announcements from the cockpit in English! A first time ever after flying 10 years with MU. MU would not be my first choice but no alternatives from Kunming to Bangladesh. MU is way behind CZ when it comes to service food quality and general appearance. Business class lounge in Kunming had a very nice breakfast with bacon and eggs but you have to be early after 9 am it is gone. Recognition of your Gold Skyteam status is non existent.

Overall review I flew out on the 17 November 2014 from Paris To Shanghai with a connecting flight to Manila before I left I received an email informing me that my Manila segment was cancelled due to operating difficulties and offered the options to cancel some other day or accept the day layover in Shanghai having already booked an onward flight from Manila I argued that they should transfer me to a different airline at their cost which was accepted. Needles to say on arrival in Shanghai the transfer option to a different airline had been cancelled I was transferred to a hotel for the night which was a reasonable standard hotel. No further comments on the outward Journey accept the food on the Manila Flight was something I could have got at a 7/11 before boarding it was a suppose worse as I had no choice once aboard. Return flight 17/03/2015 Manila Shanghai-London. 1 week before departure on ringing China eastern to recall my flight details was informed that my London segment was cancelled (due to operational difficulties) and that I would have to lay over in a hotel for a day at their expense. Flight MU 212 took of on time from Manila and had been in the air for 30 minutes when the captain announced that there was fog over Shanghai and we did not have enough fuel on board to wait for it to clear (he said 40 minutes) we would be returning to Manila so after burning off enough fuel to land we had a splash and dash to Shanghai we had enough time to get a snack in the shops at Manila as nothing was offered by the airline we took off again about 3 hours behind schedule. Food again was very poor on landing at Shanghai was transferred to a poorer state hotel where the staff had very limited English and poorer quality rooms then the hotel on the way out was picked up by coach in the morning and transferred to the airport.

I flew on two domestic sectors KMG-JHG JHG-KMG and one international sector KMG-SIN. Domestic flight was interesting. I checked into the Domestic Skyteam Elite counter at Kunming Airport and gave them my Garuda Gold card (Skyteam Elite). They had never seen the card nor heard of the airline before. Thank goodness I could speak Mandarin and understood the question the counter staff was asking another puzzled colleague and could tell them it was an Indonesian carrier within the Skyteam. After checking in for me she tagged my luggage with priority baggage handling which was only accorded to Skyteam Elite Plus members but hey I wouldn't complain. The one hour flight from KMG to JHG was short. It was operated on a B737-200 which was relatively comfortable on the second row of the economy cabin. I had the aisle seat and slept through the flight. There was no personal IFE on board. Water and a packet of candies were distributed as you boarded the aircraft. On my flight back from JHG-KMG I had the same puzzled look from the check in counter staff about my Garudamiles Gold card. The Skyteam/Business Class counter was not open which was strange. The domestic queues for economy class was long. Flew the B737-300 and the aircraft had a slightly newer configuration than the flight from KMG-JHG. It was a full flight and the crew were just busy trying to get every one on board. Flight was okay. Same bottled water and a pack of candies as you board. For the KMG-SIN International leg we had to clear immigration at KMG and collect our luggage. Get out of airside and proceed to landside departures to check in. Checked into the business class counter as there were only two counters and which every was empty served me. Again had to explain to them about Garudamiles. Flew on an A320. The best configuration and seat comfort with blankets provided. Before departure a cabin crew came to me and spoke to me in Mandarin welcoming me as a Skyteam Elite member and offered me a bottle of water and politely told me to speak to any of the crew members should I need anything. Thought that was a pretty cool gesture to recognise the Skyteam Elite members even for the lower of the two premium tiers. There was no individual IFE but there were screens on board which you could watch Just for Laughs without the sound. Earpieces were not provided but given the flight was at 1045pm scheduled to arrive into Singapore at 2am I slept through most of the flight. The supper was just a box of bun and cake some peanuts and water. You could ask for other beverages which I got an orange juice. This flight carried only 60 passengers and i was fortunate to get the fourth row of three seats in the single aisle aircraft all to myself with room to stretch. Overall I would fly China Eastern again. That's also because I speak some Mandarin and it was easier to communicate with the crew who were always polite.

I am amazed at the bagging that the Chinese carriers get on this site. I am based in Qingdao China and do a minimum of 20 domestic flights every year mostly on China Eastern and Shandong Airlines. I have been using Chinese carriers now for 13 years. My last trip was from Qingdao to Bangkok and return via Shanghai Pudong. Checked in at Qingdao and my bag was checked all the way to BKK flight took off from Qingdao on time and landed on time in Pudong. Flight itself was uneventful aircraft was an A320 breakfast in a box was served along with your choice of drink. There was a slight delay boarding the Bangkok flight boarding was from an underground "gate" which of course meant a bus ride to the plane. Flight was on an Airbus A320 no IFE and due to the inevitable backlog at Pudong took off about 1 hour late. The service on board was good was able to get a couple of beers before lunch although lunch itself was horrendous but not to worry as there is plenty of good food at our destination Bangkok. Flight did make up some time en route but as I was going on holiday (Chinese Spring Festival) I wasn't bothered. Baggage was on belt by the time I cleared immigration. The return flight whilst having a MU flight number was actually operated by China Eastern's sister airline Shanghai airways. Flight was on a Boeing 737-800 and was pretty uneventful lunch was a delicious Thai curry so much better than the lunch served on the inbound flight- different catering I guess. Arrived at Pudong on time then had a 5 hour wait for my domestic MU flight back to Qingdao. There is not much to do at Shanghai Pudong Terminal 1 -however found a nice restaurant on level 2 of terminal 1 called the Hope Star restaurant where you can have a nice cup of coffee and an edible sandwich for 80 Yuan (ca $12) which is a very good price for an airport and you can sit there in a comfortable seat for hours. Flight back to Qingdao was on an Airbus A330 which is actually a leg of a San Francisco-Pudong-Qingdao flight so was equipped with IFE however due to the short flight time 1 hour 15 mins-nothing worth watching. All in all a good trip I have been flying now for 40 years averaging 30 flights per year been flying long before the introduction of IFE so I know how to amuse myself on a flight-modern travellers are too demanding and cannot amuse themselves. I believe that the Chinese carriers are very good-I do not need constant updates from the flight deck I am not a movie or rock star and do not need the cabin crew to be falling all over me. I will admit that there are communication issues with the Chinese carriers but when you board the flight  smile and say Ni Hao you will immediately have broken down some barriers. You get much better value for money and service on Chinese carriers than you do on similar flights in Europe and the US. Now long haul flights well different story you pays your money and you take your chances.

Flight from Nagoya to Shanghai. 3 hours delay without any compensation. No passenger communication at all from the ground staff at Nagoya. While seated in the aircraft next to an emergency exit. A male flight attendant tells me the emergency briefing of Not to touch the emergency door! The flight was set for 2.5 hours from this we had constant 2 hours of moderate turbulence - what bothered me the most was that the flight crew did not even once speak with the passages explaining the situation on why and the probable estimation of the turbulence. The cabin temperature was set extremely high. An overall rating for this quick flight. A full nightmare from arrival at the China Eastern counter until leaving the airport with my bags at my destination. This company has zero customer care and support.

Had 3 flights with MU last week 2 domestic and 1 international. Had rather booked with another airline but no choice. All flights delayed one to two hours. No apologies no explanation. As usual no English spoken no recognition of your Elite status bags last ones on the belt. Compared with China Southern is this airline far behind in service level. Price was right but that is really the only good thing I can say about it.

I had a round trip from Toronto to Dhaka and back to Toronto. There were two stops in China at Kunming and Shanghai. At both stops they gave us all our Baggage back as they don't take the baggage directly to the destination. At one of the stops we had to wait 12 hours for the next flight and they did not provide a hotel or food coupons. There is no entertainment no TV on the back of the seat no toys or books for kids no personal items like toothbrush or paste or socks. The food did not taste very good and there was also not a lot of it. Overall the service was very poor.

From Bangkok to Shanghai the meal was very good. On the return flight no meal was served and we were given a tray of wrapped biscuits-that's disgraceful. On flight from Shanghai to Harbin and return Chinese passengers asked us to swap seats. My friend refused but the stewardess basically insisted I comply.

Had to fly Sydney to Beijing. Qantas sells a codeshare with China Eastern so decided it seemed most efficient flight. What they don't tell you is that you have to get off at Nanjing and clear customs. That is the passenger has to not the baggage. The flight then becomes a domestic flight so service basically stops. When you arrive in Beijing you have to do a baggage clearance through customs. Was very confused about the seat belt sign. Although the pre-flight safety video said "when the seat belt sign is illuminated return to your seat and fasten your seat belt" the sign was never not illuminated. When I asked how we knew it was okay to move around the cabin there was no response. When asked how did I know when I had to return to my seat I was told there would be two "dings" from above. Unless you ask you have to assume it's safety by telepathy because nobody tells you anything. In business class was offered the hand written menu. Yep hand written on a piece of scrap paper. How very rustic. The choice of drinks was limited and once you chose one that was what you drank the entire flight. Well the entire flight until after Nanjing when there was no gin and tonic served because it was now a domestic flight albeit the same now tired looking tech crew and aircraft. The seats were comfortable enough but the aircraft was tired and in need of fixing things such as rips and tears on seats and around the cabin. Not sure the nose tissues really worked as hand towels in the toilets as they tended to break up a bit too quickly for one to dry one's hands. Why bother? The headset for the IFE was a DYI: you are given a headset and the batteries to install into it. That's a first. The IFE offered bore no relation to what was indicated in the one and only inflight magazine (no entertainment guide) between two seats. It was torn and weather beaten on 3rd January. Qantas should be ashamed and embarrassed selling this as a business class codeshare. Next time it's Hong Kong and Cathay. And if you're flying business class don't expect any priority exit from the aircraft.

Flew China Eastern's airbus 320 from MEL to LAX via PVG (stayed in PVG for couple nights). I am a frequent flyer and I have to say the most airlines are very similar these days and China Eastern is no exception. All of our flights are on time and seats are reasonably good it's the first time I've seen China Eastern use personal IFE at the back of each economy seats good range of movies. However their staff service standards were quite different in each flight something they really need to improve in the future. Our MEL to PVG service was much better than PVG to LAX flight ironically food was the other way around though overall I consider it's value for money.

Was on a Qantas codeshare using a QF flight number but with China Eastern PEK to PUD. The check in at Beijing terminal 2 business class is a joke. There is no signage to the special business class check-in so I ended up at an economy clerk and thought so what. Oh no one must go to business class section which was back near the front of the terminal without any special signage. Was attended to by a most rude woman who had no idea about customer service. The baggage belt behind her to whisk away the business class bags was not working (whether it ever does or not I know not) so I had to walk back with my bags attended to by a busboy of sorts who took me back to the economy class check in area so my bags could go on the belt. Obviously no deviation from the plan allowed. He then demanded a tip! After customs and security (very helpful and most patient people given the rudeness of others they attended to) I made it to the circa 1974 business class lounge. Entry about that under lounges. In the end I gave up on the tired crowded and unhelpful "lounge" which was more like a noisy eating competition arena and went to the gate. No aerobridge just another mini bus. The flight had the same problem with the seat belt signs it was never extinguished so it seemed okay to get up and wander about when the wheels had left the ground. Although told not to use electronic devices nobody really either bothered to obey or enforce it as the pax in business must be very important and know all about safety. The aircraft (A321) was tired and dirty and in need of repair to internal fittings. Didn't bother with any IFE as it didn't seem to work and headsets were not offered. On arrival at Pudong Terminal 1 there was no assistance to find the way to the Qantas flight at Terminal 2 so it just took a bit of working out. Although I was travelling on QF indicated flights there was no one stop service and it was all very disjointed and unhelpful.

We flew from Manila to Rome via Shanghai. First I had been booked for months and "just happened" to call the airline to double check baggage allowance 2 weeks before my flight and was told "oh sorry that flight has been cancelled! Though they had my cell# and email there was no warning. They then rebooked us for the following day however the day we were to leave Manila our flight was delayed 10 hours with no updates and every time I tried to get them to work out an alternate route as delay had cost us our connecting flight to Rome I was told "we can't do that here Shanghai has it all set". Got to Shanghai and in very limited English they said they refuse to put me on a partner airline and I was rebooked on China Eastern for the following day. The next day service on the aircraft was very poor awful meals and I timed over 4 hours that not one stewardess was visible no drinks offered and with meals no diet drinks are available. We fly internationally for business several times a year and by far this is the worst airline I have flown by a wide margin. For an international airline the lack of language and customer service is simply inexcusable. Many passengers on our flight said they would never fly this airline again.

I flew China Eastern's new YYZ to PVG direct service and multiple flights within Asia. I chose China Eastern because it saved me some money. I am a veteran traveler and to my recollection I have flown over 40 airlines in various locales around the world China Eastern is by far the worst airline it has ever been my misfortune to fly. The staff were incompetent. (At the airport I asked if I could upgrade. And after 3 attempts including trying to overcome the language barrier with the supervisor I gave up). The food was inedible. You know it is bad when you choose the pasta with seafood and the flight attendant asks "Are you sure? and shows you the food before giving it to you). The seat was uncomfortable. (Old material not enough legroom). The in-flight entertainment was unviewable and had the worst English dub ever. If the website had allowed me to leave them no stars in any category I would have because they don't deserve any. No matter how much money you may save by flying this airline it is not worth it.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Not an enjoyable flight. Staff abrupt and not friendly. Had to keep window blind down the whole flight. Cold. Food terrible. And though not the fault of the airline they work out of Shanghai Airport where the staff are truly rude and the transit area is cold miserable uncomfortable and very expensive.

Shanghai - Yantai in Business Class. Flight on a new A320 aircraft - the Business Class section actually has larger seats with more legroom compared to many short haul business class cabins so had a feeling that you are actually getting something extra for your money. Seats in 4-abreast configuration in the business section and very comfortable. Hot meal was served with soft drinks tea and coffee but no alcoholic beverages offered (which I didn't mind as it was a lunchtime flight and I had an afternoon meeting to attend). It is also worth pointing out that you have priority going through security which is an advantage during busy times. There was access to a lounge close to the gate which was basic by western standards but adequate. Whilst some aspects of the service would be considered basic by Western standards I am told by my Chinese colleague who made the arrangements that Business class domestic fares in China are quite competitive.

We flew LHR-PVG-SYD return and were pleasantly surprised by China Eastern. After reading the reviews we were expecting the worst but the service was good the staff spoke enough English to communicate well and we had our own individual entertainment units with a good selection of recent movies. Three flights were around 10 hours and one was about 13 hours long and on all four we were served 2 full meals (generally a choice of one Asian meal and one Western meal). Seats were comfortable and had a decent amount of space in economy. Only complaints would be that it was not possible to check-in online and that their seat allocation system doesn't seem to seat people that are travelling together next to each other. We were two people booked together and on our PVG-SYD and PVG-LHR flights (which we checked in for over 13 hours in advance as they were our second flights) we weren't given seats together despite specifically requesting it for the return SYD-PVG-LHR flights at the check-in desk. We went to the service helpdesk and the woman was able to change it with no problems so not sure why the original guy couldn't give us seats together. We noticed a number of couples and groups not seated together on the PVG-SYD flight so definitely request it when checking in and follow up at the service desk if still not seated together. Seat configuration on all four flights was 2-4-2.

SYD-PVG-FRA-PVG-SYD in Dec/Jan. Second long-haul flight to Europe with CE and as with the first faultless. On time departures and usually early arrivals (30 minutes early on PVG-FRA leg). Menu choices just right and beer wine and spirits plentiful. Other amenities/facilities could not be faulted. Yes the crew's English is a second language resulting in a few communication lags but isn't one benefit of travel to gain exposure to other cultures? The provision of the courtesy car in Shanghai a definite bonus. Planning for next holiday was started by checking CE routes and will be built around one of those destinations.

We flew from London to Manila via Shanghai. The service on the aircraft was very poor with most of the cabin crew having very limited English. The food was just about edible. Getting served was very hit and miss with some crew just walking up and down the aisle with drinks and not asking each passenger if they wanted anything. It was up to passengers to attract their attention and many time people were just ignored. Some staff were friendly some barely hid their contempt for the passengers. We booked a baby bassinet but it wasn't provided and the cabin crew couldn't even understand what we wanted when we asked so we had to spend a 13 hour flight with a baby on our laps. No children's meals were provided even though we booked them. We checked the baby buggy at the gate in Heathrow. When we got to Shanghai it had disappeared and it took us several hours of speaking to unhelpful staff to get it back. Shanghai airport is a huge gloomy depressing place with zero facilites beyond basic seating and horrifically expensive shops. 8GBP for a fruit juice. All in all the worst airline I have flown with by a wide margin. For an international airline the lack of language skills and training of the staff is inexcusable and the staff's attitude to the people who pay their wages is totally unacceptable.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Very comfortable flights and CAN checking in staff helped me to change my CAN-SHA flight so that I arrived at Pudong rather than Honqaiou airport. No hassle with it and it saved me transferring between 2 Shanghai airports. The only let down was a tiny business lounge at Pudong airport. A few rows of seats without any coffee tables in front of them and just 2 tables with bar stools in the lounge. I liked the attentive service but it may be that I do not require inane and meaningless smiles at every contact like some reviewers demand. Staff smiled when appropriate and provided excellent service.

Shanghai to Melbourne on 16 December 2014. There was an inadequate announcement of safety protocols and the laminated leaflet was inadequate. The cabin was dingy from the 1970s and not cleaned thoroughly - there was rubbish from the previous flight(s) both on the floor and in the seat folio. The entertainment system was appalling. The selection of movies did not include any current releases. The "nostalgia" section contained not one but two Shirley Temple films. The screen image and subtitles were shadowy and blurred and the sound quality was very poor. No drinks were provided after take off. After 95 minutes I asked a flight attendant if I might have some water. The request was met with a surly look and the flight attendant said that drinks would be served with the meal service in 20 minutes. I asked the flight attendant for water again and after 15 minutes a plastic cup half filled was produced. Things got worse. Children were permitted to use the cabin as an activity area and continually ran along aisles shouting and squealing. The meal was lukewarm. The dinner roll was at least two days old the savoury roll at least three. The chicken dish was tepid and the rice came in a rectangular non friable block apparently not heated. Dessert was a canned peach half and pear quarter. There was no fresh fruit nor vegetables. A third glass of wine was offered - the polite question "could I have a little more? was met with stony indifference. The coffee like the cabin was from the 1970s.

I flew CE during my vacation to Japan which transits via Shanghai. Everything was fine until the last segment back to Singapore. Of all the 3 segments made I had no problems using my phone to watch movies which I've downloaded but in the last segment from Shanghai to Singapore (MU545) I was told to power down my phone. I did so promptly as requested but after some thoughts I had to ask the stewardess again to be sure. I know many airlines already allow the use of digital devices even during takeoff and landing. Some airlines may not adopt the practice yet but to go to the extent of disallowing the use of my phone (in flight mode) during cruising was really extreme to me. All laptops or tablets are ok. I was really surprised and felt embarrassed as I felt like I was being picked upon. I've travelled with other airlines using my phone to watch movies without any problems. In the end the 6hr journey was a torture. I could only wait for my food I guess. Then food came and I was asked to choose. But by the time I was served the crew couldn't provide me with what I wanted. There was no more choices. Too bad if you don't like rice with eels. No more CE for me.

Flew on 5th Dec SHA to HKG. A330. It was my first flight with China Eastern and I would say it was a pleasant surprise. The aircraft was clean seat comfortable and plenty of leg room. IFE fair touch screen and the cabin crew friendly even if not so professional. Last but not least we departed on time. Overall the cost for the quality provided is really fair.

I flew this in September from SIN-JFK with a stopover in Shanghai. The flight from Shanghai to JFK was the worst flight I've experienced. The seats do not recline (terrible on a 14 hour flight) there is no TV at the seats and the overhead entertainment is one of the worst. The food is almost inedible. This flight is not worth it especially on a long haul flight.

Flew from Shanghai to Toronto. Most passengers had two full size carry-on baggage so cabin storage was all full. Spoken English by flight attendants is poor to terrible. No on board movies. Ok unless you are Chinese and don't mind staring at a 13 inch screen at 10 paces to watch a poor movie dubbed in Chinese. Flight attendants kept insisting (twice) I turn off my iPhone (of course on airplane mode) which I was reading from even though I pointed at two other (Chinese passengers) who clearly had their mobile devices on and she did not bother them at all! Very poor operation by staff - wrong gate info displayed on monitors which did not come on until well after a huge line up formed we had to ask which counter to go to. Flight attendants did not show any pleasantness as if they did not want to be there at all.

We flew from Sydney to Shanghai. Both ground staff and cabin crew were lovely people attentive and helpful. We were feed twice and the food was very good. The seating was roomy and not uncomfortable. We took a laptop with movies with us so can not comment on their entertainment. This was our first long flight and we were very happy with the trip. Will not hesitate to fly with China Eastern again.

MU5373 (PVG-CSX) on 4/10/2014. Having read the largely negative reviews here I was hesitant when selecting a flight from PVG to CSX but decided to give it a try as the timing was desirable. I was pleasantly surprised at the end of my journey. The flight was punctual no issue with baggage food and beverages were decent and satisfying attentive flight attendants who made multiple trips to provide beverages as well as the leg room being more spacious than expected. Overall it was a very decent domestic flight. PVG airport was also fairly efficient in terms of check-in handling as well as easy to navigate around.

I travelled from Paris to Shanghai in business class. Going out the configuration was 1-2-1. Coming back it was 2-2-2. I have read a lot of negative reviews about this airline but actually it was very reasonable. The business class ticket was very cheap in my opinion. We had full flat bed seats on both legs of the journey which were very comfortable indeed. Food was average. Service was average but typical Chinese standard. Check in at both ends was efficient. For the price I paid there is nothing to moan about and would definitely fly with them again in business class.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
My daughter and I recently flew Sydney to Beijing Beijing to Xian Xian to Guilin Shanghai to Sydney. I was a bit worried after reading so many negative reviews but found China Eastern to be equal to or better than many other airlines I have flown with. The planes were clean and comfortable (by plane standards) and the staff were very professional and helpful with quite good English. The meals (all Chinese) were tasty. There was usually a choice between noodles and rice but the noodles were difficult to eat because of the shape of the fork. The only alcohol served was beer and red wine with dinner. If you want to party and annoy the other passengers this is not the airline for you! On most of our flights the monitors dropped down from the ceiling so there was not a choice of entertainment but on the flight from Shanghai to Sydney we had personal monitors with a wide choice of TV movies games etc. Mine was not working and I was offered a change of seat which I declined as I spent most of my time sleeping anyway. Our planes were all on time (or close enough) and check-in and baggage claim were efficient. Overall we were impressed by the service and quite satisfied with our experience - good value for money!

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Flew their new B77W from SHA to PEK in F two weeks ago. Overall the experience was mixed. Pros - needless to say brand new airplane and facilities. Above average (based on my experience on Chinese carriers) crew. Meal was nicely presented. Large IFE screen with plenty of choices. Cons - my seat did not go flat. I don't know if it's a mechanical failure so I asked an attendant to help me. She wasn't able to recline it either. Maybe acceptable for this 2hrs flight but certainly unacceptable for long haul. Annoying ads before every IFE program but overall worth trying out.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I flew China Eastern on a recent trip between Melbourne and China. The seats are very uncomfortable they are skinny and hard with little leg room. I am 6'2" tall and requested an exit aisle seat for extra leg room which they accommodated however they said there was no way one of my travel companions could sit with me and the 5 people from my group were seated at the other end of the plane from me. This would be fine if all the exit aisle seats and other seats around me weren't empty once we were fully boarded! The food was acceptable and there were regular drinks offered their English style breakfast was odd to say the least I would opt for the Asian style were I to travel with them again. The service on the flight was friendly and welcoming. The TV on any of the flights didn't work for me either there was no sound or the screen wouldn't stay up or it just wouldn't turn on. Not on a single flight did it work. It did work for some of my travel companions and they tell me they were able to watch some recent movies and TV shows with a selection of English Indian Chinese and Japanese shows to choose from. I can't really comment on the quality however as I was never able to access it. All in all it is a budget airline and you get what you pay for but it was much better quality than I expected for the bargain price we paid.

Flew Sept 10/14 Vancouver to Shanghai return Sept 25 plus 4 domestic flights. All planes were new comfy and had great staff! The 330-200's had individual entertainment screens. We were surprised and impressed. No baggage issues no problems. One of the 6 flights was late 20 minutes. It was a tour arranged by China star well done on all accounts.

We had 5 flights with China Eastern while visiting China and Hong Kong. Our largest journey was Heathrow to Shanghai. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Aeroplane was very comfortable and choice of entertainment was fantastic. Only problem on every flight there was not a Vegetarian meal for me this was booked with our Tour Operator and requested three times during our visit. The Steward on the Heathrow flight managed to find some food for me so I thank him for that.

For the price it was great bang for my buck. I flew a roundtrip from Seoul to New Delhi for $450 can't beat that. Everyone else was charging at least $1000. The plane to New Delhi was nice and had a PTV screen in the seat. The food was whatever but it an airline food so I don't have high expectations. The stewardess were a refreshing change from US carriers. I would definitely fly with them again. I wrote this review to balance all the negative things said. I was completely satisfied with everything.

MU598 Vancouver to Shanghai July 12th. MU581 Shanghai to Vancouver August 10th. I took a round trip between Vancouver and Shanghai with China Eastern. The flight attendants spoke fluent English (with a Chinese accent). The planes on both trips were new Airbus A330-200s (a huge improvement from the A340s I used to fly). The planes were clean with comfortable seats great inflight entertainment systems plenty of leg room and convenient USB charging ports. The meals were very tasty. The crews on the ground and in the air were very helpful and friendly. Both flights left on time one arrived on time and the other arrived an hour early. From the check-in to picking up my luggage at the destination the whole experience has been quite enjoyable. The fact that the whole trip cost me under $1000 made it even better!

I travel in and out of China regularly transferring at Guangzhou and then on to Kunming with China Southern Airlines. I was forced make changes to my usual pattern and ended up having to use China Eastern transferring to a domestic flight at Shanghai. I should have arrived at Kunming around midnight but due to 'unspecified delays' at Shanghai didn't clear Kunming airport till well after 4am. Return flight to Sydney was even worse. Left Kunming on time but with China Eastern there is a 6 hour wait at Shanghai for a connecting flight so my travel agent got me to transfer at Nanjing instead should have been only a 3 hour wait - Nanjing isn't set up for proper international transfers so you have to unload your baggage at Nanjing exit the domestic terminal and go through the booking process again at the international check in. And guess what China Eastern has different rules as regards baggage on domestic and international flights so I ended up having to abandon an oversized item I was bringing back at Nanjing airport. The officious supervisors at the China Eastern check in counter weren't interested in the fact that I had booked the baggage in at their Kunming counter knowing full well that I was flying on to Sydney. The kicker was that the flight on to Sydney was delayed 2.5 hours for 'unspecified reasons' so didn't even get the shorter wait time anticipated. I will in future be making every effort to avoid flying with China Eastern Airways or transferring via Shanghai and Nanjing.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I flew China Eastern Airlines from Chongqing-Jinan. The seats are very uncomfortable there is a very thin padding that separates your body from the metal under the seat. There is absolutely no entertainment no drop down TV screens or personal TV screens. The food is very nasty and tastes inedible the rice was very dry and tasted like it was over a week old the vegetables have no seasoning and tasted horrible the beef was the worst the meat tasted very dry and was under heated as though it were a leftover from another airline it was cooked in a sauce that had no flavor and tasted like water. Passengers randomly got up during take-off and landing when the seat belt sign was on and no flight attendants even tried to tell people to sit down. I will never fly China Eastern Airlines again because of it's terrible service and nasty food.

Flew LHR-PDG-SYD and returned three weeks later. Was somewhat tentative given some of the reviews on here but the price was at least £200 cheaper than next best fare. Needn't have worried the flights were punctual on all legs the planes were very clean and the attendants very helpful albeit some have limited English. The food was good though best on the legs from LHR and from SYD to PDG. IFE was excellent with a wide range of films and games. The flight booked for the return leg was changed three months prior to flying and we were informed by email. We left SYD later in the day and were accommodated in the airport hotel overnight in Shanghai which broke the journey up nicely. Would be happy to fly with this airline again.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
My wife stepson and I chose this airline because I naively though they were trying to encourage travel to China how wrong I was. My wife has a mobility problem we were told by airline staff at Pudong airport that they must have the supplied wheelchair now so my wife was without a wheelchair for over one hour whilst I arranged with the information desk for a replacement wheelchair - she was unable to look in the shops or go to the toilet during this time. The crew that I had dealings with were more concerned with the requests of Chinese people before the other passengers probably because they spoke little or no English. On all the trips we had problems with obtaining a wheelchair for my wife the worst incident being on our return trip when we were checking in at 9.30am we were informed that no wheelchair was available until 11am. After nearly 30 minutes of trying to communicate with staff with a poor understanding of English and asking to speak to a manager we finally obtained a wheelchair then the flight was delayed by over two hours after being told to arrive at the departure gate an hour before take off so we could enter the plane on "priority". At no time were we given ant information for the delay and gate change and having to read the " Departures board" or ask at the Information desk. I had no inflight entertainment for the last three hours of the journey from Pudong to Heathrow.

SYD-SHA-YVR Economy Class. I was anxious about taking these flights as while I've flown internal flights within China on China Eastern I'd not yet used them long-haul. The aircraft interior was brand new on both legs with comfortable seats new-looking IFE screens although with quite a limited choice. The flight attendants were extremely polite friendly on boarding and very responsive to call requests. The food was adequate only in that it was edible - it was served on the SYD-SHA leg in a plastic box and on the SHA-YVR leg in a tray. The choice for both meals on both legs was just a variation of chicken/seafood rice/noodles. The dessert was okay though! Alcohol was very limited - just red wine and beer. But they were very responsive to refills (I asked early to avoid missing out). The return flight from Sydney to Vancouver was just AUD $1500 and to be honest - I felt that China Eastern has (so far) offered value for money.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Flew Shanghai Pudong (PVG) - Beijing (PEK) domestic first class on an A321. Lounge in PVG was a disappointment - I'd say below average standards across China based on my experiences. Flight itself was good. Seat was a recliner. Typical on narrow-body legroom was good but didn't recline much. Food was pretty tasty asked for beer and water and was provided. Crew came around often and were friendly. There was personal IFE but the controls were a bit difficult to figure out and the touch-screen was slow to respond. Overall a pleasant experience though minor things can be improved. Considering the price I paid (even a little less than full-fare economy when I booked a week in advance) I would definitely recommend.

June 14 KMG to BKK. Flight was on time only about half full or less. Flight attendants were polite and friendly. Food was acceptable given the only 2-hour flight. Because the airport was newly built and there were not many international flight out from KMG the international section of the airport was very spacious. Overall it was a good experience.

PVG-CCU via KMG June 8-9 Economy. My ticket clearly stated PVG-CCU. Flight was via KMG with a 23 hr. stopover. My booking for 8th June was cancelled by the airline due to cancellation of their KMG-CCU flight on June 8. At that time (a month before) I was given the option to cancel the entire booking but it was too late and any fresh booking would cost me much more so I opted for the date change to June 9. However when I arrived for check-in at PVG they refused to provide through check-in to CCU and said that I would have to collect my baggage at KMG and go for a fresh check-in. This was ridiculous since PVG is the home base of China Eastern and they can easily manage to put systems in place for through check-in for through bookings. But they refused and when I met the duty supervisor she told me to contact the check-in counter at KMG for immediate check-in. However as expected when I arrived at KMG at midnight none of their counters were open. I managed to locate the duty supervisor who refused to help out. I had to spend money and stay in a hotel. When I returned to the airport the next day around 6 pm again they refused to check me in until 9 pm.

SFO-PVG June 6 Economy. Aircraft was a A-330-200 which was quite new. Seats were good and the crew service also good. They were serving beverages and water throughout the 12 hour flight. The toilets were also being maintained by the crew. Two meals and a snack were served; which were reasonably OK. There was option of chicken-rice and beef-noodles for lunch but by the time they reached our seats (62) they ran out of the chicken. I had to wait some time and was given a vegetarian option instead. The flight was on time in fact arrived before schedule at Shanghai. However my later subsequent flights were a bad experience which is why I would avoid taking this airline in future.

I took Shanghai Airlines 767 (China Eastern Subsidiary) from Singapore to PVG then hopped on a China Eastern A340-600 on the long trip to JFK. Then a couple months later did the same thing in reverse. I loved my experience although such long flights are tough the China Eastern crew made it seem shorter. I am 6'4 so when I politely asked check-in attendants if they had any leg room seats I got them both times with no hassle and no extra charge which would never happen on any U.S. airlines. Food was decent entertainment was decent. But then again I don't fly for the food and entertainment. Staff was great and that's what counts.

I cannot recommend to take China Eastern within China as their staff is not able to speak English sufficiently. I was supposed to go from Changsha to Shanghai at 8 am this morning but the plane was delayed but nobody could tell me to the new departure was. My question about connection (3h 30min) or going via another route was understood by nobody. Arriving in Shanghai 4hrs late I just missed my connection and there was no help to rebook it (original quote: "No our fault bad weather" leaving me very disappointed waiting 12h for the next connection and never using China Eastern again.

PVG-SFO A330-200. Seats were OK. Flight pretty much on time and cabin crew were quite attentive. During the 11 hr flight they served 2 meals and 1 snack with rounds of water and juice. The meals were all Chinese but sufficient only choice of pork and fish was offered. The snack was hot and refreshing. The crew try to be friendly with their almost zero knowledge of English. The toilets were clean though no supplies inside no toothbrush or face lotion; only hand-wash. The choice of entertainment was poor though each seat had a screen and a USB port. Pillow and blanket was provided upon request. The seat belt signs were kept on for most of the flight duration. Only some airline magazines were available for reading.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Surprisingly enough online check in was not available. Flight schedule was not available online either. A330 middle cabin air conditioning didn't work. There were no air outlet over the seats. TV screen was in the middle section of the plane and people had a hard time watching if sitting by the windows. Electrical outlets behind the seats were not powered to charge the electronics equipment. The entertainment was a joke. The same low grade movies were played both ways. No music to listen to. If not because of passengers brought their own entertainment they would be bored to tears.

SYD-PVG-LHR and return April/May A330-330/-200. I agree largely with the comments of Mr Rory Moore. Areas requiring improvement are lounges in PVG IFE (a dying breed anyway) and perhaps the ground and cabin staffs' command of English. Otherwise no problems - punctual clean attentive service and excellent value for money.

Shanghai to Singapore return and Shanghai to Beijing return. Shocked that for all 4 flights there was a delay of 30 mins - 1 hour. Singapore to Shanghai flight air conditioning broke down and I was for sweating half the time. Shanghai to Singapore flight the plane wasn't even there when boarding was supposed to begin. Shanghai to Beijing return was okay albeit with the usual lateness. Domestic flight vs International Flight issue? Based on my flight experience for the past 6 months with both budget and full service airlines definitely say this airline is between Budget and Full Service in terms of overall quality.

Manila - Shanghai - Los Angeles and return. Aircraft - Manila to Shanghai was a new A321 outbound and an old A320 inbound. Aircraft was well maintained and comfortable feeling. For the Shanghai to LAX long haul they still utilised the A340-600 which didn't have personal entertainment so you're at the mercy of watching the centralised movies. Its a disadvantage specially travelling with small kids. In general the aircraft's of this airline were okay. Cabin Crew - Generally all Chinese crew. Some were pleasant some were not. They had a hard time understanding and speaking English but some do quite well. Though you could feel that they are trying their damn best. Food and beverage - Food was traditional Chinese but beware if you're travelling with children. They will most likely not be satisfied. Beverages were served in room temp. Chinese are not fond of ice. Transit terminal - PVG Terminal 1 is a bit old and if you're connecting I suggest a maximum waiting time of 3 hours in this terminal. Nothing to do here. Overall I would rate this airline okay and would still recommend to others if you can get a very good deal from them.

Flew LAX-PVG-KUL on March 28 return trip Apr 15. Outbound: Seat was hard and lumpy. Food was awful one bottle of wine for the entire plane. Return flight from PVG to LAX: Flight attendant was incredibly rude. When I asked if I may have a beer he shouted "no beer" without looking at me and walked away. I fly frequently and this was the first flying China Eastern. It is easily the worst airline I have flown. The only thing good about my flights was that they landed and were relatively on-time.

Flight from Xi'an to Shenzhen on 22nd April was delayed nearly 3 hours but there was no formal announcement of this fact. We were told to just wait. Initial rearranged departure time of 11.00 was eventually pushed back to 12.15 but the general impression was of an airline which did not seem to mind wasting 3 hours of our time. They should have explained the reason for the delay and been honest about the extent of the delays - none of this happened.

Flew LHR to Shanghai (Pudong) and back with internal flights (to HK Xian Beijing) between. Internal flights were reasonable in planes comfortable for 2 hour trips and a meal provided on each. No seat back IFE but no need for short trips. Long haul flights in new Airbus were very good. Seat back IFE with large range of choice - good quality food (what is aviation radish??) - attentive staff and regular drinks available (I do not consume alcohol while flying so cannot comment). Seat pitch very good much better than European Airlines. Overall very impressed with quality and value and would both recommend and use again.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Travelled Singapore to Shanghai return. Flight to Shanghai was overnight. new aircraft with lie flat seats departure on time. It was odd that there was no service in business class cabin after take off until breakfast not even a bottle of water. I say this because when I went to the toilet the crew in economy were busy organising meals. No big deal as I didn't want a meal but just strange. Breakfast was fresh and tasty. Flight back was in older aircraft with Shanghai Airways. Crew attentive and meal was ok. Flight was on time. Great value for money being less than half the price of other options. I would use this airline again.

Shanghai to Melbourne in March although it was a Qantas code-share flight there was not one mention of Qantas or a QF number up on the board. Overnight flight but no ear plugs mask or socks handed out. No bottles of water given out but when I went to the galley noticed they had some so when I asked for two was given them. I was lucky to be given a pair of slippers after a toilet had been flooded and it had to be mopped up by a steward. No complaints about the staff. Food was inedible. We had a glass of wine each and asked for another glass and they informed us they only had two bottles of both red and white wine allocated per cabin e.g. approx. 120 people and it had all gone.

SYD-PVG-CDG-PVG-SYD during March. Departures on all legs were within two minutes of scheduled time and all arrivals either on time or early. Cabin crew were attentive without being in your face meals were delicious especially the Chinese options and wine beer and spirits kept coming. IFE offered a great selection of international western and Chinese movies. Cabin cleanliness superb and the PJ's and the lie flat beds were wonderful. The less said about the PVG lounges the better.

My flight was from Shanghai to Siem Reap. Ground staff didn't make any announcements for boarding even though it was nearly last call I was about to miss my flight. Aircraft was A320 it looked new but economy class had no entertainment system. That was fine but the most awful thing was the crew. They were shouting at passengers. The meal tasted awful! I will not recommend to passengers wanting good service!

MU 5806 from Shanghai to Lijiang on Feb 24th 2014. Worst Chinese Airline on domestic flights considering that most of then are of a poor standard that says a lot about MU service. Check-in couldn't accommodate 2 people traveling together on the same row of seats. Flight delayed 1.5 hours as per usual due to traffic funny enough only 3 planes where delayed in Hongqiao Airport Shanghai at that time 3 of them from China Eastern. Rude flight attendants plane was new though that's the only good point. Food as always was terrible on the second flight they didn't serve dinner because of turbulence might be better off not eating it anyway. Will avoid this airline as much as I can and Shanghai Airlines that they own is the same.

PVG-PEK lounge at PVG was very tired and worn out. First class was old and outdated and did not have any IFE. Priority luggage came out last and regular passengers ignored the first class baggage waiting area as staff just watched. Very poor service.

My wife and I flew from London to Sydney (with a 2 night stopover on the return leg). We really enjoyed the experience. The lie-flat seats were very comfortable and the food and drink were mostly excellent. The cabin staff worked really hard to deliver a very high level of service. The trip went very smoothly. Transit at Pudong is very easy. You need to go to the transit desk and then back to the gate but a bit of exercise on a long trip is a good idea. Getting a short stay visa for Shanghai is also easy although the very pleasant official called his supervisor to check our printed e-tickets. The Skyteam lounge at Heathrow is fine as is the Qantas lounge at Sydney. As others have said the lounge at Pudong is below par. Overall great value for money.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
We flew LHR-Shanghai-Melbourne return having chosen the airline due to a good price and a desire to stopover in Shanghai. We were a little apprehensive having read some negative reviews but found our experience with them quite satisfying. The cabin crew were very obliging and helpful and there was surprisingly good leg room. We were able to get an emergency exit aisle seat on two of the sectors without having to pay extra - this was a nice bonus! The seats were adequately comfortable. As for the inflight entertainment there is not as much variety as you may get from more well known airlines but there was enough variety to keep your interest. On the way back we had a 7 hour delay due to an issue with the plane. Although this was annoying we were given meal vouchers to use at Melbourne Airport - the value of these was more then enough for two of us to have two really nice meals! Also when we arrived in Shanghai we were given compensation there as well. Having been delayed before on other airlines it was refreshing to receive adequate compensation as this has not always been offered in the past so it was very pleasing to see how well they dealt with the situation. All in all China Eastern offer good value for money and are worth trying out. The important thing is not to expect an Emirates or Singapore Airlines experience - you are paying about half the price so it won't be to that level. However what you get for the price is very good.

30th Jan Pudong to Thailand returning 8th Feb. Easily the worst airline I've used and I travel weekly by plane. Always late I'd take a 1 hour flight delay every time as that would be an improvement. The 3 reasons given for delays (take your pick) are from 1) Late arrival of incoming flight. 2) Air traffic control or 3) The weather. All of which mask the most basic problem seems no one actually takes responsibility for delivery of a good service.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-BKK A330 SGN-PVG A320. Essentially China Eastern is fine nothing special and a bit rough around the edges. Flight out 30 minutes late flight in an hour late due to PVG ATC (likely congestion due to the Chinese Air Force only allocating 20% of air space to civilian operations so not the staff's fault.) Fairly new planes decent leg room blankets etc. The "meal" in both directions was actually a large showcase of Chinese snack foods. It was interesting to discover "aviation radish" and hickory kernels (actually pretty good and probably some people's idea of heaven) but it's not really a meal. A small selection of beer and wine on the first round - this had disappeared on subsequent drink rounds. IFE consisted of surprisingly good audio channels (bring your own headphones as theirs were no good.) PVG is quite an efficient if pricey (for China) airport but transferring is a pain as you now have to clear immigration customs and check-in again (count two hours). Glad I had a code share for the long haul legs of my journey - I won't be queuing up to fly them again but they're fine if I have to.

December 2013 flew to Australia via Shanghai to return 3 weeks later the flights were all on time the business class seats were great and to be able to lay flat was such a bonus. The food was fantastic and the service on all flights was first class very impressed and would fly with them again.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Return flight from Los Angeles to New Delhi (India). Read many mixed reviews and against my better judgement decided to give them a chance. That was one chance too many. On international flights (over 22 hours) you expect a few things i.e. USB or AC charger a working video screen and/or audio somewhat edible airline food and most of all decent treatment. They failed in all categories. Rudest staff I have ever encountered. Avoid at all costs.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Although cheap from Los Angeles to Shanghai and then to Melbourne a flight time of 25 gruelling hours. The cabin crew looked miserable and didn't make much effort so I felt hesitant to ask for anything. I did ask for an extra bread roll as I was starving and was given a flat out no. Nothing alcoholic worth drinking but wish I'd brought snacks. The movies and all wording on the entertainment screens was Chinese. Not very helpful if you are not Chinese. The first plane didn't even have that option. Just a drop down from the ceiling TV screen like in the 1970's. Not impressed at all.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
My flights were from Melbourne to Shanghai Shanghai to Vancouver Vancouver to Shanghai and Shanghai to Melbourne. I was impressed with this airline and flights were all on time on A330-300 planes with individual large screens and great leg room. The hostesses were friendly and always happy to top up my water bottle. The meals were fine as good as or as bad as any other airline but if your looking for alcohol there isn't much available. Before arrival a video takes you through a tai chi workout to get the body moving again. I wouldn't hesitate to fly China Eastern again.

JFK to PVG on Dec 7 and back on Dec 29. Having read many negative comments my experience was in fact quite positive. Both flights were on time despite smog in Shanghai. Flight attendants were friendly and service were good. Meal choice included beef rice or chicken noodle freshly made canned beer was available. Entertainment was less than desired as there was no individual TV panel and little flight information was given. On return trip I was sick with flu symptoms. Staff very kind and helpful offered hot water napkin and ice bags. Overall I had very good experience will definitely fly with this airline again.

Melbourne to Shanghai return. Melbourne Lounge is Qantas Business Lounge. Quite good. Aircraft on both legs is brand new A330-300. Lie flat beds Fair inflight entertainment. Wine/beer/spirits selection is poor. Food is good though. Left and arrived on time. Shanghai Lounge is appalling. Warm beer no wine at all terrible food most uncomfortable chairs imaginable no business areas uses airport wifi which is out of range. Don't bother going to this lounge - find a restaurant/bar upstairs. Apart from this lounge overall package was most impressive and good vale for money. On board product is very good.

Four flights with the airline: one way from Vancouver to Shanghai-Hong Kong-Shanghai-Paris. Outbound trip in economy to Hong Kong was the complete opposite of what I expected. It was a brand-new Airbus with individual seat- back televisions and a range of good movies with subtitles pleasant smiling courteous flight attendants a regular supply of water periodic meals that were of average airline quality best of all a comfortable economy- class seat with decent legroom. After the Shanghai layover of several hours the flight to HK was exactly like WestJet or Air Canada: on-time followed by brisk friendly in-flight service of complimentary refreshments. My luggage arrived in HK promptly. My ongoing flight to Paris several weeks later was a true test of an airline’s customer service. I had severely sprained my ankle in HK mere hours before the flight. At HK airport China Easterns check-in crew volunteered a wheelchair before I even asked then short-cut me through immigration and security and wheeled me directly to the boarding gate even offering to help me shop at duty-free en route. During the flight to Shanghai an attentive attendant asked if I wanted a wheelchair waiting for me there. Again I was pushed in a wheelchair through immigration and security to my Paris flight which had all the creature comforts of the outbound one from Vancouver plus the flight attendant found some Ibuprofen for me. She also arranged for a wheelchair to take me through the labyrinthine Paris airport through customs right to the taxi queue. China Eastern has my gratitude and vote of approval. I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-HRB connecting from an Air France flight from Paris. China Eastern claimed that business class bookings on Air France are economy on their system and failed to connect one of the travellers tickets so there was no seat for him. Checking in for the return leg China Eastern: Denied that we existed. Claimed the ticket had been cancelled. Admitted that it existed but that there were only 3 people travelling. Found the third but claimed that as his name was spelt one letter wrongly on the reservation he would not be allowed to fly - this despite them flying him from Shanghai to Harbin! Diabolical.

My flight from Sydney to New York was grounded in Hangzhou for 5 hours due to smog. They had run out of food supplies to distribute. The flight then stops at Shanghai Airport where we were told to stay overnight at a hotel (as we had missed our connecting flight) and that we would be on the next flight to New York (which was the next day). Arrive at the airport to be told we were only on a waiting list (due to a backlog of delays) despite being promised by the "supervisor" that we were guaranteed seats on the flight. Staff members were incredibly unwilling to help. Avoid at all costs.

Flew Economy on BKK-PVG-FRA and return. The ticket price was very cheap. Seat Pitch is okay PVG airport Terminal 1 is a bit soul less and don't expect to find much to keep you busy but transfer was okay food on the aircraft is bad but edible if needed. Suggest that you stock up before the flight. IFE was okay on the A330 not excellent but fair the short haul fleet has no such service except for overhead monitors. No amenity sets handed out so take your tooth brush with you. Drink choice includes beer and wine "made in china" and soft drinks. No spirits. Flights were on time and check in and boarding was normal. All in all it is a bit like an LCC flight with only basic service features. Baggage allowance is very generous even so I did not take advantage of it. Service was not brilliant but I guess okay by Chinese Standards command of English is basic. All in all exactly how I expected it to be.

MEL to LHR via Shanghai. No problem at all. On time and on budget! Requested and received exit row seat. Food and entertainment were fine. The transiting procedure in Shanghai was clunky and slow. That was the only (minor) frustration. Ticket was 60 percent of other carriers. It worked for me!

Flew MU220 FRA-PVG in C on 19th Dec. Despite all bad comments about MU I have to say that they have a superb C- Class product with very comfortable lie-flat-seats on that route served with a good looking A330-200. Food was very good. The crew rushed through the service. Some may like it some may not - but because of this there was more time for sleeping. No complaints about IFE very nice noise-reducing headset. Excellent kit by Salvatore F. Flight was on time. Value for money and recommendable. Will have some domestic travel with MU and the return- flight to FRA and hope to get the same nice experience.

Flew Shanghai - Dubai - Shanghai. I have flown over 120000 miles this year and this was by far the worst experience I have had. All the staff were at least indifferent while some where downright rude there was confusion on one flight where we were given boarding passes for seat numbers that did not exist this happened to other passengers on the same flight. Last part of flight delayed by over 4 hours with no apologies from the flight crew.

We flew from Vancouver to Shanghai then Shanghai to Bangkok. The plane from YVR was new. 10" TV's with a huge selection of free on demand movies in English as well as games music and other entertainment. There's also a plug for your laptop under your seat and a USB port near the screen. The food was plentiful. Service was fast and efficient. I have nothing bad to say about this airline. From Shanghai the flight to Bangkok was just as good although no on demand entertainment. This was fine as it was only a 3.5 hour flight and I had my laptop with me. Plenty of leg room on both flights.

The worst airline I've flown! My trip was from SGN to PVG and it was delayed for more than an hour but without any advanced notice. The cabin crew appeared too tired to welcome passengers on board without a smile. They announced breakfast would be served after taking off it was some nuts water cracker biscuit - and they called it breakfast. No one cleaned the rubbish up! The first time during turbulence that I'd heard the crew said "We are in turbulence but don't worry we will be landing soon" so ridiculous! Please re-consider if you decide to fly with this airline unless you cannot find any other option.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Avoid this airline! I was flying in early October from Beijing to Dhaka. This is supposed to be a direct flight with short stop in Kunming only to refill the plane. Well it was definitely not true in Kunming we had to leave even the transit area and go through all checks again. There were no staff to move our baggage. They decided to leave the baggage behind but were lying about this. I had connecting flights and received baggage only two days later of course without any apologies. The staff were rude and food was terrible.

We were quite worried about this airline after reading all the reviews but were pleasantly surprised at our experience. We left from SFO flew to Shanghai then to Osaka and had very good service and on time planes the entire round trip. The food was good and plentiful the attendants were always serving water and responded immediately to peoples' needs and the in-flight entertainment was excellent. We would recommend China Eastern Airlines to others.

Flight from Shanghai Pudong (PVG) to Sydney Kingsford Smith (SYD). It may have been our luck rather than fault of the airline as the plane was packed with mainland Chinese lack of education or understanding and customs: This flight was rated 'miserable' for us as the elderly behind us bashed our seat forward and refused to communicate. The food served was poor and close to 'inedible' unless you are really hungry. I'm not a drinker on the flight but I did overheard disappointments on lack of alcohol. Our flight attendants had a lack of positive attitude and all seemed to appear a bit grumpy. About 50 minutes before arrival I was using my iPhone on airplane mode and was demanded to shut it down. Meanwhile there was an iPad in action in front of me and this was completely ignored. Not strictly Eastern China related but Airbus A330-200 is not suitable to fly long distance (9 hours flight) as it is too small believed to experience stronger turbulence (this was a bumpy ride) and virtually no Inflight Entertainment. Final words we have decided to never fly with Eastern China for the time been as (luckily) competition is strong and we have plenty of options between these 2 cities.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Unfortunately I do not believe that China Eastern Airlines lives up to the expectations of a "Full Service International Carrier". Even as a cost-effective carrier they fall short of the mark in my estimations. We recently travelled to Shanghai from Sydney on MU562 and returned approximately ten days later on MU727. On the outward flight we were at least presented with an aircraft that had rear seat entertainment facilities however the inward flight provided nothing more than drop down screens and sub-titled movies. Refreshments were scarce unless you wanted Sprite Coke Water or Orange Juice. Alcoholic beverages were nigh on non-existent. On the inward flight I couldn't eat the breakfast provided as it was neither aesthetically pleasing tasty nor appetising. Seat space on the aircraft to Shanghai was much better than on the return leg because of the intrinsic design of the seat back. Service was a little off-hand with basic questions. Not an airline that I would be in a hurry to use again or recommend to anyone else.

MU598 YVR-PVG NOV 9 2013. MU5129 PVG-PEK NOV 10 2013. MU597 PVG-YVR NOV 17 2013. At check in I requested and was granted the window emergency exit seats. As I boarded I was greeted by flight attendants. I usually board last to avoid crowds. I was given instructions for the exit seat soon after I put away my bag and settled. FAs bowed as the in-flight announcement progressed. Drinks were served the food had taste but the rice was kept in the heater for too long and has lost form. The second meal was "breakfast" and I received congee. It was actually good lots of ginger and was refreshing. The tray was taken away without a long wait. Lavatories were cleaned quite frequently. Since I had the exit seat there were a lot of flatness in front of me. I ended up sleeping on the ground and apparently nobody really cared. (I was told not to on the return flight so I guess it depended on who the flight crew were). The seat could recline well. The domestic (PVG to PEK) flight was a similar experience though there was only drinks as it was only a 2-hour flight. The return flight was a similar experience except I did not take the first meal. Overall there was zero delays including the domestic flight on a rainy Sunday morning. The returning flight was actually early.

I booked a flight on the KLM website for Amsterdam-Shanghai. Only after booking I noticed that it had an AF flight number but was operated by China Eastern member of the SkyTeam. The flight to Shanghai over Paris was so-so (food very bad and worst of all the cabin was all but clean next to the window chair the dirt (nuts paper dust etc etc) was still there from previous flights. The flight from Shanghai to Paris was even worse. The food was flatly awful. The crew left the light on (only slightly dimmed) during the night flight (since when do people sleep at night with lights on?) crew was nowhere to be seen in business class until 2 hours before landing one (way too) small bottle of water. I requested another one and they told me that there was no more!. During the flight there were no snacks (what was offered was so unattractive and small that you wonder where they got this). The English of the staff is not good at all. This was by far the worst Business class flight in many years of flying. SkyTeam do something its hurting your reputation.

Nov 14th my flight from Chengdu to Shanghai PVG was delayed 1.5 hours. I missed my flight from Shanghai to Toronto because of this.

I was told to be at the airport at 11 am the next morning to arrange a new flight schedule. I got to the airport at 10.30 and went over to the supervisor's desk and was rudely told that China Eastern was not responsible for any of the issues from the delayed flight.

Kuala Lumpur to Vancouver (via Shanghai) and return I purchased this ticket because it was the cheapest among all other airlines. The flights from Shanghai to Vancouver and return were on time and the food they served quite ok (except for the breakfast). Their cabin crew were a little impolite when you ask them in English but if you speak in Mandarin you could actually see a positive change in their attitude. I remembered asking them for a drink in English and one of the cabin crews asked me to get it by myself. But when I used mandarin and asked them in the same manner I got a free refill of my bottle and a wider smile. The comfort of the seat (Shanghai to Vancouver) was good the leg room is quite big. I will go for this airline again on my next visit for the price I paid I think it's value for money. The plane is new the inflight entertainment system has a touch-screen function with a few good movies and relaxation music.

I fly from SFO to PVG (Shanghai) at least once a year for the past 10 years. This is by far the worst in terms of food and amenities. During service for first round of drinks and peanuts the staff did not provide napkins and no I wasn't skipped by accident. The food quality is terrible. What was served was worse than a $2 meal you can get in Shanghai. The rice was hard fish beef chicken all dried out. If you want soft drinks instead of a can you get about 2/3 of a small cup. Selection is extremely limited no ginger ale only 1 kind of beer. Only recommend if this is the cheapest flight you can find. You really get what you pay for in this case. The seats are probably the hardest ever for me on a plane. Only highlight is the inflight entertainment you do get a good selection of movies to choose from.

Myself and 3 others flew business class Melbourne Australia and Rome return via Shanghai. We had no issues apart from a 30 minute delay leaving Melbourne (you can get delayed longer on Qantas) and a 1 hour delay leaving Rome on the return flight. The whole trip we couldn't have been more pleased with both the service and inflight experience for the whole journey. The cabin attendants were excellent the plane was relatively new with the seating arrangements being great. I'm a regular flyer for business and have had worse experiences on some of the better known companies such as Virgin Cathay Pacific and United Airlines. Food was excellent and we all agreed that we would fly China Eastern again.

Oct 30 2013. Flight MU756 from Kunming to Shanghai was delayed for about 2 hours. Passengers were informed the delay was to wait for a few late passengers. Consequently I missed the flight from Shanghai to Vancouver because of the delay. Whoever at China Eastern made the decision to wait for late passengers without considering the connecting flight passengers should be fired. At least four connecting flight passengers were affected and missed the flight to Vancouver.

Excellent value! I flew from Melbourne to Shanghai then later from Shanghai to San Francisco. I rode on a new A330 both ways so the seats were still clean and cushy. Best inflight meals I've ever had. The vegetables still had life and color to them unlike the sodden overcooked mess you find on United Continental (pre-merger) and Delta. The service was professional though a little rough around the edges. A wide selection of movies in both English and Chinese kept me entertained the whole way. I played some of the educational games too. The crash course in Mandarin proved very useful while I was out and about in Shanghai. The music selection was lousy but then most passengers bring their own music anyway.

Flew PVG-LAX MU 586/583. This is my second experience on China Eastern and like the first it was a good experience. Both flights were on time the check in staff and flight attendants were polite and efficient and the airplane was clean. Both these flights were on A340-600 planes that CE has already scheduled for replacement they were fairly old and did not have VOD but they were reasonably comfortable. The price I paid was incredibly low and was a real bargain. This is not a 5 star airline but a whole lot better than any of the US carriers crossing the Pacific and I recommend them.

Check in for flight from JFK to Shanghai en route to Beijing was chaotic at best. Traveling with a group of 20 folks afforded us the benefit of special check in lane that began lining up hours before check-in processing started. Seat assignments were not made prior to check-in and members of our group traveling together were seated in the very last rows of the aircraft even though we were nearly first in line. Luggage was checked through to Beijing but mine did not arrive until the 2nd day after my arrival in China. Inflight only one or two bottles of wine were aboard for the entire 200 plus passengers very limited beer none after the first round of drinks early in the flight and none available for purchase throughout the remainder of the flight. Connection to domestic flight in Shanghai boarded on time but remained at the gate for nearly one hour. Return flight from Shanghai to JFK ticketing and check-in was better organized and flight was a repeat of prior flight. This is not the level of service I expected for transcontinental flights. Departure lounges not available at either JFK or in China.

April 2013 my wife and I flew China Eastern from Phnom Penh-Shanghai-Los Angeles. All flights were on time comfortable and very good service. Value for money was outstanding. It was amusing to experience the new and outstanding Shanghai airport and compare it with the rundown tacky LA airport. I can't imagine the surprise of first time Chinese traveller who visits the World's richest country and finds themselves scurrying about the run- down LA terminal. Note: transiting through Shanghai requires 1.5 to 3 hours time because there is no transit lounge. Instead one must check in anew and the airport is vast.

Flew from Shanghai to Osaka on China Eastern on 10/9/13. It was OK at best. The check in was total chaos. The check in line was determined by where you were traveling. The line I entered had about 200 people yet only 4 check-in desks working. Furthermore people were constantly cutting the line with no retort from the agents. It made me realize just how efficient the US and European airlines have become with the check in process. The check in agent and the fight attendants were fine. However the gate agents said nothing as they took the boarding pass. The flight itself was OK. The seats were very tight in coach. The only bright spot was the breakfast served in coach was the equivalent of a First Class breakfast in the US. The flight was on time. This experience with China Eastern was mediocre at best.

Night flight from Cambodia (Phnom Penh) to Shanghai Pudong. In contradiction to our flight from Shanghai to Siem Reap (which was not so good but still more or less ok) there were no blankets pillows earphones or decent food. Aside from one nice lady (who really tried her best) the total crew were rude uninterested and unprofessional. The food: some dry cookies of poor quality a mini cold "rubber" hotdog. No taste at all. Drinks were not cooled. They served only half full cups of water/tea/fruit juice which made me conclude that they didn't have enough on board so I chose a full can of warm beer. Then they show a movie but of course no earphones available. The chairs were uncomfortably closer than with our flight to Siem Reap (my knees blocking chair in front of me) and I'm only 1m 85.

Flew MU524 (NRT-PVG) A330. Check-in was smooth and quick at NRT. Boarding was easy as the cabin was quite empty. IFE was good with a good selection of films etc for this short flight. The chair was comfortable and I tried it out in the reclined position too. The chair doesn't lie flat but enough for a comfortable sleep if needed. Food was of good quality and staff spoke English with good service skills. I would fly MU again.

Flew the domestic route Shanghai Hongqiao to Wuhan. The plane was delayed 2 hours without explanation. They gave out very sweet drinks in the departure lounge after about an hour. I think that there have been delays pretty much every time that I've ever used this airline. Quite an old plane but it seemed to be in good condition. It was only a 1 hour flight so only drinks were served; no food or entertainment but the staff were quite friendly.

Sept 29 2013. I booked a flight with this airline from Shenyang to Qingdao scheduled to fly at 6.25pm. Around 6pm they told us there was delay until further notice. We waited at the airport for 5 hours. People started complaining and then they said it was due to bad weather. Because of pressure from passengers staff at Shenyang airport agreed to provide hotel accommodation for us upon arrival in Qingdao. After having a flight delayed for 5 hours and being promised accommodation nobody picked us up at the airport. Will not take this airline again.

We flew China Eastern as part of a package Tour with a Nexus Holidays. The fight was from Sydney to Beijing via Shanghai. The food was good and drinks (beer/wine) was available on request although friends who traveled on an earlier flight said that they only received one beer for the whole trip. We ignored the movie as it was a small screen set in the ceiling and you risked a stiff neck watching it. Seats were uncomfortable for such a long trip and we had over an hour delay at Shanghai airport most of it sitting in the plane with poor air conditioning before our connecting flight took off for Beijing. On the connecting flight to Beijing the in-flight movie was once again on a small screen in the ceiling but this time we were not supplied with a headset so it was pointless. Our return flight to Sydney was from Shanghai food was OK but if you were seated in the middle of the plane and wanted a wine or beer with your meal - bad luck - they ran out half way through the service. The Steward told me that they only had four bottles of wine to serve among all passengers and only a dozen small cans of beer. I guess the point I am trying to make here is that China Eastern promote themselves as a full service airline - not a budget one however you get the feeling that it is bordering on a budget carrier. Would we fly with them again? I don't think so this was a one-off package tour for us to experience a trip to China and as we always arrange our own travel I would rather pay that little bit extra and enjoy a more comfortable and full service flight.

Kunming to Chengdu 26 September. Good points: 3 week old 737-800 with passably comfortable seats that reclined and had ample leg room. Food and drink provided for a flight just over an hour long although being a vegetarian the ham sandwich was not to my taste. Bags waiting on the carousel - beware the long walk that characterises modern Chinese airports. Bad points: Twice the price of the outbound flight though to be fair it was a peak time departure (1630). An hour late leaving with no explanation other than the incoming plane was delayed; probably weather related with the after effects of Typhoon Usagi creating havoc generally - the weather at Chengdu was particularly inclement - so why not say so? Failure to control carried-on luggage resulted in chaotic boarding the overhead lockers full with little more than half the passengers onboard - again beware if travelling in China pretty much anything and everything irrespective of size is brought into the cabin. In summary OK a far higher standard than any European airline would provide but I've had better in China notably Sichuan Airlines.

Gets you from A to B at reasonable price but not an experience to be repeated too often. Flew Singapore to Vancouver with Shanghai change. Food was barely edible. Choice of drinks very limited. Out of 4 USB tried only 2 worked and headphones crackled too much to enjoy movies. Hope the aircraft maintenance is better.

My flight started with a 3 hour delay in Korea and therewith I missed my connecting flight in Shanghai. China Eastern put me on a new flight however I had to transfer airports the expenses that came with this transfer were on me. The employee however told me that I would be upgraded to business on my new flight. Once I arrived at Pudong I was informed that my new connecting flight was delayed which was already known the day before. Later on the evening the flight was cancelled. After a struggle with staff nobody spoke English and after some effort I was able to have them call someone for me I was able to get on another airline however I was put in the worst seat at the back of the plane with a seat that did not recline. On my return flight I had to change airports again from Pudong to Hongqiao. Upon arrival at Hongqiao I was denied access to the airport because the airport closes at midnight! On my flight to my destination: China Eastern put me on a flight that was delayed without informing me did not give me the choice to take a flight the next day promised an upgrade but did not actually give it put me on a flight and caused me a 7 hour delay creates additional transportation costs between airports has staff that does not speak English. On my flight back: does not notify passengers about delays while boarding time has passed and the airplane has not even arrived yet offers flights with a transfer between airports while the airports closes does not offer the transfer between the airports does not inform the passengers that the airport closes does not offer accommodation nor compensation for any of this. My advice: avoid this airline.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I will never use this airline again. We had a 10 hour flight. There was no entertainment except for a small monitor at the front of the economy cabin showing an Asian movie with subtitles. No screen on back of seats. A long flight and not much water supplied. Food was terrible and not much anyhow. No salt or pepper sachets. We asked for a glass of wine and were shocked to receive a tiny amount (about 40mls or 3 tablespoonfuls) at the bottom of a plastic cup when we complained we were told there is "only one bottle for the whole plane". At dinner no wine was offered to anyone so I assume this is true. Ten hours on a long flight with no entertainment not much water terrible food and virtually no wine little English spoken by staff is torture.

Flight from PVG to NRT on A321. I have read many negative comments on China Eastern and was a bit worried. Check- in was fast and staff very friendly. The lounge was rather poor. Also boarding was slightly chaotic but once on board all was fine. The business class seats offered quite some space. Food was good drinks ok. IFE not existent but who needs this for a 2.5hr flight anyway. Overall a nice experience.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
On my return flight from Denpasar through Shanghai to Osaka the flight was delayed out of Bali for an hour with absolutely no information there was a gate change with no information and we had to clear immigration in China collect our bags check them back in and re-clear immigration. All in it was pretty annoying especially considering I had arrived at the airport after midnight for a 3.40am flight. But these irritations aside I found the service prompt and friendly the food about as exciting as I have had on any other airline and the value for money exceptional. Of course a trip across the Pacific on a new A380 is more comfortable but for short and medium haul flights this airline is not incomparable to what other full service airlines have to offer for the same length hauls. It is ridiculously cheap. Return from Japan to Bali on a full service airline cost me less than a flight from Australia to New Zealand (half the distance) on a budget airline where I have to pay for my own luggage food and drinks and entertainment whilst sitting on a hard faux leather chair with my knees under my ear lobes. I don't know what people expect when they are practically flying for free but I thought China Eastern was wonderful given the price!

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Unfriendly check in. No knowledge or desire to seat passengers comfortably. This leads to getting on to a half empty flight and discovering people are packed in to the middle rows when half the other rows are empty. Delays - almost never leave on time. Communication about delays is poor/non-existent. Stewardesses often with very little English skills. Their programming is to simply follow a checklist. Abysmal food. Eat before you get on or take your own food. Many planes arriving in Shanghai supposedly their "home airport" get met with buses. Poor thin seats with little padding and minimal recline. Dirty toilets. Entertainment system or lack of. No in-seat entertainment. Small dropdown screens every 5th row with subtitles too small to read. Don't think business is better. MU business is maybe on par with other airlines economy in terms of food and entertainment. Complete lack of understanding of service culture. If service is important to you avoid MU.

China Eastern was a great option for a cheap flight. Flight from Vancouver to Dubai. First leg Vancouver to Shanghai was a brand new plane with great inflight service. Next leg was Shanghai to Kunming and then on to Dubai. Plane was a little older but still in good shape. Inflight service was very good. I was a little scared when I first read the comments but then realized that some people just love to complain.

ICN-PVG-WUH. Our flight was suddenly changed 1 day before scheduled departure. It was a pain to get in touch with the airlines and make rearrangements. Then flight was delayed 4 hrs - originally at 10pm but left at 2am. Had to stay in airplane with no air conditioning and with bad service. Food was horrible.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Phnom Penh-Shanghai-Tokyo. Food on both flights was awful. Baggage was not checked through despite flying China Eastern all the way and so had to endure a tortuous transit procedure at Shanghai. Flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was delayed 1.5 hours. Reason given was Air traffic control. Both planes were old. The headrest could not be adjusted and stuck into my back making it very uncomfortable. Worst of all was the temperature inside economy class on the second flight. It must have been close to 30 degrees inside the cabin. Clearly something wasn't working properly but no explanation of apology given. I complained to one staff member who just said "mmm yes it is a bit hot isn't it. First time flying China Eastern and almost certainly the last.

My husband and I travelled on MU551 from LHR-PVG and 3 days later on MU561 from PVG-SYD. The trip from London was fine the A330 plane was near new seats not that comfy but ok. The food was fine not western but it is a Chinese airline. Entertainment was good choice of films not great but enough. Flight attendants appeared aloof but came regularly around the cabin with water. No bar service apart from red wine. Flight from Shanghai to Sydney was also ok - an older plane with drop down screens and subtitled movies. Staff again appeared aloof however served water regularly again no bar service except limited red wine. Food was not brilliant. The worse thing was the Chinese passengers who would not follow instructions from the cabin staff! A couple of things to bear in mind - The Chinese do not deal with strangers well whether Chinese or Western even if it is there job to do so it is there culture not to smile at people they do not know. A lot of comments have been about lack of alcohol well this is a Chinese airline the Chinese culture is not a big drinking culture white wine is uncommon and spirits only for the wealthy. All in all the staff were polite but had a job to do which they take very seriously. I think one has to remember this is not a western airline and the main thing is they get you from a to b safely. Both flights were on time.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I will never be flying them again. I did not run into a single polite staff member. Yes there was the typical "hello" when getting on the plane and of course the asking of "what do you want to drink? but I rarely saw a smile. One of my flights was delayed 3 hours! However I didn't know it was delayed until it was close to the take off time and the screen above me finally read that it was delayed an hour. Another hour later it was delayed another hour. Another hour later it was still delayed. Not a single apology was given to passengers. Not even on the plane. On top of that I missed my next flight. Do not recommend.

Flight MU738 Melbourne to Shanghai and connecting with MU5186 to Beijing - 19th July 2013. Aircraft clean seats comfortable our attendants courteous food satisfying and delicious and the service was great. Variety of movies and in-flight entertainment was second to none on the leg to Shanghai but on the leg to Beijing we had a drop down screen and with no headphones the subtitles were too small to read so I read a book. This was our first trip overseas and we were glad there were no delays.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Our return leg from Shanghai to Melbourne was as good as our flight over. We travelled on flight MU737 on 28th July. We had the same type of aircraft as on the forward leg and were once again extremely pleased with the aircraft meals service and in-flight entertainment. We even managed to get a reasonable amount of sleep in Economy class and our flight was punctual.

MU 5030 was to depart Bali (DPS) at 3.40am on July 22 and arrive Shanghai (PVG) at 9.45am. Without notifying anyone the flight departed at 7.10am. MU5030 left Bali at 7.00am and arrived at 1.15pm in Shanghai July 22nd. I missed my scheduled flight to Los Angeles MU 583 as it departed at 1.00pm. About 20 perturbed travelers that missed their connecting flights all stood around for nearly 1.5 hrs waiting for a van ride to a hotel. My next days flight on 23 July went smoothly departed Shanghai at 1.00pm and landed in Los Angeles at 10.30. This business class flight to Bali and back to LA was about $4200. The next least expensive was about $1000 more. You get what you pay for.

Seoul (ICN) from Calcutta via China 18-22 July 2013. Itinerary as follows: CCU (MU556) - Kunming (MU747) - Shanghai (MU5033) - Seoul and return as follows: Seoul (MU2034) - Qingdao (MU5437) - Kunming - CCU (MU555). The best flights given the value for money. All flights were on time except flight MU5437 from Qingdao to Kunming (return journey). This flight has a history of arriving late. In my case it arrived 1 hour late. Inflight staff were cordial given extra snacks and drinks. Overall highly recommended.

Travelled with family of 4 from New Delhi to San Francisco and return. With the type of fare I got it was quite comfortable and may be the shortest time between these sectors. Only problem I faced while going was Vegetarian food that my family did not receive at all. I checked with my agent and LA office on my return flight for Asian Vegetarian that I really enjoyed. If food is served as per needs I think one of the finest flights with this kind of budget. I will refer to friends with a caution for food instructions so that Vegetarian lovers do not suffer.

Shanghai Pudong to Singapore a mid haul trip of 5 hours. Unlike all my previous experiences with China Eastern's old aircraft's this was a brand new airbus A300. The business class seat featured full flat beds ample space and very attentive service by the attendants. There was decent inflight entertainment with large touch screen TV. I would highly recommend this flight for this sector in the new airbus since the cost is even less than a Singapore Airlines economy ticket. The same cannot be said of the older China Eastern Boeing 767.

YVR (Canada) to CMB (Colombo) through PVG (Shanghai). There is really no respect for passengers. They cancelled our connection flight and wanted us to catch another plane going from Hongqiao airport (1 hr on the road) - help desk mentioned about a shuttle service but no clear indication given where I could find the shuttle bus. You have to transfer with all your baggage and then check in again having to stand in many queues throughout the journey.

SYD-PVG in economy. Not what I was expecting. Previous MU flights have been on newish planes with tight legroom and no individual IFE. This flight was on a brand-new A330. There were very big individual TV screens with a great user interface and very clear screens. The choice of films wasn't huge but it was varied and it was easy to find something good. The headphones aren't great - you'll need a two-pin adapter to use your own ones. There was lots of legroom and the seats were the type that slide forward to recline. This is really important on a flight into China as people recline as far as they can; the person in front of me reclined all the way but this did not impinge on my space. Food was OK - not spectacular but better than I expected. Service was friendly and not intrusive: I find some airlines are too insistent on disturbing me to offer me things I don't want but this did not happen on MU.

My wife and two kids traveled from LAX to PVG. There was no way to get seats together before check-in. Agent at LAX was very rude. The boarding process was horrible. Once she boarded the plane she had two middle seats and the third seat was somewhere else. Flight attendants made no attempt to seat them together. We had ordered special vegetarian meals (in advance). They did not have it. If you have any other option don't take this airline.

MU563 Shanghai to Delhi July 5. They boarded the plane and then announced a 2 hour delay. The in-flight service was less than friendly. When I asked for a sandwich it was given to me in my hand in a cheap cling wrap without a plate - this is in Business Class. The entire crew struggled with English communication was very difficult. In Business Class while they had a decent choice of movies the remote used for it was ancient. What really upset me after the final good bye and thank you announcement in Chinese they give a gracious bow with hands folded but there's nothing like that after the English announcement.

Recently returned from a trip to Thailand and had an awful experience with China Eastern Airlines (JFK-PVG-BKK). Before the trip: I spent hours on the phone trying to get hold of a representative to get a seat assignment. No luck. On the outbound segment I missed my connection in JFK (due to a delay from my home city) and could not find a CEA representative anywhere in the terminal. After hours on the phone I was rebooked to a flight the next day. Once I arrived in Shanghai I learned that my flight was cancelled (due to weather not the airlines fault) but the airline could not provide any assistance. A mob of passengers flocked the gate agent. Finally the flight was reinstated for 2.30am but again there was no clear communication and no guaranteed rebooking. In sum total chaos and no help from the airline.

Sydney to Shanghai flight. New clean interiors ok seats food decent but ran out of omelette for breakfast after the first few rows of service. Extremely poor entertainment system so bring your own entertainment. No personal TV screen system so not sure why they had those annoying boxes under almost all seats. There are a few tiny screens above the seats but unless you sit close to these screens you will not be able to see anything and the movies were dubbed into Chinese with English subtitles so anyone that do not understand Chinese would not stand a chance reading the subtitles. Have flown them before and if you get a good deal with them (I did) then I would definitely recommend China Eastern Airlines.

SIN-NKG-TAO MU772 A320 in economy. Takeoff was 30 minutes after scheduled time. No explanation by the crew. Legroom was ok made this midnight flight fairly comfortable. My seat did not have a blanket and pillow and I had to ask for a set. The seat itself was in very good shape other than a loose tray table which was a problem for a lot of people. No TV screens safety procedure was shown to us by the cabin crew. No PTVs something frequent flyers of MU should be used to. Food was nothing out of the ordinary some yoghurt sour cucumber salad fresh fruits and a choice of western or oriental breakfast. Both were OK. Many rounds of beverage services and alcohol readily available. Cabin crew were very friendly though reserved other than a male steward who was very impatient. Not worth the ticket price for such an ordinary airline.

Four domestic flights within China during June. The flights were all on time except the first from Shanghai to Beijing which was delayed for 30 minutes.

Flight LHR-PVG-SYD. Airline cancelled one of the flights leaving me with an overnight stop in Shanghai which admittedly they informed me of in advance and paid for. All the legs were fairly consistently about an hour late. New A330 flat beds from/to London were pretty good; flights to/from Sydney had older angled beds which were much less comfortable. Only one flight had a menu in other cases the cabin staff gave you a minimal description of a limited choice of mediocre food. Western movies were all fairly old - I cannot comment on the Chinese ones. Staff were all very helpful although the English skills of some of them was limited. Overall not a terrible experience but not wonderful and the prices were good. Keep your boarding cards; only one of my sets of air miles appeared without prompting.

Had a terrible flight back from Shanghai - very noisy and food was not good neither was the inflight entertainment. No impressed at all. but I must say that the crew did their best.

Shanghai to Melbourne. The food was awful I asked for a vegetarian meal and the first one was re-heated dried up veggies. The 2nd dinner was a repeat heating of the same. Staff infrequently offered water tea or coffee. The headsets were faulty - full of static. The seats were uncomfortable. Left on the tarmac for 2 hours from Shanghai to Beijing without explanation other than it was a traffic hold-up - we later learned an earlier flight had similar delays.

In late May I flew flight CZ6522 for a mid morning trip from Shanghai to Dalian. The overall experience from check-in up to deplaning was very good. I had flown this route a couple of years ago and noted that the overall service seems to improved over that time. At check-in the very friendly agent was able to provide me the much coveted exit aisle seat so I would have room for my laptop. I then proceed into the modern terminal at Shanghai's Pudong airport. Boarding was on-time quick and efficient. Flight departed late after a long delay on the runway but still managed to arrive on time. During the flight the attendants were friendly and helpful serving a round of beverages and a hot boxed lunch. (one choice Asian menu). The only thing really less than ideal was deplaning by stairs for a bus to the terminal and a long delay for baggage.

My sister and I travelled to Cairns Australia via Shanghai. First leg of the flight for approximately 12 hours from Heathrow to Shanghai. We were offered a drink at the start of the trip. My sister and I both asked for red wine the stewardess poured about an inch of wine in the cup. On the next visit after the meal they had run out of red wine had no beer and no other alcohol on offer! I have never been on a flight where there was no bar service! It was the same on the 3 other flights. The food was atrocious and I'm not a fussy eater. A choice of only 2 meals each time either pork and rice or beef and noodle. On one of the flights there was no choice the fish meal had run out! The staff weren't at all friendly and hardly smiled although the inflight video showed a lovely cup of coffee with very happy staff this wasn't at all what we experienced.

Flew from Matsuyama (MYJ)-PVH-HKG return. All flights outbound were within 15 minutes of being on time and on the way home both were early. The transfer at Shanghai which on the outbound trip involved getting a transit visa to allow me to visit the city was pretty easy. Return transfer was pretty straightforward. Surprised to receive meals on all legs despite them only being around 2 hours long. Presentation of the meals wasn't the best and the quality wasn't great but there was plenty to eat and some of it was pretty decent. Pretty much unlimited free drinks and all but one leg had beer. Ultimately they got me and my luggage there and I got the bonus of a day trip to Shanghai. Staff did their jobs and the planes were clean and some seemed very new. Would have no qualms about booking with them again.

Shanghai-Sydney economy. Dinner was inedible. Wife asked for a red wine and was served a glass of port couldn't get another - alcohol ran out after one drink.

Flew March-April 2013 - 7 times during a 3 week trip including round-trip from LAX-Shanghai and 5 trips within China including Hong Kong-Shanghai (round trip) Shanghai-Beijing Beijing-Xi'an Xi'an-Chengdu. None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated. We did have one recent American film shown but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and flight attendants are plentiful responsive and apologetic. Speaking of the meals the entree is always a meat/brown gravy rice or noodles congealed mass. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yoghurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks/Soft drinks are frequently served but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly. Also an FYI regarding switching off your electronic devices approaching landing - they initiate this process 30-45 minutes before you actually land. Seats were pretty standard for economy but if the person in front of you reclined the pitch was so that it made your tray table unusable.

Flew from Sydney Shanghai on MU562 in economy. I managed to get an exit seat as I am very tall and this was one of only 2 positive things I can say about the flight the other being the perfect landing. The food was very basic chicken with rice and later noodles with pork no vegetables followed by a small fruit salad eaten with plastic cutlery and practically thrown at us by the flight attendant. When drinks trolley came round I asked for a gin and tonic only to be told we have no alcohol in economy to say I was amazed would be an understatement. There are no video screens in the seats and you have to watch whatever appears on the old fashioned wall mounted screens which consisted of 4 foreign movies with subtitles. I know you get what you pay for but this flight did not live up to my expectations of what a modern carrier should be providing.

Recently flew from Shanghai Hongqaio to Qingdao on MU 5525 scheduled to depart at 08.30 am. Flight boarded on time and in common with all Chinese domestic carriers the cabin crew hustled passengers to get their gear into the overhead locker and take ones seat. Doors closed at around 08.25 am then we sat and sat and sat for 5 hours. Reason given was runway congestion at Hongqaio (a constant nightmare at this airport). After about 2 hours the food trolley was rolled out and the boxes containing bread cake and some nuts were handed out along with some drinks. We eventually took off 5 hours later. The 1hr 20 minute flight to Qingdao was uneventful. This is my 11th year of domestic flights in China and its always the same flying north in winter from Hongqaio airport.

London to Sydney via Shanghai and return. All sectors on A330. Full flat bed on 3 sectors older cabin with good recline on Sydney to Shanghai sector. Two sectors on time one with 90 mins delay one with 60 mins - acceptable in my book. Plenty of choice of entertainment even for four long sectors on AVOD. Service from cabin crew was mostly charming and efficient but sometimes let down by difficulty with English. Food was variable but generally very good. Skyteam lounge in LHR very good Qantas lounge in Sydney excellent but China Eastern lounges in Pudong very poor. Overall four very pleasant flights and the flat beds with duvet and pyjamas a nice surprise. Considering the price I paid was equivalent to Premium Economy on BA Virgin or Cathay it was outstanding value for money.

Check-in was uneventful in FRA used the Sakura lounge (JAL). The business class product on this new A330-200 was superb. The business class section is divided in 2 sections: 18 and 12 pax in a 2x2x2 configuration giving a very cosy and warm atmosphere plenty of space. This aircraft is equipped with proper full flat bed. The bed is a good 2 meter long about 50 cm wide (maybe more) the seat fairly wide (although narrower than SQ) which should not be a problem. We had all the amenities you can expect and a very soft comforter and pillow. The food was pretty good. we were offered a pre-dinner drink and a selection of Chinese style or western style food was available. The crew was available during the whole flight at the snap of a finger. The only negative points is that we were rushed through the meal. We had to slow down to make them understand there was no rush! Although the crew was nice trying their best to be polite and use proper English to get understood some lacked the elegance to provide a high standard service. The entertainment system was pretty good a large screen great picture and good selection of movies. Overall it was a very relaxing flight very good value for money in Business Class.

PVG-DPS-PVG on the Airbus 330-200. Proper full flat bed. Good service although rushed through the meal again but we made sure the crew understood we wanted to eat slowly! Very comfy seat providing a good 6 hour rest. On these regional flights you don't get the full onboard amenities but it was ok. The blanket could be longer as it does not fully cover your body when lying down. The crew was nice always trying to help. English is not their strength - but the experience was good. I would fly with them again in business class as their fully flat bed was very comfy.

Beijing to Shanghai on 25th Feb 2013. ETD was 10.00 pm but flight left at 00.30 hrs. Circled around Shanghai for half an hour before being diverted to Hangzhou due to bad weather. Landed Hangzhou 02.30. Door not opened for an hour. Mayhem at counter. Hotels offered at 04.30 and buses for those who wanted to take train to Shanghai as flight was uncertain. This is the third time I have had such an experience with China Eastern and it's sister airline Shanghai Airline. The worst participants in the SkyTeam along with Delta.

Vancouver (YVR) - Xi'an (XIY) via Shanghai Pudong (PVG). Vancover-Shanghai sector was good with a fairly new plane with seat back screens with AVOD and a reasonable range of films games etc. Legroom was probably above average. Dinner was of poor quality though breakfast surprisingly good. Drinks limited in range. Staff polite but not very communicative. By contrast the PVG-XIY sector was horrendous. Our original connecting flight had been cancelled and changed 3 months earlier this flight (from Japan) was delayed then diverted when fog came in. Told to rebook for the next day but there was mayhem at the desks with limited staff unable to cope with increasingly angry crowds. No hotel accommodation provided. Eventually I went back to the desk on a whim and discovered our flight had been reinstated but China Eastern hadn't announced it. We re-checked in and rushed to the gate just in time. Very cheap fares and now we see why.

BKK-KUM. We used this airline because its schedule meshed with ours and the cost was very economical. Luckily we had extra time built into our schedule because the aircraft left BKK over 1 hour late and of course we arrived at KUM more than 1 hour late. Aircraft was an older 737-300 and the cabin showed a lot of ware the rows were placed very close to each other and the plane was full. FA’s were pleasant and seemed to work hard at attending to the passengers needs and serving the meal. The meal was hot be we were not sure exactly what it was except it was supposed to be some type of chicken dish. When we arrived at KUM the aircraft was parked at a remote parking place and all the passengers had to deplane down portable steps and ride very full buses a long way to the terminal and immigration.

KUM–CTU. My wife and I traveled from Kunming to Chengdu to visit the Chengdu Panda Base. We took this airline because it was the best priced option. Our experience with this airline is that no matter what their schedule says they always seem to leave late therefor they always arrive late and this happened on this flight as well. Because it was a late evening flight there was no food service but there was a beverage service. FA’s were efficient in their duties and very helpful to the passengers. Aircraft was a newer 737-800 and appeared to be well maintained. The seats were well spaced and all appointments were well done. When we arrived in Chengdu our gate was not far from the baggage area which was just across from the arrivals area.

SHA-PEK. MU flight operated by FM old 767 aircraft and FM crew. Seat very worn and very uncomfortable. No in-flight entertainment. No food provided only beverage. Delayed by 1 hr. The only good thing is that crew are friendly. Will opt for CA on this route in future.

FRA-PVG-BKK. FRA-PVG flights on time on new and clean A330-200-completely full high season flight but crews were very friendly and attentive. 2x meals Lunch and breakfast were served each with 2 choices (Asian and Western) but this time the drinks offers were limited to soft drink 1 sort of beer and 1 French red wine only. AVOD with over 700 programs of films and games is more than enough. During the night flight crews came around regularly with water and soft drinks. We seated near the WCs and saw that cabin crews often cleaned the WC which was appreciated. Transit at Shanghai Pudong was better organized than last time. Onward flight PVG-BKK on smaller A320 without AVOD (only shared screen) flight full crew pleasant but worse English skills than on Frankfurt leg - Lunch (2 choices of Chinese) again limited drinks offered. Return flights BKK-PVG with 90 minutes delay. After landing in PVG with only 30 minutes of transit time - thanks to escort of CEA ground staff- smooth and quick transfers with immigration and security checks. PVG-FRA on very new A330. After arrival in Frankfurt CEA ground staff told us that our luggage will arrive a day later. Only two minus points - first for food and beverages which have gone down in quantity and quality and second - the slow cabin service. Will use again.

Flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 3rd of February with China Eastern (MU505). Flight was delayed by an hour. However the main issue I had was that half way through the flight the cabin filled with cigarette smoke. When I questioned the attendant she was rude and dismissive refusing to acknowledge what was apparent to everyone in the cabin.

JFK-PVG (Shanghai) round-trip. Onboard I found the flight attendants did not speak English well and were not too interested in doing their jobs. The food choices quality and quantity were not better than my experiences in economy class of other airlines. On the JFK-PVG flight the menu was handed out for dinner and quickly collected back as if they were hiding something. Well they were as I realized on the flight back. After dinner I had to ask about dessert and a small container of ice cream was handed out. I saw a passenger having cheese I asked for it on the trip back and was reluctantly offered it. 8 hours into the flight flight attendants walked around with small sandwiches. The breakfast after this horribly long flight was not memorable and was worse than dinner. The seats are not lie-flat and were not that comfortable for an overnight flight of over 14 hours. Return flight was not much better. The menu was handed out and not collected until near landing time at JFK. Interestingly there were 3 meal services listed (Lunch Light Snack Breakfast) but only 2 were served on this 14.5 hour flight. Again meals were of economy class quality service was slow uneven and not enthusiastic. Beverage service was slow and geared towards minimizing consumption. As far as I could see I was the only one who got the cheese plate because I asked for it and the flight attendant reluctantly complied. Same quality seats as the outbound leg. While Business was really more like Economy Plus in terms of service there is also a small First Class cabin on these flights which appeared to be more comfortable with the lie-flat seats that have become popular on other carriers. A few words about Business class lounges. At JFK it was run by some other airline and was no better or worse than the usual JFK lounge. At Shanghai I would rate the lounge as one of the better ones I have experienced. The beverages and snacks were fine and suitable for the western palate. All in all I would not recommend this airline for business class.

Flew from Wuhan to Xi'an Xianyang. Check-in staff at Wuhan were very rude didn't greet us and literally tossed our documents on the counter at the end. Flight was on a relatively new A320 with comfortable seats. Cabin crew were efficient but not polite and a poor quality meal was served half way through the flight. The fact they serve a meal on such a short flight is a bonus though. Overall standards left a lot to be desired.

KIX-PVG-YVR (return trip) Economy class. 2.5 hour KIX-PVG departed on time and was serviced by a smaller aircraft with "shared" screens but decent content. Transit at PVG was reasonable no real delays to speak of and most staff were at least agreeable (though I wouldn't specifically say friendly). PVG-YVR also departed on time (arrived early in YVR) and was serviced by a larger jet that had individual touch-screens with an optional pop-out console that could be used for navigation. Selection of TV programmes movies and music was quite good and there were a few games to choose from as well. The food was airline food; nothing to really complain about here just standard fare (pretty bland and nothing special though what do you expect on an airplane). Staff were agreeable and came through at regular intervals with water and you could request other beverages as well. No real complaints. Will use them again.

LHR-PDG-DPS in business class on Jan 23/24 2013 on A330's. First leg on a Skyteam branded plane which had a few more rows of business class and was all very new. Seats were fine full lie flat good blankets and toiletries. Entertainment system was fine slightly limited choice. Food was a bit odd you get to select your main and then they serve a whole menu with different starters depending on the main which they hadn't mentioned when you ordered. Dinner served after take off was very good lunch served before landing was just about ok but choice was limited. Cabin staff were great very polite and quick to respond. The second leg was not quite so good it was just under 7 hours so by no means a short hop but they only served a 'snack' and I was very surprised when they said they had no breakfast. The plane on this leg was slightly older and had China Eastern branding blankets were not quite so thick but apart from that it was pretty much the same as the first leg. Staff were ok too. When I originally booked there was a 3 hour stopover in Shanghai but this was subsequently changed to 8 hours. Business class lounge at PDG is pretty ropey bad food uncomfortable chairs and painfully slow WI-FI. The Skyteam lounge at Heathrow is pretty good though. The only other annoyance was that they didn't have any visa on arrival forms for Indonesia which meant we had to find them when we arrived and then scrabble around for pens. The other thing is that it is impossible to choose your seats before you get to the airport which is pretty unusual in this day and age but having said that they did honour the request on my booking for a window and an aisle together. All in all a 6 out of 10 experience and actually one minor benefit of the changed arrival time is that you avoid the terrible traffic in Denpasar. Could easily be improved by more modern web booking system more food on the Bali hop and perhaps a slightly wider choice of meals. But then it is a lot cheaper than anybody else for this journey.

Flew from Seoul to Dhaka return via Shanghai Hongqiao and Kunming. The price was less than half of any competitor's price. I was pretty satisfied with this airline. The airplanes were modern and clean. The English level of the staff was not high but they were quite friendly and efficient. The food was reasonably good but only Chinese style food was available. The flight out of Dhaka was over an hour late departing and so I missed the connection in Kunming but the staff in Kunming were friendly and reasonably efficient in arranging another flight for the following day and a free night's accommodation in Kunming. No entertainment was available but that doesn't bother me. I don't really have any complaints about this airline.

Return Sapporo to Singapore via Shanghai. I chose China Eastern for the price. Overall I have no huge complaints. The worst part of the flight was transferring in Shanghai but CEA can't really be blamed for that. Most of the flight attendants were relatively polite. I was however not impressed with the food. On the first flight the meal was almost inedible. On the second leg the longest of the two they only gave us a snack pack with a variety of packaged snack foods. Hot meals were offered on both the return flights but they were also pretty bad. The drink selection is also very limited. There is no personal entertainment system that most of us frequent international flyers are used to. There is just a screen a few rows ahead showing Chinese TV shows with subtitles. As it was a night flight and each leg was relatively short it wasn't a problem. Seeing as CEA fulfilled their basic obligation which was to get me to my destination safely while charging almost 300USD less than any other airline I would possibly fly them again. But if I needed to take a flight longer than 5 hours I'd definitely spend the extra cash and choose a different airline.

JFK to Bangkok via Shanghai. We are a family of 4 so the price difference was significant. Had a pleasant experience and encountered no major issues. Biggest challenge was going through China but if you can handle the slow processing and tight security then this airline will serve your needs. Flight attendants were laid back but were nice enough and were helpful when asked. Food was adequate and included fresh fruit. On the flight over there were sandwiches and drinks available throughout the flight at the back of the plane in addition to the regular drinks and meals served. Warm wash cloths were passed out for freshening up. were Not many entertainment screens but most passengers had iPads or laptops for entertainment. The seats were no different than any other economy class seat we have travelled in. Don't expect luxury perfection or extreme efficiency but the price makes any cultural differences worth the ticket price.

Hong Kong to Honolulu via Pudong mid December 2012. Inflight service was terrible as was the food. The crew on board were aloof and a couple of times when I asked for a drink of water I was told to get it from the rear of the aircraft. Even for long haul flights they do not provide snacks other than nuts - even then you have to ask for them. What is more outrageous was their refusal to provide a spare US Immigration form to one of the passengers who had messed it up. Very few of those passengers who boarded at Pudong read or write Chinese let alone English so completing that form was a real challenge. The passenger behind me needed a new one and was told to get it at the Immigration hall at the Honolulu airport. The inflight service on the way back was likewise poor. The plane arrived 2 hours late at Pudong and no explanation or apologies. I will never fly this airline again.

OKA-FRA return - A332. Aircraft was ok reasonably clean however female staff were rude (male counterparts were friendly and helpful). Flight-out was pushed-back 1 day approximately 2 weeks before departure. Flights departed/arrived on-time. Food wasn't great but we flew Domestic so you get what you pay for. Getting a transit ticket in Shanghai was crazy. Almost missed leg from Shanghai to Naha (Okinawa) as gate change was not announced until we asked why our flight was not on the board at the gate originally assigned (gate attendant gave us a dirty look and no answer when we asked why the gate change was not announced earlier). Overall experience (relative to the ticket price which is considerably less than the competition) is acceptable.

Shanghai to Rome on December 20. No online check-in system and no controls at the SkyTeam Priority check- in area where I had to queue for 15 minutes. VIP lounge is below standards and my flight was not called so I was late at the gate. No in-flight entertainment system and the variety and quality of food was poor. A good note is that the quality and friendliness of the staff has improved possibly a sign that the overall level of service will follow.

CJU-PVG-SYD. New 737-800 from Jeju to Shanghai (economy) no food or IFE but it was only a 50 minute flight so that was alright seat decent for a 737 and service was nothing out of the ordinary. Business class lounge at PVG was a bit small and old the hot food section at the buffet was cold. PVG-SYD was on an A330 with lie-flat seats. Lots of movie choices on the IFE and the food was excellent. Flight attendant service was great. Would fly China Eastern again if I had the chance.

OKA-PVG-CDG-LHR return in economy. CDG-LHR leg was serviced by Air France as part of their Sky Team agreement. Delays on most flights with some explanation but did not affect connecting flights. Cabin crew were robotic with very few smiles and very curt English. In-flight entertainment ranged from nothing to HD level in-seat monitors with an excellent choice of movies and games (CDG-PVG only). Was upgraded to business on the OKA-PVG flight and was pleasantly surprised by the food. The economy food was edible. Overall good value for money and much better than I was expecting having read the reviews here. The transit in PVG is an experience I never want to experience again but that is not China Eastern's fault. Would never travel via China again just because of that.

PVG-DEL-PVG in business class. Both flights on A330s but different configs and service levels. Outbound flight was an older plane with 2-2-2 seats that reclined to an angle and did not lie flat. FAs went about their work perfunctorily. The food was very bad - both options were like an economy class meal in terms of taste and quality. They did not have a dessert cart. IFE system had a fair selection of movies. Return flight was better with a newer plane and lie flat seats. FAs were professional and pleasant and spoke English better than the outbound flight. Meals were also tastier. The price for the flight is good but you get what you pay for and quality is uneven.

Shanghai-JFK non stop connection in Business Class. Overall an awful long flight. Only two direct flights one of them operated by China Eastern - that's why I ended up with them. Business Class not comparable with leading European or other Asian carriers. Very worn down no flat bed IFE outdated seats rather uncomfortable and service not really great. Overall an OK experience just because it's a non stop connection and much less time consuming compared to stopover connections. Overall experience is just OK not really worth the money though.

SYD-PEK-SYD in Business class via Shanghai Pudong airport. Positive parts are: Good value for money A330 SYD-PVG-SYD A321 PVG-PEK-PVG seats are comfortable angled flat bed proper business class seats for domestic legs as well food and drinks are good in all legs amenity kits are great for international flights not bad inflight entertainment system and you can accumulate sky team member points. Down sides: Consistent bad service in different countries and cities. During the flight it was fine nothing special and staff need more training for attention to details. Lounges in PVG are tiny and dark you have to pass boarding gate to get into the lounge so if boarding in process then you have to wait for 20-30 minutes to go down to the lounge.

SIN-JFK with a transit in Shanghai. Both flights departed on time and arrived early. Cabin clean but a little dated. No personal in-flight entertainment systems even though it was a 20-hour journey. Crew got the job done but did not go beyond that - spoke limited English. Meals served did not always correspond to time (whether at the origin or the destination) - on my flight from Singapore to Shanghai a full meal of rice/noodles was served 2 hours into take-off at 2am and no breakfast was served even though the flight was scheduled to land at 6am. Similarly the 14-hour flight from Shanghai to JFK only saw 2 meals served 2 hours after take-off and 2 hours before landing. Stereotypical airline food served somewhat tasteless but is not inedible. Best to bring your own food on board if you (1) are not inclined towards Chinese food (2) are picky or (3) are easily hungry. Toilets were clean. Many passengers (especially on the Shanghai-JFK leg) were loud and pushy. I had a decent experience with the airline but I probably would not fly with them again if I can afford it.

LHR to PVG. Main gripe is that there is no online check-in which mean turning up at airport 3.5 hrs before flight departs and having to queue to get a good seat. Airplane very clean and good first impression. Seat comfortable and legroom excellent (seat 32D). Service lacklustre without much attempt to be quick. Poor selection (no sparkling water and no white wine). Food edible but little thought for presentation or variety (cold starter warm main and yogurt). Served dinner twice (2hrs into flight and 1.5 hrs before landing when breakfast would have been more appropriate). Staff okay but not especially friendly or alert. Entertainment system excellent with HD-quality picture and lots of choice. Would have recommended but for lack of online checkin.

Beijing to Hong Kong via Kunming. When I checked in in Beijing was told my luggage will not be transferred to Hong Kong which meant that during my 1 hour transfer in Kunming I would have to take my luggage check in again for Hong Kong pass visa control and security control again. Arrived in Kunming on time but waited 10 mins inside the plane. I had to run to get my luggage go to the check in desk arrived 2 mins before the end of check in - told they could not register my luggage because it was too late. They finally let me go with my luggage in the cabin. When I arrived at the boarding gate I was told to hurry up! Finally left 15 mins late (some other passengers arrived after me). Arrived in Hong Kong another 10 mins wait in the plane. Otherwise the flight was good the hostesses were nice and polite the food was ok the seat comfortable.

I flew from Tokyo Narita to Singapore via Shanghai and I definitely got what I paid for. Three out of my 4 flights were delayed and only one was explained since there were mechanical problems and it left 2.5 hours late. On my last flight we started boarding when we were supposed to be taking off and staff acted like it was normal (no explanation or apology given). The meals and staff were good; I would say the delays were the most aggravating. Probably won't travel with them again.

On July 20th I took off from Beijing to Kunming via China Eastern flight #5706 on my way to Kolkata (via flight# 555). The plane leaving from Beijing to Kunming was late by two hours. I missed the connecting flight to Kolkata. There was no guidance or help at Kunming. I picked up my checked luggage and went to the terminal for the connecting flight. I found a lot of confusion at the ticket counter and finally gathered that I had to wait for the same flight next night. The next day after receiving the boarding pass I arrived at the departure gate where the plane was delayed for more than hour - no announcement no apology. My return trip from Kolkata to the USA was to be via China Eastern. Instead I bought a one-way ticket via another airline. I realize I would not get a refund for the unused portion of the China Eastern ticket but I have no regrets.

PEK-NKG in First (which is more like business class in many other countries). Despite the seemingly endless delays at Beijing that are common these days (often due to poor weather) my flight was good. Attention to detail seems to have improved markedly at China Eastern since my last flight with them. Breakfast was excellent and my bags arrived quickly at Nanjing. Only issue was at the special check in for first class in Beijing where the staff member did not seem to understand my electronic ticket. I even enjoyed the quality documentary played during the flight.

Sitting in the so called "First Class Lounge" of China Eastern Airlines in Shanghai Pudong Airport waiting to board my domestic flight to Liuzhou? Checked in one and a half hours in advance and was directed to the lounge. Waiting to be called for boarding. All other flights are being called except mine. Finally 30 minutes after scheduled boarding time I get up and ask when boarding would start. I am being told matter-of-factly that the flight is delayed by three hours as if it was the most natural thing in the world. No apology or empathy. Lounge hostesses could not care less. Do not believe that it is their duty to inform guests of delays. Their job is only to inform of boarding times. China Eastern still don't understand customer service.

KUL-PVG on A320-200 Business Class seat 6J. For a 5hr30min flight this aircraft was not good - an international flight but was treated like a domestic flight. Pre take-off drinks fine and then although departure was 0155 (delayed to 0245) it was a drink after take off and nothing until 1hr 30mins before landing when breakfast was served. Aircraft old and the seats hard and you couldn't sleep on them. No IFE at all not even music! Would not recommend Business Class on this type of China Eastern Airlines aircraft.

Seat uncomfortably narrow with very little leg room. No individual IFE and movies were played repeatedly. A cold and tasteless sandwich served before landing. Overall good value for the money but I will not fly this airline again.

Sydney to London return in economy was a major feat of endurance with this airline. No online check-in check-in staff in PVG didn't know which rows were the exit rows IFE was amateurish (two movies repeated endlessly on drop-down screens on both flights except when someone had recorded one over the other cutting it off before the end) toilets were filthy by the end of each 10 hr flight. Even adjusting for the common 30-60 minute boarding delays two of the three flights arrived at times over an hour different to what was on the ticket! The newish A330s were okay if unlike my neighbour your seat didn't break. Biggest hassle was their inability to check through luggage from partner airlines in Shanghai: I had to collect my bag from the KLM flight and then lug it upstairs queue endlessly and check it in again for China Eastern to Sydney even though the bag tag said SYD. The most disorganised airline I've ever flown with!

PVG-DPS return in business class. Check-in is swift in PVG. Lounge in PVG T1 is dated. Both legs are delayed for one hour. Well maintained A333 with pod seats though not real lie-flat comfortable enough for sleeping. Food is very average not up to a business class standard. Service is sufficient but you would expect much more. AVOD works well but the screens on bulk head seats are way too small. I will definitely choose MU J class again if the price is as competitive as this trip (less than USD900 for a 6 hours return flight).

I and my wife travelled from Delhi to Los Angeles via Shanghai return. Our outward journey commenced on 30th May 2012 reaching Los Angeles on the same date. We commenced our return journey from Los Angeles on 28th June reaching Delhi on 29th June in the early hours. The flights were on time. At Shanghai the transfer was smooth. We were impressed by the fact that one official was standing near the transfer desk and calling attention of transfer passengers when we were going to Los Angeles. That was good. The food was value for money in an economy class. But the entertainment in the flight was inadequate as the monitors were not attached to the back of the seats. One more problem that we faced was that we could not reserve our seats online. But our overall experience was satisfactory.

Red eye flight from Narita to HCM was delayed over an hour. We sat in the plane for over an hour waiting for take-off with no explanation. Almost missed my layover flight in Shanghai but yet again was delayed for over 3 hours! When the delay notice was given the crew wasn't even sure when the next departure would be. The plane ended up showing up at 3am. The worst thing about it was there was no apologies and flight attendants were extremely apathetic.

A glass of water soon after take off and no flight attendants were seen for the next few hours. Had to get drinks myself from a trolley parked all the way at the end of the plane! A tasteless and unappetizing meal was served one hour prior to landing. Seats were uncomfortable and carpets were dirty. Have a return flight ticket but decided to forgo that and buy a return ticket from another airline.

Shenzhen-Shanghai Hongqiao. At check-in was informed my 11.30 flight would be significantly delayed so they would put me on the 12.30 instead. That was then delayed and we didn't start boarding until 13.45. Then sat on the plane for a long time and told the flight was delayed due to air traffic control. Food was served whilst waiting no vegetarian food and no option to pre-order. Eventually took off after 15.00 with very little explanation or apology. Plane was very old and most of the fabric was peeling off. No IFE. Staff tried their best to bring around drinks.

I was pleasantly surprised when I flew LAX to Shanghai. I was expecting a terrible flight but everything went pretty well. The two meals and snack were tasty the airplane was clean and new. The flight attendants were fairly friendly and overall the flight was pretty decent. However the service was slow not sure if they were understaffed or what but most times to get water or get them to collect trash you'd need to buzz them. Also they did show movies on the drop-down TVs but they were outdated and not too interesting. But overall it was better than I thought. Also I am 6'1" and the seats were uncomfortable in coach. But I think that's probably the same with most airlines.

Shangahi to Okinawa in business class. Check-in was efficient with a dedicated sky priority section and staff were friendly and efficient. The China Eastern Airlines Business Lounge is very difficult to find and not worth the effort to be honest. The lounge is a small crowded windowless room with a few food and drink offerings. While I was there the lounge was very crowded and very dirty although they did start clearing plates and tables as I was leaving. Boarding for my flight was very organised. The business class seats on the A319 were 2 2 across and were proper regional business seats rather than the usual economy seat with the middle one kept free that you get with BA. Soft drinks were served prior to take off then hot towels and a second drinks round then a full lunch which I have to admit was the nicest meal I have ever had on any aircraft. Arrived slightly late in Okinawa first off the plane thought immigration and baggage on the belt within minutes. I was very impressed with China Eastern and will try then long haul as I can live with the fact that the lounge in Shanghai is dismal.

PEK-SHA business class. A well-maintained A330 with individual touch screen IFE. Boarding was efficient and orderly. Take-off on time (unusual given PEK airport's terrible air traffic control). Food was nice even with soup noodles on the menu and FAs were helpful. China Eastern is certainly trying hard to improve its services particularly on the "cash-cow" PEK-SHA route. Other routes (PEK-WUH for example) are still sub- standard.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
LAX-PVG. Seats were narrow made me feel trapped they were hard and there was little legroom. Which made it a very uncomfortable flight. No personal IFE for the 13 hour flight. IFE on the OV screens were confusing and hard to understand. They also kept repeating the same shows throughout the flight. We were served 2 full meals on the flight as well as snacks. The meals were good for economy class. Service was good except for when a flight attendant rudely refused to clean the toilet. Speaking of restrooms they were not clean at all. There were power ports on the A340 we were on. But the ones in our seats were broken and didn't charge my laptop. The same thing was happening in other seats. All in all the crew was good the food was decent it smelled bad and was uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend this airline at all.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Fuzhou to Shanghai however the aircraft was supposed to fly Hong Kong. At the time of our flight there were storms around Fuzhou which delayed all flights in and out so we waited in the terminal for an hour. When we got to the China Eastern desk staff were rude and made us wait 30 minutes before some told us that the flight was still delayed. Finally after 5 hours we got fed up and went back to the desk this time they told us our flight was cancelled and said that over 150 people had already been transferred to other flights. Finally after 6 hours they transferred us to a Shanghai airlines flight which was then delayed an hour.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
London to Shanghai. We were a little late boarding but made up time and arrived early. Staff were excellent very friendly and efficient. Food was good; we had a western style meal to begin with (beef and potatoes) and it was quite tasty and a Chinese style meal before landing. Inflight entertainment was great with a large selection of films. The seat/leg room wasn't brilliant but for the price we paid I wasn't expecting business class! I would recommend China Eastern they get you from A to B decent service and most importantly attentive staff.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
LHR to PVG return. In general it was a nice trip. I had heard that there's no personal entertainment system available onboard actually they do have although the choices are not that abundant but still enough. Got seat in the emergent exit in the outbound flight but not so lucky on the way back the seats are normal. Food and drinks ok. The staff service is much better than 4 years ago but still much room for further improvement. No delay in both parts and consider its price would like to recommend.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-TNA short 1 hour 20 minute flight on relatively old but clean A320 seats were old style with low back but lots of padding though quite narrow widest aisle I have seen on an A320. Service was efficient but not really friendly. A hot meal and small snack along with 3 drink runs were also offered which is great for such a short flight. Good value for money and on time.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
FRA-PVG-BKK. FRA-PVG on new clean A330-200. Flight full but departure 20 min early. Y-Seat was comfortable with AVOD but limited choices of IFE. FAs speak limited English. Hot towels and soft drink served accordingly after departure - Lunch (2 choices - Western and Chinese) were hot and tasty but drinks served very late after meal. After lunch Duty Free was offered and FAs were relaxed and smiles came often. 2 Hours before landing breakfast (2 choices) was served. Same experience as lunch – coffee/tea came very late. Transit at Shanghai-Pudong Airport was a horror. PVG-BKK on smaller A320 same experience. Return flight PVG-FRA on old A330-200 aircraft still clean but no AVOD only big overhead TV showing Air Show and a Chinese and English film. Flight again full and FA's were busy - therefore no smiling. No information from cockpit on all legs. All in all a good product at a very competitive price.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Sydney-Pudong - what a and terrible experience for 11hrs flight! Booked CX flight on Sydney-Hong Kong- Shanghai however was transferred to MU due to CX flight delayed. Old style A330 no AVOD seat narrow and uncomfortable crew rude and impolite low-quality beverages served food terrible and tasteless (very simple).

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
HKG-PVG-SHE return. New A320s on 3 flights older A320 on the other. Newer A320s offer slightly more leg room than the older A320 but overall no complaints about leg room or seats even for a heavier person. IFE virtually non-existent (overhead screens showing commercials and infotainment mostly) but not a great issue on the short 2 hour sectors. Service on the international sector is much better than on the domestic sector with friendly crew with decent English and choice of meal which was of decent quality. The domestic sector was much poorer no choice of meal crew less friendly and poorer English. Check in staff have decent English and were quite friendly and efficient. Overall probably better than most American domestic carriers I have flown on. At the price hard to beat.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Pudong-JFK on MU's old A340s. Old business class seats had not been changed over to their lay flat overall there was lots of leg room. Very poor entertainment system. The food was very poor - flight attendants did not even know how to make a G&T and no nuts to go with the drink. FA's were pushy on the food so it was a rush to get each course finished. No drink service during a 14 hour flight no water offered unless you asked. The biggest problem I found was that it was very hot and stuffy. Overall a very cheap business ticket so it was good value but i wouldn't pay any more for it.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
SIN to PVG return. Outbound A340-300 and return 767 operated by Shanghai Airlines. Both redeye flights - serve meals at an awkward time during the flight. Very regimented service. No entertainment even on the big screens. However given the distance well worth the price that paid.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
LAX-PVG PVG-REP. Airbus A340 on LA to Shanghai leg and A320 on Shanghai to Siem Reap leg. Although not on par with the best 4 and 5-star airlines it offers value for money. First leg on time and second leg arrived in Siem Reap on time. Service was comparable if not slightly better than most US carriers flight attendants courteous and spoke English adequately. Announcements in English and Chinese. While the planes did not have seat back screens the pull down screens were adequately spaced and showed a variable selection of movies. Seat backs on A340 had universal power outlets. Two complete meals offered on 13-hour flight to Shanghai snack and beverage runs offered in between. Food was edible and arrived warm. Seats were reasonably comfortable leg room adequate and the plane clean.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-TAO Short 1.5 hour flight. A320 was a bit old but clean. Flight on time. A hot meal was served and there was plenty for a lunch. Second time on China Eastern and the good service continues.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
China Eastern has the same standards as American carriers at best. Returned from PVG to HKG flight was delayed 2.5 hours. 10 minutes before the plane was due to leave still no info at all. So I go to the desk where a member of staff says there was maybe a 2 hours delay. Finally I went to customer service to complain where I was told to return to the gate for boarding. Onboard in addition to some airplane food which I take a pass on I am able to get a nice warm beer. Overall would not fly them again.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Singapore to Shanghai. Departure delayed 3.5 hours due to a mechanical problem. While we waited no snacks or drinks served. 3 hours later lunch was served while still on the runway. They seem to have plenty of soft drinks and juices but insufficient beers. No snacks or breakfast. Inflight entertainment was the same Chinese movie played on a loop. Crew simply went through the motions no attempt to offer any kind of customer service. Once the meals and drinks were served they made themselves scarce. Arrived in Shanghai at 7.30 pm instead of scheduled 2.55 pm. This is the first and last time I fly China Eastern Airlines.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
A flight delay lead to lost connecting flight in Shanghai. We were held in immigration in Shanghai for 4 hours because no CE officials were on hand to explain to immigration who we were. No connecting flight available and airline refused to transfer us to other airlines. A night spent at the airport and CE refusing to pay for hotel. Indifference of desk staff in Shanghai was astonishing. Only through hours of wrangling were we able to secure an agreement with them to partly pay for another airlines tickets out of Shanghai. Their expectation was we should wait around until cancellations came along though they were booked out for days.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
We flew this airline business class in February. Very good service and food but the movie selection was extremely limited. Same choices going and coming from the US - and all of them were outdated.

Shanghai-Hong Kong on A320. Departure on time plane looked new cabin crew very efficient pleasant and welcoming. Seat was hard but it was only a 2.5 hour flight so no problem. Lunch was served - juice beef and noodles fruit and mango jelly. Entertainment was on overhead screens. Arrival on time.

Frankfurt (FRA) to Shanghai (PVG) on Airbus 330-200. I booked this flight because it was by far the cheapest. Boarding was on time and the cabin surprisingly modern. There was in-seat-entertainment (on the flight back there were only overhead displays) though the choice of movies very limited. The cabin crew worked well but they didn't have time for talking or at least smiling. The seat was a little too small for me although my height is average European. Food was okay not more not less. What I liked were the warm towels handed to you twice and the morning work-out presented by flight attendants. In conclusion you get an average flight experience for a good price.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Beijing-Nanjing on a mid-week flight. After what seemed a never ending delay in departure (partly due to a sick passenger) the flight was reasonable except for incredibly uncaring fellow passengers who consistently wandered up to the toilet while the aircraft was still taxiing or put their seats completely into recline before the aircraft had even taken off. First Class on these domestic flights is closer to a cheap business class flight in a country such as Australia. Nevertheless food and service was quite good although the glass of white wine I had must have been the warmest I have ever encountered. The business lounges available at Beijing were extremely rudimentary.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
UK to Sydney via Shanghai for Christmas/New Year Dec 2011 - this airline was the cheapest. I purchased an Australian Visa with my flight but had to buy a second visa at Heathrow as China Eastern were adamant I didn't have one and would not issue me a boarding pass until I purchased an emergency one for £35! I would advise taking your own entertainment as the initial first leg of the trip was the only one with a personal TV system every other flight only had communal TV screens showing Chinese films with English subtitles. Food was mainly meat with noodles or fish with rice you may want to consider becoming vegetarian for the trip. I had an overnight stop over in Shanghai nothing was very co-ordinated at the airport - ensure you have a hotel booking slip from your agent. All stopover passengers from my flight didn't seem to have a reservation at either of the airport's hotels the majority of us ended up paying for our rooms on a credit card.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
LAX-PDG PDG-LAX and a few domestic flights in China. Seats were comfortable on the transpacific flight and electrical outlets at every seat. The IFE was strange so a laptop comes in handy. Meals were hot and tasty but expect Asian-style cuisine. Obviously FA's speak little English but ours seemed friendly. They brought out hot towels after each meal which was a pleasant surprise. Domestic flights were pleasant and uneventful. Only issue was when a storm the previous night caused out flight to be cancelled. We would have been out of luck if our Chinese-speaking guide hadn't been there to speak with the agents.

Singapore-Shanghai-Seoul. Surprisingly prompt departure and arrival time at all destinations no flight delay as described by other passengers. Food quality was poor and much improvement needed leg-room was only slightly better than budget aircraft's. Service staff were generally helpful.

I am China Eastern Gold (Elite Plus) member and fly with almost every week on Shanghai-Changsha Shanghai-Chengdu Shanghai-Kunming Shanghai-Guiyang and Shanghai-Beijing. Other than the VIP lounge I never got any other special treatment. Most of MU flights have delays from 30 minutes to 1.5hrs very tight legroom for all flights poor quality food served. MU is far behind the China Southern in terms of service quality if you travel within mainland China.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Shanghai-Beijing with A330. The flight from Shanghai to Beijing had very decent hot meal surprisingly. But the return flight from Beijing to Shanghai had only a sandwich. Not sure why it was so different. No individual seat-back monitor available. Both flights were almost on time with only minor delay.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Xi'an to Beijing Capital. Nice Airbus A320 flight with o/h Video playing comedy programmes during short 1 hr 22 min duration. Cabin crew worked hard to serve Lunch pity that the Beef seemed on the tough side and rice was rather cold. Cabin crew give out details of flight progress nothing from flight deck crew which seems to be the norm in China.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Two very different experiences with China Eastern. I recently flew Melbourne to Shanghai and returned three days later business class. First surprise the plane was a Shanghai Airlines B767. Seat 2E was comfortable enough with good legrest and went back to about 150 deg not flat but enough to sleep. Welcome drink was water or a glass with about 1 cm of sparking wine - very odd. Lunch consisted of small salad reasonable main course and plate with four pieces of not so fresh fruit. Dinner consisted of same small salad and same poor quality fruit plate with noodle dish in between. The silliest part was that utensils were the poorest plastic I have ever seen. They were so thin the tines of the fork could not be used to pick up the meat or the vegetables - so I had to eat with fingers which is not terrible just really silly. Business class toilet was out of service but crew did their best to give us access to one of the forward economy toilets. Return flight out of Shanghai was quite different. Same type of plane same seat. Welcome drink was normal glasses of orange juice and white. Toilet worked. Dinner consisted of salad very good appetizer seafood main course and fruit or ice cream for dessert. All served with silver cutlery which debunked my thought that plastic was used out of Melbourne for safety reasons. I do not know how the quality out of Melbourne could be so bad as I have used many airlines out of Melbourne and never had such bad food or accessories as on the Eastern China flight and what makes it so strange is that the airline has such good standards out of Shanghai. It was almost like two different airlines - I would never pay business class to fly the first but I would for the second.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
SYD-PVG-LAX. SYD-PVG leg on an A330 - seemed quite new. Flight Attendants aren't overly friendly and quite concise and to the point. Food was okay not overly pleasing. PVG-LAX on an A340. Seemed similar in generation of the A330. Flight Attendants were more friendly on this flight. Some meals were poor quality. Return flight LAX-PVG was extremely similar however meal quality was significantly improved. Return flight PVG-SYD was extremely full due to a ticketing malfunction. Food was quite poor.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-XIY-PVG. Good fare on the outbound leg had to pay 3 times the price for the return due to Chinese holidays. Both flights were A320 and looked rather tired & dated inside. Seat belt signs remain on at all times and the flight deck make no comments. Cabin crew efficient - but not over friendly. Reasonable free food and soft drinks. Return delayed 90 minutes with little information & last minute gate change. Luggage arrived before I did as it was placed on an earlier flight (?)

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PVG-CKG. Booked flight at the last minute so was happy to be on flight. Checkin in Shanghai quite organised and fast as well as the airport compared to Beijing much better. No food served on the flight I was surprised as I had d been on shorter flights with Chinese carriers this trip and got more than enough food and snacks so was a bit disappointing as it was too late to get any food on arrival in Chongqing. Drinks were served but only drinks. An ok and uneventful flight apart from this.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
BJS-PVG quite old plane but clean. Fast checkin in Beijing although it looked a little chaotic there at first. No airbridge so all passengers needed to wait and stand around on a bus for a while for departure and arrival in Shanghai. Very crowded boarding area in Beijing. The food was good more than enough and was interesting if not a little weird. All in all a good flight that I couldn't really complain about.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Singapore Changi Airport to Harbin via Shanghai Pudong. Changi to Pudong Airport was A330 but it does not have individualised aircon duct for passengers. Food was fine. Inflight entertainment non-existent no radio programme even though headset is provided. Pudong to Taiping Airport an A320 food was fine (typical Chinese breakfast). Inflight entertainment the same for the previous trip. Staff service for both flights were fine.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Sydney to London return. Food poor and often only one option by the time they reached our seat staff efficient but not friendly. Shared overhead tvs showed no english movies (Chinese ones had English subtitles but difficult to read them from a distance). No warning about 3 hour delays but did offer food voucher. Wouldn't fly with them again will pay the extra money for service.

PVG-HKG. As an Elite Plus member I was entitled to First Class Club access. Lounge well stocked and staff very friendly. Loaded on to a bus for shuttle to the aircraft. A321 of recent remodel. Flight staff friendly and outgoing. It was a 2.5 hr flight. Three choices for hot meal. Arrived hot and tasty with an ample portion as well as fruit and ice cream for dessert. First time flying MU but will certainly look forward to the next booking.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Hong Kong-Xian return. On the first leg the aircraft was an Airbus A320 which looked pretty old staff service was warm and kind. Sadly there wasn't AVOD. On the second leg the flight was delayed for almost 2 hrs on second leg because of a mechanical problem with the engine. After the switch of planes we were on a seemingly brand new Airbus A320 with a newer interior. Overall MU is a fine Chinese airline the only letdown is the food the presentation wasn't good but it tasted ok.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Lianyungang-Shanghai. Almost 3 hours of delay at Lianyungang due to some technical problems at Shanghai airport tower. The ground crew offered a small snack box of bread and bottled beverage which was a nice relief from the tiredness of waiting at the airport. No AVOD on this 2 hr flight food was stirred pork with plum sauce which was quite good. FA's had to face complaints from many passengers due to the delay and they seemed to manage their complaints quite well and attentive. Flight OK service good.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
PEK-PVG-SYD-PVG-PEK. Price for Business Class was very good angled lie flat seats were comfy a little narrow but generally comfy in sleep and upright positions. Food on the way to Sydney was ok not great but typical of food quality out of China. Lounge in PEK and PVG were both good PVG being better having a variety of hot food and more drinks to choose from. Lounge in SYD for return leg was Qantas lounge so very good excellent food and showers etc. Food on the return leg was much better not only variety but quantity and quality was much better. Service on all legs was good English level was very good from most attendants. Would definitely recommend their Business Class when it is discounted.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
ICN-PVG. Check-in and boarding quick. Staff were efficient but unfriendly - some looked glum and didn't seem to want to assist passengers. Tasty meal served promptly after take-off. Announcements made in Chinese English and Korean. Got a free copy of China Daily on request. Appeared to be headphone facilities but weren't given any headsets. No personal TV but newspaper kept me entertained for the short flight. Adequate leg room. Overall considering the cost it does the job but otherwise don't expect too much.

Sydney to Shanghai and on to New Delhi. Sydney-Shanghai flight was surprisingly great after reading some of the reviews. I requested and had an exit seat requested vegetarian meals and it arrived on all sectors without any issues. The seats were comfortable and even offered power outlets for laptops in economy seats! Movie selection was limited. Shanghai - Delhi sector had older planes and no power in the seats and we managed to get exit row seats again and food as ordered. Drinks menu was limited to Chinese beer and french red wines - which was OK.

My wife and I flew China Eastern Airlines from Singapore to Kunming return. The onward flight was delayed by 1 hr. Inside the flight it was a standard A320 seating arrangement. The crew members were nice and warm. The food was generic and nothing much to talk about. There was no AVOD. The return flight was on time. Crew members again were nice and welcoming. The flight was relatively new and clean. Overall it was a good and safe experience. And of course it is value for money.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
I was in China for 5 months for a work stint and flew China Eastern around once every two weeks. It was the only carrier available for some rural airports. although there seem to be a negative impression on here regarding its service and delays I have to say that during the 10 something flights I took with them not once was my flight delayed or my bags lost. Their seats are pretty cramped and foods are generic. The more important parts was getting to my destination on time and safe.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Hong Kong-Shanghai Shanghai-Beijing. Both flights delayed the first delay sat for 1hr on the tarmac in Hong Kong while the second was a 2 hr delay due to aircraft change. No information as to reason for the delay or how long we would be waiting. Boarding Shanghai-Beijing was chaos staff seemed to exert little or no control over passengers. Some passengers were on cell phones while we were taxiing to take off. A special meal had been ordered but for some reason was given fruit as my meal. China Eastern has a long way to go they need to learn to focus on staff training.

Hong Kong-Shanghai-New York (JFK) return. At check-in in Hong Kong there was quite a long line with only a handful of agents. However I was still able to clear check-in security and get to the gate 10 mins before boarding. Hong Kong-Shanghai was very comfortable on an A320. Once we arrived at Shanghai we had to go through Chinese customs and back through the metal detectors to transfer. Shanghai-JFK on an A340 was very good. However there was no in-seat entertainment systems and the communal movies that were offered were not very good. In every seat however there is an electrical plug. I saw quite a few passengers plug in iPads and PSPs and such so CEA is allowing you to bring your own entertainment. The food throughout both flights did not offer any non-Chinese food options. On the return flight everything was fine and the food and drink seemed to be of better quality. The flight to Shanghai was about 30 mins late which cut my transfer to HKG close. CEA is good value for money.

Flew Beijing-Pudong and Macau-Pudong-Bejing. First flight on A330 which was not very full. Seats still a bit cramped and no food served just a very processed drink and I am diabetic! Macau through Pudong-Bejing was on A320 both flights. MU did not listen to my pleas not to check bag all the way through to Beijing and promptly lost it in Shanghai. Flight late and check in at Macau disorganised for a very small airport. Baggage services at Beijing very unhelpful. Would only fly MU again if no alternative.

JFK-Shanghai. A terrific airline for the price. Comfortable seating. Food as good as any Chinese airline. Generous flight attendants. You should have no hesitation flying this airline.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
China Eastern has got a lot better since I flew with them 3 yrs ago from LAX-PVG. The modern A340-600 aircraft has roomy space compared to other international airlines and my favourite comfortable 2-4-2 seat configuration. They also have power outlets behind each seat which many airlines don't have they have many music channels. The meals are a great amount. The flight attendants are friendly and helpful as on the way to PVG a PAX lost his wallet somewhere and about 3 FA's tried to help him find his wallet for over an hour and they made an announcement too. Shanghai's PVG international airport is very nice and modern and easy to navigate around. I've seen many negative comments and review for China Eastern and don't understand why. But most of them i've noticed come from Westerners and I understand why. The food and culture and drinks with no ice is Chinese culture. It'll be unfamiliar so bring some snacks. I've heard of many situations where they give Lunch vouchers and hotel room for delayed flights.

### China Eastern Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Shanghai-Taipei and return. Very basic with no inflight entertainment. No problem as I had books to read movies to watch and music to listen to myself. Unbeatable price. No online check-in but staff very friendly and arranged good seats for me (even when I showed up 1hr ahead of check-in). The ground staff helped my parents at Shanghai airport with transfer flight I really appreciate their assistance as my parents only speak German. Got a beer whenever I asked for it.

YVR-HKG + return flight. Paid $1000CAD. The service and food was good/excellent compared to North American airlines I have flown. All 4 of my flights (connections) arrived and departed on time. I found the seats comfortable. Also there was a lot of food offered in the flights - my 2 hr flight came with a full meal.

I tried to upgrade on CEA flight Shanghai to Rome. Was told that there was Superior Economy so paid extra at Shanghai airport for a seat with more leg room etc. only to discover that they had sold me another economy seat. Superior Economy Does Not Exist on their aircraft. There was no in-flight entertainment on a 12 hr+ flight and the only good thing about the seats is that there is a small foot rest.
