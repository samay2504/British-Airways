### "I encountered multiple delays"
On Feb 23rd, I encountered multiple delays on my flight. Scheduled departure time 2 pm has been delayed to 6::50pm. Scheduled departure time 6:50pm, has been delayed ... just waiting for 12 hours until 11:30pm. Arrived 12:35 pm to Mombasa. My flight was delayed multiple times throughout the day without clear communication from the staff. This lack of updates left  passengers feeling frustrated and anxious about our travel plans. I encountered unprofessional treatment from some staff members. Their responses to inquiries about the delays were dismissive, and I felt that my concerns were not taken seriously. This is not the level of service I expected
