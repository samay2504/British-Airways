### "Plane was in a good condition"
Boarding was by bus, departure on time. Plane was in a good condition. There was a limited IFE through your mobile, adequate for such a hour flight. Inflight service was a bottle of water. There was buy MENU available.

### "Okay was our general impression"
Hargeisa to Djibouti. Air Djibouti operates one single Boeing 737-500, leased with crew from a company in Tajikistan, as well as, reportedly, a few smaller aircraft. We flew from Hargeisa to Djibouti in November. The plane had arrived from Mogadishu with a delay but landed in JIB almost on time. It was definitely at least 25 years old but appeared to be in a very good state of repair. Seats were tight but comfortable. Catering consisted of a single bottle of water, which was ok on this 40-min hop. Okay was also our general impression.
