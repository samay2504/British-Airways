### "I had a very good experience"
I was hesitant about booking flights with Winair after having read several negative reviews online. However, I had limited options for my route through the Caribbean so ended up booking two flights with them. I had a very good experience on both flights. No delays, cancellations or lost luggage. Friendly and professional staff. Winair serves a few islands within the Caribbean so it has smaller planes than large airlines, but the journey was pleasant and safe/smooth. I understand that weather and other issues beyond airline control can result in delays or cancellations, so I always booked flights earlier in the day so that if there was a cancellation I could get onto a later flight. I also made sure I didn’t book connecting flights on the same day. This was overly cautious but it meant I visited some islands I would not otherwise have seen… not a bad outcome. I did find them expensive but the alternative was flying via the USA, which would have meant significantly more flying hours. I would definitely use Winair again.

### "have no use for a voucher"
On 06-11-2024 I had bought 2 return tickets for myself and my partner for the same day at Winair for 14-11-2024 to SXM-SBH with flight number WM623. We had rented a car and were going to spend the day on the island. On 14-11 my partner and I were at the airport well in time for the flight at 10.10. With the boarding passes we waited at gate C1 with other passengers. The TV with flight was on at the counter. But no staff. Not at 10. Not at 10.30. There was also no sign anywhere that the flight was cancelled. On the flight information the flight was still existing. We went to security because of the lack of staff. They were surprised. Shortly after, there was 1 verbal message that the flight SXM-SBH for today was cancelled anyway due to storm... ... We were literally thrown out on the street by security and good luck further. No rebooking possible. Winair is not reachable. They only give a roundabout answer by email that we can get a voucher with a validity of 1 year. But what do we have with that? We are leaving for Holland on Monday and will not come here to SXM anymore. Flights are still being cancelled today without notice? We have no use for a voucher... So that will be a process to get almost 200 euros back. We went to security because of the lack of staff. They were surprised.

### "Extremely unhelpful customer service"
This airline cancelled several days of flights in a row due to wind, and I do know that is beyond their control (beyond mine as well). We had to buy expensive ferry tickets to get back to the St Maarten, missed our connect so had to purchase new tickets to get home, purchase an additional nights stay, and other expenses. All I asked for was a refund for a service they were unable to provide, but the only solution they offered was that apparently i should have stayed on Saba indefinitely until they were able to fly planes. Weather is one thing, but offering no refund for flights you have cancelled on all passengers for days and days - just keeping peoples money for doing nothing? What a racket. I also bought their flight insurance, but that only covers if I miss a flight apparently so I guess I should have lied and said I didn't show up. Even then it looks like the insurance is designed to make it as difficult as possible to prove anything (I saw an area where you were supposed to drop in downloaded weather reports). So the insurance is definitely a scam. Extremely unhelpful customer service, they just want to keep your money and make you later everywhere you go. I'll never fly with them again, a day long ferry sounds better.

### "Completely unreliable airline"
Flying at its worst! Completely unreliable airline. Delays or cancels and reschedules flights on the spot. Displays are not accurate. Showing flights that simply do not exist. Ground staff at SXM arrogant and in no way helpful. They just don't care about you. Looks they have given up by all this hassle. Avoid it if you have a connecting flight within 6-8 hours or look for an overnight stay at connecting airport, especially at SXM. Or better adapt your routing according to your needs.

### "real fun to fly their Twin Otter"
Pretty much the only option between the islands around St. Maarten and Winair knows that, so their proces are high. We paid 200$ each for two times twelve minutes of flying. Having said that: it is real fun to fly their Twin Otter out of Saba, with the shortest runway on earth and than landing at the rollercoaster runway at Saint Barthélemy. The move our departure time one hour forward. Saba's tiny airport is more like a bus stop and the plan can's land with too much wind, so it's always unsure. Taking off is spectacular since the engines are pushed to their limits before being catapulted on the runway. The plane doesn't give you any personal space, there is no service of any kind, but the view is great. Since the same plane took us form SXM tot SBH, we could stay inside and repeated the whole thing. Flying Winair between the Caribbean islands is part of the experience, so don't skip it.

### "Absolutely the worst"
Absolutely the worst, no customer service - the phone line is pretty much always busy, there's only ONE agent sitting in the so-called "call center", and the woman is beyond unprofesssional - hangs up, talks back, interrupts. The online booking system is beyond flawed - if you have 3 people with the same first name but different middle names and dates of birth, because the system doesn't provide a field for middle name input, upon checkin, you'll have problems checking in, system the computer thinks you're trying to check int he same person 3 times. The ability to use credit vouchers is beyond non-existent. First, they never email you the credit vouchers, you have to remember and call their customer service to request for those to be emailed to you. Once they email you a book of "credit vouchers", you cannot use them online, you have to book, select to pay later, and then call their customer service to ask them to use the credit vouchers. Their business model is to get you to buy tickets and never receive any money back, even if you buy their supposedly "refundable" tickets. The flights themselves are ok, nothing special, that's if you're lucky enough to be able to book and check-in with no issues. I am disgusted to say the least that this kind of business practices still exist in 2023.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Yesterday as I arrived at Sint Marteen’s airport to check in for my transit flight to Antigua with Winair, they changed the time without informing any passengers. When I brought it to the ladies at the desk I was shut down immediately and pushed aside. One of the ladies said they would tell their supervisor and come back to me but she did not. My mother called them a plethora of times before they even picked up the call then and only then was arrangements made for me to go back to St. kitts and missing my flight in Antigua with inter Caribbean. I do not recommend this airline at all.

### "cannot get a refund because I was a no show"
Was traveling from Antigua to Puerto Rico via Winair, transferring to Silver Airways in St. Kitts. I arrived at airport more than 2 hours before, then was told that we had to complete an electronic immigration and health form before being allowed to board (no one flying was aware of this requirement prior to flying). After filing, I had to receive a confirmation from St. Kitts authorities via email. There was no notice of this when booking the flight, nor follow-up via email 24 hours before checking in. In my mind, I thought that I will be IN transit, and would only need to do the regular paper filings and show my vaccination card and recent test results, if necessary. Anyway, on completing the tiresome form, which was laborious, had questions with no relevance, and hard to navigate, I waited half an hour with no response from St. Kitts in my inbox. I then went to my spam folder to find an odd query from St. Kitts, telling me to refile. Tried to refile, but couldn't get back into their system, because of course, they were still processing my initial filing. Long story short, I missed the flight, had to purchase a ticket on JetBlue, fly to New York, then fly down to Puerto Rico. And the end result? I cannot get a refund because I was a no show.

### "Winair is a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  We flew on Winair from St. Maarten to St. Eustatius a few weeks ago. It was supposed to be a 5 day vacation on a beautiful island. Two days into our vacation, we were notified that our return flight had been cancelled. In fact all of the flights the day of our return were cancelled. We were then told we had been rebooked on a flight 2 days earlier than planned. Winair stole 2 days from our vacation which we had been planning on for over a year. We then had to pay additional expenses of $850 to stay in St. Maarteen. When I spoke to their customer service and told them how much it cost us and how they stole 2 days from our vacation, they did nothing. No refund, no vouchers for future flights, nothing. Winair is a terrible airline that is managed poorly and does not care about their customers.

### "found them to be very reliable"
I had 4 flights with this airline and found them to be very reliable, st Maarten to Statia and St Maarten to Saba and back, planes are very small but perfect for these 15 minutes hop. ground crew were friendly and even tagged my bags to Antigua on a codeshare with LIAT, I was surprised, they all arrived without major problems, they are quick and professional, sometimes slow sometimes not. The prices are very high though. The only worriesome moment I had with them was when one of the pilots shouted agressivily at the other just before engine started.

### "Winair is the worst company"
Winair, the company of shame! I travel around the world often and Winair is the worst company I have ever taken. I made two trips from France to St. Barth, with three flights in all (Pau / Paris, Paris / Saint-Martin and Saint-Martin / Saint-Barth). These flights cost 1500 euros. On two occasions, I could not take the flight between St. Martin and St. Barth when I arrived on time from Paris. The reason? The poor organization and incompetence of the Winair staff. The first time, I had a ticket "Standby". We were many passengers waiting in the heat in a large hall. The hour of our flight had arrived and we had no information. After a while, they called passengers for St. Barts and people rushed and pushed for a place. Many people could not fly, and we were told that there would be no more flights to St. Barts. We then wanted to get out of the airport to go to the boat, but we were stuck in the airport. Finally, we were able to leave an hour later, and the taxi had to drive very fast to arrive on time to take the boat. I had to pay 20 euros for a taxi and 90 euros for a boat. The sea was very bad and I was very sick on the boat because of the sea and fatigue. I was up since 3am (French time) and I was traveling since 20H. When I arrived in St. Barth I had to wait another hour at the customs, and I did not have my car to go home because I left it at the airport. The second time, I encountered exactly the same problem. But besides, I had a problem with my luggage. The lady of Winair (the only one who speaks French) said that the luggage had gone to St. Barts, and that we could go take the boat. I asked if she was sure of herself, and she said yes. I had a bad feeling and looked for my suitcase in the mess of the airport. Finally, after 30 minutes, I found my suitcase in the airport, all wet. I opened it and inside everything was wet: computer equipment, clothes. If I had listened to the lady of Winair, my luggage would have remained abandoned in this state at the airport. A shame ! In the end, in addition to my two trips that cost me 3000 euros in total, I had to pay 250 euros more for the taxi and the boat. In the end, in addition to my two trips that cost me 3000 euros in total, I had to pay 250 euros more for the taxi and the boat. They give no information to the passengers. When asked a question, they do not answer. They are unpleasant and give the impression that they are annoyed, while as a customer I have always been polite to them. They do not respond to emails to the email address of their site. - If you finally get the personal customer service mails, they give the impression that you bother and respond aggressively. They say the tickets have not been bought on their site so they will not refund you. They make no commercial gesture for you. They do not take their problems. **PASSENGER NAME BLANKED OFF AND CANNOT VERIFY THIS

### "One of my worse trips ever"
San Juan to St Maarten. One of my worse trips ever on 1/6/18 but the worse was the bad promises and bad service. When I booked the flight it was supposed to be San Juan-St Maarten to St. Kitts. Later Winair changed it to San Juan-St Maarten- Nevis -St. Kitts. In SJ airport they charged $47 for an extra bag, and then again $65 for the same extra bag at St Marteen. One bag was received two days after the trip, and the 2nd bag, 3 days after the trip. None of the bags were delivered to my hotel I had to pay 3 round trip taxi trips to the airport. One on 1/7 because they would never answer the phone, just to find out when my luggage will arrive, which they did not know. Then on 1/8 to pick up the first bag, which was all wet, inside and out. Then on 1/9 to pick up the second bag. The second bag had perishables which I lost. They new there were perishables there since 1/6 and when I filled for the delayed bag on 1/6 but did not make a little effort to move that bag from St. Maarten to St. Kitts until after 3 days. Filled a complaint to Winair and they did not pickup any of the charges they only offered to pick up 2 cabs roundtrip if I had the receipt, which I had not. However they do know I did pick up the bags and what the rate is. They would not reimburse any of the double bag charges. Had to move the bags from one plain to another in St. Maartin and there was no help. This was horrible service.
