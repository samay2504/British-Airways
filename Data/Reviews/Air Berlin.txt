### "it has managed to avoid paying"
Florence to London via Dusseldorf in September 2017. First flight from Florence delayed by 3 hours, resulting in missed connection. This wouldn't have been an issue, especially considering the airline was meant to reimburse all customers for costs of the delay. However, my checked baggage was misplaced. Again, this wouldn't have been an issue under normal circumstances. I spoke to the baggage handler who told me to come talk to him prior to the next mornings flight, which was due to leave at 6am. I was forced to pay for a taxi which totalled 100 Euro each way (with promises of reimbursement) to the hotel which the company had placed passengers in only to stay there for 4 hours before having to leave again to catch the rescheduled flight. When I went to see the baggage handler I wasn't able to find anyone in the department. I went to the Air Berlin help desk and after explaining the situation to the woman at the desk she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if she was able to call the person who handled baggage as I needed to put my checked luggage on the new flight and she said she could but wasn't going to. When I asked again, saying "Please, I need to catch my flight on time. I can't wait for someone to answer me knocking at the door, my flight leaves in less than an hour and I have to go through security" She promptly said to me (in these exact words) "Why don't you just do everyone a favour and go away. I flew to my destination sans baggage and deeply offended. Being under 19 years old at the time and a solo flyer I am to this day outraged by the lack of sympathy and understanding of the customer support team. I had to wait 4 whole weeks for my luggage to arrive at my final destination. The airline owes me over 500 Euros in reimbursement, which it has managed to avoid paying due to their own fiscal troubles. I hope this airline is never resurrected and that no one is treated like that in there travels.

### "was one of my favourite airlines"
Düsseldorf to Catania via Rome. Booked Alitalia, got Air Berlin. I was prepared for delays and even cancellations, because of the insolvency of Air Berlin. And indeed: our original inbound flight from Catania tot Düsseldorf with a change in Milan was cancelled, but within 10 minutes we were moved to the direct AB-flight CTA-DUS. Even better. So we had two punctual flights, with a friendly crew and reasonably priced drinks. Leg room was awful however. I like the small route screens on Air Berlin aircraft. But it's all over since Air Berlin stops flying in a few days, so no recommendation. Pity, because Air Berlin was one of my favourite airlines. Never had any problems.

### "very positive experience"
Milan to New York return via Dusseldorf. I had a very positive experience with AirBerlin - on all four of our flights. The prices were phenomenal - all four of us flew economy roundtrip for less $2,200 - although they did charge me quite a bit for seat reservations - with 2 small kids, you can't really make a good case for 'oh honey sorry you get to sit to that stranger. Everything ran on time. The seats are as about tight as most US airlines - though not as bad as United's back rows. But we fit fine, video was working (with lots of options for watching), food was ok-ishand the attendants were quite helpful and very nice. Really, I have no complaints. And yes, I did check in luggage on the way back - because who doesn't overshop in Italy? - and I got them back in NYC. We were all nervous about this due to all the bad review of lost luggage. In fact it is why I am writing the review - as I promised myself I would write a good review if we arrived home intact with a good experience. I fly Business for work - I was expecting worse but was very pleased as were my husband two kids (8, 10)

### "Definitely avoid if you can"
Berlin to Prague. Worst experience I’ve had for a while! They announce 2 hour delay, then no info until we understand that once they have a plane they must wait for a new crew. Very bad organisation and communication. Definitely avoid if you can, lost my time and couldn’t make my meetings.

### "happy their service"
Frankfurt to Berlin, our first flight was cancelled but they arranged me other flight. Next day I use Air Berlin also this time their service was on time and good service and cabin crew - they are very friendly and helpful. I was very happy their service.

### "don't recommend it at all"
Berlin to Warsaw. This is worst experience I had. Staff are really rude. They don't have enough information about flight. I had three different information last 10 minutes. I have been waiting for my flight over 2 hours and flight is delayed. And Airberlin's staff still can't give any information about flight. I don't recommend it at all.

### "Worst airline ever, poor customer care"
Worst airline ever, poor customer care. Representatives are rude and not helpful. My flight from San Francisco to Prague (with only one connection stop) was cancelled without any notification and explanation as to why. Air Berlin representative was not helpful at all. We were told that we would be flying via a different airline, however, didn't give any information regarding flight number, refused to print any documents proving that we had the new flight with a different airline. In addition, they gave us a flight with two stops (we could have find tickets much cheaper with two stops). Do not recommend this airline, they just lost two customers. On my way back another Air Berlin representative was extremely rude, plus she overcharged us for overweight luggage (we had to pay 100 euros for 27 kg luggage). On the board they didn't offer any drinks (water or coffee) from Prague to Berlin.

### "cheating their customers"
Bonn to Prague via Berlin. Absolutely bad experience. I bought flight at 5pm from Berlin and instead they put me on flight at 9pm. Nobody was able to explain me why. After staying in line for almost an hour to actually talk with someone they tell me that I have flight for today so they don't understand why is my problem - if they would tell me up front that the flight at 5pm will not happen I would fly directly from Bonn to Prague at 7 pm. These people are cheating their customers.

### "pricier than budget airlines"
Helsinki to Berlin return. the terminal in Berlin looks like an abandoned warehouse. The Boeing 737 had the A320 safety sheet. The seats were leather, and quite worn out. The flight left TXL on time. I am an Emerald member on one world however they did not recognise me on this flight nor the departing flight (no greeting, benefit, drinks, nothing). They charge 2.5 Euros for a cup of tea and the inflight entertainment via wifi must be purchased. Not recommended as they are pricier than budget airlines.

### "Not a good first impression"
Berlin to Geneva via Dusseldorf. Not a good first impression. First segment no order to boarding process just one long line regardless if your seat assignment. Delayed 30 minutes announced 10 minutes before scheduled boarding time. No explanation why. Onboard, the least amount of legroom I have ever experienced. Take off was finally one hour later. Second flight delayed 35 minutes to late arrival of the aircraft.

### "nice crew and comfortable planes"
Unfortunately Air Berlin has gone broke, but they are still flying. I was a bit apprehensive because of the insolvency and the bad performance earlier this year, but despite the situation it was great: very punctual - even half an hour earlier on the inbound flight, nice crew and comfortable planes. Since Münster/Osnabrück is a small airport, one is at the gate within 5 mins of entering the building and boarding is very quick. On both flights we had an Air Berlin plane, a Niki flightnumber and a TUIfly crew. B737 showed its age but was fine. Paid 7 euros for a currywurst. A bit steep but it was excellent. Nice flight over Cologne and Lake Geneva with view of the Alps. I was out of Palma airport within 20 mins after touch down (only hand luggage) which was very good for such a big airport. Big surpise on the inbound flight: I was assigned an emergency seat for free. The normal cost is 25 euros, so this was very comfortable. We even got the famous AB chocolate heart at leaving the plane. It's a pity AB is about to disappear. I have flown quite a lot with them and it was always fine. The only reason I don't recommend them is the insolvency, because they're suspending flights already.

### "profit over customer"
Disaster! Booked end March to fly from Stockholm to Geneva via Dusseldorf with my wife and 3 children, taking around 4 hours and thought I had a bargain. 6 weeks before departure was informed of a small change - had to leave 4 hours earlier to fly Stockholm - Berlin - Dusseldorf - Geneva, ie total journey time of 8 hours with children of 4, 6 and 8 years old. Immediately contacted Air Berlin who confirmed I could cancel if wanted (but by then flight prices had doubled) or else I would receive some confirmation if I contacted them via their website. Did this immediately and still haven't heard. Tried contacting them at the airport en route, but impossible to find an Air Berlin employee at the airport, only representatives from other companies who were shocked and sorry but weren't "able to do anything". Clear case of profit over customer but if you don't take care of the customer, then somebody else will and next time we will definitely not be flying with Air Berlin.

### "no customer service line"
New York to Rome via Dusseldorf. We understand travel issues but AirBerlin was most disturbing and we still have not gotten through to any representative over 30 days later. Air Berlin has no customer service line for current customers only a "ticket booking line". And the representatives there will quickly and rudely tell you they cannot help you at all. This company has made itself inaccessible to its customers. We could only get bits of information through their affliate airline Alitalia. Basically though Alitaila said that it was AirBerlin we needed to get to to find baggage that had been lost with no trace for 4+days but then their is no way to reach Air Berlin - just email- to date we have and continue to send 40+ emails with no more than the automated reply that the message was received in return. There were multiple other details and issues (being told kmisinformation and waiting at airports only to find out the baggage was in fact still lost). But the biggest issue is Air Berlin's failure to respond to any messages or any emails-we have looked and tried multiple emails with no response.

### "trip was the worst out of all"
Boston to Munich via Dusseldorf. This trip was the worst out of all and I was very disappointed with Air Berlin. I was traveling with one other person and her bag was lost and not returned for another week after it was found. She tried to call the company multiple times and it was nearly impossible to get a hold of someone to talk to. The flight attendants on our flight were also downright rude. I am a very easy going person and not much bothers me but they way they spoke to us and handled any problems was highly unprofessional. Trying to board the plane alone was an absolute mess. I would not recommend this airline to anyone looking to fly to Europe.

### "seats are cramped to the limit"
Flying from VIE to Westerland, Sylt your options are limited as Air Berlin is the only airline with an acceptable layover. As a Star Alliance Gold member I would clearly prefer LH but the routing would require a overnight stay in MUC - so not a plausible alternative. Well, the routing is the only positive thing about AB - everything else is dreadful. The seats are cramped to the limit, the service is no-frill and literally non-existent, the staff lack friendliness and experience, etc. This was definitely my last attempt on AB. The next time I would rather take the train from Hamburg.

### "I was really pleasantly surprised"
This was the first trip I tried Air Berlin's (then) new business class service for Europe. I was really pleasantly surprised. This is in my view a much better product than LH or the likes offer. I like that you can get any food or snacks you want from their trolley at no extra charge. This is much better than getting a pre-set tray with food you have no idea what it is. Air Berlin also had very nice hot towels. Their staff really like what they do. The only minus is that they are expensive.

### "an average budget carrier"
This is an average budget carrier, and certainly not anything close to a full service airline. Flight to Milan was approximately 30 minutes late leaving Berlin, not even water was offered for free while inflight (would have preferred free water to the chocolate heart they offer upon existing the aircraft), and the luggage took painfully long to reach the belt on arrival. I would consider them again if the ticket is cheap and the duration of the flight is short.

### "Worst airline ever"
Berlin to Copenhagen. Worst airline ever. They just lost me and my friend as customers! We booked (two fairly expansive tickets, 390€) 3 months ago and when we came to the check in we are told we are on stand by due to overbooking. We didn't get any information before hand. Not any texts or emails. We were randomly picked and we were not the last ones to check in, we were actually early. I don't know why they chose us because the man behind the desk didn't answer any of our questions and he was rude and just wanted to get rid of us. So now we're sittning here at Tegel Airport and we have to wait 5 hours until the next flight leaves. Great times.

### "Quality was decent for a budget carrier"
Berlin to Copenhagen on an Airbus A320. Quality was decent for a budget carrier. Check-in staff did the job, but the counters of Air Berlin on TXL were understaffed. There were issues with getting the aircraft prepared on time. The aircraft was bare and just "the norm. Seats were alright for the short flight. There was no cabin service or beverages, but given that this was a short haul flight on a budget carrier it was understandable. Recommended only if you are really on a budget. I would take SAS if I was to do this again.

### "do not offer good quality"
Air Berlin is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. They are always delayed, and for my flight from Berlin to Vienna they didn't even post it on the screens. I can't think of any positive over other airlines. They are not the cheapest and do not offer good quality. This airline fails on every aspect of being an airline. Will never fly with them again.

### "try to use German Airlines but AB is a shame"
Flew Berlin to Munich. Delays and problems with handling luggage is not addressed here since this might be an issue of the airports. Nevertheless it is unbelievable what Air Berlin delivers to its customers. 1) The system delivers a seat which cannot be changed - if you are about 6'3" it's a real pleasure to have a middle seat. 2) Air Berlin might have economic problems but that does not mean they must give cheapen their "customer-relationship". I am German and so try to use German Airlines but AB is a shame.

### "these guys are a joke"
Berlin Tegel to Prague. Never ever will I fly with Air Berlin again, everything seemed nice and smooth from the check in to checking in our baggage but once we landed and we went to collect our checked in baggage we where hit with a shock! Half the flight was missing their baggage (mind you this aircraft had only 70 people on board) ground crew in the Prague told us they always do this and were not surprised. They believe that the bags were still in Berlin and sometimes take weeks to arrive. Now I understand these things happen so I left it and waited no one ever gets in touch with you, I tried emailing ofcourse there was no response. Tried calling the numbers on the website of course they didn't exist. You are better off catching trains around Europe or find proper a airline because these guys are a joke!

### "all very confusing"
Vienna to Krakow via Berlin Tegel. One week. 4 Air Berlin flights, 3 delayed and to close the story a lost luggage for 26 hours. You book Air Berlin, but you fly Alitalia, where they speak Italian in a route between Vienna and Berlin. Or worse you fly with Air One, which supposedly ceased operations in 2014. It's all very confusing. The phones lines both Air Berlin and Berlin Tegel airport are not available all day. Nobody is answering your emails and you don't receive information where or when your luggage will be delivered. Bad, bad, bad.

### "worst airline experience"
Budapest to Reykjavik via Berlin. Probably the worst airline experience. The worst customer service, nobody able to help you anyhow on their hotline and when you write them through their web form, they don't respond. Lost all 4 of our check-in baggage, which arrived 4 days after us. I called/wrote them several times asking how should we handle the lost baggage, I've got a serious reply the 11th day of our 12 day holiday. Except that we flew our first flight with some old Italian plane and crew (should have been Air Berlin), leg space was really small, 3h 30 min flight without anything to drink.

### "will never fly them again"
Copenhagen to Berlin. Terrible customer experience I have had delayed luggage before and realize it is a risk of flying. My partner and I both had our bags not show up on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Berlin (1 hour flight) and it took 3 and 4 days respectively to get our bags. The issue was not the delayed bags but the complete lack of proper communication which could have addressed our concerns and stress. On our flight, at least a dozen people had same issue. No representative present, no informative communication. Automated messages saying no updates were not effective. No number to reach a person. I called numerous times the number I located and emailed and no answer ever at number and email was simply automated with no information. When I finally received an update that my luggage had arrived in Berlin, I asked to confirm where to pick up to ensure they did not deliver to hotel I was leaving at, and never any reply over several hours. I showed up at Berlin baggage service centre on way out of city and they could not locate. I went to the air Berlin business class counter and the woman staffing refused to help and had zero empathy and was rude. I asked for her manager who had same lack of empathy. I asked to speak to her manager and he was finally the first person who tried to help and brought a luggage person who tried as well. But by this point I had lost my patience with air Berlin. They could not locate my luggage. Finally an hour before I left the city - four days after arriving - my luggage was located at the baggage service centre. I still have not received any apology for air Berlin nor any information on delayed flight compensation process and forms. After reading these reviews it is clear it is an airline issue much larger than my own experiences. All air Berlin had to do was provide simply updates each day with facts: "your luggage has not left Berlin, we are trying to get it to you by ddmmyy. And I would have been fine however the lack of any human being reachable and the lack of empathy by their business class check in counter and her manager mean I will never fly them again.

### "outraged by Air Berlin"
New York to Bologna via Dusseldorf, July 3rd 2017. The departure time at JFK was 9:40pm (Flight No. 7481). I was at the check-in point with plenty of time (7:00pm.) The flight attendant told me "there is a 3-hour delay because a baby got sick on the plane and they had to land. She told me not to worry my connecting flight layover was 3.5 hours so I would have made it and they would have made up some time during the flight. At the gate I was told they had to change my connecting flight to Bologna to a later flight at 8:30pm instead of 2:55pm (a serious problem for me), but they told me that they only did that as a precaution in case I cannot make it to the original flight (at 2:55pm) which is what I had booked. The attendant at the gate told me that once in Dusseldorf I would have been able to take the Flight 8686 at 2:55pm. We boarded at 12:45am with more than 3 hours delay. We finally took off and on board I asked what I should do once in Dusseldorf. They said as soon as outside the aircraft look for the information point with Air Berlin attendants and they would have told me where to go to get to the original flight 8686. The flight attendant sent me to Gate B56 and warned me to "hurry" because the flight was departing in less than an hour. I ran to Gate B56 only to find no one there. I went to another attendant who told me that Flight AB 8686 was at Gate 44 two floors down. I ran again with a heavy backpack and a carry-on. I had to stop to catch my breath and I felt dizzy. Two police officers saw me and asked me if I was OK. I had to explain what happened to them because they were concern about my health. I finally made it to Gate B44. The Flight 8686 also departed with about 15 minutes delay. On board,  I had to pay for coffee €2.50 for a regular coffee. At that point I only wanted to get to my final destination. We landed in Bologna BLQ about 10 minutes late. There I had the final humiliation: my baggage was missing. I went to Baggage claim and was told that probably my suitcase was moved to a later flight which will land at night around 10:30pm. I filed a complaint form there and they told me they should call me if the baggage arrives and I would have to go back to the airport to pick it up. It is now 9:30pm and on the Air Berlin website there still no information about my baggage. This has been a horrible experience. I will now have to go back to the airport to hopefully pick up my luggage tonight. I'm exhausted and outraged by Air Berlin.

### "awful customer service"
Warsaw to Abu Dhabi via Berlin Tegel. This airline has awful customer service when things go wrong. On June 30 our 21.50 flight transfer to Abu dhabi got cancelled until 16.00hr the following day but it actually took off even later by 2 hours. My wife and I arrived in Abu Dhabi 20 hours late minus our checked in cases. We filed a lost luggage report. We filed 2 complaints on Air Berlins site and tried to find out luggage on their tracer but nothing seems to work. The number they gave us didn't work and the pir number finds no match. We know our luggage is sitting in a store in Berlin. We've sent the baggage tags which the checkin should have changed for the delayed flight to Abu Dhabi but they told us to keep the old ones. We have been trying for days to contact Air Berlin to no avail as have Etihad their partner from Abu Dhabi. No contact at all. I've set up a facebook group to share their tales of woe and Air Berlin threatened to block me on their social media for doing so. Inflight service is fine but their ground staff and customer service are the worst I've encountered in hundreds of flights with different airlines. They've lost my custom and my wife's.

### "the worst airline service I experienced"
I travel very frequently for business and pleasure to Europe and this is by far the worst airline service I experienced within the past 10-15 years. The aircraft servicing flight from Chicago to Berlin was very old, seats did not recline, majority of TV screens did not work, despite the crews effort to reboot the audio system. Normally, obstacles like this wouldn't impact me, but traveling with kids makes a big difference (try to explain to your child he won't be able to recline the seat or use TV on 9 hrs flight). Lastly, and most importantly, Air Berlin lost our luggage. There were about 30 + other passengers flying on the same flight who reported missing luggage. It is been a week and we did not hear back from the airline. We sent about 11 emails to different departments with copies of claim, lost baggage tags, etc. No response. Furthermore, none of the telephone numbers provided on the website are working numbers. I do not recommend this airline and certainly will not consider it for any future travel.

### "will never fly with them again"
Air Berlin is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. They are always delayed, and for my flight from Berlin to Stockholm they didn't even post it on the screens. I can't think of any positive over other airlines. They are not the cheapest and do not offer good quality. This airline fails on every aspect of being an airline. Will never fly with them again.

### "the leg space was also reasonable"
We traveled from Düsseldorf to Milano Linate with Air Berlin. The service on board of the Airbus aircraft was good. They offered a drink and a sweet or salty snack for free. Furthermore we recieved a chocolate heart. The biggest downside of this flight was the delay of 2.5 hours, due to this we lost a lot of time which we wanted to spend in Italy. The seats were comfortable and the leg space was also reasonable. The cabin crew was friendly and highly motivated.

### "I will not be flying with them again"
I flew round trip from Boston to Stockholm. Extremely disappointed with Air Berlin. When I checked in at Boston airport and I was told that one of my connecting flights did not exist any more. I never received an advance notice making me aware of this. Instead of 2 flights, I had 3. The new flights were booked too close to each other. We barely made the flights, but our luggage didn't make it to our final destination. Our new flight back also required 3 flights, all extremely close to each other. I called customer service to see if they could change us to a better route. I was assured that since we were flying Air Berlin the entire way, our luggage and we would make it to our final destination together. (We were shuffled to another airline on our way over.) Unfortunately, all of our returning flights departed late and our luggage was lost a second time. Also, two out of three flights back didn't have soap in the restrooms. That wouldn't have been a big deal on its own, but just added to our list of frustrations with Air Berlin. I will not be flying with them again.

### "Customer Service is non-existent"
This was my first time flying with Air Berlin on a trip from Chicago to Salzburg and a return flight from Prague to Chicago. It was the worst airline experience I have had in about 20 years of frequent flying. Here are some key reasons: Customer Service is non-existent. No one ever answers their phone number and their online service always returns an error message. I tried for two weeks both online and on telephone with one simple request, to upgrade my seat on my return flight (in other words, pay them more money!). One night, with Expedia on the line with me, we waited on hold for 95 minutes and I finally fell asleep at 1am. Also, with one exception on return flight, every single Air Berlin person I dealt with was not only extremely poor at customer service, but even rude. One flight attendant was just mean to the person in front of me who asked if they could give them their trash. Another flight attendant was rude when I asked a simple question at the counter. Another in baggage claim area in Berlin was rude. Their seats in economy are smaller than any other airline seat I have experienced. I had an eight hour flight with the seat back in front of me literally 10 inches from my face. I am 5 feet 5 inches and my knees hit the seat in front of me the whole time. Be aware they will charge you $60-100 extra just to pick a seat - any seat, including economy - in advance of your flight. The WIFI does not work. I paid for WiFi going over and back and was never able to get on it. The flight attendants were no help whatsoever and were again rude when I inquired The worst part was that I experienced two delayed flights - one from Berlin to Salzburg and one from Berlin to Chicago. Both were handled terribly. When I arrived late in Chicago to make my connection to MSP, I literally ran to the gate and got there in time to get on the flight, but Air Berlin without my consent or knowledge had changed my flight to a flight 4 hours later instead and American Airlines would not let me get on my original flight. When I called Air Berlin to complain about this while sitting in ORD for 4 hours, I again waited on hold for 2 hours and finally decided they did not deserve any more of my time or effort in giving them feedback. They probably won't even read this or care, but I wanted to alert other travelers - avoid this airline!

### "incredible lack of communication"
I fly a lot, actually I'm one of those who commute every week. I find its hard to say I will never fly this airline again as: 1) I have to be flexible with the availability and 2) it would probably delete all options as there will most likely be unfortunate circumstances one time or another. Air Berlin is in a league of its own. The flights are usually delayed out of Budapest and not that its great, but its doable. But what I don't get is the incredible lack of communication. No one informs the 20 some passengers that the connecting flight will be there waiting. They don't at all care about the stress the passengers are in. Side note: If you are unlucky to be parked in another terminal (20 minutes left to your departure), they will not take any effort whatsoever in informing you where to go or even update the screens signalling delays. Then you're hit with a one lane open security control, again they don't care if the flight you're about to take is leaving in 5 minutes its slow. Yesterdays flight, once we got in the bus, the driver hacked this thing causing most of us to almost fall over and then once out of the bus, they refused to open the doors cause there was another group let in from another plane in the connecting terminal. Now we were running extremely late and running to the gate. All gates had the destinations show on the screen as is usually the case, except for the one going to Stockholm, so we ran up and asked and were brushed off. They tell us to go outside and what do we find? A bus parked right by the gate a plane right in front of us and one far to the right and again, nothing is marked. I mean, when you fly Ryanair or Wizz Air or any of these cheepy ones, its all marked. Why is this so difficult to figure out? Well obviously it is not, it is due to the lack of care. They think their passengers are a painful must. No communication whatsoever. All this anxiety and stress for the passengers, especially when you're taking the last flight out is unnecessary. Last time I flew them, my luggage got stuck in Berlin for 4 days. I have one more ticket in my pre-purchased pile and then that's it. Never again. All the issues with Air Berlin could be mitigated with care and communication. But I guess they have so many they don't have to worry about it.

### "good service with reasonable prices"
Boston to Copenhagen via Dusseldorf. Excellent outbound flight with efficient and personal service by cabine crew. Seamless transfer in Düsseldorf. Return flight with same route. Delayed departure but on time arrival. Outstanding purser but desinterested and demotivated cabin crew, at least mine. Counterpart had to check all passengers in biz class while the one assigned to me sat in one of the passengers seats for the last part of the flight. Overall, I would recommend this business class, good service with reasonable prices.

### Air Berlin customer review
Orlando to Munich via Düsseldorf. The worst airline ever. Going back to Orlando, they first delayed by an hour, then an additional half hour, before I knew what was happening, 4 hours later and still at the gate. The staff was unprofessional, they seemed annoyed at customers asking them about the delays.

### "overall service was great"
Overall a great service from Berlin to Chicago with Air Berlin. Full recline seats. Purser took much care. The meals where in very good quality and served in a good way. Wine corresponded perfectly. The entertainment could be a little more extensive and the remote was a little cumbersome. But overall service was great!

### "need a better terminal"
San Francisco to Berlin was good, attentive staff. The arrival in Berlin was dismal. Baggage was slow even with "priority", the plane lands and a bus takes you to the terminal. The trip from Berlin to Paris, scheduled for noon or so was resceduled to 6pm for unknown reasons since they don't tell you, so I requested and got a flight for the next day. Arriving at the same terminal, the route to the gate was up 30 feet of stairs, into an upstairs tunnel, down 30 feet back to the terminal without conveniences but lots of duty tree. Then back into a bus, carry bags onto the plane this time with bags because I assume luggage service at CDG equally bad. They need a better terminal!

### "the personnel were matter of fact"
Berlin to Frankfurt. I have used Air Berlin for the first time and the last time. They overbooked the 8.50am flight, AB6577, flying from Berlin to Frankfurt by 10 seats. They bumped us and told us they could not book us another flight the same day. They offered us a 2nd class train ticket and told us to take a bus to the train station. They did not offer to pay for a hotel if we flew out the next day. Overall the personnel were matter of fact. This is our company policy. Take it or leave it. But don't make me repeat it. I don't know how airlines can get away with selling seats multiple times. It's not worth it to fly Air Berlin to save a couple of Euros. Next time we choose an airline that knows what quality service is.

### "this company is a shame"
Paris to Krakow via Berlin. On May 19 my partner and myself were supposed to flight Air Berlin from Paris to Krakow via Berlin with a first flight leaving Paris at 3pm and an arrival in Krakow scheduled at 6.40 pm. The initial flight has been delayed by nearly 2 hours and we missed the connection. Nothing has been arranged to put us on another of the Air Berlin flights to Krakow on the evening the same day or early morning the next day. When we arrived at Berlin around 6pm we had to queue for 2 hours and 45 mns at the Company desk, where finally at 9.30 pm we were placed on a flight to Stuttgart at 8.20 am the next day with a connecting flight there. We arrived at 6.20 am at the Airport on the 20, to discover that our flight to Stuttgart had been cancelled! There was an earlier flight to Stuttgart but they refused to take us while they had vacant seats! We had then again to queue two hours at Air Berlin desk and finally got bookings for flights to Krakow via Munich leaving Berlin at 7 pm. We arrived in Krakow at 11.05 pm the 20th May, thus 32 hours after the scheduled departure from Paris. And to add insult to injury, it is impossible to get from the Company reimbursement of the expenses I had to bear during this unexpected stop of 24h in Berlin! This company is a shame!

### "won't recommend to anyone"
Flight from Berlin to Paris was delayed 1.30 hour. I only received a bottle of water and 2 cheap biscuits as compensation although I missed my last train and therefore had to pay €50 for a cab. First time I booked Air Berlin but won't recommend to anyone.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
Took this overnight flight as a codeshare with Etihad Airways. My partner and I chose to upgrade ourselves to the XL seats which is like the Premium Economy with an increased legroom and seat pitch compared to the normal Economy seats for a price of EUR77. Very pleasantly surprised with the the entire journey. New plane, great cabin crew, good entertainment and comfortable seats. Being at the front of the plane meant that there was ease in getting out and coming in and the XL seats around us were empty despite economy being full. Cabin crew offered to sell these seats to the economy passengers but only 1 was taken up. Seating arrangements were 2-4-2 and as soon as the plane took off my partner got to sit at the 4 empty rows next to us. Food was good but a little small. Overnight flight felt so short and a part of me wished it was a little longer so I could have a longer snooze. All in all would recommend this airline to others and suggest upgrading to the XL seats.

### "crews were friendly and professional"
Zurich to New York return via Berlin Tegel in Business Class. This was an amazing experience and everything went according to plan. The crews were friendly and professional. I am a Star Gold as well as a One World Emerald member and in my opinion Air Berlin and Etihad are ahead of the competition with their personalized service concept in business class (no lights on for two hours after take off and then again two hours before landing and a personalized inflight service concept, on demand with no disturbing factors. An outstanding product with just 19 seats in business class. I could also use the AA first class lounge at JFK which is new and amazing. I would strongly recommend Air Berlin.

### "has trouble with basic services"
Berlin TXL to Frankfurt. Air Berlin has trouble with basic services and staff appears to be trained to deceive customer support requests. Flight AB6601 on 19 May cancelled without reason along with several other Air Berlin flights departing from Berlin TXL on that evening. No offer of compensation, no answers to calls, unfriendly and unhelpful staff at all counters. Due to the masses of people and the chaos at TXL at that time, checked-in baggage could not be reclaimed on that day. I had another flight in the morning next day from Frankfurt to Taiwan, which thanks to Lufthansa I was able to catch. My baggage is gone since even though I never even entered an Air Berlin plane but only checked-in. I cannot reach anybody at Air Berlin, emails remain unanswered.

### "Never fly this airline"
Düsseldorf to Boston. Never fly this airline. The worst by far. They cancel flight and move people to different flights with different destinations. Then you are on your own. You have to buy new ticket to wherever your destination is. They hassle you to collect what you paid. No apologies or regret in their actions.

### "friendly and service orientated crew"
New York JFK to Berlin Tegel. My first experience with Air Berlin and quite impressed. While there were delays with boarding at JFK and it took an hour for baggage to be delivered to the belt in TXL with no explanation from ground staff, inflight they were very good. Comfortable seat, nice food, acceptable wine list and extremely friendly and service orientated crew. For the short hop across the pond and direct into Berlin I'd choose them again. Had I not checked bags and had the significant delay with baggage delivery in TXL, this flight would have been seamless.

### "never fly with airberlin again"
Munich to Stockholm via Dusseldorf. Horrible service (lengthy information on our flight in German, a very short in English, I did recognise Stockholm so I assumed the we might miss our connection). At airport no information on flight being delayed, no one in boarding booth, Lady in next booth didn't speak English. Stewardess spoke German and unintelligible English, never got a chance to buy a sandwich on either flights, never offered free coffee. I will never fly with airberlin again. I much more prefer Norwegian, great price with professional service (I fly regularly to UK with them).

### "I haven't got on board"
Frankfurt to Berlin Tegel AB6588 is cancelled. Firstly they asked to wait for 2 more hours and then cancelled. The worst airline, terrible! I'm staying in a huge line to get my money back. Can't say anything about their service - I haven't got on board.

### "I would fly Air Berlin again"
Berlin to Abu Dhabi. The flight had a slight delay, but nothing serious. We had a remote gate and walked like 50m to the parking spot of the plane. I like the 2-4-2 configuration, because we travelled as a group of 2. We had a window and an aisle seat. The seat width is good, but the seat pitch was poor. I am 1,82m and my knees touched the seat in front of me. It is not as abd as on other airlines but it could be better. I couldn't sleep on this flight at all. But the rest of the fight was enjoyable. We had a very friendly and attentive stewardess and the food was delicious. One of the IFE screens across the row stopped working and one member of the cabin crew changed it immediately. All in all I would fly Air Berlin again, if there is no better alternative.

### "excessive baggage fees"
Copenhagen to Munich via Dusseldorf. I've just been swindled by Air Berlin. When I booked the trip, I was given one piece of baggage in the fare. When I called them to add a second piece they charged me $101 for it. I was stunned. I was expecting $25 - $35 perhaps for the second bag. They even sent me an email advertising extra baggage for 10 Euros if I booked it more than 30 hours out. That's a laugh. They must be into false advertising. Maybe I'm living in an unrealistic world, but with high status on United, I get two free bags on Lufthansa every time I use them and could have flown them more cheaply had I known about the excessive baggage fees. Moreover, I'm flying Air Berlin and Flybe to London City airport a few days later. They told me that I have to book my baggage at the airport because of the interline ticket, which is bound to be even more expensive. I will never fly Air Berlin again.

### "incompetent and disorganized airline"
I traveled from New York to Warsaw in April 2017. Returning from New York was delayed two hours so I missed the connecting flight to Warsaw. Air Berlin put us on a flight to Amsterdam and on another flight from Amsterdam to Warsaw. On top of that my luggage was lost and I had to wait three hours for it to arrive. Air Berlin get on the ball. Never have I seen such incompetent and disorganized airline. Never again will I fly Air Berlin.

### "worst experience with an airline"
Bucharest to Miami vis Sibiu, Munich. My worst experience with an airline so far. 3 weeks before departure, they changed dates and hours - technically I could choose to get my money back, but buying from another company with such short notice would have been much more expensive - what I paid for was Bucharest to Miami with one stop, what I got was the same with 3 stops - what I paid for was Miami to Bucharest with one stop, what I got was the same with 2 stops. I had to book a hotel room for one night in Berlin because the flights were not in the same day after the change they made (still waiting for a refund), and they failed to deliver the luggage in Miami. It arrived after 2 days - out of 4 Air Berlin flights, 3 were delayed by approx 1 hour each. AirBerlin call-center is bad. They say on the web-site is 24h, but that's not true. If you call them when they don't work, they don't say come back at operating hours. They just let you listen to bad music indefinitely on your own expense. and when they do answer, they even give incorrect answers (like saying Bucharest to Munich is a direct flight, which was certainly not.

### "Reserved seat was ignored"
Frankfurt to Palma de Mallorca. Reserved seat was ignored, it looks not unusual. My family booked 4 seat together beforehand in website. But boading pass we got in airport forced us to seat far location each other. One lady kindly changed her seat for my son 8 years old to my next seat. She was forced to seat separately with her husband instead. My wife and daughter 11 years old are forced to seat one by one separately.

### "how useless Air Berlin are"
I recently flew from Bangkok to Warsaw with Etihad. No problems with the Etihad flight but they code share with Air Berlin for the Abu Dhabi to Berlin leg and again Air Berlin on the Berlin to Warsaw leg. The fun began when I was informed my Berlin to Warsaw flight was cancelled resulting in me hanging around for hours for the next flight - ok that's a pain but not the end of the world. What happened next just proved to me how useless Air Berlin are. Having arrived in Warsaw I then found out they had lost all of my 3 bags, the handling company in Warsaw could tell me nothing because they rely on Air Berlin for information and I was one of over 100 people who had the same problem . I tried to get information on what was going on but you can not - there is no telephone no to speak to someone just a website that tells you they are looking for the bags, which is just frustrating not helpful. After 4 days of wearing the same clothes all my bags were found but no offer of an apology or compensation for me having to spend 4 days with no clothes to change and no toiletries to freshen up.

### "a shameful lack of service"
Prague to Berlin. The worst customer service I have experienced in 30 years of global travel. I and thousand of other had their luggage lost at Tegel airport this easter weekend. No customer service. You are directed to WISAG who they have outsource the baggage handling to. All WISAG does is direct you to a iPad and make you file your own report. Huge line up, hours long, only one clerk. They never email you to tell you the status of your baggage, they never answer the phone numbers given, they never answer the emails sent. It's been 4 days zero response. Called the Air Berlin reservation number and they say call WISAG. WISAG is totally non responsive. So basically Air Berlin says we don't care not our problem it is your problem. Destroyed my easter weekend. Flying home without luggage. Only shopping day during the holiday was Saturday which I spent replacing cloths. Air Berlin has provided a shameful lack of service. I read they delayed there long haul flights because they have a new company handling their luggage. They have been on the job since March 26 and they are even more useless than the old company. T

### "worst service in business class"
New York JFK to Duesseldorf. The worst service in a business class cabin I've received. There was nothing that I could say positive about this flight 7481 of Air Berlin departing April 8 from JFK to Dusseldorf. Arrived at JFK with more than 3 hours in advance. There were people in the priority /business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site, were gone for a break , and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through, and when I complained, a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers (was no way this gentleman could know, without asking, whether I was going also to Berlin?) When we arrived at the time of boarding (we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay), we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft, and make the catering. When we finally boarded, never were we were approached by our names, I had to wear my jacket, since nobody came to ask for it. Food (bad catering), but that was not all. My dinner selection was Rissotto with a pinot grigio; the staff brought me the rissotto  with a red wine; when I told her that that was not my wine, and that I order the grigio, I think I spoke in esperanto, since she had no idea what I was talking about: I said white wine, and she said ok, and she never came back with the wine. Tire of waiting, I sipped a horrible red wine, and my wife took it and changed it for a chardonnay she was having. Dessert with the whole tray occupied with the other plates. The cabin was a mess, the flight staff spent the flight running, coming and going, and that is the reason why I did not have the chance to request for some better treatment. My only comfort was that this was a 6 hours flight. At the end, when we were to land the flight attendant asked me to put my jacket back since I couldn't have it in my hands. A business ticket with an economy class treatment.

### "check-in staff unfriendly and impatient"
Tel Aviv to Berlin with Air Berlin. So everything starts in the airport. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight. The check-in staff were really unfriendly and impatient. Told us that the flight was full and we can't move for another seats (we sat near the toilet) but when we arrived at the airplane we saw a lot of free seats. After the takeoff, we were expecting for a little snack or a sandwich but we didn't get anything the whole flight. It's unbelievable because we paid 800$ per ticket. I don't know what's the problem with Air Berlin because it's not the first time I am flying with them. At the past they were an excellent airline. Not recommended.

### "will not choose again"
Went on a round trip Stockholm-Berlin for a long weekend. On the way, the Air Berlin flight was about 30 min late. When landing in Berlin, there were no buses that could take us to the terminal. We were stuck in the plane for about 30 min before any buses came. We are now on the way back to Stockholm, and the latest information says that the flight is 40 min delayed. Just hoping to get home soon. I will not choose Air Berlin again, no matter how cheap the tickets are.

### "Great service and friendly crew"
New York JFK to Berlin. Great service and friendly crew. When I booked, I saw some people reporting bad reviews about them, I was sceptical. I must say I was beyond happy and grateful that I flew with them.

### "cabin crew was unfriendly"
Abu Dhabi to Berlin. The cabin crew in our section was unfriendly. When asked for milk for my coffee she just waved it, never said a word, no smiles, no response in English. I had the person next to me translate. Nobody looked at passengers when we entered the plane, the crew talked to each other and we were just not greeted with a smile like all other companies I have flown with. I had to make this review, as it was not a good atmosphere, I felt really uncomfortable and it was quite a long flight.

### "enjoy free baggage allowance and seat selection"
Flew Air Berlin from Milan to Berlin. Of course, you should not expect lots of comfort here (the seats are quite narrow) and there is no free food, but for a short-range flight it's not that critical. What you get is reduced price and nice Topbonus frequent flyer program which allows to collect miles fast. Once you achieve Silver tier, you can continue buying relatively cheap tickets, but also enjoy free baggage allowance and seat selection.

### "young cabin crew was polite and professional"
Flew Air Berlin to Vienna for a short business trip: they are the only option from Linate airport and for me it is much better than flying Austrian from Malpensa since I can save half an hour drive to get to MXP. Bought my ticket in December and paid about EUR 180,00 including one checked bag and seat selection. Both flights were perfectly on time, check-in was a breeze, the young cabin crew was polite and professional and and planes clean and modern. More than enough to be satisfied and to declare that I will surely fly them again for short haul flights inside Europe.

### "cannot really expect my luggage"
Munich to Warsaw via Berlin. Air Berlin was late about an hour at boarding, at departure 2hrs. In Berlin I had to transfer to connecting flight to Warsaw, which was to depart 30 min before the first flight's late arrival. Hustling off the plane, there was no bus to bring us to the terminal, which literally was 15m away. After 5 min, there was a bus to bring us these 15m. Inside the terminal, I was running to catch the next flight. It took about 5 min, just to notice me boarding the plane right next to the one I came in with. After having seated, we were told that we need to wait for another 30min because one passenger did not show up but his luggage was loaded, so it had to be unloaded. About 2h late departure. Arrived in Warsaw, I was told my luggage did not arrive, because there was too short time in Berlin to transfer my luggage. Air Berlin staff knew this already in Berlin, but decided to tell us upon arrival in Warsaw. However, how was there 30 min to unload luggage but not to load transfer luggage? Being left without christmas presents and without any clothes one day before christmas, I was also told that before 2 days after christmas I cannot really expect my luggage. Thank you Air Berlin for ruining christmas. Never again.

### "the airline looks better"
Berlin Tegel to Bucharest. I would start my review with the regret that Air Berlin has stopped flying to Bucharest and those were one of the last flights operated by them. I know it is tough to keep pace with Ryanair but since Air Berlin has moved towards a quality service experience for its customers, maybe it would have been nice to get this experience on this route too. I must say that since I fly Air Berlin (and that is a lot of time) I only had once or twice that my flight was delayed. And those flights to/from Bucharest were both ahead of schedule. I have read it is not always the case but from my experience and point of view, I was really impressed to see so many flights on time. The aircrafts they are flying are new (I suppose the kept only the new ones in their fleet after the restructuring last year) and as a topbonus platinum I always get a seat with extra leg-room which makes flying with them a joyful experience. There are some things that are disturbing: the inflight entertainment system only shows ads of Air Berlin and their partners together with their destinations, over and over again. This becomes too much after some time and they never change. They have an App which you can use on your own device for WiFi and entertainment, but for my surprise you had to pay for watching TV-Series as well, not only for using the WiFi. They are many airlines which offer this service for free. Another thing that I find not right are the prices for the in-flight snacks and drinks. I understand that this is a new market strategy (is it really part of that high quality experience they are talking about?) but there are operators offering decent prices, not 3,5€ for a mineral water. And the coffee was really bad: a bag exactly like tea infused in hot water. I would expect more quality from their famous "signature" coffee. I think things are changing and the airline looks better like it used to be some years ago. The cabin crew members are more friendly but there is still much to do. Many people say it has the corporation mentality and they attention for client is low and that is partially true. I think being closer to the client in any way will make this airline better.

### "just an unpleasant flight"
Berlin to Abu Dhabi. XL seats are good, great leg room and I found the seat very comfortable to sit on. Everything else was quite sad! Crew was cold and except for one flight attendant there were no smiles. None of them seemed happy or enjoying their job. Food was very disappointing, actually shocking how little it can be, and I am not a big eater. It was just an unpleasant flight.

### "do not recommend Air Berlin"
San Francisco to Munich. I started flying with Air Berlin from Germany to the US for business during a period of strikes by Lufthansa. I did a few flights with them with a few minor problems (delayed flights, delayed luggage); I kept using them as I had already a bunch of miles and a gold status, but the last one was very bad and is the last drop. Connecting in Berlin will require you to change terminals by walking outside and going over security again. Their lounges are so bad that are almost always worse than the comparable regular waiting areas from better airlines. A lot of their web site is not working, specially if you are accesing it from outside of Germany. Their phone app is buggy and of very limited functionality. It is very hard to get hold of them on the phone, you have to navigate a maze of menus to get there and then wait for long periods of time. Their phone service is very fragmented, once I get to talk with someone it often happens that he or she can not do what I need and I need to call again. My average has been four calls to get anything done; this is in total with waiting and menu navigation about 45 minutes. Their phone service is not 24 hours, if you are in a different time zone than Germany you may have to actually wake up in the middle of the night to call. It is practically impossible to make use of miles for flight upgrades in their own flights. It is effectively impossible to use their miles to upgrade or buy any service from other airlines on the network. Booking an award fligh on their own flights requires you to call them, again, this is difficult; you cannot do it online. My last return flight was cancelled and I arrived with a 12 hour delay back home, losing a whole work day; they didn't offer lounge access during my 12 hour wait at the San Francisco airport. Now they are delaying and dragging their feet with lots of bureaucracy to pay the compensation mandated by EU regulations. This is just what I can remember in one go, the list can go on. I definitely do not recommend using Air Berlin.

### "never fly with them again"
The flight from Berlin to Abu Dhabi is supposed to be sold in collaboration with Etihad. However, the experience of Air Berlin is million miles away from what I have experienced on Etihad. The staff use German as their first language of contact all the time - even on the fifth time when I spoke to them, they would still answer in German. They hardly ever smile or keep an eye contact. When the entertainment is switched on, you have to go and ask for the headset. They expect you to bring your own. We took off at 21.30 and received first refreshment 2 hours into the flight - I managed to watch a whole movie before they offer a glass of water. Considering that it's a night flight, they wait with delivering the supper until it's 2 am. Hardly anyone was still awake. Considering the food, they could hardly offer less: three spoons of overcooked pasta with tomato sauce, four crackers and two slices of cheese. And do not try to ask for another glass of wine - they never look at you. Terrible service and will never fly with them again.

### "not be a returning customer"
Stockholm to Düsseldorf return with Air Berlin. This was a cheap trip for me, except for the luggage which was well priced but all in all, a cheap trip. The seats were nice and the seat in front of me did not recline too much leaving me with good space. But then again I am a 1.61m short girl. The crew was not too pleasant or attentive. No help was given with the luggage at all, they just stood there. A girl next to me kept her cabin bag model large in an empty seat next to her during the whole flight, while I was forced to put my soft jacket on the floor under a seat. She could have asked to put it in the compartment for me - I got what I paid for I guess. Air Berlin thank you for taking me to Germany for a reasonable price but no thank you, I will not be a returning customer.

### "wouldn´t recommend it"
Hurghada to Munich. As somebody who flies various times per year I can say that this was the worst flight I've ever been on. First of all the positive : the service was unexpectedly well. On a four hour flight they served alcoholic beverages and some snacks for free what is not usual these days on low cost airlines. The worst part of the whole flight were the cramped seats. I´m 1,98 m tall (6'6ft) tall so I couldn't find any comfortable position. My knees hurt and I didn't have any space to rest my legs. Asked at the check in for a emergency exit row-seat they wanted to charge me 39EUR what is unjustifiable towards clients of my height. So I spent three hours standing in front of the toilets to avoid pain. This was the first and last time I've booked Air Berlin. If they aren´t able to provide decent space or service for tall costumers I see no reason to pay for a flight with them. Wouldn´t recommend it.

### "don't care about their customers"
Rhodes to Paris via Berlin. They made me pay a fee for lugagge (115€). They did not deliver the luggage on time, I had to wait 5 days and call the airport every day. My luggage arrived 5 days later damaged and my kitesurf board that was in the bag as broken. After contacting them for 5 months they still never did anything, they did not even send me a single message or gave me a call. They don't care about their customers.

### "ended almost 24 hours later"
It started in New York City and it all ended almost 24 hours later in Florence. The flight from NYC to Dusseldorf was 2 hours late (supposedly for an unspecified “change of equipment”) hence my flight from Dusseldorf to Florence had to be rerouted. Therefore I had to fly from NYC to Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf to Vienna (Austria), then from Vienna to Rome (IT) the from Rome to Florence. 4 flights. My baggage was lost and given to me after 3 days. On my way back, the flight from Florence to Dusseldorf was cancelled therefore I missed my connection flight for NYC. I spent 12 hrs in the airport in Florence without Air Berlin answering to my and all other passengers’ complaints. After 12hrs of waiting they put me on a flight to Rome. Arrived in Rome, they say that hotel rooms are waiting for us. I spent the night in the lobby of a Hilton Hotel with fellow passengers because staff at the hotel said that Air Berlin didn’t email them about our arrival. At 3:30am I went to the airport and boarded a flight to Dusseldorf, then one to Berlin, then one to New York. I got to NYC with a 24hrs delay. An offensive 5 Euros voucher for lunch was given to me.

### "outstanding experience today"
Dusseldorf to Los Angeles in Business class. Outstanding experience today. Amazing cabin crew with attention to detail. Great food choices as well and very comfortable seats. Enjoyed the inflight entertainment system as well. Usually fly on Lufthansa or Swiss but Air Berlin is much better in business class in my opinion.

### "inconvenience and rudeness"
Stockholm to Chicago. Air Berlin is the worst airline I've had an experience with. I landed in Chicago after four months of studying abroad in Sweden, only to see that myself and my friend didn't have any of our luggage arrive. This was on December 22nd so this clearly affected how our holidays were going to be spent. After calling, and calling, and emailing, they had lost my bag, found it again, lost it in Copenhagen, found it again - finally 6 days later on the 28th I received my bags. I missed a trip for Christmas, giving presents, all of my personal items etc. Air Berlin was rude about the process and I would never recommend flying with them if you have baggage. Air Berlin get a solid two thumbs down for inconvenience and rudeness.

### "tired business class product"
Berlin to Chicago. Pretty basic and tired business class product. Terminal at Tegel is little more than a hangar and there's no lounge. You do get a 15 euro voucher for food but that doesn't go very far. You have to walk to the plane. It's not far but it wouldn't have been pleasant if it was raining. Plane was a bit tired, food was adequate and entertainment was ok. Also flew with them economy from Copenhagen to Berlin. Both flights were part of a round the world trip so not sure how they compare cost wise. Suspect they are relatively cheap compared to others. In two minds as to whether I'd fly them again.

### "seats are horribly narrow"
Dusseldorf to Punta Cana. The seating in our plane (AB7446 on Jan 4th 2016) was NOT the one shown on any seating map we could find (not even Air Berlin's). Identical staggered cubicles but inverted window/aisle positions. E.g. second row had 02A (window) and not 02C (aisle), third row had 03C and not 03A and so on. Reason why you won't find my 03C on those maps. Seats are horribly narrow and not long enough in the flat position (I m 184 cm tall, you won't be comfortable lying if you are taller than 170 cm, I tend to think), the reading lamp not usable (light beam never illuminates your book page since there is no flexible support/stem like many airlines offer), and almost no room to put your belongings. Okay for day flight in the seating position. Obviously those seats are not keeping Air Berlin's attractive promises (see their website). They should be changed. These seats are light years away from Qatar Airways Boeing 773-ER's and 772-LR's heavenly comfort). I did not use the IFE unless to track the route. So no idea of IFE's value but it offers a wonderful large screen and terrific high definition for the route tracker. I did not use the connectivity either, unless to charge my tablet battery but there are various sockets available (including USB). Drinks generally OK, real Champagne being an asset. Lunch food was nothing fancy but generally okay, snacks not so okay. Excellent service by highly motivated and attentive flight attendants as well as remarkably professional and kind check-in agent. Amenity kit included slippers, a definite asset as far as hygiene is concerned. Cabin was clean. No separate business class counter during "night before check-in" service! Not acceptable in my opinion. My seat and general ratings as well as my recommendation would of course be much better if I were a small tiny person.

### "helpful crew and food was not bad"
Vienna to Los Angeles via Dusseldorf. We started our trip from the US very confused. When we booked our tickets we did learn that Air Berlin does not fly in the US and part of our flights were with American Airlines for US domestic. I liked that they did not charge for luggage and our luggage went all the Way to Vienna. Unfortunately one of the pieces of luggage did not make it until 12 hours later which was not too bad. The flight was pleasant, nice, helpful crew and the food was not bad. On the way home none of our 4 checked pieces of luggage came on time. We landed Monday night, and as of Friday we have not received them. It could be a really drawback if we were not home but trying to enjoy our vacation.

### "hope next aircraft seat design will improve"
Flew Air Berlin from Miami to Dusseldorf. Excellent caring, friendly and professional cabin crew. Captain and crew announcements too softly spoken and volume to low. Hard to understand. Food service on sector Duessldorf to Miami was 5 star. Food service Miami to Duesseldorf was 3 1/2 star. Miami joint businessclass lounge excellent. Business club cubicle in comparison to any other airline is overall well designed and functional but far too narrow. Average sized man has shoulders squeezed in, feels like undersized coffin. However I will recommend airline and fly again. Hope next aircraft seat design will improve.

### "helpful, friendly and professional crews"
ZRH to JFK via DUS in C. Excellent C service and product on both legs as always. Arrival in JFK 20 minutes ahead of schedule. After hundreds of short and longhaul flights in C and F with LH and LX I recently switched to Air Berlin for transatlantic flights after a satus macht from HON to AB Platinum. Really like the AB business product a lot more: 19 C seats only, proper lie flat seats and certainly not with cheap air cushions, no cheap trolleys coming down the aisle but proper restaurant style service with excellent foods and wines, very helpful, friendly and professional crews etc.. Last but not least, it usually only takes me about 10 minutes from the door of the plane to the taxi stand at JFK Terminal 8 wheras it can easily take 2 hours at the other terminals, specifically at the International Terminal 4. Finally, AB platinum status = Oneworld Emerald allows for First Class Lounge access across the entire Oneworld network with all Oneworld carriers as well as Etihad.

### "the service is improving"
Sofia to Berlin Tegel. Being my airline, as their Platinum member I must say that we do have a really complicated relationship. I fly them a lot inside Europe and the service is really depending on who is in the crew. It can be a delightful experience or it could be a disaster, although I must say that in the last year you can feel some change inside the management and the service is improving and becoming good, therefore I trust them and give them 10 points for the change they are developing. Some might say that paying for the snacks and drinks it is a downside but I do think that for flights shorter then 2h you really don't need all these. The prices they offer are OK and the quality of the products has improved. You still get the chocolate heart when exiting the aircraft. The planes they got after the restructuring are in very good shape. Not mentioning that the flights are almost all the time landing on time or even before schedule. It is still very difficult to use their website in order to buy tickets and this needs improvement. The mobile apps are sometimes too long under maintenance and you cannot use all the features, but at least people are well informed about it. I really hope this airline will get back on track because in my opinion is the best German airline and it brings up the spirit of Berlin (those living in this city probably know what I mean).

### "good experience for exchanging miles"
Dusseldorf to Los Angeles. We are talking here about the too much advertised (on all their Europe flights on their entertainment screens) new Air Berlin business class seats which indeed are new, the technology is great, but they are to narrow. I tried to sleep, I couldn't. It was indeed a day flight, so I wasn't probably that tired. I was expecting more from their "Sansibar" exclusive menu and the portions could have been more generous and served more often for an almost 12h flight. I got the opportunity to fly business as an upgrade to economy offered by the airline to its frequent flyers' program and I must say it was a good experience after all. Not the best business class I have flown, but a good experience for exchanging miles.

### "an insult to passengers"
Air Berlin Topbonus Frequent Flyer Program is an insult to passengers. For my upcoming flight from JFK to Berlin Tegel on Jan 11, 2017 (AB 2749) I tried to redeem miles for a seat reservation for an XL seat. For some reason I could not reach the Topbonus office in Berlin by phone. Constantly got a busy signal. The US booking office could not and would not handle the request either. They, however, sent two e-mail to Berlin to have that office call me back instead. No response. In dismay I requested to speak to the manager of the US office. She was extremely arrogant, refusing to come to the phone letting me know through an intermediary that I should keep calling Berlin. 7 e-mails with my request were not honored either. I got a standardized computer response: "we will handle your request with utmost care" and ultimately: "it can only be handled by phone". Finally connecting by phone I paid for every minute on hold for my transatlantic call. Nobody got on line in a reasonable time. I gave up willing to lose the miles that expire by end of year. While I find the flights and attendants typically very pleasant, customer service and customer care of the ground service is humiliating and degrading. Very unfortunate for an airline in economic trouble.

### "Worst customer experience ever"
Barcelona to Stockholm via Dusseldorf. Lost luggage, an 8hr delay, zero information, and landed at destination after midnight. Missed connecting train and had to take rental car (based on instructions from Air Berlin staff). I received a 10€ check for meals. Was denied email and phone service. I filed two complaints which was left without reply. Luggage turned up a few days later without notice. Claims for direct costs rejected. Worst customer experience ever.

### "Worst experience ever"
Venice to JFK via Dusseldorf. Worst customer support ever. Cancel connecting flight with no agents at gate notifying you. Hundreds of passengers left hanging in foreign airport looking for someone to figure out what was going on. Lost luggage and then claimed not their responsibility - it was the problem of airport baggage handlers. Customer service team not able to give Valid email or telephone numbers for assistance. Worst experience ever.

### "onboard service was very good"
First time in Business Class on Air Berlin from Chicago to Berlin. Seats are lie flat but quite narrow, and also short on length. In the flat position I had to bend my legs or have feet jammed against the end of the seat. The crew, food and drinks, and onboard service was very good. Would definitely fly them again.

### "no space in the seats"
Rome to Curaçao via Düsseldorf with Air Berlin. There's no space in the seats. We're 173 and 183 cm and our legs couldn't fit. After take-off the passenger in front of my husband kept reclining his seat up and down. When we called the steward to ask him for a solution as the man was literally crashing and recrashing on my husband knees he answered us irrespective that he couldn't do much. Result: 8 hours of hell. Food was miserable. We're now waiting for the flight back - at the check-in we asked for a seat with a little of more space and they answered we would have to spend other 84€ each for the seats near the exit. We paid 1000€ each in August to fly in December. I travel often in North, Central and South America with different companies, Air Berlin is the worst.

### "service provided is very bad"
Never buy tickets with long haul flights being operated by a partner airlines. I was flying to Munich to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi, the Munich to Abu Dhabi flight operated by Air Berlin. The service provided by Etihad is very bad if you book with their partner airlines. Etihad does not even care, very rude service. Any question asked to Etihad representatives is met by a rude answer 'ask Air Berlin'. I would have if the Air Berlin counters were present at the transfer desk.

### "worst flight experiences"
Miami to Dusseldorf on Air Berlin. One of the worst flight experiences: the seat is the most squeezed I have flown, similar to EasyJet, but long haul. Service is ordinary befitting a cheap airline. Air Berlin fails to recognize One-World partner Elite Membership for extra seating, which is offered only to their members (while AA offers to partners). Check in staff 'knows nothing' about lounge, but the AA Miami Lounge turned out to be the only good thing on this trip. The fare is cheap but false economy: AA is much better.

### "avoid this nasty airline"
Dusseldorf to Berlin. A short flight, my connection between Miami and Berlin, and as such it should be OK but I am frustrated. I had booked an aisle seat but on boarding I found it changed unnoticed to a middle seat. While the flight is short and endurable, I vow to avoid this nasty airline which has failed in many respects, not befitting the German name for supposedly quality.

### "not caring about their customers"
We should have flow from KEF to TXL and then to ZRH but we were diverted to Leipzig as they did not have enough fuel on board to enter into a holding for 20 minutes when we reached Berlin. After two hours we were then taken to Berlin by bus with no rebookings arranged for the connecting flights. I then had to stay in TXL for almost 24 hours as they refused to book me on an earlier flight to Zurich even though they had seat availability in business class. Plus I am also a One World Emerald member. The worst thing about Air Berlin is actually not that things consistently go wrong, but they have a terrrible corporate culture of not caring about their customers.

### "Air Berlin lost a client"
I purchased a $3,000 business class ticket from Los Angeles to Düsseldorf. Since I am a professional musician I made sure to speak over the phone with a Air Berlin manager to confirm I would be able to carry my $ 150.000 guitar with me as my only carry on baggage. The Air Berlin manager assured me that following the US Federal law I should not have a problem. When I arrived to the LAX airport, the Air Berlin manager on duty refused to let me carry my guitar on board, she also refused to receive a printed copy of the US Federal law and she even refused my right as a passenger to speak to the senior flight attendant hoping to find a solution. She was simply impolite. If this is the treatment I received as a business class passenger with Platinum status on my Frequent Flyer with Air Berlin's alliance, I can´t imagine what is the general attitude towards the rest of passengers. Air Berlin lost a client. My advice is to let Air Berlin as your last flying carrier option to fly with. You might spend a little more with another carrier but at least you know that the customer service will be there for you for anything you may need for your journey.

### "I wish they had been nicer"
Bought my ticket one day in advance for $122 from Berlin Tegel to Dusseldorf, which was a very good deal. I got to the airport early to check my bag, and the guy told me my fare didn't include a checked bag. Fair enough. He gave me a paper slip and had me go to the ticket sales office to pay. They in turn sent me somewhere that had no sign, so they had to tell me again where to go. After finally being able to complete the transaction, I went and got my bag tag. The agent wasn't friendly and welcoming, only functional. The line to get through security was long and the waiting area tiny, but that's all about Tegel Airport, not Air Berlin. Boarding was fairly haphazard, but they got the job done in time for departure. We took off and landed a bit early with the lights off most of the way to DUS as it was an early morning flight. The flight attendants literally ran the cart through the aisle and sold drinks to maybe 3 passengers. Got my bag at DUS. Mission accomplished, but I wish they had been nicer.

### "operate company like a circus"
Venice to Dusseldorf. Air Berlin is average when their operation goes as planned, but at the slightest irregular operation they come apart and it is just chaos! Two years ago, I flew from Budapest to Berlin on a non-stop flight, but my luggage was delayed. I filled out a report at the airport, and didn't hear from them for three days and no one would answer the telephone, so I went back to the airport to learn that they had 500 pieces of baggage on hand and wouldn't let me look for my suitcase and they hadn't even entered my report into their computer! I got my suitcase back 13 days later and they ignored every attempt I made to get my interim expenses reimbursed (they were very modest). I had to travel on to Switzerland for a week without clothes and underwear. On the 19th, their inflight crew was "illegal" and so the flight was delayed 90", and so I missed my train connexion and had to purchase a new ticket for 39€. I asked for a reimbursement, but at least this time they answered and told me NO! It wasn't three hours so I am out of luck, and they had the moxie to write me, "We sincerely hope that you will accept our apologies and hope that you will continue to place your confidence in us. The only confidence I have in them is that they will operate their company like a circus. I advise you to make a connexion on a reliable company.

### "flight was up to expectations"
Berlin to Abu Dhabi on return to Australia, on A330 with 2x4x2 seat configuration. Late flight out at 8.55pm with slight delay 20+ minutes on departure from Tegel. Air Berlin offers extended/extra leg room seats for additional cost on this aircraft but not made aware of this till after flight, and not available on codeshare with Etihad, neither is seat selection for this section. Used Air Berlin a number of times and found service and efficiency to be good. We had a good experience with ground staff at Tegel check-in as the Taxi dropped us off at the incorrect terminal, the check-in staff at terminal provided excellent service in checking us onto the flight and arranging second leg seating. This allowed us to walk over to the correct terminal and drop off check luggage only avoiding a reasonable wait at the general check in - big thumbs up to Air Berlin ground staff. Flight was up to expectations and free of any issues or hassles. The service was very good and the food was slightly better than on Etihad, amenities well maintained and refreshments served throughout flight. Overall very good flight and would use and recommend Air Berlin in future.

### "would use this carrier again"
Flew Air Berlin as a co-share with Etihad out of Abu Dhabi to Berlin. Slightly delayed departure time. AB seat configuration 2 x 4 x 2, with seats 43H-K, Noticeably down grade on this aircraft from the A380, more dated appearance and fitout but well maintained and clean. Seat spacing reduced and generally more cramped feel, seat not particularly great or comfortable but bearable for 7hr flight - would not like to do any longer. Plane was close to capacity. Flight was up to usual German expectations for efficiency and service. I've noticed some general poor reviews for AB but not reflective of our experience (several long-short haul). The service onboard was very good and the food quality slightly better than the Etihad offerings, also noted 2 x meal services on 7 hr flight, which was the same as Etihad for 14hr flight. Cabin amenities well maintained in clean condition throughout the flight. On board entertainment - below other offerings and screen size a little on the small side to the more modern offerings but screen quality still good. Overall trip into Tegal was smooth and hassle free - still love Tegal for its compactness and convenience to CBD. Disappointing to note AB no longer provide their welcome to Berlin chocolate heart (Fassbender & Rauch) on departing the plane - really looked forward to this little parting treat. Would recommend and use this carrier again.

### "feels like a low-cost airline"
Frankfurt to Berlin. Austerity measures noticeable. To my disappointment, Air Berlin has practically abolished its inflight service on this route - no free beverage, no snack (fortunately, still a good-quality piece of chocolate). Beverages and snacks could be purchased but some of them were not available when asked for. The seats are very cramped. In summary, Air Berlin feels like a low-cost airline now - which it did not in the past. I have to state that flights were on time and flight attendants friendly - with the minimal service there was not much communication, though.

### "noticed a steady decline "
Stockholm to Berlin. I frequently fly with Air Berlin since a few years back, and have recently noticed a steady decline in the quality of the service. First Air Berlin started charging for baggage, then they wouldn't let you select a seat, and recently they removed the free drinks and snacks. I have not noticed any difference in the prices. Other than this, several other experiences have negatively affected my opinion. Recently my girlfriends bags were lost by Air Berlin (for the second time), and they promised she would get a refund for everything. We even called the support to make sure. However, all she got was a coupon to use when booking flights through the AB website. The value of the coupon was 1/3 of what the clothes cost. As for my personal experiences, a few months ago I missed a connecting flight because of the first flight was delayed. The lady at the service desk told me that I would not get anything because I had more than enough time to make it, eventhough I ran as fast as I could. As for the positive, the planes are rather clean and the prices are decent. Also Air Berlin flies to TXL.

### "the extra legroom is really valuable to me"
We booked our trip to Phuket on the Air Berlin website. The segments from Abu Dhabi were operated by Etihad Airways and the rest was operated by Air Berlin. Checked in online, but when we arrived at the airport we found out, that our seats from Abu Dhabi to Phuket had been reassigned to other passengers. Reason was, that Air Berlin can not access the Etihad Airways booking system. Hence our boarding passes were invalid and we did not get any window seats any more. Apart from that however, check in procedures were smooth and seamless. Air Berlin offers their XL seats (economy seats with more legroom) for free to their frequent flyers and I have to say, that I love them. They are exactly what I was looking after. I do not need any premium economy product where the food is the same but only presented differently. I get extra baggage allowance and other benefits from my frequent flyer status. So the extra legroom is really valuable to me. Even if I didn't get it for free, I would be more than willing to pay those 79€. The extra space allows you to stretch your legs and to find comfortable and relaxing position for a long haul flight. Boarding was done in an efficient way and we were able to take off on time. Pillows and blankets were distributed in advance, whereas the amenity kits (toothbrush, sleeping mask, ear plugs) were distributed after we were airborne. Shortly after take off the crew distributed a sandwich and announced, that there will be breakfast prior to our arrival in Berlin. By doing so, the crew was able to maximise sleeping time for their passengers. After snack service, water bottles were given to each passengers and the light was switched off. Breakfast service commenced 90 minutes before arrival The options included an omelette and pancakes. I picked the omelette, which was surprisingly tasty. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I can't wait to fly Air Berlin again.

### "will wait before I fly them again"
Zurich to Bucharest via Berlin TXL with Air Berlin. Punctual flights, on each leg aisle seats in the front of the airplane as I am Oneworld Emerald FT. Booked the flight a while ago and ordered lunch. This option is not available anymore. Meals also not onboard. Had to claim the money back, which was easy to do and fast with no complication. So far all ok. But I really do not understand their changes of service in the context, that they want to restructure as a smaller network carrier. Why reduce food and drinks to zero? Then the new biz class product (4 seats in the front row). Not even any special menu, but the option that you get what ever you want from the onboard food shop. There is a difference of several hundred Euros to a "Classic" fare ticket so if you have no intercontinental connection it's not worth the money. The other thing to observe, is to have plenty of spare money with you, if you want to buy food. CC reader was once not working and they could not change a 50 Euros bill. I like this airline and I'm ok to pay for food if I am hungry but it's definitely their problem to have enough change. I will wait a little until they have made the changes, before I will fly them again.

### "fare was cheap and my expectations were low"
The Paris to Berlin flight from Paris Orly was confusing. I thought it departed from Orly West as other One World flights but it actually departs from Orly Sud. The flight was ok. No beverage service, not even a drop of water. Air Berlin fare was cheap and my expectations were low. The good things is that, as a Sapphire member of other carrier, my checked bag fee is waived. So I have reason to be satisfied.

### "ample supply of food and beverages"
Flew Air Berlin from Berlin to Miami. My seat, on Row 20, should be 'extra', but it is not (wonder why this is the only Extra row without an extra pitch seat). Fortunately as a Gold card member I didn't pay extra for it. But great that the neighbouring seat is not occupied, though the seat pitch I gather is only some 9 inches, one of the worst. Service was good and there is ample supply of food and beverages at no cost, much better than for example SAS. Not a bad flight The dissatisfaction was only that Air Berlin flight departs from Tegel T3, which is small, congested, and under-equipped. There is no business class lounge, though the flight has business class.

### "never use their service"
My trip was from Moscow to Miami via Berlin, they didn't let me to use my ticket because i didn't have schengen visa, but i didn't plan to stay in Germany, I planned to stay in transit, but transit zone doesn't work on night, so... what should do transit passengers? Air Berlin didn't inform about this unique situation, they sold me ticket without any reference on airport's operating hours, almost all international airports are working 24 hours a day, even Heathrow allow transit passengers to leave airport for night, As I didn't use my first ticket, they annulled back ticket and I was not alone in this situation, there was couple who was in similar situation. Never use their service.

### "3 out of 4 flights delayed"
Very bad experience. Had connecting flight via Düsseldorf on the way to Dresden. 3 hours delay and the tickets booked to have a nice afternoon in Dresden, instead arriving at 6 pm. No information, no meal provided, nothing. On the way home flight from Dresden to Düsseldorf delayed, no Air Berlin staff to ask - I ws very worried I wouldn't make my connection flight with only 1 hour between. On the aircraft I again asked the staff - they didn't know anything, would tell me when they did. When we landed, still no information. On the way out of the aircraft they just said: you will make it. I asked what I should do, would we be picked up. The stewardess didn't know. I hurried as much as I could to make the flight - we landed in Düsseldorf 21.15, my flight was leaving at 21.05, boarding 20.30. I came to the gate only to find out the last flight was delayed too - good so I made it. But then I arrived home 1.5 hours late, having to go to work next day. All in all: 3 out of 4 flights delayed, in total 5 hours delay, no information at all and absolutely no help from the Air Berlin staff.

### "worst airline I have seen"
The flight from Cologne/Bonn to Berlin was cancelled without any notice. All passengers waited for the Boarding call at the gate, but the airplane did not take off because there was no Crew. There was an airplane on the gate, but there was no Pilot. This flight was a connecting flight to Moscow, whose estimated Arrival time was 7:25pm. We went to the Company desk for rebooking. Air Belin sent us again to Berlin in a late flight (AB6508). Once we got to the Berlin Airport, we found out that there were no direct flights to Moscow on that date. Then, Air Berlin rebooked us, at 16:57pm, in a connecting flight (AB8246) to Prague, whose departure time was 17:45pm. We ran through the Airport to do our check-in. We asked for help to skip the Long lines of check-in and security check, but no one from Air Berlin helped us. As it was expected, we missed the flight to Prague. We went back to the Company desk and the staff decided to rebook us in a connecting flight to London, whose estimated Arrival time in Moscow would be 5am in the next day. Air Berlin made repeatedly mistakes with us. At the end, we decided to fly in the following day. The longest flight of my life in the worst airline I have seen.

### "seat pitch was very tight"
I flew Munich to Dusseldorf with Air Berlin on an A320.The flight was full. It seemed to take longer to get on and off than for the flight with the amount of carry on bags people were trying to stuff in the bins. Boarding was not done by rows. Flight was on time and crew fine. I did not make any purchases. Seat pitch was very tight, would not like a longer journey,

### "will never fly them again"
We have flown Air Berlin about eight times now. We have used them within Europe for quick, short, hops and from Hamburg to Dusseldorf and on to Los Angeles and return. Although the performance of this airline and its personnel may be adequate for short-haul flights, and we doubt even that, their lack of professionalism, poorly trained staff and pitiful website are, in our opinion, among the worst. We can say without qualification that we will never fly them again. Every time we have tried to check in or manage our bookings on line, our attempts have been defeated. Most recently, trying to check in and/or reserve seats for out international itinerary were unsuccessful at every turn. We tried dozens of times over many hours. Eventually, we ended up calling the ‘reservations’ phone number (not a toll free number), three separate times over about 6 hours to accomplish a simple check in and issuance of boarding passes. We tried to reserve XL seats but by the time we got a CS agent to complete the process on the phone, all those seats were taken and we were told to check at the airport when we arrived. We did that. They sold us exit row seats, for which we had to go to another ‘desk’ to pay, then return to the main window to pick up the boarding passes. Ridiculous. At that, the CS attendant struggled to complete the process. We are certain she had no idea what she was doing. Eventually, when we arrived at the gate, we found they had sold our seats to 2 other people and a fiasco occurred while the on-board attendants sorted it out. We ended up in middle seats at the rear of the plane (for an 11-hour flight); the most disagreeable situation of all! In terms of on-time performance, none of the flights we have ever flown with AB departed or arrived on time. They were all delayed by 20-90 minutes. The seating on the planes we have flown was among the least comfortable and spacious we have encountered in recent memory. The in-flight meals the cheapest and smallest we’ve ever seen.

### "the failures of Air Berlin"
Copenhagen to Los Angeles via London. When booking our flights we paid a lot more money to have specific seating arrangements and food. We were booked to fly from Copenhagen to Los Angeles via London. We arrived at the airport 7:30 a.m. and stood in line until the check in agent opened at 9:00 a.m. I was the only one there standing in line as I wanted to beat the crowd. We checked in and went to security and they said our flight had been cancelled. Went back to agent and she said "No" flight had not been cancelled and the security were mistaken. We went back to security with some airline person with us and went through. We tried to find out which gate our flight was at and it was not listed. We finally found an Air Berlin agent at another gate. They said they could not help me as they could "only see their own flight on their computer screen". I persisted and finally they checked and said to go to gate 23 which we had been at. No one was there and it was 20 minutes until boarding. We left and started searching for some other help. After at least 2 attempts with various agents (not Air Berlin as they are not at that airport) our flight had been cancelled prior to our arriving at the airport. Air Berlin did not contact us about that. Air Berlin had transferred our reservations to British Airways but no one had told us. We went to British Airways (BA). We were fortunate to ask for help from an airport employee who walked us to various agent windows talking to them in English and Dutch and finally got us some answers. All of this is over a multi hour period of time. We found out from BA that when Air Berlin had made the reservations they had failed to make arrangements for the seating requirements we had paid for (aisle seat, extra leg room as one of us has medical conditions that require this). British Airways said they could not make any changes to our tickets from London to the USA until we landed in London. That is a whole other story as that was difficult and stressful even though BA was working with us; it was just too late to make many changes on an already "booked flight". BA were finally able to make the needed changes but it took much time and was a devastating experience due to the failures of Air Berlin. In each airport we tried to speak to Air Berlin, London Heathrow and LAX, there were no Air Berlin employees at that time. Our luggage is lost and Air Berlin did not provide any "claim checks" to us so we are sitting here now, not knowing where our luggage is (Air Berlin told us that it was already on the BA flight which was not true) or if we will ever see it again as we have no claim check tickets. Any Air Berlin employee we were able to speak with briefly at the Copenhagen airport were rude and dismissive. They had no interest in even talking to me and it was only because I am persistent that I had any contact with them.

### "gone are the free snacks"
A surprise today on my regular Air Berlin domestic flight from Munich to Hamburg. Boarding normal but a new concept on board. Gone are the free snacks and drinks - the only offer now a paid on board menu. No difference at all to Easyjet or Ryanair. A shame as the previous offer was an alternative to Lufthansa. Lots of communication about "business class" which is just economy with a choice from the menu. A 400€ sandwich - no thanks.

### "barely enough legroom"
We were flying with Air Berlin around Pentecost from Düsseldorf, Germany to Calvi, France (Corsica) and back for vacation as a family of four persons. Overall the flights were ok. But there are two negative things I'd like to point out: If you're a tall person over 1,85m (6'00"), there's barely enough legroom for you to sit comfortably for more than one hour. Secondly, the flight back to Germany was delayed by about 20 minutes because an Air France plane blocked the runway for a long time but there was no information given to us, while we were waiting for takeoff. The cabin crew (especially on vacation fligts like ours) may not be the youngest but were the frendliest staff I have encountered.

### "had good flights on Air Berlin"
Air Berlin on 1 September from Dusseldorf to Copenhagen. Connected from an American flight from Chicago and I love to transfer at Dusseldorf. Easy airport for connections - a quick pass thru immigration and you are in the EU and can walk to other gates. Flight was to board from gate 82 but then switched last minute to gate 79, so caused some confusion. Boarded full flight quickly - push back and smooth take off. Drinks served and BOB offered. Flight attendants smiling and friendly. Landed on time and bags off in reasonable about of time. I have had good flights on Air Berlin and no complaints.

### "planes were not the cleanest"
Thessaloniki to Nuremburg. Two weeks before flight they change the departure time. Both flights with A320, the planes were not the cleanest that I have seen. You have to pay to select your seat, even if you wait for web check-in (30 hrs before flight) computer selects your seat, you have to pay to change it. You have to pay for food. Only free in flight service are: biscuits / potatoes chips, coffee, soft drinks. Flight attendants were helpful and friendly. IFE only drop down screens with flight paths and advertisements.

### "service was precise"
Abu Dhabi to Berlin with Air Berlin. Nothing to be sniffed at. We had a slight delay, we arrived 20 minutes later due to the traffic at AUH. Aircraft interior is rather puritan, no overwhelming place to pack. However, I must say that even though German airlines are not famous for their comfort, these A330 seats were really good. I could sleep for an hour or more. I woke up for the food. This 6-hours-flight was an enjoyable experience for me. Service was precise. Food was not bad at all, although not very good either. It was a German way to fly. I could recommend it. It meets the international standards, I do not think they are better or worse. It's simply German.

### "great value airline"
Cologne to Berlin and my first time on Air Berlin. The cabin area was clean, seats very comfortable and recline, which is fantastic considering they are a budget airline. The food beverages given on board are also a surprise and selling point based on the fact their competitors (Easyjet and Ryanair) don't offer this service. The cabin crew could have been more welcoming but the service they gave was satisfactory. Great value airline.

### "we have not hit rock bottom yet"
It's sad having to add another negative review to my last review of 29 July of Air Berlin's Dusseldorf to Milano-Linate service. I am trying to avoid Air Berlin as best as I can - due to their bad service and punctuality record and inferior cabin product compared to Eurowings, Lufthansa, Swiss and even Easyjet. But for an afternoon flight from the Dusseldorf region to Milano, AB8746 at 15.35 is the only option. Having taken this flight twice in less than 2 months, it really leaves me angry to again experience significant delay of almost 1 hour for this flight on 1 September - for my previous flight on 7 July it was 40 mins. While the airline sent a message by email (that I missed), Dusseldorf airport provided no information about the delay. Also, the gate staff only announces the delay 15 mins prior to departure? Surely, the airport should have known for at least 2 hours. Studying the departure boards, I see that Air Berlin had to cancel two flights (Munich and Stockholm). So maybe I should count myself "lucky" to only be delayed. My last review was titled "from worse to worse" - it just seems, unfortunately, that we have not hit rock bottom yet.

### "they did not care in the least"
Munich to Berlin. Flight and plane were fine and normal, however I did find the seats a bit cramped. The problem came on landing. We had flown from Dubai and our luggage transferred to the Air Berlin flight 6196. When we got off in Berlin it was not marked where to go so we followed others who were walking out. Just at the exit doors I noticed we were exiting and asked the guard where to go for luggage. He only said "go to Terminal C lost baggage". Once you are just 1 inch out the sliding door you can not go back to get your baggage. Ok follow policy blindly with no common sense, thats what EU is all about I guess. Once at the lost baggage it was chaos as about 20 airlines had turned over their lost baggage to a 3rd party company called WISAG. It took one hr in line to reach a man who only said "go file a claim on line" thats it. Go use the iPad over there". The lady ahead of us was German and was totally outraged and the SA man being us in line had also done the very same thing too. The next day we came back and again after 1 hr in line they looked at the screen and said "Nope its not listed here" and "we still have 18 carts not yet unloaded back there from last week". We then went up to the Air Berlin counter in the terminal and they just looked at us with a blank who cares look and said "go back to lost luggage" thats all, no help at all. They did not care in the least. We went back again at 11 pm and finally got one of the men (there were ever only 2 there) who took some compassion on us when I said 'my wife cancer drugs were in her bag and our tour group left tomorrow'. He said "maybe I saw them yesterday" and he actually went back and found them. We had been in a state of despair what to do, totaly zero information or help by anyone at Air Berlin. I will never fly with them again. Also Service from WISAG was the I worst service I have ever seen in the world.

### "most definitely fly again"
We flew last week from Dusseldorf to Boston, family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids). I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service on our flight home. We received an excellent lunch and then a sandwich before landing. All through the flight we were constantly given drinks and the FAs were very attentive. In flight entertainment was excellent with move choice and music, games not so much. I was very happy with our flight, it was on time and comfortable - well seats weren't the most comfortable. This carrier is considered more of a low cost choice but I found it had better service than our United outbound flight. Would most definitely fly again.

### "excellent and efficient"
Flew Cologne to Berlin with Air Berlin. Ground crew were excellent and efficient in the boarding process and such, and so were the cabin crew. The flight arrived on time. The service offered - free of charge - consisted of a salty or a sweet snack and a drink. This was great for such a short flight. Transferring at Berlin Tegel could not be easier. Berlin to Keflavik on-board service offered consisted of the same snacks, which was not really enough, however, you could purchase meals onboard, but I found the prices to be rather steep. The flight arrived early. Also, the Lindt chocolate hearts they give out at the end of the flight are a nice touch. Overall, would fly Air Berlin again if the prices where attractive.

### "I felt properly caged in"
I fly Sydney - Frankfurt about once a year to visit family and normally fly Singapore or Etihad Airways. This was the first time I flew Air Berlin long-haul for one part of the journey (under Etihad's code). I had opted against booking an exit row seat because the flight was only 6 hours, however as soon as I sat down in my seat I realized that had been a bad mistake. I'm quite tall (1.77cm or 5'10) and while I never find airline seats in economy to be spacious the legroom on this flight was ridiculously small. I had to sit all the way at the back of my seat to not touch the seat in front of me with my knees. Once the child in front me decided to recline his chair all the way back for the entire flight I felt properly caged in. The service was friendly and efficient - I was surprised they sell you snacks rather than making these complimentary - they're not exactly a budget airline, at least my ticket price can't be called cheap. They hand you a bottle of water which I loved as I drink a lot during these flights but in reality it was to reduce the staff's workload as they weren't seen for hours after the meal service. We departed and landed on time and communication from the captain and crew was adequate. Check-in was uneventful - what you'd expect. The inflight entertainment wasn't overwhelming but good enough to pass the time (VOD screens for everyone, slightly smaller than I'm used to).

### "getting worse and worse"
Air Berlin's service and punctuality record is getting worse and worse and I avoid using this airline now when I can. My last flights, AB 8746 in July from Düsseldorf to Milan and AB 8731 in 13 June from Milan to Berlin were delayed. Communication with AB is difficult, waiting times at the hotline can be over 15 mins - only to speak to badly trained staff. On Sunday 12 June (I had an email informing me of a cancellation of my direct LIN - TXL flight for 13 June), I had to call the hotline three times to find alternative ways of getting to Berlin (in this case via Vienna). I ended up being double booked - hence the many calls. As a OneWorld Sapphire member (through BA), I am also frustrated that AB is gotten worse in seat selection. While not so long ago, a Sapphire member would get priority seats, this is not the case anymore and seats can only be booked from row 15. So, as it happens, on flight AB 8476 on 7 July, rows 3-14 were almost completely empty. Seating is also really bad and cramped - not more difference to Ryanair. On 7 July, the plane was not cleaned properly, maybe to make up for the delay of 40 mins? Another "policy! to alienate frequent and business travellers is the restrictive hand luggage check before security at some German airports. I would understand if AB was a low-cost airline trying to make some more money by passengers checking in luggage. However, AB is still charging tariffs closer to Lufthansa than Easyjet or Ryanair, so it should at least try and show more flexibility for its passengers, particularly business travellers. In any event, I don't think that AB goes anywhere near the standard I would expect from a One World airline.

### "service was impeccable"
Flew Air Berlin from Düsseldorf to Miami. Service was impeccable. Flight attendants were available all the flight and trying very hard to please passengers. Food presentation was great and very tasty, Business class seats E and F are to be avoided. Very difficult to get in/out. Shoulder width very restricted.

### "poorly handled once we landed"
The flight from Stockholm to Dusseldorf with Air Berlin was fine, despite a 2.5 hour delay. What was terrible was how poorly Air Berlin handled passengers once we landed in Dusseldorf. The stairs weren't ready for our plane when we landed, finally the stairs arrived and we were loaded onto buses. At the gate which we were dropped off via bus, the door into the airport was locked and airport personnel wouldn't unlock for us. Our entire plane load of people were standing in a stairway, trying to figure out what the hold up was. It was very stressful. Then the bags were delayed another 1 to 1.5 hours because they weren't unloaded and were sitting on plane. This was very disappointing to see how all these issues were so poorly handled. When I contacted Air Berlin, they didn't have anything to say, except that since we were only delayed 2.5 hours on the front end of our trip, the rest was basically not their problem. I won't fly Air Berlin again, they clearly don't care.

### "on time and efficient"
We recently traveled on an Air Berlin flight from Los Angeles to Dusseldorf direct. We flew Coach on the way out and business class on the way home. Both flights were okay and uneventful. We paid extra to sit in the emergency row on the outbound flight. On the way back we were in business class which is nice. The staff were efficient but not overly friendly. We were served soft drinks and a dinner on the coach portion of our flight. The food was ok and after dinner the flight attendant came around with bottled waters. The staff disappeared for a few hours after dinner. They would come if called but otherwise they were not around. I would fly the airline again without hesitation. The airline was on time and efficient. The price we paid was great.

### "staff very attentive and friendly"
New York JFK to Krakow via Berlin with Air Berlin. Because of the short layover time, and the affordability of the tickets, it proved to be our best option as it was only slightly longer than a direct flight. We took the overnight flight from JFK to TXL on an A332, flying in economy. We made sure to get to the Airport very early, but check in was very quick and smooth, so we had ample time to do everything we needed to do. Our flight out was delayed for about 50 minutes, which is typical of almost any flight out of JFK, but because of our short layover in Berlin (just under 2 hours, plus having to go through customs) this did worry us. We were only able to get center aisle seats. The seats themselves, while comfortable to sit in, did not offer much leg room for someone like me who is 6'3" so the long haul flight was a bit uncomfortable in the later hours. The entertainment screens on our seats seemed to work, but not very well, but we tried to sleep much of the flight, so we did not fidget with it too much. The flight included diner after take off, and a light breakfast before landing. Meal was better than one would expect for economy class airline food. Staff was very attentive and friendly. We arrived in Berlin about an hour behind schedule, and because of this, the airline made a point to find anyone who had a short connection and move the up in the customs line, so they could catch their next flight. We were a bit worried, especially since we had to connect in a different terminal (and this meant going back through security at TXL). Luckily, everything moved quite quickly (German efficiency) and we made it to our connection gate with 25 minutes to spare before boarding. The second leg, was a short flight from TXL to Krakow. This was on a smaller turbo prop plane, a DC-H8. While the plane felt a bit older on the inside than the A330 we had just flown on, the leg room was much, much better. We had seats on the wing, just behind the props, but we didn't find this to be any louder than a normal flight. The flight itself was nice, and as before, the flight staff was friendly. Overall, we were very satisfied with our flight and our experience. Our only issue was on our return flight. A few days before we were scheduled to leave, we had a death in the family. This would require us to stay a few days later. Our ticket package did not allow for rebooking, but I was hoping they could work with us with options on what we could try to do. Unfortunately, they offered none, and the person I talked to did not seem interested in going further than telling me, 'There is nothing we can do for you. Given the circumstances, I was hoping we could have figured out something, but instead, we had to book a flight through another airline (which ended up being cheaper than what it would have cost to book the return through Air Berlin). Disappointed there, but given all the good service we had up to that point, I would still fly with them.

### "chosen to treat me badly"
I haven't written a review of an airline before, but this company's lack of professionalism really stands out. My partner and I originally booked a convenient 1½-hour afternoon flight within Europe. Air Berlin then cancelled the flight and changed our itinerary (in fact, changed it twice) so that in the end it involved an early-morning departure and a 5-hour journey via a city in the opposite direction. The e-mails they sent about this were weird and confusing. We were going to simply cancel the flight, but when I contacted Air Berlin they said that they would at least reimburse the cost of staying at an airport hotel the night before, so we agreed. But then, after the flight, they refused to make the reimbursement. Instead they offered me a voucher, which I just find insulting - why on earth would I want to book with them again? I fly a lot with budget airlines, and of course have experienced plenty of delays and frustrations over the years, but have never before felt that an airline has deliberately chosen to treat me badly. Crazily, their "Guest Relation Team" has put time into sending me a string of rude e-mails. It would have been more cost-effective for them to simply pay the hotel bill, as they had committed to do.

### "low language knowledge of the crew"
Flew Air Berlin from Zurich to Alicante. Quiet flight, on time. I was somehow surprised about the low language knowledge of the crew in German, English and Spanish. None of them in the economy cabin was able to understand and speak at least two of these idioms which was understandable for the customers. Another detail: Even if Air Berlin is loosing cash with its operations, they still serve you a free (awful) snack in the economy cabin.

### "they will not honour this"
When searching for tickets from Zurich to Palma return, I found the best price on a Swiss travel search site, however I noticed on Air Berlin website "best Price Guarantee" option, where they claimed to refund any difference in price. Hence as I realized last final page where you click "Book Now" did not show details of the flight I copied every single step of the booking process for the claim. Even despite the fact that I provided every single print screen of the whole booking journey indicating cheaper price, Air Berlin refuses to cover the difference. Even weeks after the claim price was still lower at the Swiss travel search site, and I directed Air Berlin to check it, they still refuse to cover the difference. What is the point of the guarantee if they will not honour this? I regret booking directly through them!

### "seats were the worst"
Recently flew from Boston to Florence via Düsseldorf with Air Berlin. Good entertainment system and meals. Seats were the worst I have experienced in many years of transatlantic flying. On return flight chose XL seat and it was a great improvement. Luggage was lost on both the outgoing and return flights.

### "managed to make the flight"
We were booked on flight AB3165 on May 27th from Faro to Helsinki via Berlin. We had pre-booked seats with extra legroom and some food. Although the flight was some 40 minutes late taking off we managed to make the flight to Helsinki AY918 in time. I just like to say that we had a very pleasant flight the whole way thanks to very nice cabin attendants on both flights. We fly to Faro and back about four times per year and always try fly Air Berlin. So a big thank you for looking after your customers.

### "it was chaos"
We had delays on our return flight with Air Berlin from Budapest to Frankfurt. This was not the problem because all flights seemed to be delayed. The first problem was check in, we could not check in ahead of time because of a lack of access to the internet but we had to check our bags anyway. We were 2nd in line to check in, 20 minutes to get to the desk to check in. The employees were non-communicative about the delay in the process. Boarding was chaos. There was an additional delay in Berlin, not a problem, we figured it would give them time to load our luggage from the previous flight. Not one bag was unloaded from the plane in Frankfurt. An entire plane full of luggage was lost? They let us wait at the carousel at 1am for over 30 minutes before it was announced that all passengers must fill out a lost luggage form. It was chaos there too, people pushing and shoving to get a paper at the desk, they didn't have enough for everyone. 2 days after landing my husband finally reached someone who told him none of the luggage was loaded on the plane. I have 2 problems with this: 1) If they knew they didn't load any luggage on the plane, why didn't they give the passengers the lost luggage paper on the plane to fill out during the flight? That would have spared us another hour at the airport. 2) It seems that it was more likely that the airport workers decided not to off load the plane. We finally get our luggage 2.5 days later. I will never fly Air Berlin again.

### "whole experience seemed a bit chaotic"
Not a good experience. Firstly the flight from Berlin Tegel to Salzburg was delayed by an hour (this seemed to be normal though as all the other Air Berlin flights were announcing delays as well). Once the boarding process started I was told that my seat had been changed from the extra-legroom seat I had booked to a standard seat. Onboard the aircraft the first attendant I spoke to was really not that helpful until her colleague stepped in and told me my original seat was free so I should take it. This guy was extremely helpful throughout the flight, making sure that my meal (see below) was out on time and asking if I needed anything - he was the one good point about the whole flight experience. I pre-ordered a meal, which was actually ok, better than the usual airline standard but not worth the €11 it cost. The whole experience seemed a bit chaotic - glad I only had carry on and didn't risk giving them my luggage.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I was pleasantly surprised by Air Berlin's business class service fron Berlin to San Francisco via Düsseldorf. Lie-flat seats are not better or worse than Lufthansa or British Airways. Plenty of overhead storage space. Amenity kit was Wunderkind branded but with minimal content. The entertainment system has nice large screens and a good choice of movies but unfortunately no music. Food was good and abundant though they ran out of my preferred choice both on the outbound and return flight - the crew were apologetic, and otherwise friendly. Flights were on time and baggage was delivered promptly. The only real issue with Air Berlin is that they have no business class on the connecting short-haul flights. While I can live with that the least thing I would expect is a seat in the front of the aircraft at no extra cost rather than being seated in row 19.

### "my preferred carrier"
Düsseldorf to Hamburg, and Air Berlin is my preferred carrier. Warm and welcoming cabin crew, very punctual und aircraft are in good shape. I`m just wondering that the interior is very different (eg. not all have Center Screens with flight Information), but this could be a result as of the financial Situation Air Berlin is facing the last years. I feel comfortable on board.

### "no inflight entertainment"
My flight was from Stuttgart to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. From Stuttgart to Abu Dhabi it was Air Berlin and another leg was of Etihad. Air Berlin is a sheer example of a worst airline. No Inflight entertainment system and it took 8.5 hours when I was travelling from Abu Dhabi to Stuttgart and returning it took 7 hours. Cabin crew was not good, the food and beverage were not good. Leg room was less as compared to other Economy class cabins. If you want to upgrade the luggage then it was way expensive and in fact every other upgrade was way expensive as compared to standard airlines like Air France. Eg. Additional luggage of 23kgs from Stuttgart to Abu Dhabi is 153 Euros and as I had to travel other leg with their partner airline Etihad, then another 130 euros I had to pay. In Airfrance it was 60 Euros for whole journey.

### "would fly Air Berlin again"
I flew Air Berlin from Vienna to Puerto Plata via Düsseldorf on 11th April, returning 23rd April 2016. The longer part of the flight was with A330-200, and not so much space for legs. The flight was on time, cabin crew okay. On the way to Puerto plata (9 hours) we got 2 hot meals and one snack, on the return flight (8hours overnight) we got a hot dinner and then breakfast and bottle of water. Drinks are served often. I was disappointed because we were not offered free headphones and got only cushion and blanket (no toothbrush, eye mask etc). Entertainment during the flight was okay (your own screen with movies, games etc), on the outbound flight the airshow didn´t work, which was unpleasant. All in all it was okay, but do not expect nothing special in economy class. I would fly with Air Berlin again.

### "had nothing to complain about"
I flew with Air Berlin for the first time on Tuesday March 29th from Munich to Berlin. It was my first time flying with Air Berlin and I had nothing to complain about. Flight price was good. Cabin service was nice. They even served you beer and chips on a 45 minute flight and gave us chocolate as you exit the plane.

### "cabin crew were outstanding"
Must say I was pleasantly surprised by Air Berlin. Boarding at Tegel is a little chaotic only because of no priority line (given the small airport/individual security at the gates). For some reason German efficiency never applies at security at any German airport, anywhere, but that's another matter. Boarding was easy and smooth and quickly given champagne. Didn't get to see the AB lounge at Tegel. For return used the American lounge at JFK-nothing special, but this is American/OneWorld in general. No arrivals facilities/showers though at Berlin. On both legs the cabin crew were outstanding: efficient service, but also fun/friendly people who clearly enjoyed their jobs, which is not what you typically get flying anymore. My only advice would be to try to be sure to get a window seat or the middle section if you have no one next to you; the aisle seats in their configuration (similar to Delta's) feel a bit exposed. The privacy in the seats I had was much better than lots of business class products I've flown recently. Overall I enjoyed Air Berlin better than BA, Delta or several other business classes I've flown transatlantic, but avoid Tegel for transit and avoid aisle seats.

### "the experience was great"
Chicago to Berlin with Air Berlin, and the experience was great. Seat comfort and flight service good, price for business was outstanding. Video entertainment limited, but not of great importance to me. I'm 6'3" and lay flat seats were fine. I would avoid seats on the aisle as they have less privacy. Only issue was AirBerlin lounge was outside of the secure area at Berlin, so you could not linger to last moment because you still had immigration and security to pass thru.

### "probably use them again"
Stockholm to Zurich via Berlin on Air Berlin. Check-in at Stockholm was poorly organized. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I was told I could have used the priority lane because I had checked on line. There was no signage to indicate that was an option. Boarding was reasonably organized. On board, both aircraft had clean and well-kept interior. The service was basic but included a snack on both legs. Flights left and arrived on time but the transfer in Berlin was not as smooth as it required a change of terminal and the time allotted was barely enough. FA's warm and polite on the first leg but not so on the second. Disembarkation via bus in Berlin and in Zurich was annoying as there were several vacant air-bridges. It was an verge experience but I would probably use them again.

### "Would fly Air Berlin again"
New York to Berlin. Surprised and pleased with all aspects of flight, from check-in, in flight service and even a great landing, prompting us to let the pilot know. Not a first time traveler by any means, and I have experienced all levels of service. Cabin crew very polite and efficient. Two free food services in economy (food was adequate), and on the A330, so many free entertainment options. Just a delightful experience. Would fly Air Berlin again.

### "last time I will fly Air Berlin"
I flew Berlin to Tel Aviv overnight. There was not enough pillows or blankets for everyone. My seat in row 13 would not recline backwards - even though the seats behind had extra space (35 euro extra), and the pitch of the seat made it impossible to get comfortable. The snack was a joke -  chocolate or a packet of crisps. It was obvious they where only concerned in increasing revenue by pushing people to buy overpriced food. Its the last time I will fly Air Berlin.

### "seat pitch not very good"
Zurich to Dusseldorf via Berlin, and two full flights but Air Berlin does the job well. Still with drink, snack and chocolate heart, but usually much more expensive than say Eurowings. Crew with no smiles with the odd arrogant crew member. The flights were punctual, seat pitch not very good however.

### "seats appeared very cramped"
Flew Air Berlin for the first time last week. From the start of online booking I began to have serious doubts; poor user interface, deceptive pricing and more. The airfares initially shown are not comparable to competing airlines because of Air Berlin a la carte pricing. A rule of thumb would be to add at least €70/person when flying within Europe to make a realistic comparison. Amazingly, the staff made the determination of overweight baggage by lifting my hand carry themselves. An airline can't extract more junk fees based on their subjective impression of weight. They must have a certified scale! Onboard after a chaotic boarding the seats appeared to be very cramped but cabin service was efficient.

### "awful seating arrangement"
New York to Zurich via Düsseldorf with Air Berlin, and awful seating arrangement for their A330 business class. I can't figure out for the life of me as to why they would comaprtmentalize the business class seats. I am 6 foot 4 and I do not fit lengthwise in their seats (in "bed" mode). Their service, food and entertainment is great, but they need to redesign their business class seating. There are many areas in business class that have unused pockets of space - pockets that can be utilized for a more comfortable seating experience.

### "typical budget service"
Vienna to Punta Cana via Düsseldorf, with Air Berlin for the first time. Check in went rather smoothly. A320 from Vienna to Düsseldorf has had more leg space than the transcontinental A330. On the way to Punta Cana we were supposed to have the very new aircraft that should have the internet connection. To our dismay the stewardess first announced that possibility only to deny it after 10 minutes without any explanation. The onboard WiFi was present, but locked. On our way back another A330 has had so little leg room, that flight for us above 180 cm was a real pain. All in all the airline is a typical budget service, with a pompous advertisement and a less real value.

### "okay alternative to Lufthansa"
Frankfurt to Berlin with Air Berlin. The plane had a very tight seat layout. Would have been painful to fly longer than 1-1.5 hours in Economy, and I am normal sized at 180cm. I think they had a better distance between seats when I flew mid-range last time. Service is okay, boarding by groups is perfect, unless you go to the plane by bus, as happened in Frankfurt. It is an okay alternative to Lufthansa on the same destination.

### "pretty much as expected"
Copenhagen to Malaga via Berlin. First time with Air Berlin and it was quite ok. CPH to Berlin the flight was very open and so plenty of space. The transfer in Berlin was a bit of a hassle as it seems it is undergoing some construction work. The waiting area was terrible and that might be enough to reconsider Air Berlin as a good option. The second leg also fine, it was a bit more tight than the first, but staff was friendly enough and it was pretty much as expected. To me Air Berln does well enough for a discount airline, but cannot stack up with the other airlines in the higher segments.

### "had a great experience"
New York JFK to Düsseldorf with Air Berlin. On the return flight I was not able to understand what the pilot was saying, but aside from this, all the flight attendants spoke very good english. The entertainement during the flight was great, many choices of movies and TV shows for everyone. I thought the food was particularly good and the portions were perfect. Overall we had a great experience with Air Berlin.

### "attendants were professional "
New York JFK to Berlin, and Air Berlin would charge me over 50 Euros to reserve a seat in advance, but I was able to reserve an aisle seat for free at the airport check-in. The flight was full and the plane felt very cramped: seats are narrow with minimal pitch. I ordered vegetarian meals for dinner and breakfast and they were good. The flight attendants were professional and friendly. The entertainment options included a modest range of new and classic movies. We left the gate at JFK about 30 minutes late, but arrived at TXL about 30 minutes early.

### "most unpleasant flights"
It was my first flight with AirBerlin involving changing flights, from Budapest to Copenhagen via Berlin Tegel. It was a very disappointing experience. It started with the online checkin system, that did not work so I could not choose between seats. On both airplanes there were plenty of empty rows and seats but online it did not work to choose. The first flight from Budapest to Berlin was fine, luggage was checked in all the way - but when arriving in Berlin Tegel nobody had mentioned that I needed to change terminal myself, from the Airport's old main terminal to one of the new terminals far away and that I had to walk there myself plus needed to go through security again. Not a very pleasant transfer. And then landed in Copenhagen only to realize that the luggage had not come on the plane from Berlin. Plenty of other passengers had the same problem and ground service said that there was only 4 pieces of luggage with the plane. In their marketing Air Berlin tries hard to wash off their budget airline image by pointing to their world wide route net and collaboration with Etihad and other airliners. But it was one of my most unpleasant flights involving transfer ever, and it was really a budget airline trying to pretend being something else. For point to point flights they are fine. For stopover flights, use another airline.

### "equipped with Wi-Fi"
Dusseldorf to Bilbao via Palma on a very modern aircraft with sharklets. Cabin staff very friendly. First aircraft was equipped with Wi-Fi including various movies and series on demand via the Air Berlin connect app. Also offering internet connection for affordable price. Both flights on time.

### "poor service level"
Air Berlin flight Dusseldorf to Barcelona was okay, but my luggage was missing for 4 days and I needed to buy things for personal use. Luggage was supposed to arrive the next day but it took 4 days (almost 5 days actually). I saved all the tickets of my purchases and went to the airport personally twice. No result at all. I sent the bills to the head quarters of Air Berlin. The total amount was EUR191. After a hefty email contact, which did not go smoothly, they first offered me reduction on my next flight. I did not agree, I wanted to be compensated for my extra expenses like any normal company would do. The time between the emails and their replies took ages. You cannot call them anyway, because they don't seem to have a real customer service. Only because I kept on sending them emails all the time, they offered me a refund of 50% of the total costs. This is not what I would suggest of a customer service, but at the end I had to accept it, this was the best I could get. Poor service level towards customers! Would not consider recommending this company to others.

### "Cramped seating"
Berlin to Funchal, and Air Berlin continues its way from a once renowned airline with a high quality service to a an airline very much the style of Ryanair. Cramped seating (this was always the case with Air Berlin) and onboard service that consists of non alcoholic beverages and a small pretzel and this is for a flight of 4.5 hours. Everything else needs to be paid extra. If you want to have something to eat they charge your between 8-11 Euro. Cabin crew was friendly though.

### "cabin staff were friendly"
In July we travelled home from Portugal after a 10 day trip in Albufeira. As I live in southern Sweden, our closest airport is Malmö Airport but it does not serve as many airlines and destinations as Copenhagen Airport, which is also close to us. Unfortunately there were to direct route from FAO to CPH, therefore we hade to make a stopover in Berlin-Tegel Airport. We flew with Air Berlin. The cabin staff were friendly and were always ready to help if anyone needed it, they even gave us recommendations for which food in the menu they thought was the best. AB offered drinks and snacks for free, on both of the flights. It was very nice, either you could pick a chocolate kex or some crisps. The seats were as comfortable as any other airline, I was sitting by an exit on our FAO–TXL flight and therefore I had some extra legroom. After landing, they offered some chocolate at the exit. Would definetley recommend and fly with Air Berlin again.

### "cabin staff charming "
Munich to New York JFK via Dusseldorf on Air Berlin business class. Ground service helpful and friendly. On JFK flights, welcome drinks served during boarding (champagne, juice, etc). On-time departure. Very good food on outbound flight (DUS-JFK), worse on inbound (the catering from JFK is awful). Cabin staff charming and friendly. Business Class is the same as  Etihad Airways, and all seats have direct aisle access. Thank you for this very pleasant journey.

### "Unhappy with Air Berlin"
Unhappy with Air Berlin. Bag got lost from Abu Dhabi to Berlin but wasn't alone as I met 3 others in the same situation. I had to wait almost an hour in lost baggage as the lines were huge, staff assured me my bag would be on the next flight which was that night and that it would be delivered the next morning. 4 days later of ringing constantly the phone always being busy I finally got through and staff said it had been dispatched and was on a truck and then after 6 days I rang again as it still hadn't arrived and told them to take back to the airport and I'd pick it up. When I picked it up the staff member had wrote down only half the address and it was just getting driven around. Due to having travel insurance my insurance company told me I could spend a certain amount on essentials but after doing so and going to put in my claim several times air Berlin never replied so I'm still out of pocket.

### "voyage of the damned"
Flights with Air Berlin can be like night and day. Flights from JFK to KRK via Berlin/TXL were pleasantly uneventful; ie. decent food and friendly service. Flight back to JFK from TXL was the voyage of the damned. Check-in at WAW took forever, and as TXL has no airside transfer facilities, had to check-in again in Berlin, though I hadn't needed to do that on the outbound flight. The food was inedible on the TXL to JFK leg. They seemed to have forgotten to restock the inflight duty-free, so practically nothing was available. FAs went out of their way to be nasty - every time I wanted a drink I had to ask 3-4 times before finally getting one; a nearby passenger who asked for a whiskey got the phrase "I only have coke" barked at him as the FA walked by never to return.

### "never take Air Berlin again"
The ground service (check-in counter) is extremely bad: the staffs there do not think about how to improve check-in efficiency or customer satisfaction at all. My flight was early in the morning from Berlin Tegel, and there was a long queue for check-in. The queue was divided to two lines, and both lines seem to lead to the check-in counter. There was no signs at all at the begining of the queue to indicate what the queue is for (check-in or drop off baggage or priority check-in). Only after queued for over 30 min, in the place close to the counter, there are signs indicating what the queue is for. I and some other passagers were in the wrong queue, and so had to go to the right line to re-queue again. So after checked-in, I suggested to the staff that they provide the signs at the begining of the queue, but not at the current place where the signs are not obvious at all. And then the staff of Air Berlin shouted at me: there are clearly signs here, and we can do nothing to change it. She's really hostile. Even though she doesn't agree with my suggestion, she really doesn't have to shout at me. When I turned away to leave the counter, she was still shouting. I'll never take Air Berlin again. They can go to any other airports to see how an efficient queuing system should be.

### "possibly the smallest seat"
New York JFK to Dusseldorf with Air Berlin. For a no-frills airline, there are lots of little frills - sweets as you board, two meals on long-haul, a small amenity kit on overnighters etc. None if this, however, makes up for what is quite possibly the smallest seat I've ever flown in. Sat bolt upright, my knees still touched the seat in front - reclining into anything vaguely comfortable on the back meant cut off circulation to the legs as the nerves and vessels in the knees were contorted and pressed into the overstuffed magazine rack. On top of that, you've also got to find space for the pillow, blanket and amenity kit, shoes, etc. Tried to check in online to pick somewhere vaguely humane to sit, but wouldn't work for me and Twitter support were unhelpful with this. Daytime flying might be fine, but don't count on sleeping for a period of longer than 20 mins on a red eye unless you are under 5ft (152cm). Staff were  okay, food I've had better

### "flights were good, nothing special"
Just a regular Air Berlin flight from Dusseldorf to Berlin and back for visiting some friends and family. Flight on the 17th of Oct from Dusseldorf to Berlin was on time, cabin crew was friendly but certainly not more than that. Flight back to Dusseldorf on the 20th was a bit delayed, cabin crew had the same attitude as the flight to Berlin. The plane did not parked at the gate, therefore we had to wait for about 10 minutes for a bus to bring us to the terminal. For a surprise my luggage was already on the belt. Both Air Berlin flights were good, nothing special!

### "very unhappy to say the least"
I flew Air Berlin from Vienna to Chicago with a layover in Berlin. I read that I could have 1 checked bag, 1 carry on and a personal bag. In Vienna I was told my checked bag was overweight and that it would cost 100 EUR for being heavy. I threw out some stuff and it was fine. I had my carry on which she checked the weight and told me it was fine. My layover in Berlin was 17 hours at the Tegel Airport (there was nothing there, no cots available and nowhere for passengers to rest comfortably for free). I checked in 3 hours before the flight. I've never had to check-in twice with the same airline that I was flying a connecting flight with. In Berlin, I was told my carry on and personal bag was too heavy. The lady at the counter told me that it would cost 170 EUR (which is more than I have ever been quoted for additional baggage or for being overweight) for my carry on. So, I threw away towels, underwear, socks, books, and slippers. I got on the flight only to find that it was half full. I was very unhappy to say the least. I will never fly Air Berlin again.

### "furious and angry "
Worst non-service at Tegel airport from Air Berlin staff. First I was told that my handbag was to big - it is not, as it follows the size rules of Air Berlin - then it was too heavy, and I should just check it in. So I did and was presented with a 60 EUR fee, after the bag was checked in. The personal did not inform me of the fee before, and did not tell me, that I could just have added som weight to my wife's bag - or put on an extra coat from the bag to lower the weight. I'm furious and angry to receive such  incompetent service of Air Berlin staff.

### "nothing to make you welcome"
Being a Top bonus platinum member, Air Berlin is doing nothing at all to make you welcome. When flying any other oneworld airline partner, as a platinum member you get a treat even flying in economy. It even shows on your boarding pass, but not so at Air Berlin, you are treated as a once a year flyer, and thats it. The perks are checking in at business when flying economy, so being loyal really pays off at Air Berlin!

### "legroom is adequate"
Dusseldorf to Munich using Air Berlin. Seats comfortable and the legroom is adequate. There is no business class, but Air Berlin reserves the front rows in their cabin for status customers and keeps the next seat empty, but only if the flight is empty enough. The only real shortcoming however is, that there are no real coat hooks available apart from the ones, that hold your tray table. But once you want to use it, there's no place for your jacket any more. Boarding was quickly accomplished according to seat rows. Shortly after take off a drink service with a small snack, that usually consists of a chocolate bar or crisps. Cabin staff was friendly and efficient. They distribute an Air Berlin chocolate heart after landing.

### "upgrade program a scam"
Not only was the transatlantic flight experience on Air Berlin generally terrible, but their "exquisite" (upgrade) program is a scam. This was undoubtedly the most uncomfortable transatlantic I have been on. The seats are cramped, mimimally cushioned and just generally uncomfortable, while the 30" pitch feels like even less. I'm not especially tall, but when the person in front reclined her seat her head was practically resting on my chest. I'd planned to work on the flight but I couldn't even usefully open my laptop on the little table. The food was marginal, as was the service - both on the flight and on the ground. The only redeeming quality was the video system, which at least has a decent selection. Finally, to add insult to injury, I applied pre-flight for their "exquisite" upgrade service - one of those things where you bid on their website for an upgraded seat, which if you "win" it they charge you the amount of your bid in exchange for the upgrade. This is a scam! I "won" the bid, my credit card was charged 200 euros, but then I did not in fact get the upgraded seat. I tried to talk to personnel on the ground and on the flight, but they not only would not help but claimed no knowledge of such a program. I have spent the last 3 months fighting to have my 200 euros refunded, but with no success.

### "very pleasant experience"
New York to Dusseldorf in Business Class with Air Berlin. Very pleasant experience. Seats, overall comfort, IFE quality of food and FA's were all very good. In my opinion the Air Berlin business class product is outstanding.

### "the worst experience"
Düsseldorf to Miami on Air Berlin, an unfriendly crew, giving not the asked service and starting disussing if it is worse to serve - by the way we are Gold Card Member. This is after more than 40 years flying many airlines in first and business class the worst experience we ever had. After return from our trip we wrote a letter to AirBerlin and got the anwer, that they are very sorry - thats it.

### "cabin crew was very helpful"
Moscow to Berlin with Air Berlin, and it was a good flight in general, the seat was comfortable. The cabin crew was very helpful and smile. The problem is that if you need to cancel your flight or a route they will do their best to delay to don't do it - the customer service in this way is very bad. Be careful.

### "definitely fly with them again"
I flew with my 2 kids, my brother and parents from Berlin to Salzburg on August 16. We booked on flex fare since we change our plans a lot and my parents needed the XL seats. My brother, parents and I sat in the XL seats by the emergency exits and my kids sat in the row in front of us. We got priority check in at Berlin since I'm a Qatar Airways Silver privilege club member which is a part of Oneworld with Air Berlin and got priority security since we had flex tickets (there wasn't a line anyway). Berlin Tegel isn't a huge airport but there were a few nice restaurants and a duty free shopping area. We got priority boarding (flex ticket perk) which wasn't very helpful since boarding was a mess and unorganized at all. A bus took us to the plane and we were seated and greeted by the very kind and polite flight attendants. The flight flew over Eastern Germany and started descent near the Austrian border it was a pretty smooth route. Meals weren't served since it was a short flight but you could purchase snacks. They handed out heart shaped Lindt chocolates while passengers were leaving and a bus took us to the terminal. Our bags came out from the baggage claim right away and we were out of the airport in minutes. Would definitely fly with them again and recommend them to people.

### "cabin staff attentive and courteous"
This was a low fare economy class Air Berlin flight (with my daughter) from Berlin to JFK New York, and the service was excellent, with cabin staff attentive and courteous. The food was delicious, and the movie/tv entertainment selections were great. Prior to landing, every passenger was given a bottle of water and a hot towel. This was a nice touch and I will fly with Air Berlin again.

### "plane clean and crew nice"
Palma to Valencia with Air Berlin, and the plane was clean and crew was nice. We flew an A320 and the flight was 45 minutes long. They gave us free food (biscuits) and the baggage check-in wasn't bad. My only trouble was the baggage claim in Valencia, that lasted an hour, but it's usual in Valencia, where the ground handlers are a bit slow.

### "impossible to upgrade my ticket"
I have already collected more than 80.000 Air Berlin bonus points. Impossible to upgrade my ticket, and I've been trying for 5 years. After waiting on the phone (the only possibility to contact them) for half an hour, they tell you no more seats. If you want to book Business Class they have seats.

### "among the worst long haul carriers"
Berlin to Abu Dhabi with Air Berlin. We left 90 minutes late, circled in AUH for 45 minutes and landed in Dubai Cargo airport instead, no info given and waited for 2 hours, then finally landed in Abu Dhabi and missed our connection to BKK with Etihad. No info given by Air Berlin staff on connections, chaos at AUH. We had pre-booked extra legroom seats and due to the delay and missed connection, had to forfeit these. EY staff friendly and supportive and gave us better seats on the AUH-BKK route, seats and service much better than at Air Berlin. Air Berlin must be among the worst long haul carriers out there. Same experience flying Berlin to Chicago in February. Why can´t they improve on service, comfort, food etc.

### "crew was nice and cockpit kept us informed"
Flew Cologne to Palma/Mallorca with Air Berlin. Checked in online a day before, when we arrived at the airport, from 8 counters only 2 were open and a long line of passengers were waiting, so drop off was a nightmare. Plane was on time and boarding was normal. On the 2 hour flight I got two free drinks and some pretzels. I also got two Pommery Champagne for EUR 20. Crew was nice and Cockpit kept us informed us during flight. Landed on time in PMI, but took almost 1 hour to get bags.

### "a tourist carrier, no less and no more"
Going to Catania with Air Berlin was somewhat ok. Planes are ok, seats are similarily narrow as Lufthansa Economy, service the same. A drink, a snack bar and the option to pay for food. We did, but the sandwich for €5 was not worth €1. All in all ok. Going back from Catania was chaotic, but seemed normal for a tourist carrier. We went to the plane by bus. Instead of boarding by zones or at least have people with front seats enter thru the front door and people with back seats to the back door, they had bus 1 go thru the back door and bus 2 thru the front door. You may imagine what was going on in the plane with people going from one end to the other. This was unneccesary and idiotic. The rest of the flight was normal. As long as you have people applause after landing, Air Berlin will be a tourist carrier. No less and no more.

### "a real low cost carrier"
I am a oneworld Emerald for many years but made a huge mistake by changing from Air Berlin recently. Shanghai to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi, Shanghai to Dusseldorf leg was operated by Etihad Airways which was excellent. Upon arrival in AUH I was told that Air Berlin had a aircraft change due to technical problems. The new aircraft would only have Economy seats. That was the first time ever I booked a ticket where a Air Berlin business class is involved and then Air Berlin shows up all economy. Etihad offered me to rebook on AUH to MUC in Etihad business class and MUC to DUS on AB Eco. I obviously took that offer as I really think that no matter what happens, Air Berlin will always stay that "low cost" carrier in peoples minds because they dont really do something to improve that. I finally got confirmation for that theory once I got to the gate in MUC to board. Chaos, no priority boarding, unfriendly ground and onboard staff, narrow seats. What other points you need to be a real low cost carrier. Air Berlin please go check the big guys and learn how to treat your frequent travelers right! The rating here is strickly for Air Berlin.

### "not such good value for money"
Flew Air Berlin from LAX to DUS. Delayed flight and uncomfortable seats. Good price but not such good value for money. Seats weren't comfy at all and the flight took off more then an hour later. Cabin crew were kind and professional and the food was ok.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew on leisure as a couple. Tried to book window/aisle seats in advance (16 EUR per person and segment). Airline said "no it's against the regulations" and forced us to book either window/middle or middle/aisle seat. Never heard of such regulation before. Other than that the usual mediocre AB service standards, chaotic check-in and boarding. You get what you pay for.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flight started with two hours delay though the plane arrived in Rome from a previous flight with only marginal delay. Boarding was a total chaos with no pre-boarding for status clients. No reasons for a delay were given before boarding and no announcements were made by ground staff. Flight was then rerouted to Hannover with a subsequent 3 hour bus ride to Berlin because the airport in Berlin closes at 11 pm. and the flight left Rome only at 10.40 pm. The passengers were not informed until 15 minutes before the plane landed in Hannover though it must have been clear in Rome before the start that the flight was not going to Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
Boarding at Zurich was well organized and staff were helpful. The cabin of the A320 was clean and neat. The seat, 19F, was a standard slimline seat with some recline and padding. Legroom was mediocre and was tolerable for the 2hr flight (I am 5'9"). The flight was very noisy as there were many families travelling on the flight, but I was able to sleep a bit, the seats were not all that uncomfortable. Cabin service was decent for a LCC, with some complementary snacks and drinks. In-Flight Entertainment on the overhead screens was not very great (mix of sitcoms and comedy TV-Shows) so bringing a book or tablet/laptop with your own movies or shows is recommended. It should also be noted that the seats do not have so be sure to fully charge your devices before using them on-board. Cabin crew were very helpful and kind. Overall the flight was ok, but not extraordinary. I would consider flying with Air Berlin again, but I'll give some preference to larger European flag-carriers.

### Air Berlin customer review
Good service from the cabin crew. Seat had lots of space and the interior of the aircraft was clean. I will definitely be recommending the airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
We had to disembark the plane due to brake failure and spend the night at a hotel. No one to show us where to go to get hotel voucher etc. Due to it being around 11pm the hotel was not offering any food and I was told I could go downstairs in the airport where there was a supermarket. Drag my luggage down there now. The next day I check in only to discover my boarding tag was made out to some woman continuing on to Bangkok. I told them I was going to Abu Dhabi only, but the guy at the check in counter said it was ok. So back to the service desk. They issue me a new boarding pass and ensure my luggage would arrive in Abu Dhabi. Of course it didn't, and to make matters worse, they did not give me a claim ticket on the new pass. Again no apology. After clearing security I am asked to return to the ticket counter. Back through the airport again. All they wanted was to say my luggage would be ok and to apologize. At least someone finally said they were sorry. I get to the gate and the plane was latte leaving by an hour. Very arrogant and ignorant people at the gate. As people said earlier, bad food and tiny seats.

### Air Berlin customer review
As platinum and very loyal customer to Etihad we tried this year the Etihad partner Air Berlin to fly from Dusseldorf to Los Angeles (good ticket price, non-stop connection, earning Etihad miles and according to the website of Etihad also access to the lounge). But, no access to the lounge in Los Angeles (afterwards Etihad confirmed but their typical customer service apology e-mails. No miles seen yet, Etihad is working on it (after another apology e-mail). During the flight to Los Angeles: only a couple of movies possible to watch due to technical issues, it was a very long flight. No priority lane boarding, chaos in Dusseldorf during boarding, very small seating, pitch 30. Very bad. Not child-friendly. Very unfriendly crew. I'm used to the excellent service of Etihad and question why Etihad is partening with this kind of low-budget / non-customer focused airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
On time flights, smooth check-in process. Nice, clean aircraft, friendly crew. Awful pre-ordered Sansibar lunch, but nice beverage available to buy. Overall a good option. Will fly them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
Changed gate with no notice on board, made hundreds of already checked in customers wait in a hallway near the gate for over an hour with no explanation or communication of any kind. There was no reason for the wait except to tell us that the flight was delayed 5 more hours, and to give us a tiny credit to one food concession stand which could not come close to paying for the lunch we were now going to need to buy in the airport. We showed up to the proper gate early only to be told there was an additional hours delay. Got on board only to be told there would be another hours delay. Husband who is 5'9 and 150 lbs was unable to sit in his seat without his knees cutting into the metal frame structure of the back of the seat ahead of him. His seat did not recline at all and his screen for movies/tv did not work. He was in pain and discomfort for the whole time we waited on-board.

### Air Berlin customer review
With a business class ticket we got into the admiral club at JFK. Club was neat, comfortable, offered two cocktails and pre-flight snacks including a corn bisque which was quite good. Boarding the plane was quick and soon enough we were airborne. The A332 is roomy but the seats in business were tight and at times a bit uncomfortable. Without an air control, the temp got really sweaty and hot. Sleeping was rough! Food was sufficient but there was no prior cocktail service. Nothing was offered. After asking, the FA was cordial and served us the drinks of choice. Service was professional and exceptionally quick. Flight was safe and upon arriving on route to Rhodes, the lounge in Germany was a great place to get a rest and some complimentary breakfast, the lounge was better than AA's admiral's club at JFK. Dependable but nothing special for a business class service. Would rather fly American Business.

### Air Berlin customer review
The new business class is outstanding. Service is top notch, so are the food and drink. The seats are comfortable and have a massage function included. The way they are placed gives you loads of privacy. Way better than Lufthansa, KLM etc.

### Air Berlin customer review
Excellent experience. Good entertainment selection for the long flight, good food for airline food.

### Air Berlin customer review
Check in Cologne was nice and fast and no problem, topbonus number was checked. Boarding was nice and fast, we were welcomed when entering the aircraft. Flight crew informed about flight and cabin crew did a nice job. I got one coffee and a glass of water with a nice muesli bar. You can choose between salty and sweet, all of this is for free. Baggage at Berlin Tegel was fast and we arrived on time. Return flight was the same only the plane was a Bombardier propeler plane, which I like because seating is 2-2 and you can see more. Crew was fine again and this time I choosed salty and got a bag of prezzels. Since this was a small plane, we were bused to gate, but it was fast again. Air Berlin is a good airline and I booked again CGN-TXL-CGN with them.

### Air Berlin customer review
Good checkin, fast boarding. Free magazines during boarding. Free soft drinks and a sandwich. The staff on board were very friendly and attentive. I can recommend Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew from Stuttgart (STR) to Hamburg (HAM). The online check-in worked without problems and really fast. On the airport you could choose between a few magazines and newspapers you were able to take on the flight (no fee). The flight itself was on time and the staff was very friendly. Even on that short flight (around 50mins) we got offered a drink and a snack (Lindt chocolate or crisps). At leaving the airplane we got Air Berlin chocolate- hearts. The flight back was excellent too. The online check-in worked and the flight was perfectly on time. Very friendly staff and good service again. The flight attendant accidentally spilled a drop of coffee because of turbulence. She gave me two more chocolates as excuse which I found very kind. At all I can say that Air Berlin is a very good airline especially for German and European flights. Also the value for money is very good. I would definitely recommend Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
I flew non-stop TXL-JFK on 13 March and I was extremely surprised about Air Berlin's new Business Class service. Let's not mention TXL airport though. The rotten airport (including the Air France Business Lounge gates and boarding area) is a disgrace which I will not blame Air Berlin for. However once I boarded the plane the service was so amazing - like in good old times. I got greeted by my name. Blankets slippers amenity kits are individually brought to you with a smile. The new flat seat feels more like a private cabin than a seat - much better than Lufthansa's new Business Class or AA's new one that I used recently too. The food and bar service was like in a restaurant - including a special dish of the day that was not on the menu. Last not least: The flight attendants were tremendously kind and attentive.

### Air Berlin customer review
March 20th 2015. Flight 7001 from Miami International to Rome via Dusseldorf. The boarding started around 3.15pm. After several hours inside the plane we were informed by the captain that they were trying to fix a "leak". After two more hours we were instructed to disembark the aircraft with our carry on and wait inside the terminal. Neither water or any type of food or snacks were offered by Air Berlin employees. Early evening we were told to board the aircraft again with all our belongings to our incredible surprise we stayed inside the plane again for more than two hours. Finally the captain informed the passengers that now the aircraft was having computer "issues" and we would have to sleep in Miami without any hint as to when the next plane will be ready for us to continue to Dusseldorf. Early next morning I went to Air Berlin counter just to find chaos and indifference to all passengers from the day before. The employees did not know when the next plane will be departing so I run to American Airlines who provided me with connections to Rome.

### Air Berlin customer review
In May 2015 I caught the flight from Chicago O'Hare to Berlin Tegel. The aircraft was an Airbus 330. I was allocated a window seat but had no window. A woman who had paid an extra $50 for a window found herself in the same position but was not given a window. The aircraft was very overheated and had no individual air vents above the seats. The individual lights above my seat illuminated my neighbour rather than my seat. There were inadequate numbers of toilets for the large number of passengers. This resulted not only in severe discomfort for passengers but the water supply ran out in the toilet closest to me resulting in toilet paper not being flushed. The food was as cheap and nasty as I have ever had in Economy. I am not tall but had very little leg room. I could do very little work not only due to the shortage of space but the intense heat of the aircraft. The TV and movie selection was OK but not great but the TV screen in the back of the seat in front of me kept skipping or freezing every time the passenger in that seat vibrated the seat - extremely irritating. On approach to Berlin droplets of water started to drip on me and the passengers around me. On arrival the aircraft parked a very long distance from the terminal building. We were bussed to the terminal - this took about 10 minutes. We were then kept on the bus for another 10 minutes before being released into fresh air. The terminal for Air Berlin at Tegel turned out to be a shed with only 4 customs officers for hundreds of non-EU passengers. It took about an hour in a line to clear customs. (EU passengers cleared in minutes due to their automated passport readers.) I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and ended up on Air Berlin because it is a One World partner with QANTAS. How Air Berlin managed to join that partnership of good to excellent airlines is a mystery only the executives of those airlines can answer. I will be complaining to QANTAS and Air Berlin directly. The small number of flight attendants worked very hard and were pleasant but I felt sorry for them.

### Air Berlin customer review
Booked a flight back home to Abu Dhabi from Berlin with Air Berlin not by choice as I actually booked it through Etihad Airways. The whole experience left me rather bitter and I really don't see the value add from Etihad Airways in partnering with Air Berlin. The following were my experiences with Air Berlin: 1) Couldn't reserve a seat on Air Berlin since my reservation code was tied to Etihad's. Had to make a call to Air Berlin but the initial response from them was to call back Etihad since they couldn't see my reservation in their system. However Etihad told me to call them back again since the flight was to be operated by them and they should see it in their system. After calls to-and-fro Air Berlin managed to retrieve my reservation and assist to reserve a seat (which came with a fee). 2) Baggage limit was only at 23kg. My outbound flight from Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt which was operated by Etihad Airways itself was 30kg. So I had to pay for the excess since I needed to bring back lots of stuff back from my trip. To make things worse the counter at Tegel Airport could not accept my credit cards apparently again because the reservation code was tied to Etihad's and so the payment couldn't be booked to release my boarding pass. So I made a mad dash to withdraw cash and had to go to a Baggage Service counter in exchange for a receipt since Air Berlin does not handle cash. From this experience I will not consider Air Berlin for long-haul flights anymore (being charged for seat reservation and low baggage limit) as there are many other alternatives that can provide more value and cost savings. Nor will I fly with any of the Etihad Airways partners anymore since their systems don't seem to be well-linked up with each other.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew over the Easter holidays from Cologne to Berlin. Flight was rebooked to an early morning flight which was not as planed. Checked in online with no problem. Staff was nice and as soon we were airborne service began. The cabin had a nice smell of fresh coffee and fresh baked roll for breakfast. Soon I was served a cup of hot coffee one glass of apple juice and a hot saltbread roll. All was tasty and the crew was very nice on a one hour flight. Cockpit informed about flight. Baggage took some while because Tegel Airport is way to small but this is not Air Berlins fault. Better than Germanwings since service is free of charge.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-TXL-DUS. Attitude of AB ground-staff in DUS remains problematic. They are grumpy and arrogant. Crew on board okay. Very punctual and swift performance. Price (396 euro RTN for 4) included snack drink chocolate and 23 kg luggage. The only problem with AB is reliability. They cancelled the last two flights out of Berlin so we had to leave almost three hours earlier. Had a similar experience last year. On the other hand: definitely preferred AB above Germanwings because of constant strike risk.

### Air Berlin customer review
I flew from Stockholm (ARN) to New York (JFK) via Berlin on March 29th (AB 8003 and AB 7248). The first stretch was 30 min late and I was forced to run through the terminals to get to my departure gate for JFK. I received no support or information from AB. Upon arrival at the gate I was informed that there was a 5 hour delay for the JFK flight. There was no information on the cause of the delay and staff appeared to be very confused. After 4 hours it was announced that there was another hour delay. The flight finally left over 6 hours behind schedule. The only compensation we received was a bottle of water and bag of chips. The return flight on April 2nd (AB 7249) was also delayed. Originally the delay was 40 min and then turned into over an hour. I therefore missed my connection back to Stockholm and was booked on a flight 4 hours later. The only compensation was again a bottle of water and bag of chips. The quality of the service once the plane was airborne was quite good and the entertainment system excellent (when it worked I was unlucky enough to have a malfunctioning screen on the return flight). In conclusion if you can afford to arrive late then the low ticket prices can make this airline attractive. However I will never fly them again given this rather miserable experience. The combined delays cost me over 10 hours of my life.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH-DUS-JFK-BER-FRA with Air Berlin. On time flights with very friendly check in staff and cabin crew. I will use this company again.

### Air Berlin customer review
After reading quite a number of negative reviews I can not believe I actually flew Air Berlin. My flight from Zurich-Dusseldorf-Miami return in Business class was one of the most pleasurable flying experiences I have had. The planes were clean. The crews were efficient and kind. The food was plentiful and incredibly good. The seats are extremely comfortable. The entertainment is the best in the air. Overall Air Berlin is much better than KLM Air France British etc.

### Air Berlin customer review
Travelled Berlin TXL to Abu Dhabi on A330-200. First of all shame on Etihad for partnering with such a budget airline and expect all of its loyal customers to put up with it - it has severely damaged the prestige it had built up over the years. Air Berlin is essentially a German budget airline operated out of a budget hub with a cheap meal and a poor IFE thrown in all awhile pretending to be a full service airline wearing the Etihad badge. Flight crew are very basic leg room is extremely minuscule - like other budget airlines meal is tiny and unappetising. Worse of all even for inter-continental flights you've got to pay nearly 40 Euros to select your seat! Never heard of it! All in all I am extremely unhappy with what Air Berlin had to offer both pre and during flight. I am taking my money else where the next time I am heading back to Europe. Bye Etihad and your budget subsidiary.

### Air Berlin customer review
NUE-DUS-CUR Return. Dash 8/A330-200. Air Berlin has a good product in Economy Class. Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality. Note that AB is a semi-LCC though with mostly regular fares. This could explain the poor Food and Beverage service. Flights were all remarkably on time.

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin operated the 6 hour flight from Berlin to Abu Dhabi for the partner airline Etihad. Firstly it was delayed 2.5 hours due to having to unload luggage of a passenger that failed to board. This meant that the flight would arrive into Abu Dhabi 30 minutes after boarding would commence for the connecting Etihad flight to Perth. Crew refused to advise if the connection flight would wait for us saying that Etihad had not contacted them therefore they didn't know. If they are partner airline and operating the service on behalf of Etihad and are responsible for the delay surly it is their responsibility to contact Etihad or surely there is a some agreement between the two carriers for situation such as this! We were told that ground staff would advise and assist on arrival in Abu Dahbi. But there was no ground staff who knew anything about the flight to Perth and no ground staff willing to help. Luckily the connecting flight was delayed for other reason and we made it but the airline did nothing to ease our minds. On the flight itself the crew were rude abrupt and just generally unpleasant. The food was worse than terrible. The hot food was served in a plastic-lined container the taste of which went all through the food. The only good thing about the flight was the seats - they reclined further and are possibly wider than most economy seats that I have sat in. I was very comfortable and slept well.

### Air Berlin customer review
Short haul internal flight from Berlin to Munich and return - 27th Dec. Have flown with this carrier on a number of occasions in recent times on both short and long haul flights. Have found them to provide a very good level of service on all occasions. This flight was short duration with no in flight entertainment and provision of only a light refreshment. Seats satisfactory for short haul only and legroom tight in comparison to long haul aircraft. Unable to be seated together despite early booking for group of 6. However given the short flight any inconveniences were minor - no complaints. Long haul evaluation just below level of Etihad/Emirates/V Aust. Have used and will happily continue to use and recommend this carrier.

### Air Berlin customer review
Copenhagen-Dusseldorf-Miami both ways with my family (wife and three kids). Service on board was not as we expected. Some of the personnel was unfriendly and not very understanding concerning families with kids. There was a delay on our way from Miami to Dusseldorf were we sat for 3 hours in the plane and the only thing that they offered was a protein bar. Food on the plane was not so good and we had to buy some snacks to the kids. The entertainment system on the longer flight of 11 hours was not working well and there were no helps from the personnel or alternatives. The delayed flight home had us miss the connection flight and we had to wait for 12 hours in the airport since the company did not use the 10-11 hours we were in the air to try and find alternatives for passengers with connection flights. The ground personnel said they only knew it 10 minutes before we landed in Dusseldorf. This is according to my view not a professional way of running a customer focused company. We will never travel with Air Berlin again.

TXL-AUH return. My second long haul flight with Air-Berlin and as before can't understand the bad comments on this forum. No worse or better than most other European airlines. A330 aircraft on both legs. Flights bang on time great IFE with lots of choices good quality screen and an OK price. Seat is also as comfortable (or non- comfortable) as on other European airlines such as Lufthansa and KLM. On the negative side: both Berlin Tegel and Abu-Dhabi airports are horrible - both outdated too small and boarding was a nightmare on both. That is not an Air-Berlin problem or fault. What is however Air Berlin's fault is the stupidity in the way we boarded in Tegel buses taking us to the aircraft and passengers boarding an A330 from both the front and rear gates without taking into account seat numbers. Result was dozens of people trying to go past each other in opposite directions in the middle of the aircraft - the most brainless way to board such a large aircraft that I have ever experienced. Other than that nothing to shout or not shout about and will use them again.

Berlin - Madeira - Berlin. Very friendly crew on both flights including regular updates on flight status. Compared to Germanwings all passengers still get free drinks (2 rounds alcoholic beverages are not included) a rather tasty sandwich and then some chocolate later. Space is also ok. So while the service has declined over the years (no more free magazines) Air Berlin still offers better service than most other charter carriers plus the friendly staff made both flights very enjoyable. The only thing I would criticise is that although they show even a movie on this flight you need to purchase headsets which in the end nobody did (yes they are only 3 Euro but giving those out for free would be nice).

Flew Madrid to Berlin. Very ordinary experience. Flight departed bang on time. Crew were friendly and smiling which is always nice to see. We were offered a free non-alcoholic beverage and a bag of chips or gingerbread. They put on a few videos for the 3 hour flight but no headphones were offered. No meals were offered for purchase even though this was mentioned by the crew at departure. I'd recommend you take snacks. We were offered a small delicious chocolate heart as we got off the plane. We had to walk down stairs in the rain and be taken by bus to the terminal. Had to wait ages for our luggage. Is this the 1980s? Seemed like there were plenty of empty aerobridges. No explanation was offered. Wouldn't recommend this airline. Not sure how they ever made it into OneWorld?

I flew from Milan to Berlin round-trip and have to say that after several bad experiences with Air Berlin this time they were over the point. I booked the flight from Malpensa to Tegel and some weeks later they changed the airport from Malpensa to Linate which is further from where I live. This was just the beginning. On the flight back from Tegel to Linate although I was at the check in desk on time (70 mins in advance) they told me that I could not fly because the flight was overbooked! This was the evening flight and they offered me the chance to fly the next morning instead. They offered me another alternative to fly to Linate via Dusseldorf. So I went back to the Air Berlin desk where they gave me a new boarding pass. After finally arriving at Linate 3 hours later than initially planned what completed the disaster is that my luggage did not arrive. Never again.

ZRH-DUS-MIA and return in business class. Short flights okay (only coach class but they kept the seat next to me free). Business class seats fully flat really great if you sleep on the side (otherwise might be a bit short) staff extremely friendly meals rather uninspired (I had a pre-ordered vegetarian meal). Entertainment has a nice selection however I slept most of the time. Would fly with Air Berlin in business class.

Flew an A330-200 from JFK to DUS in economy. The flight was about 25 minutes late taking off (good by most standards). Food was average service was average although the staff came across as a bit unfriendly. The inflight entertainment system was excellent (there were a wide range of up-to-date shows movies and music to select from). However the seats were the most uncomfortable I've ever flew in. My knees were literally pressed up against the seat ahead of me the entire flight. No legroom whatsoever. On the whole nothing to shout about but not the worst either.

### Air Berlin customer review
We flew from Berlin to Abu Dhabi Business Class. The flight was late in Berlin and 40 minutes late on arrival at Abu Dhabi. Missed our next flight to Bangkok. The seats are narrow and for tall persons it is impossible to sleep. The meal is not worth talking about. The cabin crew were friendly.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew an A330 from Berlin to Miami - I enjoyed the food I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough leg room. It was a little tight when the person in front reclined all the way. The entertainment was the best system I have seen lots of movies TV games and the map including flight data.

### Air Berlin customer review
Abu Dhabi to Berlin what a horror joined a long line which snaked out of the door into the duty free area the long line was caused by lack of security screening facilities. Once past security people are compressed into a small area whilst buses transfer you to the aircraft another painfully slow process. Once on board you get to witness some of the worse leg room in economy in the industry. It the took 1 hour to taxi out to take off unbelievable at 0200 in the morning get with the picture Abu Dhabi airport. Once airborne crew come through the aircraft in the dark to serve substandard food. Disembarking in Berlin passport control is at the end of the aerobridge so the line goes back towards the aircraft door and if your a non EU passport holder you can't even get to the line for that counter as the majority EU residents are blocking the path. Once through that process you wait in a small luggage claim area for your bags to eventually arrive! What a horrible experience from start to finish.

JFK-DUS DUS-ZRH TXL-MUC MUC-DUS DUS-JFK. From reading all these reviews before my trip I was a bit nervous but actually my trip turned out awesome! I took five Air Berlin flights on my 3 week vacation and not one of them was an issue. Even my bag arrived with me! All flights were on time served pretty decent food and the flight attendants were friendly. We got served chicken or pasta on the long haul flight and croissants or chips on the short haul. The legroom especially on the A330-200 was tight even for a 5' 3" person like me but it was a manageable. If you're tall you might have a problem. Each seat on the A330 is equipped with a personal inflight entertainment with a good selection of games and movies. When you select a seat on the A330 choose an even number because you'll have a full window instead of sitting between two halves of one. My only problem was the boarding process. Too many people were pushing and shoving when their group is called and the airline changed a gate in MUC without notifying us. Overall my experience was good much better than an US airline. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again!

I flew yesterday from Vienna to Munich and the flight was shared with Niki. Upon arrival at the airport I found that the flight was cancelled. I was given a choice to either fly via Berlin and arrive late in the evening in Munich or wait for the 18:30 flight direct to Munich. I opted for the direct flight and then had the five and a half hour wait at the airport. The 18:30 flight was then one hour delayed as they had mechanical problems. So instead of arriving at the arrival time of 16:00 I arrived at 20:30 in Munich. This is the second time this has happened to me with Air Berlin in the last three months. The previous time I was flying to Milan and I had to spend the night in Dusseldorf as I missed the connecting flight. The ground staff in Munich were completely unhelpful and only the staff in Dusseldorf did an excellent job and were very helpful. I will certainly not fly AirBerlin again. The only compensation I received in the first instance was a five euro drink voucher!

DUS-AUH AB 7460 on 17 October. Flew AB short-haul quite a lot but first time long-haul. Much less positive than previous times. It started with a very grumpy attendant at luggage drop off. No welcome no eye contact just orders. Man must hate his job. Same attitude at gate while boarding. On board less legspace food bad and no pre- ordered vegetarian meal. Flight attendants robotic but that's AB. Movie choice limited. On the positive side: very punctual performance. But on long haul AB is not on par with other carriers like Lufthansa. Chose AB because of direct flight and departure time but will probably shift to another carrier next time. Lots of choice to the UAE.

### Air Berlin customer review
Economy on ZRH-DUS and DUS-AUH. The planes were new but considering this is a European airline why did they design the seats with so little legroom? Everyone suffered when the the person in front started to recline seats. Limited choice on inflight entertainment. The experience on both flights were horrible and we would never want to fly with this airline again. Avoid this airline at all cost.

Flew from Dusseldorf to JFK. A330 service in Business class. I often fly BA Virgin and Singapore Airlines transatlantic. I have to say I thought Air Berlin were just as good (admittedly SIA use A380's on the JFK- Frankfurt run and are a little roomier). I thought the seat was very good (I was in 2A). The food was good and the entertainment system was good although I think Virgin wins that one. Flight was on time despite a big headwind. I will definitely fly them again and love the fact I can avoid Heathrow and use my Avios points.

I am a 1.8 million miler with Delta and have flown millions of miles with almost every Airline in the world in Economy Business and First Class. We recently paid $10000 for two Business Class Tickets from LAX to Dusseldorf with Air Berlin because we wanted to fly on the same air line as family members returning form a visit - never again Air Berlin. It took more than combined 14+ hrs on hold on the phone to confirm our flights. They never answers our various email complaint forms I filled out. Their business class seats are small just like Comfort Economy seat  even so the decline to a full bed but you may fall out when you turn around. Food is average and overall service ranges form very bad to average. Never again.

My wife and I recently flew from Munich to Berlin-Tegel then Berlin-Tegel to Paris-Orly. The connection was only 40 minutes so we knew things were going to be tight but that's how AB booked us. Things went downhill fast when some genius in ground services let 4 band members board the plane with their instruments (guitars etc). It was a full flight and I'm sure everyone here knows how little room there is in the overhead lockers these days. Where did they ever think these guys would be stashing their guitars etc? Anyway surprise surprise there was nowhere to stow them and the passengers were offloaded. Delay caused - 20 minutes plus. Then when we arrived at Berlin we were informed that the connecting flight was aware of the delay and to make our way to the gate as quickly as possible. Problem was the connecting flight was leaving from another terminal which meant a 500 odd meter dash and another set of security check points. Luckily my wife and I are moderately fit and got there reasonably quickly. I looked at the plane through the glass and could see it sitting there with stairs still in place. I presented our boarding passes to a very disinterested woman slumped behind the desk. She casually scoffed/explained that as we were late they had offloaded us and there was no way of getting on the flight. Knowing enough about the words 'offloaded' I didn't bother arguing and I realised there was no reversing the situation. We walked all the way back through security back to the other terminal and were told there was no way of getting to Paris that day as all flights were booked. They put us up in a cheap hotel in Berlin (without our checked baggage). Certainly the worst service I have experienced from an airline and not one I would risk again by flying them in the future.

Return from Faro to Dusseldorf. Check-in in Faro was quick even with only 2 check in counters open. Got seats in back of the plane. Check-in staff nice. Plane boarding was quick and not a hassle and on time. Take off on time. Service on board was great very nice crew. Got one coffee one water and one nice beer for some change. Free movie shown on overhead screens and again a lot of legroom. Cockpit crew provided us with nice information like seeing Paris at night from the sky. We stopped on the tarmac so deplaning was via bus to terminal which took about 45 minutes due to bus queue on terminal. Baggage took about 1 hour before on the belt. With out that mishap Air Berlin is a great airline.

Abu Dhabi to Phuket AB7424. My husband and I flew from Heathrow with Etihad and they were brilliant and can't fault the flight but from Abu Dhabi to Phuket it was awful on Air Berlin. No leg space and when the seat in front reclined you couldn't eat your meal or view the poor selection of video. We had one poor meal which consisted of a roll and not very appetising considering this was a six hour flight this was appaling we only had one hot drink with this I asked for a hot drink later and was told brusquely no. Our roll was practically thrown at us as well. Customer service was non-existent. Etihad need to reconsider their flight partner as this has put us off.

Flew Dusseldorf to Faro Portugal. Check-in in Dusseldorf was really nice got seats in row 9 with window. Check-in staff nice and polite and helpful. Plane boarding was quick and not a hassle and on time. Take off just 10 minutes late due to emergency landing of a 4U plane. Service on board was great very nice crew. Service with the Sansibar-Snack was nice we got a Currywurst with roll and two nice bottle of Pommery champagne for a little extra but it was nice to have that. Free movie shown on overhead screens and a lot of legroom. Cockpit crew provided us with nice information. We got jetbridge at Faro so deplaning was nice and smooth again. Baggage was on time on the belt. So this is a great airline.

Aug 23 from JFK to TXL and again on Sep 03 from TXL to JFK. Our Eastbound take-off was delayed 2.25 hours due to “ mechanical difficulties but the flight going back to JFK arrived a few minutes early. AB has a problem with space which is in short supply. I am average height and weight yet I could not walk in the aisles without turning sideways. A passenger in front me on the Eastbound flight reclined her seat and made the space issue more critical. Seats are narrow and seat belts date back to 1968. Staff are friendly and polite but refuse to recognize that some passengers do not understand German. Food quality surpassed my expectations saluting the American Cuisine on the Eastbound portion. The meal quality on the Westbound portion surpassed that of Business Class food on other carriers!

### Air Berlin customer review
This was my second time on AB after a short flight to Crete in 1997. To make a long story short - the 2 biggest issues were: The narrow space between the seats Ryanair has more space! That would be OK on a 2-3 hours flight but not 12 hours (TXL-AUH-HKT and back). Terrible. I am 1.88m and did not know how to sit. Customer service: I do not know if the flight attendants earn enough or have zero training because they have no idea about customer service. At the end of the day I do not care - I want the best service for my money and I have to say that I have never - and I have been to almost 80 countries - experienced such unprofessional often rude stewards. Two examples: I ordered special meals and on 2 of the 4 flights there were problems with it and the AB staff screamed the information about my special meal throughout the cabin. I went to the kitchen for a second beer. The lady gave me a lecture in a very rude undertone that the supplies have to suffice for the return flight from HKT to AUH as well. All this and more has never happened to me before. The result for me is: AB and AUH never ever again. AUH is a mess too - everything is totally unorganised and everything works like on a bazaar. I know DXB and DOH as well. DXB and EK are the best and I love to use them.

We flew ORD to TXL on July 31 and TXL to ORD on Aug. 18. After years and years of flying with UA and having to transfer in Europe it was a relief to fly non-stop to Berlin.

17/8/2014 Berlin Tegel to Dusseldorf AB6445. Dusseldorf to London Stansted F7 276 (with Etihad) 17 August. Our family have travelled with Air Berlin for years mostly within Europe no problems except now they have an inefficient incompetent partner for the route Dusseldorf/London Stansted called Etihad operated by Darwin airline based in Switzerland. Etihad is never on time and 17 Aug flight from Dusseldorf was first delayed by 2 hrs then another 1 hr + then cancelled. That made 2 flights that day cancelled no reason given at the gate. Air Berlin say they aren't responsible and there was absolutely nobody to help reschedule flights. Etihad Regional NEED to be represented at both airports because there was no staff whatsoever so no customer services to help any of the many passengers.

8th Aug 2014 London Stansted to Dusseldorf AB5825 and then 9th Aug Dusseldorf to Cancun AB7416 and return 23rd Aug Cancun to Dusseldorf AB7417 and Dusseldorf to London Stansted AB5826. Really good long haul cross Atlantic flights kind and helpful at staff check-in and for in-flight service. Good meals with drinks brought round in between. Planes seemed new with fresh seating and USB ports on the media screens. The short haul Stansted to Dusseldorf parts were delivered by Etihad Regional and again good in-flight service. The only slight negative was the time to check in on return they opened it 1.5 hours pre flight and completed 45 mins before the flight with only about 30 people in line the slowest check per person I've ever known. However Dusseldorf airport was lovely and smart for the wait time between flights. Avoided US Immigration hassles/poor customer service by flying Germany to Mexico.

We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket with two little ones. Flight was a bit shaky due to monsoon season nothing that captain could do about it the aircraft was new clean food was fine crew very attentive especially the young male attendant on the way back who was superb. The seats were fine too but when the person in front reclined his seat there was unfortunately not much space to move especially with the little one on your laps. Overall it was very pleasant experience and we will fly with Air Berlin again.

Air Berlin takes low cost to the max - we will never fly with them again. 3 of us flew from Heraklion to JFK via Dusseldorf on July 20th. After checking in online the previous evening we arrived at Heraklion airport 2 hours early to drop off our bags. There was no separate bag drop line and we were at the very back of the check in line. AB was trying to check in 350 passengers for 2 flights using only 2 counters Each group would take 10-15 min to be checked in - a total nightmare. By the time we got to the counter it was 10 min past departure time the PA system was calling our names for boarding and we hadn't even started the check-in process. By some miracle we made it onto the plane but our bags didn't. When we got to JFK we filled out the lost bag paperwork and headed home thinking we'd get the bags in a day or two. We finally got 1 bag 5 days later and the other two 8 days later.

### Air Berlin customer review
Hard to rate Air Berlin as a whole since we never got on the plane. Our complaint is about the people who work at the Air Berlin counter in Zurich Switzerland. We arrived 40 min. before departure and were told that they couldn't check in our luggage because we were 20 min. late. We asked if they could send our luggage on the next flight we were told no because it must go with us. Our dilemma was to lose our luggage or lose the flight. They were very uncooperative and unhelpful to 2 old travelers. One would expect more from the personnel at the counter aren't they there to help us instead of causing more stress. We rushed to Swiss Air and they boarded us with 30 min. before departure with our luggage. That's what you call a helpful personnel and a good airline!

Flew ORD-TXL-STR STR-TXL-ORD. Was nervous after reading all of the comments here but the flight was very good. The IFE was perfect small TVs on the back of every seat in economy with more than enough movies TV shows music and games. Food was decent enough for the price water was served periodically. 5 bathrooms: more than enough. Staff was pleasant enough. Only problem is that the 2 hour layover in Berlin Tegel was hell. Berlin-Tegel Airport is designed terribly and was under construction when I flew but that isn't Air Berlin's fault.

Flew business class from Berlin to Abu Dhabi. Outbound flight in the evening was good. Service was great. Flat beds great. Food was pretty poor though. I've tasted better 99p microwave made meals. Inbound flight - flat beds great. Service was awful. I echo comments made here about attendants wanting to get the job over and done with as quickly as possible. On top of that the breakfast was without a doubt the worst breakfast I have ever tasted. A McDonalds McMuffin is fine dining in comparison. So good hard product. Mediocre soft product.

We flew Economy with Air Berlin as it was the only carrier that offered a flight from Naples to Stockholm at a good price and we were pleasantly surprised with the whole experience after reading quite a few negative comments in this forum. There was a 3 hour stopover at Berlin Tegel which wasn't great but no issues whatsoever with Air Berlin. Both flights left on time aircraft was newish and clean service was pleasant despite a fully loaded plane and they also threw in coffee and a sandwich. No inflight entertainment but hey on a 2 hour flight who needs it? We were very happy with what was delivered for the price (Italy to Sweden for just $200) and I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.

6/08/14 AB7421 ORD-TXL. 6/24/14 AB 7420 TXL-ORD. I had the privilege of flying Air Berlin business class last week from Berlin to ORD. It was my first time with Air Berlin. The seating was the best I have had. The staff were friendly and efficient. On my return from Berlin-ORD I had the best airline meal I have had. It began with a Thai beef salad and I selected Beef Slices in water chestnut sauce for an entree. Both salad and entree had very tender beef. The cold meal was also very good. A recent review said the new business seats were narrow. At 300+ pounds I found it to be fine. I'll definitely fly them again.

After using United for many years on my trips from the US to Berlin I was excited to try Air Berlin. The fare was more than UA but I decided to try them. Mistake! The crew on my ORD to TXL flight seemed interested only in getting the service over with ASAP. The food was terrible and served ungraciously. The seats are hard and more cramped than on UA (I did not opt to pay extra for an XXL seat since I'm 5'2 and weigh 98lbs I didn't think I needed it). On my return TXL to ORD the fight experience a mechanical problem resulting in a 2 hr delay. The ground staff made an unintelligible announcement and then retreated behind a glass partition where no one could ask them anything. Again on board service was without a single smile. Same terrible presentation and lacklustre service. I will not be using Air Berlin again.

TXL-JFK and return. Can't understand what all the bad reviews are about. Both flights were on time using an A330 with the cabin in a clean good condition. Not a lot of space in economy but I wouldn't say it was much worse than other European carriers. IFE is excellent with a very good selection of Movies and TV series. Food was OK but nothing to write about. Considering the low price and punctuality would definitely use them again. Only negative is Tegel airport which is simply not designed (or capable) of handling large aircraft - but that is not Air Berlin's fault.

I flew the OSL-TXL route on an A320. The plane was packed but the staff still did a great job. They gave a Air Berlin - The Ryanair of the One World alliance just plain poor. Having flown TXL-SOF return here is my experience. I am a top tier OneWorld member and fly all the time but AB are by far the worst member of OW. Their hub airport Berlin Tegel (TXL). Without doubt the worst hub airport in Europe easily surpassing chronically bad airports like LHR. It is a series of temporary buildings and metal huts connected by temporary walkways. Grossly overcrowded with massive deficiencies in service such as bathrooms restaurants seating areas etc. Those they do have are dirty. AB check in is often crowded and has long lines security was OK. But wait I am a top tier member so I can use their lounge right? Yes sir it is past security. OK I have 2 hours to kill I get to the lounge and there is no attendant there is an automated card swipe machine to enter that only accepts AB status cards. Eventually a man appears I explain I am an emerald member sorry you can't get in must have an AB card no override or personnel available. Now for you USA fliers that have a US sized carry on this gets a frown of disapproval from AB staff I was asked to check mine. Except they lost it from SOF-TXL. Inflight service on this 2 hour cramped seat pitch was a drink and a "sweet or salty" snack. I am done with AB - I'll connect through Madrid Helsinki or London thanks.

I flew the OSL-TXL route on an A320. The plane was packed but the staff still did a great job. They gave a coloring book and stickers to my children. They enjoyed the flight. Water was served.

We were given a (what they called) sandwich which was half the size of the palm of my hand and bottle of water this constituted a 'meal' just woeful.

My wife and I had reservations on Air Berlin FCO-DUS/DUS-MUC AB8841/AB6031. The DUS-MUC flight was cancelled which in itself is not unusual. However the manner in which their personnel dealt with this was not at all professional. There were no clear announcements or directions on what we had to do nor on where to proceed to claim our luggage. Then after we secured our luggage there was the re-booking procedure. There was much time and frustration in this process and did not leave us with a good feeling about Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin was fine going from ORD to TXL. Good service actually decent food. Booked an extra size seat. Beware of this. The seats that are by the window in the bulkhead do not have much space for your feet as there is a large boxed in area for the door when it is closed. Aisle seat is fine but window seat not. TXL has to be one of the worst airports I have ever been to. Slow bus service from the plane to the terminal. 2 passport agents for 100's of citizens. On the way back I could not find out where my flight was leaving from as I had made a connection and no one would help me. Poor signs. I had to exit the terminal walk two other terminal down on the street and then re-check in for my international flight. I had 55 minutes between flights and kept asking when I booked was this enough time. I was told YES - plenty. I barely made it and was the last person on the plane. Ran the whole way to the gate. Flight back was not so good. A bit of a surly flight attendant. The guy in front of me kept putting his seat totally back and I could not eat my dinner or even get out of my seat! I am a small person - this was crazy. I asked him for some assistance but even though he spoke English - he ignored me. Would I fly them again probably not.

Flew FRA-TXL-SZG. Excellent Airline. Food was good. Helps so much to have a few screens to look at during a flight. The staff were so kind. The funny thing I noticed was they advertise more for Etihad than they do for themselves. Would definitely fly them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin business class from Los Angeles to Berlin in May 2014. The first thing I noticed about Air Berlin business class: It's cramped. Very cramped. Air Berlin tries to sell the head-high dividers between its business class seats as "even more privacy" "even more isolation" and so on but in reality these are just flimsy plastic screens that fail to disguise the fact that Air Berlin has taken away about half the width of a "normal" business class seat and inserted another seat which is recessed so the other passenger's feet are sticking into your space. They manage to cleverly disguise this in their advertising by depicting only isolated seat units. In Air Berlin business class the feet of the person in the recessed seat next to you are a few inches away separated by a flimsy shaky plastic screen cutting into your space. The person in front of you is also recessed with their head sticking into your space. Air Berlin's plastic seat divider is - inexplicably - cut low in the back with the effect of exposing the top of your head if lower your back rest. If you recline and the person "behind you" (remember they're only half-way recessed) doesn't they're breathing on your scalp. If the person behind you coughs a lot - as happened to me - you're either coughed on the head a lot or you simply can't recline. This is exactly the kind of annoyance one pays to avoid in business class. In addition to significantly reduced width the seats are very short. I'm 185cms (6'1") and I could only "lie down" with my knees pulled up toward my chest. On my right the armrest was about four inches thick. On my left it was exactly the width of my index finger (not an exaggeration) and it was squeaky and wobbly (hard to believe but true). The in-flight entertainment is good with a solid noise-cancelling headset provided. The 15" screen is decent and operated via a remote with a mouse-like controller that works reasonably well but which your mother will not learn to use in a 100 years. The entertainment selection is limited. There were a few new movies but most of the selection was old stuff. There is a power outlet and a USB outlet. Storage is a problem. There is a compartment with cheap carpeting under the ottoman a pouch for magazines and rather small overhead compartments. Except for the medium-sized table there are no surfaces. Every business class passenger has - a few inches from their face - a strange UFO-looking contraption that turns out to be a combination of reading light and "night light. One can't help thinking this must be a case of designers gone insane. These units are unnecessary because there already is a reading light in the ceiling and ugly and cheap-looking producing the palest "night light" you could imagine. The food is pretty bad. Decent alcoholic beverages and snacks are available at any time. The flight attendants try pretty hard but they can't make up for the failings and cheapness of the cabin. They're nice but they'll throw you out of the kitchen immediately if you try to get up and stretch your legs a little. This shouldn't even be called "business class. It's more of a glorified economy class plus.

Phuket to Abu Dhabi. Most uncomfortable seat and with the smallest leg room I've ever experienced. Knees where wedged against the seat in front of me the entire flight and I'm only 5'11". They had to have the guy in front of me put his seat forward when serving the meals just to fit the food trays in. Entertainment and movie selection was laughable with nothing even remotely current. I know this is a low cost carrier but Ryanair is more comfortable that Air Berlin. Spend a few extra dirham and go with any other carrier than Air Berlin.

Flyer beware! I recently booked a flight through OneWorld Alliance-American Airlines. I received the confirmation email stating clearly a 2 baggage allowance. I arrived to the airport with an extra bag which I was prepared to pay for. The check in desk refused to acknowledge the baggage allowance in the confirmation email and preceded to charge my card for all the bags. The card was swiped several times as the agent said the charge would not go through. At this point I opted not to take the flight due to the excessive cost (550 Euro) and left with all my bags. I checked my account today only to discover that $412 USD has been taken from my account from AirBerlin. As I did not approve these charges I do not have a receipt. I attempted to call AirBerlin but was not able to get a human being on the phone.

Abu Dhabi to Phuket on an Etihad ticket. Air Berlin flies this sector on behalf of Etihad. A satisfying experience. The plane was only around 60% full so I had 2 seats to myself. The seats were a bit cramped so it would be uncomfortable if the flight was full. Very nice and friendly crew who chatted and socialized with the passengers. Food was not bad at all I was actually dreading German food due to my previous experiences with Lufthansa but Air Berlin's food was obviously from Abu Dhabi airport and tasted good. Smooth flight no complaints at all.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew Air Berlin last night (26/04/14) from Phuket to Abu Dhabi. Extremely limited service left my food and very uncomfortable flight. These are literally a low cost airline with a poor meal and a bottle of water thrown in. If Etihad endorse these then we'll revert back to Emirates.

TXL-MXP return. Pleasant and straightforward flight on time. Clearly not the most exciting option as it is a low budget carrier but excellent value for money.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew Cologne-Berlin/TXL return. Modern aircraft both flights with Boeing 737-700 one brand new with Dreamliner interior very nice. Good service from flight crew got 2 drinks and offered sweet or salty snack. Crew was nice and smiling. Pilot informed during flight and arrived on time in Berlin. Baggage was quick on belt. TXL is an old airport and that is not to blame Air Berlin for that. Return flight was nice as well crew gave me a 3rd hot drink that was a nice touch. Plane was not full and the service was nice and with a smile. Much better than Germanwings. I wish Air Berlin would fly CGN-HAM.

### Air Berlin customer review
Milan-Berlin-Antalya and return via Dusseldorf: a reasonably enjoyable experience although Berlin Tegel was possibly the worst 'airport experience' I can remember for a long time especially as I had a 4 hour layover stuck in what seemed like a make-shift demountable building plus use of a few old steel chairs. Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time). Priority luggage does not appear to be recognised. All in all quite a pretty good experience and which reminded me for the benefit of my fellow countrymen very much like some of the better Jetstar flights and experiences in Australia.

### Air Berlin customer review
Oslo-Berlin (Tegel). Boeing 737-700 round trip. Same equipment. Check in was fast both ways. We checked in 1 bag. You can have 1 free (23kg) bag checked in. Pretty much left gate on time both ways. Seats were comfortable but jiggly. I got the seat of the passenger sitting in front of me in my lap during take off both ways. Air Berlin says on their website state they will give you a free non alcoholic drinks and a Ham/Cheese sandwich on flights over 90min. We got a choice of "sweet or salty". Note: If you choose "sweet" you will get a waffle bar. If you choose "salty" you will get a bag of chilli potato chips. Drink choices of coke products and juice/coffee. It would have been nice if they asked if you want a "waffle bar" or a "bag of potato chips" because I was confused. An overall average flight. Left on time and landed on time. Good value for money.

### Air Berlin customer review
Took this flight long haul from JFK to Poland. The seats were small and the leg room is very small. I usually travel this route through Aer Lingus which has a lot more space and more comfortable but unfortunately they discontinued this route. The flight attendants for my flight was rude and not nice. They didn't smile and if you asked for anything it seemed like you were bothering them. The food was the worst. Would not use this airline again. The price was very good though.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-TFS 5 hours flight was on time friendly flight attendant but the free food was not good at all. There was the choice cheese or chicken sandwich. The food you have pay for was a little bit better but still not worse the money. The flight was not expensive so I would recommend this airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
I fly Air Berlin every 2-3 weeks long haul from Europe to Miami doing the same flights all the time. One thing that stands out is that they are not consistent. The crew (under-staffed) do not work as a tight team and so the service is often all over the place. Being a TopBonus Gold member makes no difference at all except for priority check-in lounge access and pre-aboard. I always fly economy and choose to sit at the back I usually miss a choice of meal the seat next to me is rarely kept free and the regular collection of rubbish from your seat is very poor or non-existent. I often disembark with a seat pocket full of rubbish or I take it with me to the toilets during the flight. When pressing the call button they attend to your seat turn the call button off and then a give quick glance to see if you actually wanted anything. Water is given to you in a bottle there is no mid-flight juice/water service. When boarding they have 1-2 crew members greeting passengers while the rest stand in the galley no effort to emerge and help people find seats store luggage etc. I fly Etihad frequently and am shocked at the tie-up the two airlines have - complete opposites when it comes to service. I have a tomato allergy for which I can rarely get a special meal so when boarding I ask them to make sure they put aside a meal that does not contain tomato this request is often met with no response or an attitude of that is a lot of work of 14 in the last year only once did a crew member actually give me a crew meal. I now take my own food. Have tried several times to upgrade to business class with miles but never been able too. On a positive note the long- haul aircraft is modern IFE is excellent and seat comfort is ok and they are nearly always on-time. I have flown business class a few times and they are excellent - there is however only two business class cabin crew for 19-20 people so if full I imagine service would be different when I have flown there is only a 10-12 people in business class.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-TXL-MAD. AB cancelled the original DUS-MAD flight which was quite a nuisance. So had to fly via Berlin which added 3 hrs since they didn't offer to fly direct on their OW-partner Iberia. On the positive side: very punctual flawless performance. Free drinks and a nice snack and only 80 euros one way. Seating in 737-800 to TXL cramped. Luckily an empty middle seat. Otherwise it would be hardly bearable.

### Air Berlin customer review
This a totally no frills airline with seats so close together that there is no room for your knees and if the person in front of you decides to recline your poor knees will pay a price. Getting in and out of seats is difficult and seats are very thin. Our flight was MIA-DUS and too long for comfort this carrier is best suited for regional routes not trans-Atlantic routes that become gruelling. I would rather pay 10% more to get additional leg space from a more traditional carrier. Crew was nice but had a reluctance to speak English even though they are serving an American market I thought that was strange as they clearly could speak English. Food was normal airline fare with lunch and a light breakfast. We flew the A330 which was very nice and new. Our DUS- Berlin and Berlin-Rome flights were fine both on A320's.

### Air Berlin customer review
SZG-HAM-SZG on A320 both ways. Long time ago since I last flew with Air Berlin and it was a positive surprise. Both flights on time. Cabin was very clean and spotless seats are nice and not cramped. We even got coffee and tea on this one hour flight. FA's very friendly. Overall a very good experience and I would fly Air Berlin again on European routes.

### Air Berlin customer review
After a long trip from Sydney-Abu Dhabi and a stop time of 3 hours (+1/2 hour delay) the more than 7 hours flight to Dusseldorf started. After almost 2 hours flying finally the staff offered us a small sandwich (with beef or cheese) and one cup of coffee. Another 2 hours later we got a bottle of water. Doing nothing but trying to sit compressed between my seat and the extreme tilted seat in front of me I really felt hungry. When I asked for another piece of bread I got one and the promise that there would be more served in 20 minutes. Indeed we got food. While collecting the rubbish we were offered a drink coffee? No only cold drinks. Before my experiences with Air Berlin were ok but this last flight was really unpleasant.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK to DUS. Great flight. 8 hour trip non stop great entertainment and staff service was excellent.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-AUH on December 24th 2013. Air Berlin 7460 code-shared by Etihad. The seats don't offer much space but I was very impressed by the personal entertainment system. It basically looked like a tablet - very sharp display touch screen fast response. I've haven't seen such a great system anywhere else yet (I only fly economy though). When somebody's unit stopped working the flight attendant brought a replacement! The only drawback of this was the fact that it was a night time flight so I tried to get some sleep rather than spend the time watching movies.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH to TXL and back in mid-November 2013. As an OW Sapphire member I was able to reserve a seat for free in advance additionally because I made the seat reservation only 3 days prior to departure I was able to obtain an XL seat free of charge which is something that Air Berlin normally does not offer its OW partner members. On the flight to TXL the plane type was changed without advance notice so I ended up with a normal seat but on the way back I enjoyed the larger legroom. I must say that if you're taller than 6'2 the normal seats are at the limit of what one could call comfortable. Though there is no pain or pressure in any way. The fare cost less than 5$ the rest made up of various taxes and fees and it ended up costing me around 120$. I like the fact that overall the service was good enough for this amount of low fare. Along with the good public transport connections in ZRH and TXL door-to-door cost me 135$. Departure was on time in both cases. Staff was friendly in both cases though there was nothing special about food and beverages being offered. No inflight entertainment at all bring your own.

### Air Berlin customer review
STN-DUS-TXL. After I read lots of negative feedback about Air Berlin over here I was a bit terrified to use this airline. Actually my both flights were just fine and I can't say nothing bad. It's just 3 star airline so expect 3 star service. Cabin crew not smiling that's true. I read that on intercontinental flights lots of tall pax struggle I was just fine and picked an aisle seat as precaution. Seat comfort - just normal. Flights were departing little late but arriving on time. Check in luggage arrived with me into destination. The small plane this airline is using on route from London are extremely loud.

### Air Berlin customer review
My reservation was for LAX to Dusseldorf to Salzburg. After I made my reservations I got 6 changes from Air Berlin. I paid for the XL seats (more leg room) from LAX to Dusseldorf. After all their changes I am now traveling from LAX to JFK to Dusseldorf to Salzburg and they gave me XL seats only from JFK to Dusseldorf and I now have a 12-hour layover in Dusseldorf. They have rude clerks on the phone. No one can make a decision without a manager and managers only work 8-5 European time.

### Air Berlin customer review
I flew to and from Abu Dhabi to Norway and return. I was very disappointed in both the seat comfort quality of food and general service. The seats were narrow with poor leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the short flight from Oslo to Berlin than the long flight from Berlin to Abu Dhabi and they were hard and generally uncomfortable. The food on the way over was unrecognizable let alone edible with a business class passenger asking me what is was while we were awaiting customs clearance so they obviously got the same thing. The return flight food was marginally better. The staff were friendly and polite but did little to help a woman who had a 4 month old baby and a toddler who had booked a seat with a crib and didn't get it. She was basically told 'bad luck' and they left her to ask 2 other passengers if she could swap seats with them to accommodate her sitting with her child in the crib which attached to the wall. The toilets were also in a revolting state by the time we arrived at both destinations because they were not cleaned at all. I will not use this airline again. I had expected better from an affiliate of Etihad airlines who are excellent.

### Air Berlin customer review
I am only 5'3" tall a frequent traveller and have never had any issues with legroom. Flew Budapest to Chicago round trip in economy class and was shocked at how cramped it was. If the person in front of you reclines their seat at all it is impossible to even move in your chair. The monitor was literally just a few inches from my face. I have never felt so claustrophobic on a flight before. Flight attendants do their job but with a bit of attitude. Also I had one piece of extra luggage (not overweight) on the return flight and I was charged $200 USD. Their fees are written very clearly on a piece of paper when you arrive at the airport but are very unclear and confusing on their website. Considering most airlines charge anywhere from $50-70 for an extra piece of luggage $200 is beyond ridiculous.

### Air Berlin customer review
We paid extra for seats with leg room from Chicago to Berlin and on to Salzburg. We did get the leg room seats. However it seems that Air Berlin seats are exceptionally narrow. I did not measure the seat but my guess is that even an inch or two makes a great deal of difference. As we were taxiing in (both directions) the air conditioner condensation came dripping down onto my legs. On the way to Berlin this was a significant amount of water less so on the way back. The flight attendants who were sitting facing us and just smiled and said "condensation". While on the plane after I read for a while I attempted to turn off the overhead light. It would not go off. The flight attendant said that it had to be turned off by the computer which for the life of me I could got get into place. After he helped he could not get the computer to turn off the light. He switched computers and that still didn't work. We asked if we could change seats but there were not leg room seats available. The flight attendants tried to be very helpful. Berlin Tegel is a grey stone cold airport. Cigarette butts all over the place. Even people who were cleaning just bumped into you with the mop without a word of "excuse me" like the whole row of waiting passengers was supposed to get out of our seats while she mopped. I would not recommend Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
For an almost 2 hours flight to Bucharest from Berlin TXL we we're served a 20g pack of potato chips which was described as snack. Every airBerlin flight the "snacks" become smaller and smaller but this is too much. That bag of potato chips will cost anywhere less than 1 Euro and I think this becomes towards a customer humiliating. There are always the same unhappy stewardess-faces always looking like they can't wait to finish their shift and go home. Not to mention that at the airport we were sent in an improved Terminal with only two flights very crowded and absolutely no duty free facilities. I am fed up with this airline and I have given up my topbonus card after one year of bad experiences with them. I hope I will never have to travel again with them. The only plus I can give the flight was in time.

### Air Berlin customer review
I will never fly Air Berlin again! Some of my flights were ok but flying Dusseldorf to JFK business class was terrible. The seats seemed like they were from 1966 - very old and extremely uncomfortable. Fly this airline at your own risk.

### Air Berlin customer review
DME-DUS-VRA and back. Excellent airline which offers very competitive prices but also good service. The flights from Moscow and back were on time. The connections in Dusseldorf went smoothly. The transatlantic flights were great. I enjoyed excellent entertainment system which provided wide selection of great movies and music. The food were very tasty and fresh. The staff were very efficient and polite. All in all a very pleasant experience. I would recommend not to economize though and pay some extra fee for the preferred seat selection since the leg room is rather scarce.

### Air Berlin customer review
Vienna to Rome in October 2013. Vienna has this amazing facility where if you fly Air Berlin or Austrian you can check your hold luggage in at the city train station up to a day before and take the express train out to the airport. We made use of this facility and despite being a bit doubtful everything worked perfectly. Thanks to this we had no waiting time at check-in or at the airport. Boarding was orderly and quick even with only one person at the gate. Flight crew was friendly the plane being a newish A320. Inflight snack was okay nothing special but I've seen worse airplane food. On arrival in Rome we had to wait over half an hour for our luggage but that seems to be par for the course there. All in all I'd fly them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
Travelled from Berlin to Chicago. I generally have low expectations of airlines today especially when travelling with my national flag carrier British Airways. I was pleasantly surprised by this flight. Yes Economy Class seat pitch is just 30" but the scooped out seat backs help in that respect so you gain a little knee room. The food was pretty good that is to say I've had a great deal worse and the crew were friendly and attentive at all times. I particularly liked the entertainment system which worked well and had large seatback screens. All in all for an Economy Class flight of nearly nine hours not a bad experience.

FRA-TXL-FRA: Just 55min flight but complementary snacks and soft drink in the afternoon flight and also complementary warm bread and soft drink in the early morning flight. Cabin attendants were friendly on both flights. Even landing on time at FRA due to full spots we had to wait on a taxiway for 10min. Outsourcing ground staff at TXL could not answer where the AB lounge was. I don't know" with smile.

Air Berlin domestic TXL-DUS-TXL 737-800. Though almost fully booked on both ways boarding was smoothly (maybe due to new boarding process). Crew - as always at Air Berlin - a bit of a mixed box: varying from friendly with a personal touch to absolutely indifferent. Seat quality and choice of snacks and beverages very good for a short hop. Arrival 5 min late both ways - so almost on time. All in all good domestic product and value for money.

SKG-Dusseldorf-Stansted. Flight went very well. All on time. Polite staff and good "meal" on board. I would recommend.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flight from CPH-TXL. As this is a short flight (around 60 minutes everything included) food and beverages are not a matter of survival. However Air Berlin was once renowned for its on board service even on short haul routes. No longer. There was absolutely no service at all on this flight. Neither was there any explanation. One flight attendant privately admitted that they did not have anything on board. Too bad as they were one such a great airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
No Transit At Tegel airport and double security check at arrival and departure! One hour transit is not enough and we almost didn't make to the flight! From TLV to Tegel and from Tegel to Zurich. Our luggage didn't arrive and we had to wait 3 hours for the next Air Berlin flight to receive our luggage! Cheap but not worth it!

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-JFK Business class flight 7450. Good service good staff good food good wine and drinks but the seat was horrible.

### Air Berlin customer review
Worst experience with Air Berlin was my first and will be my last. Flying from TXL to GDN and the flight was cancelled at the last minute no extra information was given and the boarding screen was just switched off so no one knew what was going on. Then we had to stand in a line for over 2 hours to be told that there were no flights for a few days after which was unacceptable. Then it was the whole process of finding the luggage to collect and the staff were so rude and unhelpful.

### Air Berlin customer review
Our flight from San Francisco to Dusseldorf was delayed 27 hours. We were promised a hotel for the night in the SF area. Instead Air Berlin provided us with no accommodation no advice no refreshments no phone calls. We were misinformed by Air Berlin about the availability of hotels in SF and alternative flights across the Atlantic. In effect we were abandoned by Air Berlin. We therefore cancelled the flight and flew with another airline. We would not recommend Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
My flight was on 9/1. I took the 2 hour flight from Zurich to Dusseldof and then Dusseldof to JFK. There is no sign outside Zurich airport about Air Berlin you have to discover that its Check In area is at 3. Check-in line was short and easy. The plane arrived at Dusseldof with no gate so a bus took you to the door. Once you exited the door you enter Germany. You have no idea where you were. I found out I had to move from the arrivals area to the departures area. I had to go trough the security check and then get my passport stamped. The inflight service and food were excellent. There were two meals. Flight attendant provided non-stop service and distributed water bottles. The programs on the monitor were excellent and the screen has very good resolution. The flight map was not working.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK-Berlin-Sofia-Stansted-Dusseldorf-JFK. Planes are new and clean but the space between seats is really small. I am 5'7" and found it to be tight can't imagine how someone taller will feel. At one point the person behind me asked me to move my backrest forward because it was too tight for them. Food is average to below average maybe at par with American's food on international trips but lesser quality than British Airways. Flight was on time service was decent. I have a OneWorld Sapphire status so I used the BA lounge in Berlin (TXL). The lounge was old and quite dirty kind of like the airport itself. Selection of food was poor drinks were ok. On return flight I was not able to use a lounge at the Stansted airport - AirBerlin pointed me to a lounge but when I got there the attendant told me that AB does not have a contract with them. Then there was a last minute gate change and I had to sprint to a new gate to catch my flight. Used AirBerlin lounge in Dusseldorf - minimal selection of food ok on drinks. Flight from Dusseldorf to JFK was on time with 2 meal services average quality of meals. I do not plan to fly AirBerlin in the future.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK-TXL return in Economy. Overall quite satisfied with Air Berlin. Check-in at JFK quick and staff accommodating in helping find me a good aisle seat (I am rather tall). Gate staff and boarding were fine. AVOD fine although TV choices were a bit limited. Seats are comfortable legroom should be more than adequate for someone under six feet. Cabin crew were polite drinks service was punctual liked the whole bottles of water handed out. Food was merely decent. Return flight same comments although TXL gates leave a lot to be desired. Overall I would recommend AB; despite their lower cost they are indeed better than most United States carriers when it comes to Economy long-haul.

28th August 2013 from Malaga to Hamburg on a very well maintained 737-800. Journey started with online check-in and a bag drop at Malaga airport. The queue was not orderly and the staff did not police the queue very well at all. The check-in agent who dealt with me seemed indifferent and did not make eye contact with me which was rather rude. Boarding the flight took quite a long time as the flight was full. Far too much hand luggage had been allowed aboard the flight. The cabin crew were not very friendly nor welcoming at all. There was considerable turbulence during this flight and the crew did little to allay the fears and concerns of some of the passengers. A small snack was served as well as a drink. At the end of the flight an overheard monitor displayed the route taken for a few minutes only. There was no goodbye from the crew at the end of the flight. I found the staff very cold on this occasion.

### Air Berlin customer review
Overall very satisfied with Air Berlin. Returned from a cruise which ended in Venice. First took a short flight to Dusseldorf to then catch the connection to JFK. All connections were made on time. The Air Berlin flight staff were all very congenial. Was able to watch three movies on their entertainment system to pass the time. Food was good. Open" bar even better. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL to SOF return. Really can't complain about their short haul product - both flights were on time a drink and a snack offered and crew on both legs were friendly enough. At least the short haul service is comparable to established airlines such as Lufthansa or BA. Will definitely use them again in the future.

WAW-TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL-WAW. Flight from WAW to TXL on a new Bombardier Q400 short and smooth. Flights from TXL to AUH and from AUH to HKT on the A330-200 were half empty so it was very comfortable having 4 seats in the middle row to sleep all by myself. Same thing on the way back. Service was great as well I can't complain at all.

I flew to Europe on June 15 from Fort Myers (FL) to Duesseldorf. My previous trip was in January 2013 (Berlin- Miami). Company changed their fees on June 1st and nobody had a courtesy to let me know that even though I am their top bonus member (frequent flyer program). I called before my flight to double check and asked if there is anything else I should be aware of (I flew with them few times before so I was familiar with their policies) and teller forgot to mention they changed baggage fees (from 50Euros to 200$). Customer service representative at the check in desk forgot to mention that too and she just transferred me to the cashier and it was than when I found out about the charge! I don't mind paying but I do mind being ripped off! Besides that their seats are very small and food quality could be better (a lot better).

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-VIE a weekend trip 26/7-28/7. Both flights delayed: in Berlin they announced 10 mins but it turned to be 25 mins when we boarded. There was an apology from the captain. Return flight also delayed this time nobody announced anything and we had to wait. When for a 55 mins flight you have a delay of 20 mins it is not that good. I found the crew not necessarily rude but there was no feedback from them there were just doing their job and waiting to finish and go home. I keep asking myself how small a sandwich can become? At Air Berlin they succeeded to make the snack smaller and smaller. The Inflight Entertainment is becoming more and more "commercial" and there are no more films or cartoons.

### Air Berlin customer review
Very satisfied with my first long-distance trip on Air Berlin. Kind and humorous staff both on the planes and at the airports. The food was tasty and more than enough also plentiful drink runs. Then before the staff retires for about 2 hours one receives a small bottle of water-never had that happen before. As can be seen the staff presence is great throughout the flight. The Inflight Entertainment is good too although the TV series were a bit outdated. The plentiful amount of films made up for that again though. On the night flight we were given a large amenity kit with tooth brush and paste socks ear plugs and a eye mask. Only problem is the tiny seat pitch. Even if the person in front of you doesn't put back his chair your knees touch the seat in front of you.

At Dusseldorf airport now waiting for a flight to Milan Malpensa. Our flight was about to board at 4.45pm they started boarding when all of a sudden we were told the flight was cancelled and with no further instruction or explanation other than to go get our bags and get our tickets re-issued. The Air Berlin staff are rude unhelpful and did not give us any alternatives other than to cancel flights or get on an even later flight out of Dusseldorf. This was my first experience with Air Berlin and it will be my last.

Business class from LAX to Berlin as LH had a technical so they offered this: Great One World Lounge in LAX far better in every way than the place that LH shares. New plane. Crew interested and friendly. Business seats were a trip back in time - far from flat and also cheap-uncomfortable so very stupid when they compete with flat beds on the route. Food was about OK only but no "class". Overall: was nothing like a Business should be at the price.

### Air Berlin customer review
AUH - HKT and return as part of Etihad codeshare. Out in old business class configuration and return in new configuration which is the same as Etihad's business class. Food and beverage offer was not quite as sophisticated as Etihad's but not far from it and I found the food to be very tasty and well presented. The staff were also good in my opinion - being warm and attentive. The old business class seat would not be that comfortable for sleeping on an overnight flight but the layout actually worked well for a daytime flight. IFE was good with enough variety and choice to keep most people happy. All in all I was quite impressed and would be happy to fly their long haul business class product again!

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin carries its passengers in very low regard. After several plane issues a problem with the door opening and other mechanical problems we sat on the plane at the gate for 30 minutes. While most of the plane had connecting flights the airline did not hold the planes. After flying 11 hours from LAX to Berlin I counted twelve of us that missed the connecting flight to Zurich due to the airline's failures. Had they held the plane it could not have been delayed more than ten minutes. So I had to wait five hours in the Berlin airport for the next flight. The airline's response? A measly $10 voucher not accepted by many businesses in the airport.

Air Berlin from TXL to VCE and back. Everything went extremely smoothly. Free seat next to me (as a Topbonus Gold member) pre-ordered food was on board and very nice (Indian vegetarian curry) cabin crew very friendly and professional both flights a few minutes ahead of schedule luggage among the first 5 bags on belt. Air Berlin at its best!

Departing Catania Sicily Italy on June 30th we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before scheduled departure time. Massive line for check-in only one woman and one desk checking in 2 flights. No weather nor equipment issue purely bad management and under-staffing. 3 hours in line not a single announcement. By the time we arrived in Dusseldorf our flight (business class) to JFK was long gone. Told the next flight they could get us to Chicago on was the following afternoon - 24 hours later! Told they'd booked us into the airport hotel and they gave us two 10 Euro food vouchers. Flew back to Chicago on Lufthansa/the Star Alliance. Despite business-class having angled seats the food service and punctuality of the flight were flawless. As a lifetime-gold/million-miler on American this experience was sufficient for me to alter my habits and to focus on the Star for my future air- travel needs. Air Berlin's 'service' was utterly lacking.

### Air Berlin customer review
We came prepared we flew from LAX to DUS. Flight was smooth and food ok. Crew was just like every other flight crew. We took a tape measure and measures the seats front to back and side to side. The seats are the same on all the different airlines we flew except for jet blue which had a 1 inch larger seat. The reason why the seats seem close is because they recline to a greater degree.

Berlin to Abu Dhabi and back. In general aircraft's ok but the biggest problem in the company is the impolite and unhelpful staff. Flight attendants do not offer help or service at all. Atmosphere in the plane was not very comfortable due to rudeness of cabin crew. We try to avoid flying with Air Berlin from now on.

WSW-TLX. Flight delayed by 2hrs. No sms or email sent to inform passengers. Rude check in staff. No apology given onboard. Ageing noisy turboprop plane. Unpleasant experience.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH-CFU-ZRH. Flight out left on time very nice crew and efficient. They served you a sandwich which was tasteless and a free soft drink. They offered from the menu "Onboard Cafe" against payment. Since the flight was only a bit more than 1.5 hours the sandwich was ok. Flight back 30 minutes delayed - not the airlines fault. Again very nice and attentive crew same sort of sandwich offered on the way back. For short flights Air Berlin is fine.

Flew Dusseldorf to Kos a Greek Island for holiday. Check was not able to take a sun umbrella as luggage only after discussion we were able to check it in. Boarding was via bus but ok. Seats nice but special. Food service was a sandwich and soft drinks. Bought from the Sansibar list a Currywurst (sausage) with a roll and a beer. This was nice and good. Flight landed 3 hours later on time. Crew was nice and friendly. Cockpit informed us about the flight. Would fly them again but Check in needs to improve.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK to Nice via DUS. Flight was awful. The whole flight was spent with a woman putting her seat back in my lap. Mind you the legroom was barely existent to begin with. The seat back TV had no sound and the one on my wife's side had no picture. The crew while strolling by didn't really react to anything. The food? The "meal" on this flight was inedible! I could barely wait for them to take it away! The only saving grace was the warm beers I could occasionally get from a bored crew member. The second leg was thankfully quick and over fast no food and they wanted money for everything. Sometimes comfort is worth the price.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK-CTA with a connection in Berlin. Plane delayed 3 hours for no reason out of JFK. Missed connecting flight to Catania. Air Berlin re-routed us through Rome and then by Meridiana to Catania. The entire time telling us our bags would arrive when we do. No problem. We land in Catania. Our bags never made it. Finally got our bags the night we were leaving. The airline is very disorganized. The seats and leg space are small. The food is terrible.

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin flights out of Dusseldorf delayed all week per lounge receptionist. Ours delayed 2.5 hours which puts our connection in serious jeopardy in the US. The lounge is small and the food the most limited I have seen since flying business and first (maybe 10 years). I asked if some other food (sandwiches etc) could be provided since we were missing lunch and attendants said this is all they ever have. After reading other reviews regarding seats and service in Business I will not let American Airlines lead me this way again.

### Air Berlin customer review
New York - Dusseldorf - Venice return Vienna - Dusseldorf - New York. The smallest space between rows I have experienced. Anyone over 5ft 8" will be miserable. Airport staff at Dusseldorf offered no updates on delayed return flight - verbal rebellion at the gate. Never again.

### Air Berlin customer review
Business Class JFK-Berlin then on to Krakow 3 days later and then to Budapest 3 days later. In that time they managed to lose our luggage twice. In Berlin there is no one in the baggage area to help you. Lost luggage is handled by a separate outfit located in Terminal C Lobby. Finally received our bags 2 days later. Flight to Krakow was late (we got our luggage). They again lost our luggage on the flight to Budapest. Business Class was nothing special but the food was ok. We had a lot of trouble getting a glass of wine before dinner. Food service on the economy flights were either a sweet or salty roll and something to drink. Their coffee is terrible! The planes were OK - seating is a bit tight but they are an economy airline. If you need to check baggage fly Lufthansa.

### Air Berlin customer review
I used to love Air Berlin and the quick connection and passport control when coming in from NY and connecting in Dusseldorf to Stuttgart. After my last 2 experiences in Stuttgart I will not fly them again. Both times on the return trip and after going through security they called me to re-route my flight. They make you go out of security then go to one counter and then to the priority counter. I have a roll bag that I carry on to Germany. On my first check in it is no problem to take it in. Once you have to go back out and check in the second time she makes you check it in to NY. Customer service on the flights is great. The ground team and systems in Stuttgart are awful.

### Air Berlin customer review
MUC-TLV and return several times. Planes always clean staff friendly food ok. Sometimes they do weigh your luggage but 1-2kg overweight were ok. Arrival in TLV in the late night/early morning definitively recommended as passport control is considerably faster.

### Air Berlin customer review
Los Angeles (LAX) to Nuremberg (connecting in New York's JFK return portion was from Munich (MUC) to LAX via Dusseldorf). My wife and I paid for our seats to guarantee being together on both legs. It made no difference or sense in the end since the seats had no leg room. We were uncomfortable the entire time. Upon arrival in Dusseldorf (DUS) we found out that our connecting flight was cancelled with no other options available. Furthermore our luggage would not arrive at our destination until the next day! No explanations or no apologies were offered. Customer service was dreadful in Dusseldorf - rude and slow. I do not fly for the food or the entertainment. My hope is to travel safely and while on board to not be squeezed.

### Air Berlin customer review
This was the most unpleasant trip we have taken. I had paid extra money for the extra leg room. We had got the seats right by the flight attendants station and by the bathroom. The service cart was constantly sticking out which made it difficult for people to pass to the bathroom and squeezing between my boyfriends legs and the service cart. The monitor with the flight information was wrong. The food was terrible. And the worst were the seats. You feel like you are sitting on the metal bar going across your lower back. On the way from Berlin to Miami they kept everybody boarding the plane in a small locked area separated from the shops and cafes without enough seating for everybody. To top off the trip when landing the flight attendant demanded to take away the pillow that my boyfriend was sitting on because it had to be put away for landing. At that same time the pillow and blanket were laying down on the seat behind me and they did not create any danger but the little pillow my boyfriend was sitting on was taken away from him. Ridiculous.

### Air Berlin customer review
June 16 2013 Venice to Dusseldorf to JFK. Very unorganized in Venice. First told to wait in line 54/55 then it was moved to 5657. There was not enough staff to check us in and people in line were rude and pushy. When we finally boarded we were taken to a bus that they crammed the entire plane into. A mad rush to board. The crew opened both doors which made no sense so again another round of people pushing and ending up on the wrong end of the plane. After everyone was settled we were told that the plane had to be mechanically signed off so had to wait 30 minutes or so. The flight from Dusseldorf to JFK had to be held for us. Impressed with Air Berlin on our outbound flight June 5 from JFK to Dusseldorf to Barcelona but this return flight home left much to be desired.

### Air Berlin customer review
Miami-Berlin. Took flight on a one way basis as return dates were subject to change. I am a top tier AA flier and the addition to Air Berlin gives some good connection options. Aircraft was a new Airbus with standard seat pitch and seat comfort in economy was uncomfortable. The IFE is good with each seat having independent controls and a reasonable selection of movies etc. Unfortunately the selection is via a touch screen buried in your seat back and the Neanderthal behind me felt that instead of lightly touching the screen they had to indent their finger into the screen - constant tap tap into my seat that precluded any chance of sleep. Food average drinks average FA's average. Despite being top tier no way to select seat on line - had to call in advance and their website is poor.

### Air Berlin customer review
BUD-TXL-AUH on 14 May 2013 (and AUH-BKK with Etihad). Everything was OK. So smooth. But beware - on TXL there is no toilet in waiting room behind the passport control. Onboard I met the funniest staff I have ever travelled with. The food was good and tasty. The seat comfort was better average. The IFE was good (better than on Etihad). The price for the ticket was excellent.

### Air Berlin customer review
Paris (Orly) - Berlin (Tegel) short haul flight and very pleased with this airline. Plane was a fairly new 737-700 comfortable clean nice lighting and professional attendants. On time departure well maybe 5 minutes late but arrived in Berlin ahead of schedule. Nice snacks and beverages at no cost. All in all I do recommend this airline from my experience.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flight from Barcelona to Munich. Flight was an hour late. Entering the plane was like entering a discotheque loud music plus screens with advertisement everywhere not comfortable at all. It was cold in the cabin throughout the whole flight. And somehow I did not get any food in the plane although it should have been provided. Would never use this company again.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK to Dusseldorf to Nice - round-trip. Flight was punctual cabin very clean. Food service and beverage was executed very well. Attendants were courteous and helpful. Flight was smooth as well as landing and take off. Baggage transferred and unloaded quite quickly. We were impressed. We have been crossing the Atlantic for over twenty years. I recommend Air Berlin. We would give the poor rating to seat comfort in Economy Class to any airline in today's world.

### Air Berlin customer review
Instead of a non-stop flight to Palma de Mallorca of 1hr 45mins the airline changed the flight routing. We first had to fly north to Dortmund Germany. Total travel time was 4 hours! Plane was totally full. The seat numbers were not correct the staff did not care. No drinks served during this 1 hour flight. Cabin crew disappeared after take off. Arrived at Dortmund told to remain in the aircraft but after a while we all had to leave with our hand luggage to wait at the gate for re-boarding 15mins later. Seating number problem still not solved. Families who were promised to be seated together complained to staff flight attendants were rude and arrogant. After take off finally drinks were served in tiny cups and a dry mini sandwich served. At Palma airport the plane was not docked to the terminal although most gates were empty. We had to leave the plane by stairs take a bus and walk all the way to the arrivals hall.

Copenhagen to Berlin and Berlin to Paris 28 May and return 5 June Paris to Berlin and Berlin to Copenhagen. Sceptical as the tickets were relatively cheap. Surprised by the excellent service: all flights were clean and well maintained we got a free drink snacks free newspapers and the leg space was reasonable. While leaving the flight we got Air Berlin chocolates from staff with a smile. Staff were kind. Overall I had a very nice and experience and would travel them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
AB gets the short haul service right. Both the outbound and the return flight (same day) on time clean well maintained 737s. Generous newspaper/magazine offer in the boarding area at TXL somewhat less generous at DUS. Efficient and friendly on board service with a choice of a sweet (candy bar) or a salty (small bag of sesame saltines) miniature snack and a drinks run they are always gladly serving both a hot and a cold drink wine and beer included at no charge. The friendly and obviously motivated staff a big plus. Legroom scarce but not a big issue on 45 minute flights. Absolutely my choice again for the next intra-German flight if the fare is right.

### Air Berlin customer review
New York to Dusseldorf Koln to Berlin Munich to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to New York in the last 2 weeks. Flights were late which seems out of character for a German airline but landed on time. The seats are extremely close together. I'm 6'4" (194 cm) and could not sit with my legs forward at all and could not stretch them under the seat either. For the longer flights the entire 8 hour flights my knees and shins were pressed into some part of the seats in front of me. I was on the aisle so every time someone passed by me they bumped my knee shoulder or foot impossible to even relax much less sleep. I'm not overweight at all but these seats could only be comfortable for children. To make it all worse on the trans-oceanic flights the pilots seemed to find every segment of turbulence over the North Atlantic. I think we were bouncing around for at least 50% of the trip. Air Berlin: good prices bad passenger experience.

### Air Berlin customer review
Dusseldorf-Berlin-St Petersburg. We checked in easily at the machine. At bag drop our Russian visas were very carefully checked. Boarding smooth for the first flight and our bulkhead seats on the A321 had plenty of legroom. A drink and a very bready pastry were served. Crew were efficient and the plane operated on time. Bussed to the terminal at Tegel. The boarding of the flight to St Petersburg was poor. Although there are dedicated gates for flights to Russia there is no signage or information to indicate that before reporting to the gate you have to have your Russian visa checked (again) at a desk labelled simply "Air Berlin service". To enter the departure lounge you have to pass through passport control. As we could see that the lounge had no toilets and not having been informed about the need to have our visa checked again we and many others decided not to go into the lounge until just before boarding time. At that time we were directed to join a long queue where a single employee was slowly checking visas. All the while Air Berlin announcements were telling people to board the plane immediately as it was about to depart! The whole mess could be avoided by clear signage and information. Once on board the A320 the seating and basic lunch were fine for a 2.5 hr flight - although loud chatter and giggling among crew in the galley during descent was a bit unprofessional. Again we were bussed to the terminal.

### Air Berlin customer review
CPH-DUS CGN-LPA in April 2013. Flights on time decent service with a snack and non-alcoholic beverage CPH-DUS. CGN-LPA a filling sandwich served with same beverages as above. Both flights were good service efficient but a little mechanic. Air Berlin-chocolates given upon disembarkation of each flight. All in all a decent product in today's aviation market.

### Air Berlin customer review
When we booked the return flight from Europe on Air Berlin as a part of our round trip booking through American Airlines we were told that the Air Berlin flight from Berlin on business class would have lie flat seats (not true and the seats sere very uncomfortable). We were told that the connecting Air Berlin flight in Berlin would not require that we go through security again (not true). The food and service in business class were very poor. The cabin was hot and the attendants either could not adjust the temperature or did not pursuant to our request. The Air Berlin website cannot be negotiated to see the seat layout and select seats hence we had to rely on the Air Berlin representative telephone conversations as to location of seats. Our seats were changed 3 times without any notice. Sound quality of the entertainment system is very poor. The information regarding status of the flight and time of arrival on the entertainment system was grossly inaccurate.

### Air Berlin customer review
LHR to Phuket. We were worried about travelling with this airline following the reviews on here however our flight to Phuket was on time and food and in flight entertainment was ok. So far so good. Our return journey was a different story. We arrived at Phuket airport to be told we couldn't check in as the AirBerlin plane hadn't arrived or even set off for us. Various options were thrown around including another night in Phuket returning on the next Airberlin flight. After being left in the dark for some time we were then booked on to a Qatar airlines flight which first flew to Kuala Lumpur then to Qatar where we then boarded a flight to Heathrow. In total we were delayed by 8 hours. The manner in which we were left in the dark at Phuket was very worrying and it seems from the reviews below that this is not rare for this airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH to TXL to MIA. First leg in Economy Class (Air Berlin does not offer Business Class on short haul). Flight on time friendly Crew and nice snack. Second flight in Business Class. Crew friendly greeted passengers by name. Seat not fully flat but angled cradle style but had a good sleep. Entertainment AVOD however no current blockbusters selection of films rather poor. Meals just okay everything is on the tray (starter cheese dessert) except the hot meal which was served seperately. Why don't they serve the cheese and the dessert not separately as they used to? Arrival in Miami a few minutes late immigration took 40 minutes Air Berlin staff in the baggage reclaim area assisting passengers.

MIA-DUS Seat 22 A+C. Check-in hectic but quick boarding slow typical for USA. Seat small and very uncomfortable with little leg room a no go for a 9.5 hr flight. Service sloppy. Drinks ok. The only good thing was the price cheap as this airline has now become. Next time I will use another airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
Travelled from Abu Dhabi to Phuket on 28th April. After reading the comments on here before my trip I was very apprehensive about the flight but the service was good food was good too. The only problem was the leg room which was a bit uncomfortable but I would certainly do this flight again.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-MIA-DUS in economy on the A330 new seats finally with IFE. About 12 movies (some in Arabic) episodes of US sitcoms and music styles. Seats small and with legroom only for people under 1.80metre. I got row 33 next to the toilet unreclinable. Food ok. Generous dispatch of beverages (wine or beer for meals) bottle of water before the night. Friendly staff on both legs.

### Air Berlin customer review
Do not travel with Air Berlin if you are over 6 feet tall. Leg room is unheard of and it is just very unpleasant for flights of 3 or more hours. Cabin crew are helpful planes are fairly new and I would probably fly them again within Europe if prices are reasonable but never again for long haul! Food not terrible nor great either. Also keep in mind that the seats themselves are very small and luckily it was me and my wife traveling together or else it would be a very uncomfortable experience to be pasted up to a stranger. We are both very skinny people and yet we were all up in each others personal space. I took carry on bags and did not checked anything in due to hearing all the horror stories of lost baggage and I recommend you doing the same if your trip is short enough but keep in mind it needs to be under 10kg.

### Air Berlin customer review
Trip from Abu Dhabi to Phuket. The plane is new the overall look is ok entertainment is ok as well (just a few movies and all in English and German). But leg room is ridiculously small the seats are very hard and the food is just ok. Adding to this a very unpleasant crew. I will avoid flying Air Berlin on long distances in the future.

### Air Berlin customer review
2 domestic flights in mid-March (FRA-TXL TXL-MUN) as prices were very reasonable. Flights themselves were unremarkable and indeed I was surprised that snacks were handed out on such short flights (1 hr 25 mins). Biggest complaints have to do with having to take a bus to/from the gate out to the planes. Additionally the boarding process and check-in area for domestic AB flights at TXL is horrible! AB ground staff are rude and unhelpful. Ticketing/check-in/boarding area for Tegel is one of the most inefficiently planned and run CFs that I have ever had the displeasure to experience. Combine that with no train line to the airport (just a severely overcrowded and unpleasant bus route to get to Alexanderplatz or Hbf). Will avoid flying out of TXL at all costs.

Flew Abu Dhabi to Phuket . Flight was most uncomfortable hardly any leg room seats uncomfortable rude cabin crew awful food. Seat back television broke down a couple of times and had to be restarted. Would never travel with them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
Phuket to Abu Dhabi on 17th March 2013. Booked as part of a codeshare return flight with Etihad. Having read previous reviews on Air Berlin I was not looking forward to this flight sector. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how polite the cabin staff were. The plane was clean and tidy and the overall comfort was not much different to Etihad. The meal I had was typical Plane fare and a little less presentable than Etihad but edible non the less. The seat back TV did not have as much to choose from compared to say Eitihad or Emirates but fine for a 6 hour flight. Flight was on time.

### Air Berlin customer review
Connecting flight from OSL through TXL to FRA. Flight from OSL delayed. Connection in TXL to FRA could have been reached but Air Berlin did nothing to support connecting passengers (direct bus transfer) and even after running to the gate boarding was denied with the aircraft still at the gate! Re-booked to next flight to FRA more than 3hrs later. No support whatsoever. After finally reaching FRA suitcase was still in Berlin. Today (2 days later) the luggage still hasn't arrived.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flight Munich-Fuerteventura-Tenerife (back: TFS-MUC). Poor service: only a sandwich although we were onboard for more than 5 hours (with one stop in Fuerteventura where we had to stay on board). From the 5 meals you could buy there were only 2 available (cost more than 10€). On the way back our video monitor didn't work and we only had 1 music channel working. Worst of all: very unfriendly crew. We flew already with TUI-fly and Condor (Thomas Cook) to the Canary Islands and had a much better service and friendlier staff on board. I won't say: never again but if I can choose between Air Berlin and another airline Air Berlin will be the loser.

### Air Berlin customer review
GDN-TXL-TFS-TXL-GDN. In general not bad flights for quite competitive price although with some disadvantages. The main of them is Terminal C on Tegel Airport which is dedicated mainly for Air Berlin short and medium distance flights. It's overcrowded and not sufficient for big amount of departures. In result both our departures from TXL were delayed. The other disadvantage is poor in-flight entertainment. On mid-range flights it's limited to some sitcoms and one movie presented on ceiling monitors. Amount and quality of food is not sufficient for over 4 hours long flight. Fortunately we didn't experience any rudeness of cabin crew as some other reviewers did. In fact we found almost all of members of crew polite and attentive.

### Air Berlin customer review
2 flights - Abu Dhabi to Phuket return. Insufficient leg room rude staff. We were stranded in Phuket on the return leg due to a broken aircraft. No one from Air Berlin appeared to know what was going on - we eventually left Phuket 25 hours late. Put up overnight after almost a full night at the airport in the most basic of hotels. Then our bags got left in Abu Dhabi. Will never fly with them again.

TXL-MIA-TXL Economy Class January 2013. Outbound flight on time however the waiting area was short of seats (old Tegel airport). After takeoff a snack was offered with soft drinks and one hour later they started to serve breakfast. Portion was ok taste ok offered drinks twice during breakfast plus coffee tea after. Mid- time offered a snack with drinks and a bottle of water. Staff were helpful and smiley. The dinner shortly before landing was good (pasta or chicken). Even served hot towels just before landing. The cabin seemed to be freshly refurbished new touch screen monitors with many movies music and games for kids. The seats were small as always on any economy transatlantic flight. Not bigger not smaller. On the inbound flight we had the same experience. I'm happy we chose Air Berlin and the price was very reasonable.

Jan 9 2013 Budapest to Bangkok on Air Berlin / Etihad. Budapest staff were helpful and the flight to Berlin went well. Air Berlin flights from Berlin to Abu Dhabi and from Abu Dhabi to Berlin on Jan 31st were horrifying. Each way it was a 6.5 hr flight in cramped seats with bad food and rude service. The stewardesses were virtually snarling. The food was almost inedible The seats were unusually small. The worst flying experience we've had. The Etihad part of the flights was excellent with great food pleasant service and comfortable seating.

TXL-MIA-TXL A330-200. Very mixed box this time. After a good experience on an Air Berlin transatlantic flight lately I was looking forward to my flight to MIA. Outbound: 1 hour delay due to late arrival. Crew very reluctant and surly Purser seemed unprofessional. Meals explicitly smaller than on last transatlantic trip and not sufficient for a 10.5 hr flight. No snacks in galley some cookies handed out but only once - if you slept at this particular moment you missed your chance. Inbound: Food portions seemed larger though taste was dull. Crew very friendly. Friends of the crew (or maybe colleagues) were moved up front to C or were given nuts and chocolate bars - again: no snacks for normal Y passengers. At the beginning of the flight we experienced heavy turbulence but captain talked passengers through it. All in all both trips felt more like a vacation trip to Ibiza or the Turkish Riviera rather than a transatlantic flight of a want-to-be full service Oneworld airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew Abu Dhabi to Phuket. As it was almost impossible for me to fit me knees into the seating area they fell into the aisle when I finally dozed off slightly. I was abruptly awoken by a male flight attendant who knocked me with a trolley. I awaited an apology but instead was yelled at for having my knees in the aisle. The other flight attendants did their utmost to make us feel as uncomfortable and unwelcome as they possibly could. It was as if they were going out of their way to be rude and unfriendly. Our return flight (mid October 2012) which we were dreading was delayed by over 2 hours. No staff available in Phuket to advise what would happen with our connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to London. When we finally boarded we were again met be extremely rude and unfriendly cabin crew. Flying Ryanair would be considered an upgrade from this. AirBerlin are definitely the worst airline we have had the displeasure of flying with and it is unacceptable that they are part of the OneWorld alliance. If you like flying low cost airlines with appalling service then you will love AirBerlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
Been flying with them at least 8 times a year. Overall the planes are pretty good and the staff are usually friendly. The food is not as good as other airlines and they have been cutting down on the food: The Berlin - Tel Aviv flight would usually have a warm meal now you just get a sandwich. If that saves money fine for me because better meals can be ordered at extra cost.

We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket on 11 December and returned to Abu Dhabi from Phuket with Air Berlin on 27 December. Flight out delayed by a few hours and all the crew had to say was that it wasn't their fault. Eventually there was an announcement that we were going to be given a glass of water! On the fight back one of the cabin crew plonked a meal in front of my husband who asked if there was a choice. The flight attendant told him there was only chicken left. No drinks service before our meal and the food wasn't up to much. Not all the crew were surly but most made you feel that you were a nuisance - even though we didn't ask for anything! Very poor service.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew code share (I thought I was flying Etihad) from Abu Dhabi to Phuket. All in all quite poor flying in business class poor food and seat no lie flat very uncomfortable bad choice of movies. On the return leg they did not have enough food so I did not eat a main dish cabin crew apologised but did not offer any options. On the whole I found the crew to be quite rude and unhelpful. I will not use Air Berlin again and would not recommend them.

Flight AB7417 from CUN-DUS on 29th Dec 2012 on A330-200. Called their serviceline to reserve seats for my wife when checking in I was told there were no records. In the end got a 4 seater for me and my wife with the comment that they would not be able to guarantee until boarding would be completed. Since plane was only 70 % full it finally worked out. Lounge access: Although clearly mentioned on their homepage for their Gold Members no voucher for their contract lounge later in the lounge sent away due to I could not provide them with a voucher! Onboard IFE not working properly even reading lights could not be operated. When asking one FA to help she was very annoyed telling me she has other things to do. Finally she helped by resetting the lights. Food was not nice either. No drink rounds during a 9 hour flight with exception of meals. No amenity kits not even a small one for a night flight. No personal welcome or care for their status pax at least not for me whereas they seemed to be very caring about one more status pax 2 rows further front. Out of more than 30 long-haul flights in 2012 this was by far the worst. Never had such an unprofessional unfriendly experience and will avoid for future trips! They might be acceptable for a short hop within Europe but their long-haul product is really bad both for the ground handling as well as on-board.

### Air Berlin customer review
Düsseldorf to Fort Myers return 3 weeks later. The food was good no complaints. Flight service staff were very good - ground service staff not so. The in-flight entertainment was very good. There was a problem with one monitor. The problem had not been fixed on the return flight - we had the same seats on the same machine! My problem is with the reclining seats. They are very peculiar in that in the full sleep position the body is in a decline the legs and feet are lower than the upper body. A very odd position that I found most uncomfortable. The seats looked a bit worn for newly installed seating. Late night check-in in Düsseldorf left something to be desired. There were 4 counters open and just a handful of passengers checking in. The Business counter was dealing with a rather lengthy problem so we went to one of the economy counters. The woman at this counter practically snarled at us. For these reasons - poor service by the ground staff and the office staff I would hesitate to fly with Air Berlin again.

TXL-AUH AUH-TXL. Staff were surly and unhelpful. We were travelling with an 18 month old and they gave the bassinet seats we had requested/reconfirmed to two men instead of us. Food was terrible service was non-existent. Plane was old and poky considering length of flight. Never again.

We flew from JFK to Tegel. The flight was over an hour late taking off and no explanation or apology was given. No dinner provided and a very poor explanation given for this ie there was a potential for clear air turbulence although during the flight we experienced little turbulence. Breakfast was provided but it was cold and of very poor quality. My wife had no audio for her in-flight entertainment and staff were unable to rectify this. All reading lights that were switched on were unable to be switched off so it was very difficult to get any sleep. The seats were uncomfortable and tended to tip you forward. There was no information provided about destination time or weather and the travel map on the in-flight entertainment did not work. Also no one could provide information about our next flight out of Berlin in spite of us having a forward booking e- ticket indicating that there was a service to be operated by Air Berlin. The general demeanour of staff was surly or apathetic. Without a doubt we would never choose to fly Air Berlin again.

### Air Berlin customer review
My outbound flight to Rome was delayed by almost 10 hours. Customer Service at JFK comprised a few hapless girls who did not bother to try and book any of the passengers on alternate flights. My return flight from Venice was rescheduled from 1.55 in the afternoon to 8.00 in the morning an incredible inconvenience requiring getting up in the middle of the night to reach the airport 3 hours before an international flight. These matters were made worse by the almost total disregard for the passengers or their schedules. Since my return to New York Air Berlin Customer Service has evaded replies to my letters for more than a month. It is bad enough for an airline to be sloppy. Fortunately most of my travels go smoothly. Inevitably I've occasionally travelled with a poor or weak airline. I will never fly with them again.

Air Berlin carrier for Etihad Abu Dhabi to Phuket December 2012. Crew surly and uninterested food and seats terrible no space. The flight was so bad I checked all my onward travel on arrival in Phuket and was prepared to pay for other flights if Air Berlin were the carriers for any other legs. If you have booked with them or will have a leg of your journey with them be warned and do something about it now.

FRA-TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL-FRA. Surprisingly good experience compared to European competitors. FRA-TXL and TXL-FRA flights excellent - complimentary food and wine on a 50 mins domestic flight. TXL-AUH (22.11.12) - enough legroom on A330 personal display and professional friendly and smiling crew. Cabin was in perfect condition. Food was tasty with choice of pasta or beef and drink runs about 4-5 times. Same experience on flight AUH-TXL (07.12.12) with meal and snack on a 6.5 hr flight wide choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks too. Unfortunately moving map was out of order. The captain kept us informed instead. However experience on both flights AUH-HKT (26.11.12) and HKT-AUH (06.12.12) was not really the same as mentioned above. Flight crews looked a bit nervous and tired only 1 drink run. What I dislike at AB is that although they have a very good IFE system it gets boring watching the same movies and listening to same music on each and every flight with them. Especially if you have 4 long hauls in 2 weeks. Either update it monthly or by leg! The second complain is TXL as a transfer airport-it looks appalling and awful in every sense. All in all above average experience. Would fly them again.

Booked XL seats on the flight from Tegel-Miami but the seats was not XL. They were by the door (entrance door and emergency exit) which has a very big bulge on the door with makes the legroom (for your left leg) smaller than an ordinary seat. I asked the steward about this and he was somewhat surprised that the seat was sold as XL. On the way back we ordered XL seat for my son. He got an ordinary seat. On the way back we also booked reserved seating for me and my wife to make sure we did not get bad seats. We got seats by the toilet which were impossible to recline. All together we have paid about 200 euro for nothing.

JFK-TXL-CPH and CPH-DUS-JFK. Inadequate legroom for a 5'9" tall person meant my knees touched the seat in front of me on the overnight to Berlin from JFK. On the way back from Dusseldorf a 6'1" guy sitting next to me couldn't fit in his seat without sitting bowlegged and the elderly woman in front of him couldn't recline. Aside from the DUS-JFK meals which included various unidentifiable items and cold chicken nuggets other amenities were fine but I will never fly them long haul again. On a positive note domestic European transfers had more legroom than the transatlantic flights.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-JFK and JFK-DUS-TXL. All in all better experience than I thought. A330 long haul product quite good. Boarding very strict and by rows. Standard Y seats comfort is good and legroom is okay (if you are 5'10"). XL seats (exit row) on return trip very spacious for a little up-sell. Pleasant surprise: IFE - lots of choices and large screens for Y class. Amenity kit offered on overnight return flight. Food outbound was quite a good surprise as well. Return was so so but still portions are generous. Drinks runs are not so frequent but you can go to the galleys. Cabin attendants are a mixed box but in general friendly. Domestic product: 737-700 looked a bit tatty and old quite cramped.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew from Los Angeles to Berlin and my only complaint is that the passenger behind me asked me not to put my seat back as she then would have no room. I obliged because the passenger in front of me also did not use his seat recline so that I could have a little room. Flight staff very hard working and I remarked to the purser that they did a very good job. The food was adequate plane was clean and fairly new and we arrived to our destination on time. I would fly Air Berlin again.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-AUH. When we booked this flight on Opodo it was listed as an Etihad flight. As we have flown Etihad a number of times and were always satisfied we were looking forward to this experience. It wasn't until a later stage - after purchasing the flight - that this part of our trip (to Australia) was listed as "operated by Air Berlin". After having had a considerably bad experience with them on flight from DUS to MIA two years ago we weren't too excited about this but wanted to give Air Berlin another try on a long haul flight. Sadly things turned out to be even worse than expected: The plane was old didn't have an entertainment system installed and the leg room would have been OK on a trip to PMI from Germany but not for a 6+ hour trip. Ridiculous! The flight attendants were rather bossy the food awful and we were in doubt if the a/c was actually working. To us the "climate" in the cabin is an integral part of the success of a flight. There was hardly any oxygen which makes every flight an unpleasant experience. Altogether it was a very poor experience. This might have been state of the art back in the early nineties but we aren't talking about Ryanair here. Why has Etihad agreed to a codeshare with Air Berlin? It is just like booking a four star hotel but staying in a two star room.

### Air Berlin customer review
Abu Dhabi to Berlin on a A330. First time flying with Air Berlin and a disappointing experience. First problem was the lack of leg room. I'm 181cm and my knees were hitting the seat in the front while when reclined I had trouble stretching out. The second negative was the in-flight service. I can't remember the last time I came across such a sour and unfriendly bunch. No smiles and total lack of effort and interest. Half the food I didn't even bother touching it was so unappealing. One positive was the IFE which was modern and had a fair amount of choice. Air Berlin might be fine for short-haul but I will certainly not be flying long-haul with them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
The baggage drop off service on both Mon October 1st from Zurich (1 hr 10 mins) and the return flight on Thur October 4th at Berlin Tegel airport (1hr 25mins) is simply ridiculous. Why bother to check in on-line and then expect such a delay to drop off your bag. The staff counters were opened for 4 lines (incl business) at Zurich and 3 lines (incl business) at Tegel. I for one will never bother with Air Berlin again as I simply do not have this time to waste on such a pathetic level of customer service.

### Air Berlin customer review
My wife and I flew (non-stop) San Francisco to Dusseldorf AB7393 Sept 5 2012. Everything from check-in to landing could not have been better! Everyone on the ground and in the air was friendly all smiles food and movies great leg room was good. The trip back on Sep 19 AB7392 was the same. I have flown in to Dusseldorf 2 other time on other airlines and Air Berlin will have my business from now on.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flew Las Vegas to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to SFO. AirBerlin has chosen to cram as many seats as possible on the plane an Airbus A330-200 reducing the seat pitch in economy to 30 inches. To do this they removed all padding in the back of the seat and space for legs. Nearly the least comfortable seats I have ever been in and certainly the worst for an 11 hour flight. Lots of empty seats on the plane an indication of how attractive the airline is. The flight out of Las Vegas was 2 hours late in leaving; there is no online check-in for Germany-USA flights the counters do not open until 3 hours before the flight so you drag luggage around until they do open. The cabin was cold not merely cool. Otherwise the food was tolerable the drink cart did have free wine and Baileys the new - not on all flights - On-Demand entertainment system with seat back screens did have an OK selection of movies CDs TV programs; and the staff was efficient and polite. If AirBerlin in the future will get me a direct flight over a painful series of connections I would take them again - otherwise there is another German airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
Palma-Hamburg Economy. The plane was a A330 which was fully booked. The boarding process was disorganized (no zone calls big queues) and as a result of the chaotic boarding we lost our departure slot and had to wait about 40 minutes for a new one. The inside of the plane was a little old the seats were moderately comfy but quite narrow. Air Berlin offers hot meals for a surcharge. The crew did take orders but forgot all passengers in my section. Since they were also not reacting to call buttons I got my meal about two hours into the flight and it had to be removed quite soon since the flight is only about 2.5 hrs long. Arrival delay was 40 minutes. Baggage delivery in Hamburg took over one hour. When I booked the flight Lufthansa was only about 30 Euros more expensive and I should have paid the difference.

### Air Berlin customer review
I have been impressed with this airline before but they have seriously let me down. I had a booking Alicante to Lisbon via Palma de Majorca where I am picking up a cruise ship. I have just received an email from them alerting me to the fact that "due to urgent operational requirements a flight time change could not be avoided". Fortunately I looked closer and found that not only was there a time change but they were now flying me to Faro not Lisbon (no mention of this in the email). I then had to ring a premium number to query this. The person I spoke to did not seem to find it strange that people book a flight to Lisbon because that is where they want to go and that Faro some 300 miles away is no substitute. I have a cruise booked and an overnight hotel booked but now no flight. And to add insult to injury before ending the call I was asked if there was anything else she could help me with.

JFK-Berlin-Stockholm. The JFK-Berlin leg was in Business and the Berlin-Stockholm in Economy with no other option. I found the initial flight to be very good helped by a highly professional cabin crew plenty of room and good facilities even though the plane was older. The food and beverage were very good and generally this rates as high up on my scale of satisfaction. The seats are to be upgraded soon but were not bad if not entirely flat in bed mode. Berlin's newish Tegel Airport was something of an experience. The flight parked on the tarmac and in pouring rain once we were off the plane a people mover took us to the terminal for immigration and customs. Thankfully the process was fast and efficient although I had to race in order to ensure getting to the next gate for the flight to Stockholm. The next flight was however delayed without any explanation and ultimately proved to be less memorable. The plane was older and again required a walk in rain to board. Berlin Tegel is therefore an airport to be avoided in future. To Stockholm there was a limited service although staff had been trained well. I will watch and use them again.

### Air Berlin customer review
FRA-TXL. Non-Stop on an Airbus 320-200. Check in line and security was fast and efficient. Gate was a short walking distance from security. After waiting at the gate for half an hour we were let into departures lounge. The lounge provided complementary magazines to all passengers. Since I do not speak or read German I was unable to read them. When boarding was finally announced everyone rushed to get onto the plane. After our boarding pass was checked we board a bus and were taken to the plane. Since the plane was about ¾ full everyone had a lot of space. Staff were great and helpful. Most spoke German English and a third language. Once in the air flight attendants provided us with a complementary non-alcoholic drink and snack. Landing was great and we arrived early in Berlin. As we were getting off the aircraft everyone was given a thank you chocolate. We again had to board a bus which was a short drive to the terminal. It did not take long for my bag to show up on the arrivals belt and for my vacation to begin. For the price I paid for the flight with taxes $108 CND/€87 they are a great deal. TXL is a dump so it will be nice when Brandenburg opens up.

### Air Berlin customer review
Berlin - Los Angeles. I loved the non-stop service and the nice flight attendants but the food was sub-par and the "new" business class seats which will be replaced again in November to bring AB on the same level as Etihad were not comfortable. The also "new" VOD with bigger screens did not work for me either. All in all flying Air Berlin business class is still worse than Air New Zealand or Turkish Airlines Premium Economy which is a shame for the rather high business class fare they charge!

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK to Zurich with a stop in Germany. Flights both ways between JFK and Germany were on Airbus A330. Complimentary mints and newspapers offered during boarding. The seats were cloth and had adjustable head rests. Leg room felt above average for Economy. Each seat had a pillow blanket and small amenity kit. Personal seatback TV's were also available at each seat and headphones were offered. TV's were touch screen and had a great selection. Flight Attendants offered a substantial food service 2 meals with entree' and side offerings and multiple beverage services. Flights between Germany and Switzerland were onboard Airbus A319 aircraft. These planes had leather Economy seats but without an adjustable headrest. No seatback TV but there were TV screens hanging over the seats every few rows. A few music channels were also available with the volume controls in the armrest. They offered a light snack and beverage service on these flights. The only/main complaint I have is that on every flight flight attendants were some of the rudest people I have seen!

### Air Berlin customer review
Although it said online early am the flight from Mannheim to Florence was going to be delayed three hours on check in at airport the gate agent swore there was no issue and flight was on time. However ten minutes before we were to board they announced the three hour delay. After the three hours flight was cancelled. They could tell us nothing and getting any info in English was difficult. All non German speaking travelers couldn't get rebooked until the next afternoon.

JFK-TXL-BRI Check in at JFK was fast and easy staff on board excellent. My seat was 14A which is in the first row. Found pillow and blanket on my seat but was told I had to stow it up top until after take off. Didn't think I would see them again but 15 min into the flight it was handed back to me without having to ask! Dinner and snacks were served with a smile. TXL to BRI was much of the same. Will absolutely fly again.

We requested a ticket from Venice to Cologne/Bonn on May 21st and we were issued a flight AB8991 to Tegel Berlin with a 40 minutes stopover then flight AB6503 to Cologne/Bonn. Just as well we arrived at Venice airport early as four Air Berlin flights were leaving and only five counters were open. After 45 minutes they opened three more counters which meant we were checked in for our flight 1 hour 10 minutes after lining up. Given baggage receipts and boarding pass's to Cologne/Bonn. Flight was very good in all aspects other than we arrived Tegel at terminal C and were bussed to terminal C which was a delay. We then ran 800 meters to terminal A arriving at gate A6 at 16.45 hours. We were informed that our flight had left early also told we were not on their computer and nor was our baggage on this flight so they were not expecting us. They could not explain why we had onward boarding pass's issued in Venice. We went to their ticket office in terminal A and had superb service to ensure we caught the next flight to Cologne/Bonn. On arrival in Cologne our bags awaited us at the lost luggage area as they had come through on flight AB6503. A pity as in the air it is a good airline but ground staff wise it is way behind.

### Air Berlin customer review
Ground service and check in process very friendly and no queue. Lounge share with British Airways in Berlin Tegel very quiet. Lots of drinks and snacks. No extra boarding queue for Biz but the boarding process was quick. Took off on time. Very satisfied with the service. Friendly and attentive. Food was delicious from the famous Sansibar Kitchen of Sylt. New Business Class seats. Lie angle seat. Not comfortable to sleep. Nice massage function for relax. IFE good with new high pix display. The film and music selective was big enough. Only 4 biz pax this flight. Touch down on time. Price was fair. Overall would choose AB biz again.

Again a very nice experience flying Air Berlin this time from Düsseldorf to Copenhagen. Easy check-in flight was on time cabin was nice flight attendant was friendly and everything seemed very relaxed. You even get a drink and a little snack for free on such a short flight. Flew them 3x before on similar routes and every time it was a very agreeable way to fly with not a single trace of a problem.

### Air Berlin customer review
In my past experiences I have found that even with a cancelled or delayed flight the airlines will typically be proactive in notifying passengers on board about other options or the status of their connecting flights. On my international flight which took off 1 hr late I received none of that. Even when going to the ticket counters to re-book my flights (after running to my gate and discovering that I had missed it) no one was on the same page. Some didn't print out new tickets they couldn't tell me where to go to get my luggage on the right track (which by the way I didn't get until almost 3 days later) and last but not least they flew me to a completely different airport in London without telling me of this change. On the way home from Europe same situation. 1 hour delayed flight (due to technical issues) causing nearly missed flight on other end. Wouldn't provide me with cart or tell me the status of my next flight and whether it would hold for us. Landed at final destination no baggage.

### Air Berlin customer review
Totally devoid of customer service. Delayed yesterday coming out of Munich by 6 hours. No communication internet was better. No counter staff. The flight was to Majorca and I had an ongoing flight. The Majorca bound young holiday makers found the time to get very drunk in the wait and were therefore removed from the plane by police. They where allowed to board and then removed from the plane without air con. Bags off and more delays. Bag lost in transit no connection. Then to cap it off the return flight was delayed by another 6 hours.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK-DUS-STR Both flights were full. Flight attendants were friendly professional and spoke English and German. Meal choices were fine but not very tasty. My main gripe with the trip was the leg room. I had more leg room on my trip from to STR then I had to DUS. The matter wasn't helped in the fact that the seat in front of me was reclined for the entire trip making it next to impossible for me to reach the carry-on I had put under the seat in front of me. The best part of the trip was the IFE. Probably the best I've experienced in the last year.

### Air Berlin customer review
WDH-TXL. Flight attendants could be friendlier. Once in Berlin transit security staff in Berlin took me too late to the gate and I stood on the bridge and watched in dismay as my LHR connecting flight departed without me and my young daughter while security staff were busy talking on the ground next to my bumped luggage. 2 hours later security staff demanded USD2000 from me to rebook my missed flights via LHR to Chicago claiming that this was because I had no airport transit visa. When I explained that there was a fax from BA about my arrival and connecting flight and the tardiness of the security staff I was rebooked without charge but no apology. Air Berlin told me that they were not British Airways although the flight showed their name and number as well yet they simply cancelled my Chicago-Des Moines confirmed reservation on American Airlines without explanation. This is extremely poor service from a OneWorld partner.

### Air Berlin customer review
The seats on our 11 hour flight to Dusseldorf were impossible for someone my size (6 ft 3 in). Legroom is so small that there was no way my feet could go under the seat in front of me. As a result my knees were bent at 90 degrees for the whole flight with pressure on my kneecaps the whole way. This was my most uncomfortable flight in my 3000000 mile flight history.

Took 8.55 am flight Berlin TXL to Frankfurt on a Monday morning. Arrived 2 hours before flight check-in area still not shown. Only shown 1.40 before departure. Get to the check-in area staff says go away. Turns out she is from Lufthansa. So we wait. 10 minutes later staff come along ignore us in the queue chatted with each other take another 10 minutes to set up. Printer not working has to ask neighbour for help. No instructions on where to go next. At 1 hour plus to departure I go to security. They say come back later. Flight itself was ok. FA ok. One drink and a roll. Bus to terminal. Luggage takes ages to arrive. Not pleased. Not recommended.

Flew non-stop LAX to Berlin TXL on May 23 return on May 30th. Our first encounters with AirBerlin began with a series of phone calls to purchase premium seating a fairly common practice with airlines these days. The person on the other end was courteous professional and efficient. Personnel at the check-in counter at LAX were all friendly and helpful. Yes the seats in economy class have poor legroom - but so do AA and British Airways. The plane was spotless the entertainment top-notch and current just remember to have your headphones with you - otherwise 5€ isn't bad for a set. We were served a beverage snack wine or a meal every time we turned around. Our plane left on time and arrived several minutes early.

### Air Berlin customer review
Miami-Berlin flight was great. Had to buy head sets for $7 I was little surprised. Staff very nice and professional food was great. Kids crying for 9 hrs but it wasn't the airline's fault. Little TVs for every passenger great selection of movies and music. I flew back to MIA with the same airline on the 28th. What a difference! No TV's head sets offered for $5 this time. Food was really bad staff not helpful. I asked for a pen stewardess replied I'm sorry and never came back other one saw a paper napkin on the floor and instead of picking I up she kicked it in the corner. I couldn't believe it was the same airline. Excellent experience on the way to Europe but not very good experience flying back.

### Air Berlin customer review
MIA-DUS-BER. First impression was new airplane and very clean. Seats ok seat pitch compact. Staff correct but not very attentive and definitively rude when confronted. IFE excellent if you have brought your headphones or pay the €5 charge. The rest of the trip uneventful except for the very tired airport facilities at DUS and TXL. Return flight was nonstop TXL-MIA. Priority access only granted after insisting twice that we were Gold Status or OneWorld Ruby; nobody seems to have been instructed on what that means. Same plane IFE staff with a little better attitude though nowhere be found once they hand out "the bottle of water". Food was above average wine as always: one glass. Luggage handling ok. Rates are ok but same as other main carriers especially those belonging to One World. AB will have to do a lot to take advantage of their recent incorporation.

Copenhagen-Berlin-Frankfurt. Booked so I could accumulate Qantas points. Qantas booked seats for me and all went smoothly. Check-in at CPH was fine priority check-in for Platinum member but staff did not know whether I could access the lounge or not - she suggested I try my luck at the lounge. Lounge at CPH was fine. A319 from Copenhagen to Berlin and 737-700 from Berlin to Frankfurt. Air Berlin cabin looks like a budget airline service was inconsistent. Copenhagen-Berlin flight staff were rude and unprofessional friendly and helpful from Berlin to Frankfurt. No lounge available in Berlin considering that is their home airport. Transit at Berlin airport is a nightmare only 50 minutes between flights. Security staff are slow and rude luggage arrived at Frankfurt airport pretty quickly. Air Berlin still have long way to go to meet the One World alliance standard.

### Air Berlin customer review
Inaugural TXL-LAX flight Economy Class. Check-in uneventful boarding delayed 30 minutes however nobody seemed to mind since there was plenty of free food and beverages. Each passenger got a little souvenir upon boarding. Flight smooth arrival on-time. New clean cabin with a good 10" touch screen IFE on demand with plenty of movies TV music and games comfortable seats. Attentive crew with plenty of water runs at some point they even handed out water bottles. However seat pitch is impossible. I am 6'3" and if I had to actually sit during the entire flight (I had the entire 4-seat row to myself due to low passenger load) I would have ended with severe pain in my legs. When the passenger in the front reclines their head practically is in your face. Food was tasty but the portions tiny. Beer and wine for sale only except one glass of wine served with the main meal. Headphones for sale only. The crew didn't really care about keeping passengers in line so nobody bothered closing the sun shades after the main meal kids were left playing in the aisles unattended. Overall a good value for the price but still far from LH AF BA or KL standards. Nevertheless a great direct connection from Berlin to LA with a lot of potential.

Our booked trip from Rome to Copenhagen via Vienna with a 55 min transfer window in Vienna. After checking in we went to the appointed gate - we were there quite early so sat waiting at the gate for 1.5 hours. Our flight to Vienna was delayed 1.5 hours but no one could give us any information or help regarding our connecting flight in Vienna. We were told to keep checking the departure list and in the end 2 hours after the original time the departure list said that the plane was now boarding. Eventually 2.5 hours after the original take off time the plane was boarded and ready. When in the air we asked staff about our connecting flight which by now we had definitely missed they were very surprised to hear that there were people onboard who had connecting flights and they knew nothing. In Vienna there was one guy to help all passengers he informed us that we would be installed in a hotel in the airport for the night and that we would get on a plane home to Copenhagen at 6.25 am. Air Berlin had a special little extra surprise for us as this flight was not direct but had a stop in Berlin! Information was close to non existent and staff very unhelpful.

### Air Berlin customer review
Berlin-Abu Dhabi-Phuket. Good things first: Flight crew very friendly very helpful making the best of the basic services Air Berlin provides. You receive a glass of wine with dinner (but they have to explain: only one!). Headphones are charged for 3 Euro. The onward boarding pass (Air Berlin flight Air Berlin plane) from Abu Dhabi to Phuket has to be picked up personally at Etihad counters in Abu Dhabi as Air Berlin cannot issue them - in Berlin! Overall - if cheaply priced ok. If expensive definitely not.

TXL-AUH-TXL. Outbound flight to Abu Dhabi very lightly booked. Average meal was served and we got small bottles of water as an extra service. Old seat layout without in-seat entertainment. Return flight was fully booked. My seat reservation had been given away despite the fact I checked in 120 minutes ahead of the flight. The aircraft was fitted with new seats. The new economy seats were disappointing the pocket is too small to even fit an iPad or a bottle of water; and the passenger behind me used the touchscreen like a woodpecker waking me up every time. Before departure the crew told passengers would have to enjoy the entertainment system without sound. The sun started rising but there was no effort to close the window blinds. As promised the crew mercilessly started serving breakfast 120 minutes before landing. Again loud announcements that woke everyone up. All in all an unpleasant experience.

### Air Berlin customer review
Flight from Abu Dhabi to Phuket return. Codeshare with Etihad. Inflight entertainment zero seats small and service very mediocre. After serving an average meal the crew disappeared. On a 6-7 hour flight one would expect them to serve at least water between the main meal and the turkey/cheese roll before landing.

TXL-ZRH-TXL weekly. Most of the time very punctual crew not always friendly but watch out if the flight is late in into TXL on Friday evenings. Only passengers with connecting flights can disembark. I do have a gold card with AB as did several of the people next to me but still we were hindered in getting out by a loud FA. So far I have always booked them as they are cheaper than LH or Swiss but I will definitely review that.

Flew Berlin-Frankfurt which was fine. On the return Tel Aviv-Berlin. Flight delayed by an hour. No hot food just a sandwich - I expected a lot more on a medium haul flight. Staff were a bit rough around the edges and wore an awful black uniform. You had to pay 3 Euros for headphones to listen to the inflight entertainment. Money was the main motivation to fly them but not the overall service. Fine for short-haul but not for medium haul. The flight itself and landing etc were fine.

DUS-MIA on A330-200. Unacceptable business class seat same as 6-8 years ago on LTU Airlines. They may call it "economy plus" but it has nothing to do with international long distance business class. IFE ok FA - only men - friendly but lack professional skills. Food below business standard just "superior economy" - same for drinks. Flight departed 40 mins late - no explanation given. Luggage delivery at MIA airport ok.

Düsseldorf to Vancouver. Our flight was delayed by 11 hours! Air Berlin did not offer passengers any compensation for the delay not even a meal coupon or a coffee. Onboard staff were also rude. They did not offer any explanation for delay when asked. The seats were relatively comfortable but the meals were below average. The overall quality is that of a typical budget airline. The worst customer service experience I have ever witnessed.

JFK-DUS. Flight boarded on time. Crew very hospitable and friendly. Served dinner an hour after take off meal tasty by airline standards although portions could have been a bit bigger. We were given a choice of a complementary cognac or ice cream for desert. Free beer and wine. Seats average or slightly below in terms of space and comfort. Breakfast was of a traditional German type - cold cuts and fruit. Flight crew bilingual some even spoke a handful of languages. IFE was the antiquated overhead CRT monitors. All in all a pleasant experience.

### Air Berlin customer review
BER-MIA nonstop service. Old A330-200 from LTU - seats do not fully recline but not a big issue for me personally. Lots of space. IFE very old small personal screen films shown nonstop not really usable. Supposedly with AB joining One World seats and IFE in both business and economy on longhaul will be replaced step by step. Very friendly service 2 flight attendants for business cabin. Very good food with three meals. Plenty of drinks. Flight on time. Crew provided lots of information during the flight and also about immigration process. Air Berlin really needs new planes and/or refurbish its longhaul planes to compete with other major carriers. If they do AB offers very good value for money.

I have always been extremely satisfied about Air Berlin services within Europe so I booked a flight to Bangkok.

We had a 5-month-old infant with us in Berlin the crew spoke little English so when we asked for 'deliver at the gate' tags for the baby's stroller they checked in the stroller as regular baggage all the way to Denver. In Miami we had a 6-hour layover and nothing to put the baby in. From Dusseldorf to Miami we didn't get a bassinet for the child as they supposedly were all booked. However when we walked around the plane it turned out that only one was in use. We ended up sitting in the last row by the restrooms where seats could not be reclined. We struggled to accommodate the baby for 10 hrs 40 mins. The crew was unpleasant when I asked for hot water to warm the baby's milk. I would not recommend Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
Staff unfriendly and impolite they were eating during our conversation at the front desk. I had a flight from London Stansted to Verona they cancelled it without informing me because I booked trough Edreams. I had been waiting for 5 hours at the airport no information displayed no apology and I had to pay the transport from Stansted to Gatwick. I tried to complain with the customer service via email but no reply at all.

### Air Berlin customer review
My wife and daughter flew Thailand to UK via Dusseldorf. The flights were ok though connection was missed in Dusseldorf due to late departure. No information given to people waiting at Stansted arrivals. Eventually my wife and daughter were put on a flight to Heathrow. The bags did not arrive with them so we had to spend the night near Heathrow and return in the morning. The bags did not arrive so we travelled home to the Isle of Wight. We incurred extra costs for the overnight stay none of which have been reimbursed after repeatedly contacting customer services. I understand these things happen concerning the original late departure but don't expect any help if things go wrong!

KEF-DUS-FCO. First time with Air Berlin. Everything went smoothly before departure from Keflavik and we arrived on time in Germany. The seats and sandwiches were ok but I didn't care for the inflight entertainment. Flight attendants were friendly. All in all good value for money.

### Air Berlin customer review
Alicante to Lisbon via Palma de Mallorca. First leg with AB second leg with FlyNiki. Both new comfortable planes. Pleasant crew. On time. Unfortunately at PdM instead of boarding the Lisbon flight my suitcase went to Frankfurt. However I was very impressed with the speed with which it was discovered and dispatched on the first available Lufthansa flight to Lisbon and was in my hotel before 9am the next morning. Got a numbered seat and a snack all for the same price as low cost companies like Ryanair and Easyjet.

### Air Berlin customer review
MIA-DUS Business Class. Boarding quick and on time arrival in Dusseldorf on time. Business class is not comparable to others as the seats don't fully recline. This was more than compensated by very comfortable seats and a seat distance which is quite generous - you can easily step over neighbours seat. Crew was friendly and attentive. In view of the price business class is value for money if you don't need full recline on your seat but favour more space and friendly service.

### Air Berlin customer review
YVR-DUS A330 DUS-STN - Q400 DUS-NYC A330 flights all enjoyable. Service friendly and included nice extra touches - candies as you board chocolates as we got off one flight overnight pack on long haul. Two hot meals on YVR-DUS-NYC tasty by airline standards. Seat width and pitch as you would expect. The inflight entertainment was shown on overhead screens rather than PTV on demand. I'll take low fares and great service with limited entertainment.

### Air Berlin customer review
MUC-HAM A320. Passengers greeted with staff busy chatting amongst themselves. Announcements by pilot in English and German. Seats beside me were dirty. Served salty or sweet snack with choice of cold drinks juice and coffee. Flight landed on time.

### Air Berlin customer review
HAM-MUC B737-700. Acceptable leg room for tall person. Announcement by pilot in English and German. Flight was about 45% full. Passengers served bread roll coffee and juice. Toilets were dirty. Since we did not get landing on Munich airport we were flying around for about 45 minutes. All in all a pleasant experience.

### Air Berlin customer review
London Stansted to FMO Munster. Fast check-in and easy boarding. Full plane but even on a short flight crew managed to give everyone a snack and a drink. Seats ok for a short flight and English papers provided. Munster airport large but very little traffic luggage unloaded quickly. Perfectly acceptable flight but not cheap.

### Air Berlin customer review
Business class Vancouver to Dusseldorf. AB uses the Priority Pass lounge at YVR which was fine. No current newspapers due to a delivery problem but when asked about this the concierge immediately went and purchased a copy. Business Class was only half full at the end of AB's summer schedule. Food was fantastic - a choice of four entrees plus a fifth 'special' dish available. Seats in Business are old type non-flat bed with limited video choices however they were comfortable. On time arrival in Dusseldorf which is an easy airport to navigate. A great bargain and a great flight.

### Air Berlin customer review
Dusseldorf to Vancouver in Business class. The AB lounge is about 10 yrs out of date only one English language newspaper limited seating no wifi. On time departure with Business Class cabin only 40 % full. Onboard only one English magazine. Four meal choices and good service (2 attendants having little to do with only 10 passengers).

### Air Berlin customer review
Crowded flight from Dusseldorf to Nice. Departure delayed for 1 hr due to incoming flight being delayed. No announcements made - one had to inquire at the desk of disinterested staff. No English language papers available and AB's inflight magazine had little English content. Snacks consisted of cookies or a fat filled salted dry sausage roll in a hard bun packed in a tube. Arrival at Nice late made worse by a 40 mins wait for bags and again with no explanation. Good value for money but service appalling.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-CGN-TXL. Booking and check-in online was easy. A new and clean A320 to Cologne. Nice staff and good snack. Arrival earlier than scheduled helpful for me because of train connection. In the evening back to Berlin with 15 minutes delay due to problems before boarding. Plane was an older B737 but fine. Staff helpful and snack tasty. All in all good value for money. Professional and friendly attitude gave me two relaxed hops which I enjoyed.

### Air Berlin customer review
Berlin – Miami. Our flight was diverted to Ft. Myers instead of Miami due to weather. Problem was in Ft. Myers the airline kept us on the tarmac for 3 hrs giving us various stories. After we de-boarded a representative from the airline said they would refund the cost of the rental car for those who didn't want to wait for busses to Miami. After 2 months of exchanging emails they declined to refund the money.

### Air Berlin customer review
Berlin to Cologne. We left 90 mins late so arrived 90 mins late. But what made me angry most was the missing empathy of the unfriendly crew for the passengers who had to wait 1.5 hrs in the dry-air cabin without any offers of water to drink.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-LAX outbound SFO-DUS inbound both on a A330 with significant differences. Traveling as a family with two teenagers we reserved our seats 6 months before and got them without problem on both legs rows 38/39. Outbound flight with good seats and crew. Good food constant service with soft drinks complimentary wine made the 11 hrs nearly a pleasure even in Economy Class. Unusable IFE with small screens high above slight delay of 30 min. Inbound older plane with bad seats cushions worn out. Crew professional and friendly service ok with decent meals and good supply of soft drinks and wine. Overhead screens even worse bring your own entertainment.

### Air Berlin customer review
Delayed Vancouver to Dusseldorf 13 hrs with no compensation. Had confirmed seats by paying extra for Top Bonus but seat selection was not honoured. Re-routed with a 9 hr delay. No toilet tissue in the washroom after the first 3 hrs. Replaced slowly and continued to be a problem throughout the flight. Sat in row 28. Had to ask for beverage service which seemed to be a hassle for flight attendants.

### Air Berlin customer review
BKK-DUS return in Business Class. The airline is extremely tough on luggage allowance. Check-in staff not friendly either end and boarding in both cities was chaotic. BKK boarding was late no proper announcements from unfriendly staff chaos in Dusseldorf as boarding was through one door for all pax and cabins no pre boarding for children special needs or premium pax. Cabin crew on both legs were smiling and cheerful for the whole flight. 2 crew serving 24 Business passengers leads to somewhat slow service however it's personal and friendly. Seats average only reclining and not lie flat seats. IFE poor with looping programs and AVOD. One suitcase lost on return but returned within 48 hrs. Just a shame the onboard experience is let down by ground services.

### Air Berlin customer review
Frankfurt to Munich via Berlin. Onboard service for such a short flight was slick and efficient with a snack and drink. Very short transfer time in Berlin meant my baggage did not arrive in Munich. Air Berlin didn't let me down - baggage arrived the following day to my rural alpine chalet.

### Air Berlin customer review
CPH-TXL return. Boarding was a mess with everyone rushing onboard. CPH-TXL slept through the flight. TXL-CPH flight I wanted to have a second drink and I stopped and asked the stewardess for a cup of water and was told to wait. She walked pass again without stopping back to the gallery. I pressed the call button and when the same stewardess came she refused to serve me as we were landing soon.

### Air Berlin customer review
PMI-OVD. Took off on time nice beverage onboard hot and cold drinks free. Cabin crew can not speak a word of Spanish only English and German. I have flown many years with AB and the service is excellent.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-BKK return. Nice FA's on both flights. Leg Room could be bigger but was ok. Meals where hot and of good taste. No Delay. Luggage was there on time and without any damages.

### Air Berlin customer review
SFO to Dusseldorf a 10hr nightmare. No leg room overcrowded plane rude staff no choice of entertainment seats very hard with little cushion. Not significantly cheaper than the major airlines when you consider a sore back is assured after arrival.

### Air Berlin customer review
MUC-HAM return. Both flights on time smiling cabin crew sufficient leg room. Onboard service a snack and all kinds of drinks. My preferred airline for domestic trips in Germany as they deliver a reliable service.

### Air Berlin customer review
Dusseldorf to Vancouver and used Air Berlin because they have a non stop flight. Never have I been on an airline that has such abusive people and a system generated to swindle money out of passengers because of bags. They were rude and knew that when you get to the counter you have no choice but to accept any tactics they use to get money out of you for bags. They will try to charge you 150 Euros for the hand pieces you are carrying which are not overweight and in regulation size. There were at least 15 to 20 passengers who were experiencing the same thing. It was not just one employee who was doing this the passengers realized and were talking about it that employees of AirBerlin had an organized system of telephoning each other to pinpoint passengers that they could charge more from the check in counter to the cashier to the gate check in. Three people on the counter at the gate who were picked out for extra charges for hand pieces were yelling at them for not providing a receipt.

### Air Berlin customer review
Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Very nice crew and friendly. We got a salami or cheese sandwich and 1 or 2 drinks. Very clean and modern airplane. Shared IFE screens throughout the cabin. Airbus A320. Arrived at Dusseldorf a few minutes ahead of schedule.

### Air Berlin customer review
SFO-Dusseldorf-Barcelona. Service better than expected from a low cost carrier. Free international newspapers and magazines upon entering the aircraft. Hot meals with complimentary wine. Constant complimentary drink service throughout the flight. IFE was shared screen with headphones priced at 5 Euros. However a 10 hr flight on an A330 is the maximum one could take before the restrooms and cabin start to become uncomfortable and dirty. Connection at Dusseldorf was a bit confusing due to the on-going construction and limited passenger seating areas. Dusseldorf airport is a duty free shopping centre with passenger amenities as an afterthought. Dusseldorf to Barcelona on A320 was great. Again complimentary drinks and sandwiches. IFE was shared screen.

### Air Berlin customer review
STR-HAM one way. Very pleasant flight no lines at check-in on time nice cabin crew one round of drinks with choice of cookies or crackers 737-700 clean and well prepared. Pitch between seats could be one or two inches more. Cheap fare since we booked 4 months in advance. Overall: very good!

### Air Berlin customer review
Passenger cabin was ok legroom was enough for a small person. Cabin crew especially female FA's were not friendly and seemed irritated and annoyed. Service was not worth the price.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH-TXL-CPH in Economy Class. All flights on time cabin service good (free drinks) and FA's had a positive attitude. Legroom could be better. I'm impressed they actually managed to get my transfer luggage to my destination given the connection time in TXL was only 25 mins.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-MUC-MBA and return on A330 in their Business product. Excellent value for money and good service. Friendly flight attendants with a good sense of humour in Business both a bit older and probably because of that very professional. Seats good for C-Class on a holiday carrier. Great choice of meals and excellent quality.

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin changed our return flight for our honeymoon a few weeks beforehand so that we would miss our connection in Dusseldorf. Their only attempt to reconcile was to refund the ticket in full or give us 80 Euro off a hotel in Dusseldorf so we could catch a connection the next day. The former would cancel our honeymoon in its entirety and the latter would not cover the cost of a hotel at such last minute notice. There was absolutely no consideration or concern on their part. They seemed totally indifferent to the entire issue.

### Air Berlin customer review
I use AB several times throughout the summer between FRA and Spain. No matter what the flight is always jammed packed with screaming babies and out of control children. Best tip is to avoid any seat toward the front where they tend to sit. It can be unbearable and airlines need to address this problem soon. Cabin crew are usually good and cabin service is fine.

### Air Berlin customer review
FRA-TXL-BKK in C. Very friendly staff. Good Menus. Super service from BKK-Pattaya free Limousine service. Sure we fly again with Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
JFK-TXL-VIE Round Trip. The Transatlantic portion of the flight was much worse than the Intra-Europe portion. The planes used for transatlantic are older and very uncomfortable compared to Intra-Europe planes which were new and had more legroom! On the way to Europe our flight departed late and our bags did not make the connection to VIE. Ok so this happens from time to time we'll probably have our bags the next day. Nope airline was not forthcoming with any info at all. I had to call to get any status. Next day found out that 2 of 3 bags had arrived but could not get them to deliver those until 3rd was located. Then we find out my 3rd bag had a lovely time visiting friends in Venice (VCE). After 2 1/2 days and 20 calls later our luggage finally arrived.

### Air Berlin customer review
Berlin-Miami. What a nightmare. The plane was about 3 hrs 40 mins late with no apology no information. I was in Business class. The crew was the rudest incompetent I have experienced in my 35 yrs of flying. We arrived in Miami priority bags came off last for the last insult!

### Air Berlin customer review
Faro-PMI-ZRH. Online check-in went very well and was happy being able to skip the queues at the airport as was travelling with hand luggage only. Faro-PMI was flown by an A321 by Niki. Seat pitch tight. FA's are dressed casually so is the service as well. One gets free soft drinks and a sandwich. Inflight Entertainment on this hop was Audio although they can show films as well. Service not bad but not great either. Flight PMI-ZRH was delayed as well due to some passengers arriving late who obviously didn't come from a connecting flight. Their luggage should be simply offloaded. Crew rather distant and seemed unorganised. But not unfriendly. Sandwich and drinks again but Zanzibar meals could be ordered. Value for money. Take you from A to B. Better than low cost but not better than other full service carriers.

### Air Berlin customer review
Air Berlin from Dortmund to Barcelona via Palma. Plane was late arriving in Dortmund and more delayed leaving for Palma. Our AB connection did not wait in Palma so we were re booked onto another flight. Crew unfriendly and did not care that many passengers missed their flights. Our flights from check-in in Dortmund to Barcelona took 9 hrs 45 mins. Air Berlin used to be very good now they are people carriers who simply do not care.

### Air Berlin customer review
FRA-PMI-FRA Very friendly crew and spotless cabin. Pre-ordered meals good value for money. Check-In swift and friendly. Much better than competitors on same route.

### Air Berlin customer review
Helsinki-Berlin-Helsinki. Bought tickets quite early so got these quite good price. Flights were packed since it was Eastern holiday. No check-in queues in Helsinki or Berlin. Flights were on time so nothing to complain. Free sandwich and soft drinks were offered that is big plus.

### Air Berlin customer review
CPH-DUS one way. A very bad experience. Check in was a mess ticket incredibly expensive for what they offer. Excess baggage 10 euro per kilo. On board you have to pay for everything and very expensive. Plane was old and not very clean. Legroom was a nightmare and seats uncomfortable. And the most important: crew very rude and not smiling.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH-TXL-OSL trip on Air Berlin. Arrived to Zurich on AA. Due to the volcanic ash cloud my morning flight to Berlin got cancelled. No one showed up by the gate to explain what was happening so all passengers had to run back to the check in counter only to be redirected to the Air Berlin service desk. After waiting in line for about 30 minutes was told that I can be re-booked either to a 7pm flight this same day or following morning although they could not assure me that the flight would actually depart. No accommodation food voucher refund of the unused portion of the ticket or getting me on one of SAS flights directly to Oslo or Copenhagen were offered because in words of the airline rep "It's not our fault. I ended up buying a train ticket to a friend in Germany renting a car and driving to Oslo myself.

### Air Berlin customer review
BER-MUC. Extremely pleased with the airline and above expectation. There was no food but a hard tasteless piece of bread was given to those who wanted to risk it. Seats comfortable and though the flight was packed it felt spacious.

### Air Berlin customer review
Salzburg to Berlin and Berlin to Dusseldorf and extremely impressed. I paid very cheap rates for European flights (only about 90 euros per person) but got very good treatment - from newspapers and magazines to a nice snack and drinks. Seats comfortable. I couldn't get over the fact that this was supposed to be a low cost airline.

### Air Berlin customer review
Business Class DUS-BKK. No separate boarding line. A330 business seats ageing do not recline more than 150° but comfort was better than feared. IFE not AVOD and only small screen. Food was ambitious and tasty. Wine list was short but okay (no Champagne). Value for money was okay on the edge to slightly overpriced. Due to the outdated cabin frequent travellers may find better options in other airlines.

### Air Berlin customer review
HAM-FRA-HAM. Best price on this route also good service including drinks and snacks. Ground service was okay flight was on time.

### Air Berlin customer review
Will go back to LH for my next domestic flights in Germany. Very uncomfortable seating on old looking B737 HAM-MUC. Flight full and was very annoyed when gate agent decided my carry-on suitcase was too big to go onboard but had to be gate checked. Bag is/was well within size limitations but I was being penalised for boarding as one of the last passengers as previous passengers were allowed to carry 2 bags on board. Was very inconvenient to carry laptop travel documents and other valuables as lose items while carry-on was gate checked. Should have done what majority of late boarding passengers did and simply ignore the tag and take the bag/suitcase on board.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH to DUS and back on a day-trip. Flying Air Berlin is a bit like taking the regular bus- service. Nothing is outstanding or done in a personal way. Staff doing their job without any kind of special attention. Cabin usually clean and flights on time. However you get what you pay for and this is okay for the flights in Europe below 2 hours. Air Berlin has developed a product that is by far better than many low cost carriers but does not match the legacy carriers.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-MIA-TXL. Staff though not as professional as Lufthansa were polite and present - drinks given out regularly restrooms checked. Seat comfort great we paid for bulkhead XL Seats (highly recommended). Food was good. IFE was dated (wall/ceilling mounted monitors) the movie choice was entertaining. Amenity kits distributed so no reason for complaint whatsoever. Looking forward to the makeover of their A330-200s with new seats and IFE.

### Air Berlin customer review
HAM-VIE-HAM. The staff at check in friendly and gave desired seat. Flight boarding started in time announcements in German and English. Food satisfactory for a low cost airline. The flight back was also satisfactory with 3 rows empty from behind so had much space.

### Air Berlin customer review
Cologne to Hamburg Lufthansa flight was cancelled and I was rebooked on Air Berlin. Everything was okay flight on time on a new 737. TV screens show flight routing and got coffee juice and a warm roll for breakfast on a 35 minutes flight. Bags arrived on belt in normal time.

### Air Berlin customer review
Business class Berlin - Bangkok. I am surprised about the airport which really needs a re-vamp but I am sure that will happen. After check we were given vouchers to go to the BA lounge in the connecting arrivals terminal which was nice. Business class passengers boarded the bus 1st and then called all the other passengers onto the same bus - so we got off last. Large and comfortable seats flight attendants came around with welcome drinks. The only problem was the inflight entertainment - not much choice and a lot of interference. Apart from that very impressed and would choose this airline again. Also the price we paid was excellent!

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-PUJ-DUS. The on time schedule was ok but I have never experienced such an unfriendly and unprofessional cabin crew with really poor language skills! Aas I was about to change the position of overhead luggage to get the lighter one in the less strong compartment I was told to remove it immediately. Even after explanation the answer was she would not care as this compartment was not for me. When requesting a new blanket as the one on our seats were obviously already used the same person told us that this was not her job the cleaners should have fixed this but if we want new ones we should get up and look for it ourselves.

### Air Berlin customer review
Dusseldorf-Bangkok return. Check in at Dusseldorf airport took a long time. Staff is unfriendly and not much service or help at check in. One customer before me had a problem with small overweight handbag. Staff just shouted at him. No window seats available although later in the airplane there were empty seats occupied by staff. Food poor. On my return from Chiang Mai transit was poorly coordinated by Air Berlin. Only by help through Thai Airways was I able to find transit point and catch my flight in time. Air Berlin also forget at first to file my correct passport number - had to return at check in. Flight back horrible - no window seats just small seat in the middle. Not enough space for legs. Seat in front of me failed to work so less space. Staff seemed not to care about this problem. Flight arrived on schedule very slow unloading of the bags. For a budget airline it is pretty expensive. The attitude is arrogant.

### Air Berlin customer review
Return flight to Bangkok. Business Class was something between Premium Economy and real Business Class. Service was fine food okay seats fine though not angled flat.

### Air Berlin customer review
MUC-POP-MUC in Business Class. Dedicated check-in at Munich. Shared Lounge in Munich was hard to find no food service and a weird collection of magazines. POP-MUC via VRA: Check-in a bit more crowded and less efficient - lounge in POP hard to find due to construction works. Shared Lounge at POP serves non-edible sandwiches and a very limited variety of drinks no magazines or newspapers but free wifi. No Lounge access for transit pax in VRA. Onboard welcome drink service with prosecco and orange juice - prosecco was barely drinkable. Food and Beverages edible and tasty. Cabin crew deliver attentive and friendly service however not very consistent. Seats outdated. Mechanical adjustments only 150 degree recline and oldish IFE. Seat pitch and width were decent. Washroom clean. Amenity kit provided on both legs with usable contents. Kit different on return flight (might have been an economy kit) and seems to have been in storage for an extended time. Good product for the price - saves around EUR 1000 and at least 5 hours vs UA + Jetblue or AA via MIA even though the return trip is somewhat lengthy due to a stop in VRA or MBJ.

### Air Berlin customer review
Stockholm - Berlin - Miami - Atlanta. Weather delays in Atlanta caused me to be stranded in Miami for 4 days. Knowing the forecast I asked representatives in Stockholm and Berlin if I would make it to my final destination. All representatives refused to look up flight or airport information causing me to be stranded in Miami instead of getting on a later flight out of Stockholm. Furthermore the flight in Berlin was delayed 3.5 hours. Completely unpleasant flight experience. I will not fly with Air Berlin again. Flight was satisfactory.

### Air Berlin customer review
Bangkok to Vienna ticket for BKK-MUC-VIE was by far the cheapest possible on this route. When we arrived at the airport our flight was delayed by 14 hours but they rebooked us to BKK- TXL-VIE. Departure from BKK one hour late flight above average. A330 not new and seats had terrible seat pitch but it was clean and service was excellent. They even managed to organize a vegetarian meal for my girlfriend (as our meal request was for the original flight via MUC). Plenty of free drinks and snacks. Transfer in TXL bit chaotic had to run to our connecting flight. Boeing 737 had much bigger seat pitch and was newer. Again quite a lot of drinks and snacks for such a short flight. Downside was the lost luggage (forgotten in TXL delivered 7 days later) and no possibility at all to contact Air Berlin to find anything about it.

### Air Berlin customer review
If you regard Air Berlin as a low cost carrier this is the best you could experience in this segment - planes are clean and pretty new. You get good attention onboard and a snack plus a soda or juice for free. On the ground however the experience is different. They are really overdoing it with baggage weight I find it a sure way to turn a loyal customer - holding the Frequent Flier Card - off by making a big fuss (happened twice) when the baggage weighs 215 kg instead of 20 kg. Terminal at Berlin Tegel Airport lacks seating which becomes pretty inconvenient if a lot of delays occur at the same time. If the price difference is not more than 10-15% to a regular carrier like LH or CX I would probably pay that and choose them instead of Air Berlin.

### Air Berlin customer review
Frankfurt-Hamburg. Very good for price. Well organised and with tidy plane. Upper end of quality for the budget market.

### Air Berlin customer review
STN-SZG and MUC-HAJ-STN. Excellent for economy tickets and better than competitors. When the first leg of our return flight was delayed (which would mean we would have missed our connection) we were booked onto a BA direct flight to Heathrow without even having to ask. Will use again in preference to RyanAir EasyJet etc

### Air Berlin customer review
Zurich to Berlin. Online check-in easy to navigate. Queued for 10 minutes at the bag drop; ground staff were pleasant. Flight departed within 15 minutes of allocated time. Complimentary newspapers in German and complimentary beverages and snack. The plane was clean and the staff were pretty good. Overall a good flight and excellent value compared with Swiss.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH-DUS-ZRH. Both flights left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. A320 and A319 well maintained crew professional with limited language skills. Despite cabin not too clean on outbound no issues on flight back. Some free drinks and snacks served. With an unbeatable price and a good schedule is definitely well worth flying short hauls in Europe.

### Air Berlin customer review
STN-HAJ-STN. Their staff are extremely nice decent leg room plane is clean and they are fairly punctual. Last time I flew with them the free food and drink was a snack and drink rather than a sandwich. If flying short haul I would be more than happy to use Air Berlin again.

### Air Berlin customer review
FKB-HAM-FKB. We didn't expect a lot as our benchmark were the Australian low cost carriers. We were overwhelmed with what we got. On the 1hr flight we had one round of non alcoholic drinks and a snack. At the departure gates each way we could stock up on complimentary newspapers and magazines. There was enough leg room for tall people on FKB-HAM and doable for an hour space on the return. No seat back TV's but cabin mainscreen TV's with flight routing and TV series. The ground staff on either airport were efficient.

### Air Berlin customer review
CPH-TXL-DUS-ZRH. New and clean aircraft. Snacks served crew were friendly even though we only spoke English. Fares were very cheap when compared to the competition. Only German magazines/newspapers available. Would fly them again if I'm in Europe.

### Air Berlin customer review
TXL-KRK and then KRK-DUS. I was impressed with this airline - a good web site for discovering their service and making purchases very reasonable pricing meaning that one can piece together a complex itinerary without requiring round-trips to get the best prices. On-time performance for each of the 3 legs I flew baggage appearing promptly after the flights. Onboard experience very similar on the TXL-KRK and KRK-DUS flights - the former was a 737-400 and the latter an A319. Not luxurious but newish interiors and good service.

### Air Berlin customer review
Dubrovnik - Munich. A320 was full and while it was a short flight of just over an hour it seemed a lot longer as every second passenger seemed to be a screaming child. Maybe have flights where no passengers are under 5 years of age? Let's see which airline is brave enough to introduce such a restriction. After this performance I think next time I will pay a higher fare on the full fare airlines.

### Air Berlin customer review
Santorini to NUE. Check-in in Santorini took nearly two hours due to computer failures but we landed on time. New A320 FAs abrupt but OK and one of the meals I ordered on the site showed up. IFE was overhead. Pilot liked to point out the sights. All-in-all they deliver on short- haul flights but there's no glamour here.

### Air Berlin customer review
The aircraft itself was clean seats however not very well padded. I'm not a very tall person but in order to sleep I had to lean forward on the tray table; I ended up being repeatedly suffocated by the person in front of me every time she reclined her seat. The entertainment system is okay and they dim the screens during the night to help you sleep. The food was good but it seems you only get the choice of Chicken or Pasta.

### Air Berlin customer review
Dusseldorf-Miami. I was faced in July with few available seats and high fares using American Airlines and other airlines. However travelling Gatwick to Dusseldork and including an overnight stay my trip to Miami with Air Berlin saved me a fortune and I was very impressed with the Air Berlin service. Two reasonable meals as good as other transatlantic economy offerings with free complimentary wine and liqueuers which is something unheard of with AA. IFE via a shared screen but not a problem. The cabin crew were great. Security checks at Dusseldorf quick. All in all a very pleasant trip and with the bonus of an arrival at Miami 35 minutes early.

### Air Berlin customer review
DUS-LAX-DUS. Check-in ok. Seat pitch much narrower than on other airlines little to no leg room. Food is average but had to pay for everything even non-alcoholic drinks. No IFE on outbound flight - limited IFE with shared monitor on return flight. Staff rather arrogant and unfriendly. Cabin and wash rooms dirty on departure on outbound flight. It seems Air Berlin offers two very different products under the same brand - I'm happy with the product for the European market but long-haul is not recommendable and not even cheap!

### Air Berlin customer review
Zürich-Düsseldorf-Reykjavik. Excellent airline friendly staff reasonable food. Good aircraft. Return trip on SAS via Oslo was less enjoyable.

### Air Berlin customer review
Berlin TXL to Vienna. Check In efficient. I had 21 Kilos but I did not have to pay extra fees. B737-700 seat pitch is very tight but this was only a 1 hour flight. Nice selection of magazines and newspapers. There was bretzel free and coffee/tea/ juice at no extra cost. Air Berlin clearly offers an outstanding product on short haul flight. The problem starts with its long haul destinations - the seat pitch is a big problem. I would use Air Berlin on short haul flights but on long distance flights would look for Asian or Pacific carrier if available.

### Air Berlin customer review
ZRH-TXL-ZRH. Flight was € 199 incl and much cheaper than Swiss. Online Check-in efficient and was at the gate quite quickly. Air Berlin use the B gates at ZRH which are easy to get to but once you are there you cannot do much as there are only 2-3 shops. Boarding is also by bus which is rather inconvenient. TXL is probably the cutest airport I have seen. It is so tiny and efficient for an airport. The distance between the gate and exit is probably not more than 30m. Flight to TXL was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and flight back to ZRH was delayed due to ATC regulations. Inflight service is rather simple with free drinks and a choice of crackers or a chocolate bar. Service to TXL was friendly and efficient but the return flight had a very arrogant male FA on board which spoilt the experience. Air Berlin is not a bad airline in general and they can be compared with other carriers in Europe.

### Air Berlin customer review
ORY-DUS DH8-400. Comfortable leather seats with generous legroom. Cabin interior clean. Web check-in does not work at ORY - however check-in at the airport hassle-free. Free snack on this 1-hour-flight. Hot/soft drinks and choice between bretzel and muesli. Stewardesses polite but not overly friendly. On the downside not a single word from the cockpit!
