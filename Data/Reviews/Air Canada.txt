### “this level of service is unacceptable”
I flew with Air Canada from Tokyo to Argentina with stopovers in Vancouver, Toronto, and São Paulo. Not only did my checked luggage arrive four days late, but it was also tampered with. The communication throughout the process was vague and unreliable. I received inconsistent updates, and when I tried to follow up, emails went unanswered. The local baggage service stopped responding entirely and never provided a proper contact number. For an airline with such a prestigious reputation, this level of service is unacceptable. I am extremely disappointed and expect appropriate compensation for the delay, damage, and loss. I trusted Air Canada with my belongings — and that trust was broken.

### "exemplary service, great food"
International Signature Business Class with exemplary service, great food and beverage offerings and a very comfortable seat/bedding. Love the Aqua Di Parma business class amenity kit. The use pre-flight of Air Canada's Signature Suite Lounge in YYZ Terminal 1 was by far one of the best airline lounges ever experienced serving top notch champagne and a la carte dining served to table. Air Canada is the best airline in North America.

### "vague apologies and meal vouchers"
I was scheduled to fly with Air Canada to Japan on February 27th, and while I had high expectations, the experience ended up being a frustrating and costly disaster due to poor airline policy and lack of accountability, not the people on the ground. Our flight was delayed multiple times before we were told to deboard due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft door. From there, we were left in limbo for over four hours, sent between different parts of the airport just trying to get information. Eventually, we were rebooked for a flight the next morning — but were offered no hotel accommodation, no real compensation, and very little guidance, just some meal vouchers. And those vouchers? Only worked in a couple restaurants and were rejected in most. Air Canada staff were professional, friendly, and clearly doing their best in a difficult situation. This review is not about them. It’s about a system that leaves passengers unsupported. When I contacted Air Canada afterward, I was told that since the cancellation was "safety-related," no compensation would be offered. When Air Canada works, it’s great — comfortable seating, good meals, solid pricing, and in-flight entertainment. But when things go wrong, their policy offers passengers nothing but vague apologies and meal vouchers that barely function. Until Air Canada adopts policies that actually protect and value its customers, I will be flying with someone else — and I suggest others do the same.

### "Charging for internet access"
We have flown with Air Canada for the first time for this trip. Probably the last as well. Overall inconsistent service level in-flight, on our outbound flight my experience was very positive, however my wife was not of the same opinion as she was on the other side of the isle and was attended to by a different flight attendant. On our way back service was not bad but not great either. Charging for internet access on business class is outrageous in my opinion. On a positive In-flight selection was great, food was acceptable, drink selection was rather limited and seemed to be from a bottom shelf selection. Both inbound and outbound - online check-in did not work - so that is an additional hour of buffer time for us, on our outbound this was perfectly ok as there was a lounge. Inbound flight - no lounge access at Cancun airport. Seats were comfortable on the shorter leg which flew 777-300ER, Airbus seats were tight and uncomfortable. The real issue was when we arrived at Frankfurt. Flight landed at 10:55 -> Baggage arrival at 12:55. Attendants showed up at 12:30ish with no additional information - other than saying "please bear with us" - which was infuriating. I asked to file a missing bag and leave the airport - they indicated we had to wait until they got confirmation of bags not being delivered - 2h is more than enough confirmation on my end. Icing on the cake was when I filed a complaint through their website - their response was "Air Canada contracts this service and does not have control". Not taking ownership of the whole process is not acceptable for a no-mistake allowed industry as flying is unacceptable.

### "sat in an empty window seat"
I purchased seat 30D (aisle seat). On this flight, the plane was half full so after the door closed, I slid over the 2 empty seats in my row, from 30D to 30F (a window seat), in order to watch the take off. The flight attendant told me that people pay for this seat and that I should sit in my seat. I was not moving to a different class cabin and a different row. I just sat in an empty window seat same row as my seat just to watch the takeoff and then I moved back to my seat. For a 5 hours flight, there was just a biscotti cookie.

### "disappointing service experience"
Air Canada provided the most frustrating and disappointing service experience. The level of entitlement, lack of empathy, and overall apathy displayed by their staff is deeply concerning and completely unacceptable from a company of its stature. It’s painfully clear that the comfort of operating within a near-monopoly has allowed a culture of disregard to flourish — one where customer care feels like an afterthought, if acknowledged at all. The fact that many Canadians are left with no viable alternatives is not a justification for substandard treatment — it’s an indictment of the system that enables it. I regret that I am forced to rely on their services due to limited options, and I sincerely hope that some level of accountability is introduced — not just in word, but in practice.

### "I got value for money spent."
First flight vas delayed due to crew issues. The delay was well communicated. A second delay occurred on the initial flight that resulted in the connections to my final destination in Australia being missed. Air Canada advised me quickly of the changes in my itinerary. Downside was a 9 hour layover in Sydney. As far as the actual flight segments were concerned, the staff were all professional and polite, cabin service well done and requests quickly responded to. Seats were satisfactory as was the entertainment, food and beverage service. The Texting while flying was fast, the baggage following notices were great - nice to know that your bags are on the plane at each leg. Makes the wait at the pickup carousel less stressful! Lounge access was included, it was unfortunate with the quick connection in Vancouver due to delay departing Toronto that we did not have more time in the Maple Leaf Signature Lounge in Vancouver, another time to better enjoy that. Overall I have to say I got value for money spent.

### "not offer vouchers or reimbursement"
Air Canada kicked me off my flight while my bags stayed on board. Their reason ‘You were late.’ Their ‘ compensation was a $150 coupon for a 6-hour drive, cracked suitcases, and a ruined event. I ended up driving my own car to New York City from Montreal. I asked to be compensated for the gas, food, parking etc. After multiple attempts to get a compensation, they sent me: "Air Canada does not offer vouchers or reimbursement for accommodations, meals, or other expenses incurred at a passenger's destination.

### “Horrible inhumane service”
Not Verified | Air Canada held us (myself and 5 kids) for 4 days without compensation for hotel, food etc… Kept pushing our rebooking further and further for our flight back to Toronto from Regina. Instead of Monday we flew out Thursday (with Westjet). Air Canada is yet to rebook us “standby - we working on you rebooking” message - all we got so far. Which means we would have been stuck for at least two more days if we hadn’t approached an Air Canada guy and if he wasn’t as nice and as understanding as he was and rebooked 14 people to Westjet right away. Horrible inhumane service treating people like numbers.

### "will never fly with them again"
This is one of the worst airlines. They have zero customer service. They charge full ticket prices for children but don’t provide food or milk for babies. I have previously flown with Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad, where they provide everything you need with a smile. In the past 10 years, this is my second time flying with Air Canada, and I will never fly with them again. They also delay flights without a valid reason and only provide a $10 voucher for food if the delay exceeds five hours.

### "cancelled the flight with no reason"
The flight was canceled. It's not all right, but it happens. 3:26 PM I got an email from Air Canada informing about the cancellation and a promise to update the information in 30 minutes. Now is 10:30 PM, no information, no answer from customer service (almost 4 hours of waiting). It was a flight accident and the airport did not work for 2 hours, but most of the flights were not cancelled just delayed. Air Canada cancelled the flight with no reason

### "can't dictate to me how much I drink"
On December 31st 2024 I had the displeasure of flying business class on Air Canada flight AC65. The flight started off well enough with a preflight glass of champagne and when asked by a flight attendant if I want another I said yes. An hour into the flight I asked the Galley director for another glass and he said to wait until the meal service, which I just said ok. 20 minutes later when the meal service came around, I mentioned to him can I have two glasses instead since I had to wait. He said you can have one and I am cutting you off I can smell the alcohol on your breath. I was extremely shocked and appalled by what he said. Up until this time, I only had those two small glasses of champagne, I did not said anything to him or to anyone and was perfectly well behaved in my seat minding my own business. I said you can't dictate to me how much I drink (especially when I only had 2 glasses of champagne), is this your first time working business class, what is your name, after which he told me his name then proudly with a great sense of impunity said I am the galley director and "you can go file your report all you want it doesn't matter to me I am unionized! He then walked away. A few minutes later he came back with my dinner, which was burnt and inedible. To add insult to injury, he told me that he had informed the captain of my unruly disruptive behavior. I still cannot comprehend what would cause a flight attendant to treat a customer in this fashion. Perhaps it is a matter of mistaken identity but regardless, the behavior is unprofessional and inexcusable. As for the rest of the flight, AC's reverse herringbone seats are ok but quite narrow especially with the foot rest. If you are a side sleeper, the narrow footrest will be disturbing. The meals were average at best with very little flavor. The on demand snack of chicken pot pie was the best part of the food selection. AC recently downgraded their Acqua de gio amenity kit from leather/pleather to a fabric bag. The moisturizer was quite nice. The wifi was quite slow.

### "liable to pay compensation"
This trip included one stopover and two legs. The first flight was from Brussels. The pilot announced that they were delaying the flight to allow for transferring passengers to make our flight. That decision meant that we lost our spot in the de-icing process (at the gate) and then lost our take off spot. We were two hours late departing. We arrived in Montreal, and the ground personnel provided boarding passes to passengers who would not make their connections. I was told that mine would be okay, and others were making the same connection. We cleared customs and made it to the gate 10 minutes before the gate was to close. Management had decided to send the flight early. They closed the gate 12 minutes before the published time on our boarding cards. This meant delays, rerouting through Toronto and more delays before arriving at my final destination. I was 10 hours late in arriving. Only once was I apologized to by a staff member. The rest of them blamed someone else. The actual flights themselves were reasonable, comfortable and safe. But management's decisions both in Brussels and Montreal and then in Customer Service, were horrendous and they refused to take responsibility for them. The airline is liable to pay compensation. When contacted, they said that it was due to the weather. When I presented the trip facts, they never responded to those facts. I was not the only passenger to miss that flight due to management's decision to close the gate and send the flight early.

### "no help or options given"
Delayed hours, boarded the plane and then waited in the plane for a separate fault then everyone taken off the plane and told 2 hours longer delay. At the end of the 2 hours another hour delay then cancelled. No information or communication throughout the day and no help or options given that we had checked luggage. Other flights delayed and no flight to same destination offered by the end of the day. Had to change destinations after losing a whole day of our trip in an airport with nothing.

### "always had a good experience"
Not Verified |  Have flown with Air Canada many times and have always had a good experience. Our last trip was to Florence via Zurich (Flights LX4641 out and LX4640 in). No issues whatsoever. Check in was smooth, boarding in Toronto was about the easiest we have experienced in a while, seats were fine, service was good. The only minor issue was that the seatback in the seatback in front of me was broken somehow and I couldn't put the tray back easily. Also, what's with offering WiFi but only to Aeroplan members of a certain level? I find that annoying. Other that that, everything was good.

### “Now they are refusing to give the refund!”
I booked a bulkhead seat online so that I could ask for a bassinet for my child. Subsequently, my husband called their customer service to confirm the booking and to request a bassinet. On call, their agent offered the seat as a complimentary gesture, since it was my baby's first flight, and refunded the seat price. We literally paid for the seat and their agent refunded it. About 5 days before my flight, I found out that I've been assigned some random seat, and not the one I originally booked. I was never informed of this change. I spoke to another one of their customer service rep and she said the earlier agent was supposed to send me a no-fee invoice of some sort in order to confirm the seat, which she didn't. And now they've given the seat to someone else! I tried to explain to her that I need that seat so i can have the option to get a bassinet on flight. But she said there are no more bulkhead seats available on that flight. After being thoroughly annoyed by their lack of accountability and inability to provide a solution, I posted a complaint on Twitter. A handle with their company name and logo reached out and asked for my email id and booking reference #. A person claiming to be Air Canada staff called me and canceled my booking! He said he'll refund the amount and I can book the same seat again. I found it suspicious and cut the call. But he already logged into my Air Canada account without any password, and he actually cancelled my booking! I received a cancellation email from AC and there was a non-refundable charge of $987. I brought this up with AC staff, but they couldn't care less. Someone impersonates their account and staff, gets access to their customer's account, and they still don't bother to take any action. If AC had taken prompt initiative to reach out to me, this wouldn't have happened. All this ordeal just days before I'm to take a 15hr flight with my baby. After a lot of unhelpful discussion on chat with their staff, one of their agents assured me that the original amount would be refunded. He then proceeded to offer me another ticket for another flight that's flying out two days earlier than my original flight. But he said I'd have to pay for this ticket though. Based on the assurance that I'll receive my refund, i paid for the new ticket. Now they are refusing to give the refund! I decided to pursue them for my refund, but take the flight nevertheless. Didn't want them stealing my money twice. The in-flight experience was horrible. The flight attendant refused to provide me with a bassinet, because in her opinion, my 6-month-old 7.5 kg infant who cannot sit up by herself is too big and does not need a bassinet. I understand that a bassinet is provided on a first-come first-served basis. And they did have a bassinet in flight. Another flight attendant that I spoke to came with it to install it, but this woman came back again saying my baby cannot have it! She said it doesn't matter that your baby cannot sit upright independently, it doesn't matter that you paid for this seat, you cannot get the bassinet. I've never in my life had such a horrible experience with any airline. Why should I lose out on my money, when they made their customer's online accounts easily accessible by any random person? How is it my fault that their agent did not confirm my seat and returned the amount? Their agent stated on chat that the original amount would be refunded. Why did he lie and deceive me into buying new ticket?

### "experience at check-in one of the worst"
My husband and I had an extremely distressing experience with Air Canada. We had booked separate flights, Toronto to Dubai with Air Canada and Dubai to India with Emirates, allowing a 7-hour layover in Dubai. Before traveling, we confirmed with both airlines that no transit or visit visa was required since our landing and departure in Dubai were within Terminal 3 and the layover was less than 24 hours. However, when we arrived at Toronto Pearson Airport the check-in process turned into a nightmare. The staff at the desk told us that we could not travel without a transit visa, demanded that we cancel our tickets and rebook with Air Canada for the entire journey. We reached out to Emirates customer service, and they reassured us that we did not need a visa under UAE immigration rules. The situation only improved when a higher-ranking manager, intervened after seeing me in tears. He directed us to two other staff members for assistance. Despite the first lady’s efforts to interfere and discourage them, one of the staff members finally helped us. She informed us that we needed to make a payment to an agency in Dubai, Marhaba, to transfer our luggage from Air Canada to Emirates. After enduring nearly three hours of stress, we were allowed to board. Upon arriving in Dubai, the Emirates office staff went above and beyond to resolve the issue. They transferred our luggage to the  While the flight itself was fine, the experience at the check-in desk was one of the worst I have encountered.

### “What I can truly call a win win”
I flew with them last August. There was a problem with the seat like it had been punctured. It had to be manually inflated every hour or so to maintain some comfort. The purser was more than gracious and did everything he could to help make things as comfortable as possible. 24 hours after arrival I received a communication from Air Canada with a sincere apology for the serious inconvenience experienced and a 25% credit for a future flight. I appreciated the acknowledgement. 5 months on I have received another communication from air Canada apologising for what they have called an unacceptable service. They have given me what I consider a substantial financial compensation for this flight without any asking or complaint. The effort to make things right with a customer is most commendable and deeply appreciated. What I can truly call a win win.

### "nearly 1.5hrs to serve drinks"
Star alliance gold traveller, flew on many Star alliance partners but Air Canada is such a joke. Boarding was on time and completed in a jiffy, however we were stuck at the gate for about 1hr without any service or updates aside from an initial announcement when boarding was completed about waiting for paperwork and de-icing. Flight was almost 6hrs long and personal IFE was antiquated and barely worked. It kept restarting and going back to the main screen. Service was almost non existent and the 2 crew who were servicing the economy cabin took nearly 1.5hrs to serve drinks and a snack. I understand that this is a full flight but it's ridiculously slow even for economy. And they offered us 1 small chocolate cracker. for a 6hr international flight.

### "everyone was rushed"
I've flown air Canada many times, its better than all of the American airlines but it cant even compares to the airlines from asia. It feels as if nothing was well prepared and everyone was rushed. My seatback screen worked but the USB and the 110v plug didnt, so i couldn't charge my phone on a 12 hour flight. The flight attendant dropped food items on me while trying to give it to people seated besides me, I'm lucky it was bread and snacks. There was no second option for food, just sorry, we ran out. I don't feel the flight attendants were to blame, but more the company, its like they've never flown with so many people before and lacked preparation. Im writing this sitting at Toronto Pearson, waiting for my connection to Montreal. It was supposed to be a 2 hour layover, they changed my flight to the last one of the night so now it's a 5 hour layover. They also changed my gate 4 times and there's still 3 hours of waiting left; making me go through the whole terminal twice.

### "nothing short of a disaster"
Not Verified |  I recently flew with Air Canada on my first trip to Europe, and the experience was nothing short of a disaster. What should have been an exciting adventure turned into a nightmare because of Air Canada’s complete lack of reliability, accountability, and customer care. The first major issue occurred when our connecting flight was delayed, causing us to miss our flight to Switzerland. Air Canada rebooked us on a new flight, but this left us stranded in Toronto for almost an entire day. Once we finally made it to Europe, the problems only continued. Our luggage was sent to a city we never even visited. It was lost for five days, and despite their repeated reassurances that we would get it “in no time,” it took far longer for the bags to be returned. I had to wear the same clothes for days and, eventually, I gave up hope of getting the luggage back and bought new clothes. It was a humiliating and frustrating experience. What made everything worse was the complete lack of empathy from Air Canada staff. Not once did anyone offer practical solutions or acknowledge the stress we were under—especially since we arrived in freezing 30-degree weather with only the light clothing we’d flown in from Dallas. When I got home, I submitted a claim for reimbursement for the necessities I had to buy during the five days without luggage. It’s been nearly a month, and I have yet to receive a single response from their claims department. I’ve sent multiple follow-ups, all of which have gone unanswered. To make matters worse, after 48 hours of no updates on our luggage, we were asked to fill out yet another claim form, which took over an hour to complete, listing every item in our suitcase and its value. Conveniently, after submitting that form, our luggage was “found,” but it still took several more days for it to finally arrive. On top of all this, I paid extra for what was supposed to be premium service—Economy Plus—yet received subpar treatment and bottom-tier service the entire time. Air Canada has made it clear they don’t care about their customers, nor do they take responsibility for their failures.

### "business class service is outstanding"
I absolutely love Air Canada. Their international signature business class service is outstanding. Flight from YYZ-CDG was delayed by four hours but the Air Canada app kept me updated of any delays and they even sent me an airport food credit which was perfect. Checking in for the flight both at YYZ and CDG for the return were efficient and seamless. CDG passport control and security were a breeze. Love the feature on the Air Canada app where you can track your checked luggage. Safety and comfort are what you receive when flying Air Canada.

### "I am deeply disappointed"
One of the flight attendants servicing the back of the aircraft was very rude and dismissive from the start of the flight. Before takeoff, I walked to the back of the plane to use the lavatory and seeing as it was occupied, I asked was there another bathroom back here and she yelled “right there!” pointing to where I was already standing. I was so taken aback by the harsh response that I stood there quietly. After using the bathroom I walked back to my seat. I had a terrible bout of food poisoning during this flight. I experienced extremely painful stomach cramps, multiple episodes of projectile vomiting, diaphoresis, and diarrhea. After the first episode of vomiting, I got the attention of the flight attendant was busy having a conversation with a mother and her small child, and let her know that was I vomiting. She immediately criticized where I vomited as opposed to asking me was I ok or to offer some assistance. When nauseated, on a moving plane and unable to control bodily functions when your body is forcefully trying to eject the food you just ate, it is rather difficult to think clearly. I asked for medication to help me feel better. I was at a window seat next to two other passengers so in an effort to minimize disturbances to them and to be closer to the restroom, I asked were there empty seats toward the back of the plane. I was told no at first. Then after a couple more episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, another flight attendant approached and said there was an empty row in the back where I could lay down. The rude flight attendant quickly chimes in and says let me move my stuff first. Apparently it was a storage area for the flight attendants. I was told that they would close off the lavatory I had used repeatedly for my own personal use. I happened to be standing outside the lavatory that was closed off to other passengers and a flight attendant (who unbeknownst to her that I was the passenger who had fallen ill) attempted to use it and was quickly stopped by the rude flight attendant who told her not to go in there. She then says that’s the vomit bathroom. I was utterly shocked and appalled by the unprofessionalism. It was extremely uncomfortable and I had to repeatedly ask for accommodations and assistance from flights attendants who had no compassion for someone who is visibly ill. This was an unforgettable experience that I will never forget. I am deeply disappointed and disgusted by the treatment I received. Sensitivity training and basic customer service skills are highly recommended for your staff.

### “an utter disaster from start to finish”
Oh, Air Canada, where do I begin? If you’re looking for a masterclass in how NOT to run an airline, look no further. My recent flight with them was an utter disaster from start to finish. First, we were delayed because—get this—the cargo door didn’t work. Fine, mechanical issues happen. But wait, there’s more! After finally taxiing to the runway, the flaps didn’t work. You’d think that might have been worth checking before boarding us, but hey, efficiency isn’t exactly their strong suit. So, what happens next? We sit on the plane for over three hours, trapped like sardines with no water, no snacks, and absolutely no information. And the best part? The air hostesses were utterly useless. They were more interested in sitting on their backsides than actually engaging with the passengers or showing a shred of concern. If you dared ask for an update or even a cup of water, you’d get a blank stare or an eye roll. It’s like Air Canada forgot the “airline” part of their job and just leaned into being a slow, painful situation. Suffice to say, I will NEVER be flying this miserable excuse for an airline again. Save yourself the headache and go literally anywhere else. Air Canada: Where disappointment soars higher than the planes ever will.

### “a misery to fly”
This Airline is a ripoff and a misery to fly. I paid $700 extra for Premium economy to get the extra legroom and recline and got neither. The way the seats are constructed the support for the seat in front of you blocks one of your legs from stretching out so you end up in a contorted position for the whole flight…the VERY thing I paid extra to avoid, Then, to add insult to injury, I had the ONE seat (out of 21 premium economy seats) that wouldn’t recline fully. When I complained to the flight attendant he agreed that there was a problem with the seat then essentially to said… “to bad for me”… as though it was up to Air Canada discretion to provide me with the service I had paid for. Then, finally when I phoned Air Canada directly they refused to let me speak to someone in authority and told me there was no phone number to complain to.

### "my flight was changed"
I purchased my ticket together with my husband on June 15 2024, to travel on December 20 2024, on November 30 at 6:30 pm I received a text message from Air Canada telling me my flight was changed to December 22nd 2024 only my ticket without reason, causing many problems including my plans in Christmas, I called costumer service and told me sorry but they can't do nothing.

### “rude, uncooperative staff”
Not Verified | Worst airline and rude, uncooperative staff at the Airport and at call center. Hope they improve their customer relationship and start providing better service and train their staff to be empthatic towards their customers.

### "worst online booking experience"
Not Verified | Air Canada worst online booking experience and the worst of the worst customer service! Booked a flight with layover on Dec 13 from Yellow Knife to Calgary - payment got pulled but reservation showed error, next day I could not see my booking at all on the aeroplan app; when called they said it is cancelled and I’ll have to book again but this time they purposely increased the amount and said they won’t honour the original price - greedy and a complete waste of time! Went ahead and booked a cheaper and direct (shorter) flight with WestJet for the same day.

### "grumpy service, late flights"
Being Canadian, I have flown with this airline countless times and the experience is always the same - grumpy service, late flights, poor food. The entertainment options are the only thing that is good about flying with this airline. Do better AC.

### "downgraded to Economy Class"
I booked a Business Class ticket with my parents for a trip from Toronto to Vancouver on AC113 on Nov 17, 2024. The night before, I was told I would be separated and downgraded to Economy Class even though I had already selected my seat in Business Class. When I called the customer service, the agent arrogantly told me I would have to take a different flight if I wanted to be seated in Business Class and be seated together with my parents, or I would have to be downgraded to Economy Class if I wanted to take the flight I had originally booked. I asked for the reason, but he refused to tell me. At the airport, the staff was also unable to tell me the reason nor accommodate me back to the Business Class seat I had booked and paid for. This means I was separated from my parents. Later, I found out that they downgraded me and removed me from my Business Class seat in order to make room to upgrade an Economy Class passenger to my seat. All I was told was to request a refund online. During the flight, all the Business Class privileges were deprived, and I had to pay for all the inflight amenities, food and beverages. The crew was cold-hearted, urging me to pay for my request. Is this how you treat a Business Class passenger who paid full price for the ticket? Is this how you handle a group booking? This was my first time and also my last time flying with Air Canada. Flying with Air Canada is a complete mistake.

### "Missed connections"
Absolutely horrible airline. Missed connections, dirty, uncomfortable planes, rude, condescending gate agents.

### “They just don’t care”
Not Verified | A horrible airline. I have tried to avoid flying Air Canada for many years. The problem is, in Canada we have practically no choice for internal flights. As usual, Air Canada lives up to its motto - “we are not happy until you are not happy”. How this airline earns accolades or awards for anything positive is a mystery. They just don’t care. Period.

### "disappointed by the experience"
I recently traveled with Air Canada, and I’m extremely disappointed by the experience. Not only was my baggage damaged, but I also faced significant difficulty in filing a claim. Despite multiple attempts to contact customer service for assistance, I received no support and felt that my concerns were not taken seriously. The lack of responsiveness and accountability from Air Canada’s team was incredibly frustrating. I was hoping for a timely resolution to my damaged baggage issue, but instead, I was left without guidance or any meaningful help. This experience has negatively impacted my view of Air Canada, and I’m hesitant to fly with the airline again or recommend it to others. I urge Air Canada to improve its customer service response times and streamline the baggage claim process to provide the level of service that passengers expect and deserve.

### “never again Air Canada”
Not Verified | Yeah, so never again Air Canada. You've proven yourselves money grubbing, unreliable, and the opposite of a pleasure to deal with. Current case in point. Looking at the available seats on my flight under the guise of a new booking. 40% empty plane, it will allow me to select any of those seats at an excessive fee. 1 minute later as check in opens, I am offered 2 middle seats at the rear of the plane. Did 75 people just rush to beat me at the exact second check in opened? No, Air Canada is punishing me for not forking over $50 USD to select a seat and is hiding the rest from me so they can continue to do the same to every other person checking in. Air Canada is pathetic. I'm done. Never again.

### "refusal to even partially compensate"
As a loyal Aeroplan member who has frequently flown with Air Canada, my recent experience on Flight AC824 from Toronto to Madrid on September 29, 2024, was disappointing and costly. Due to a 5-hour delay, I arrived in Madrid far later than expected, causing me to lose my pre-booked car rental. This disruption forced me to secure another vehicle, incurring an unexpected additional expense of $395.53. When I submitted a claim to Air Canada explaining the situation and the costs I had to bear as a direct result of their delay, I was disappointed to receive a denial with no acknowledgment or support. While I understand that delays are sometimes unavoidable, I feel it’s crucial for airlines to take accountability, especially when those delays lead to significant inconvenience and unexpected costs for their customers. Unfortunately, Air Canada’s refusal to even partially compensate or acknowledge the impact on my plans and budget has left me questioning their commitment to customer care. I encourage Air Canada to consider the value of customer loyalty and to recognize the importance of taking responsibility when service disruptions create substantial ripple effects for their passengers. Effective customer service involves understanding and addressing these situations, not merely dismissing them.

### "bag was one of the last onto carousel"
Took Air Canada (AC) flight 342 from Vancouver to Ottawa on October 28, 2024. Direct non-stop YVR-YOW flights are rare so you take what you can get. The entertainment system did not work. My screen at 13A was white with a red arrow circling round and round. The screen for 13B was black. The crew tried to fix the entertainment system. It worked for 40 minutes. Then seat screens were black for the remainder of the flight. AC “apologize for the inconvenience”. Second, the window between seats 12A and 13A had condensation between the acrylic panels because the seal was broken. A priority tag was placed on my bag as I checked in at Vancouver and my bag was one of the last onto carrousel #3 in Ottawa on October 28, 2024. This is priority? This is a regular occurrence with AC.

### “staff unable to provide adequate service“
Not Verified | This was a crammed flight with every one of the 450 seats filled. Staff was pleasant at the outset but clearly tired and were unable to provide adequate service as the flight went on. The seats were a little wider than  economy and reclined a little more. This made the expensive upgrade worthwhile. Persons in economy were squeezed in very tight, especially the larger ones. The entertainment system was sub standard, likely a very old system. It froze at one point and it took about an hour to have it restarted after pressing the call button. Our amenity package with earphones was not at our seat. It also took a prolonged time to get staff attention to this issue.

### “It was as if they were doing us a favor”
Not Verified | Air Canada, our signiture CHEAPO airline, representing the stoic cheapo best we offer. The flight from Lisbon was not unlike the three other flights that we took with AC. Un-courteous service. Spoke in French first only yet most of people were english. On both international flghts to and from Europe only offered cheap wine to drink, once with meal. Would not give full can of pop only glass and no ice. Female attendant at the gate and on the plane was totally rude, and snarky. It was as if they were doing us a favor by serving us. Worst feeling of being on a plane ever. Couple of the male attendants seems semi friendly but the women were not at all cordial to many people.

### "food was delicious"
Cabins were in good condition. A330 even though an old plane was in good condition and Premium Economy is in old business class seats. Crew was nice, the crew to/from Colombia was indifferent but the crew from/to Athens was great and attending the passengers. From/to ATH to Canada food in economy was great with midflight snacks. Inflight service was tasty and nice. From YYZ-BOG I had a paid upgrade to Premium Economy and the service was great, food was delicious, there was an amenities kit, welcome drink. IFE was good but need a little upgrade with newer films.

### "offered a $200 travel credit"
I am deeply disappointed with Air Canada’s handling of wheelchair assistance for my 77-year-old mother's recent travel experience. She has significant mobility issues, is a cardiac patient with back surgery. I purchased her ticket trusting Air Canada would provide the pre-arranged assistance (wheelchair) she needed. During a 1 hour and 45-minute connection in Toronto, the staff member assisting my mother told her to walk to the gate on her own, saying it "should be a short walk. She was left alone in the elevator without a gate number on her boarding pass. What was supposed to be a short walk turned into a long distance, causing her significant physical and emotional distress. What makes the situation worse is that Air Canada offered a $200 travel credit as compensation, which I find inadequate. This was not just a minor service lapse—it was a failure to provide essential, pre-arranged assistance to an elderly woman with health challenges.

### “never fails to disappoint”
I paid for business class and was informed as I checked in that I was being "downgraded. No apologies and when I spoke to a supervisor I received a wrote series of Air Canada platitudes. The ticket was booked almost a year ago and the high handed tone of the staff was akin to, "Not my problem. They did tell me with great pride that I could use the lounge but I was unable to do so because I had to wait so long to speak to a supervisor that I had enough time to go through security and get to my gate. To add insult to injury, the flight staff said there would be no IFE or wifi then promptly went around trying to sell earphones for the non-existent IFE. I received a voucher for 150 CAD which of course doesn't even come close to closing the gap between economy and business class. This airline never fails to disappoint.

### "sent to another airport"
Not Verified | Flight delayed, missed connection, lost baggage, then sent to another airport, no one wanted to know, rude staff - not just one person but the majority. Was Told to book an Uber to the airport we should have landed at and they would refund - no they would not! Can’t speak to another on phone. Don’t book a flight with this airline, the level of incompetence, I would walk rather than book a flight with this airline again.

### "unwillingness to accommodate a simple request"
I planned a trip to Iran to visit my mother, and to make the journey easier, I booked a flight from Chicago to Toronto with Air Canada so I could fly with my sister from Toronto. However, due to the rising tensions in the Middle East, all flights to Tehran were canceled. I contacted Air Canada to ask for assistance in modifying my itinerary. Unfortunately, I was met with no effort to find a solution. The only option they offered was a partial refund of around $60, even though I had paid approximately $450 for the flight. I then asked if I could retain my return flight from Toronto to Chicago but change my departure to Toronto to a week earlier, planning to book a new ticket to get to Toronto. However, I was told that if I didn’t use my outbound flight to Toronto, my return flight to Chicago (which was operated by United Airlines) would be automatically canceled. I am extremely disappointed in Air Canada's lack of support and unwillingness to accommodate a simple request.

### "would use them again"
Not Verified | Quick hop, ahead of schedule, got us to Montreal with loads of time to make the connection. Left on time, arrived LHR early. Totally uneventful flight. Late dinner pretty average, breakfast better. Crew robotically effective. Pre-booked Emergency Exit row seats quite comfortable, would not have wanted six hours in a standard economy seat. This trip the first time we have used Air Canada. On this evidence would use them again.

### "a series of unpleasant incidents"
My itinerary included a smooth outbound flight from Miami to Montreal and then onto Tokyo. However, the return journey from Narita to Montreal was marred by a series of unpleasant incidents. Upon landing in Montreal, the airport's disorganization and chaos became apparent. It took us an hour just to leave the airport. Given our extended 13-hour layover in Montreal, we decided to book a hotel near the airport to prepare for our final flight AC1650, scheduled to depart from gate C77 on September 15th at 8:35 AM. As we arrived at the gate, announcements were made informing passengers that the Airbus 319 was fully booked and requesting volunteers to check their carry-ons. My wife, parents, and I had two essential carry-ons, so we did not volunteer. When it was our turn to board (Group 4), an inexperienced Air Canada employee, a young woman no older than 25, approached me and asked me to place my bag in the size checker. I complied, and to my surprise, the bag, which I had used on numerous trips without issue, fit perfectly. However, the employee insisted that my bag was oversized and demanded that we must check both luggages or face being denied boarding. She even claimed that this was federal law and that we were in violation. Her unfounded claims and unprofessional demeanor left us standing there while everyone else boarded the aircraft. After a considerable wait, she finally returned and asked, "Are you going to check your bags or do you want to speak to my manager? Confident that I was within my rights, I requested to see her manager. Shortly after, a more senior employee, a woman in her forties, arrived and asked, "What's going on? Why aren't you boarding? I explained the situation, and she immediately asked me to place my bag in the size checker again. Upon seeing that it fit perfectly, she acknowledged, "Yes, you can board. However, the younger employee, clearly unwilling to admit her mistake, insisted, "No, I've already called my manager. After enduring unnecessary stress and waiting, my wife and I were finally allowed to board. Unsurprisingly, our bags fit perfectly in the overhead compartments, further highlighting the absurdity of the situation. This incident added to the exhaustion of a 26-hour journey and marred what should have been a routine boarding process. This experience exposed serious gaps in Air Canada's staff training and professionalism. I urge the airline to address these issues promptly and thoroughly to prevent future passengers from enduring similar frustrations. It is essential that Air Canada invests in comprehensive training programs that emphasize customer service, empathy, and adherence to company policies to ensure a seamless and positive travel experience for all passengers.

### "delay to gate check bags"
Not Verified | Amateur hour at AC. They knew they had a fully booked plane where every passenger has a roller bag and instead waited until half way through the boarding process to turn around passengers to gate check. They also had 45 minute delay to gate check bags before the boarding process started but elected not to. Not the conduct of a professionally run ground staff.

### "I can’t say enough good things"
I can’t say enough about the flight attendant Desire. She is an absolute angel. It was my first flight in my life and I mentioned it and she bumped my seat for me and gave me the best experience of my life. She checked on me so frequently and always had a peak to make sure I was doing ok. I was so beyond nervous and anxious. I went with a colleagues/friend and we were not in the same section and she went and got her to come up and sit with me so I felt more comfortable. I can’t say enough good things. She brought energy to everyone and was such a sweetheart and so caring. I almost cried when I was leaving and gave her a hug because she and my friend made my first flight the best experience. I appreciate her and I hope the managers realize what an asset she is. If I could have her on every flight I go on I would. She really was meant for this job.

### "lack of communication"
I recently went on an 8-day family vacation from Toronto to Catania. Unfortunately, my luggage didn’t arrive in Catania, and I was without my belongings for four days. Air Canada advised me to purchase essential items and keep the receipts, which I did. Upon returning home on August 27th, I promptly submitted a claim and received a confirmation email with a case number. I was told to simply wait, and Air Canada would handle everything. After three weeks of hearing nothing, I contacted them, only to be told they were still ‘working on it.’ They then suggested I contact Italy to submit a claim there. I was baffled—why wasn’t I told this earlier? I received no explanation, only an apology. I followed up with ITA Airlines, who helped me file a claim, but four days later, I received a response saying the claim was denied due to being submitted past the 21-day deadline after receiving my luggage. Meanwhile, I still have not received any response from Air Canada. I still have not been reimbursed for the items purchased whilst my bag was missing. This experience not only disrupted our family vacation but left me frustrated by the lack of communication and accountability. Based on this ordeal, I strongly recommend avoiding Air Canada.

### “should be ashamed of the service”
Not Verified | On Aug 19, 2024, after experiencing a 9-hour outbound delay and losing a day of my vacation, we filed an online complaint. However, Air Canada responded that we are not eligible for compensation due to a maintenance issue and are not offering any compensation. I plan to file a formal complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), hoping to get compensation. This is the third time something like that has happened to me in recent years with Air Canada. The story doesn't end there. I also experienced significant delays on the inbound trip to Toronto. There was a 4-hour delay on Aug 27, 2024, in Venice on the way to Toronto through Montreal. When I arrived in Montreal, my trip was canceled, and they rebooked me on the trip for the next morning at 9:30 AM. Despite arriving (as a family with 2 kids) around 5:30 PM in Montreal, when I spoke to the Air Canada customer service, they told me they were sorry but that we were on our own. The customer service representative did not offer any sort of help other than a $15 food voucher. Air Canada should be ashamed of the service it is offering. If they don’t know how to manage it then give it to a third party who can serve customers better. The media needs to push this greedy corporation to do better or change.

### "really cram the seats so close"
They really cram the seats so close to each other, even though nobody is paying the extra for the leg room rows. I tried to fill out the survey sent to me, to let Air Canada know that I dont appreciate them using my email address to solicit me for feedback. It was taking way too long to fill out. I am not an expert at flight travel, hire a consultant. If you want to waste my time, pay me. How can I fly without giving out my email address to avoid such harrassment?

### “what a shambles”
This is our second Air Canada flight in two days and true to form there were issues with both of them. 1. Toronto to Montreal - our checked bag did not make it on the flight along with about 40 other bags which would have rendered the plane “too heavy” and therefore were left behind… it then didn’t get delivered until the next day. 2. Montreal to Calgary - the flight (which cost Can$ 1,100 for 2 tickets incl bag + seats) is more than 1.5h delayed to to “unscheduled” maintenance… being a 737 plane this is worrying especially as the plane was stationed in Montreal before and we were told at check-in that there aren’t any delays. Dept time was 8.25am and is now 10am at the earliest. Why is just every flight with Air Canada flawed? I wish I had read the vast amount of negative reviews beforehand and booked elsewhere - what a shambles. How can they even be part of the Star Alliance… so misleading.

### "72 hours after our original scheduled flight"
My story begins with a flight on Friday getting cancelled like so many others, and rebooked 24 hours later. As compensation we were given two meal tickets because I guess eating two meals in 24 hours is sufficient. Since we were delayed overnight, we inquired about hotel bookings. We should know in about 10-15 minutes while our system updates or you can be reimbursed up to $300 a night”. We decided to wait the “10-15 minutes” but pulled up a booking app and browse. In an astonishing 30 seconds, the power of an Internet connection gave us an assortment of hotels. Still we waited, feeling more comfortable with a booking done directly by AC. 10-15 minutes passed and I asked if there was any update. There was none. Timeline? Not sure when the system will update. As hotels filled up we booked it ourselves and the reimbursement process I’m sure will be a daisy. One night in a hotel, flight the next day, several flights after it the next day, just in case. Inconvenient but no big deal. Our next flight was cancelled the following morning due to weather. Not to be deterred, AC wasted no time and got back to us 3 hours later with a gracious offer for a new flight Monday evening, a mere 72 hours after our original scheduled flight. With several flights in front of us with open seats, it would be easy to think we were forgotten. I was determined to change my itinerary, so I employed the use of a travel agent. We tried our hardest to switch airlines to get to our destination. At this point our experience seemed like it was a typical airline meltdown that happens every so often, remembering southwest in 2022-2023. Travel agent work quickly to get us on another flight and another airline but unfortunately, one more leg on AC, then another on a new airline. Travel agent advised us to go to the AC customer service desk, or call the AC customer service line and explain that our itinerary needed to be exchanged. We could try checking in, but it was likely that an itinerary exchange would need intervention from customer service. After trying to check in online and on the app, it was clear we needed customer service to intervene. Dozens of individuals run what is called AC’s customer service department, but don’t let the latter half of the name fool you.

### "We had unlimited legroom"
Not Verified |  First time with the airline and apprehensive after reading so many negative reviews. Also a bit concerned about such a long trip on a narrowbody. However, it proved to be painless. We had unlimited legroom with row 20 seats (no charge), an attentive crew, regular water runs, a reasonable main meal with wine (extra offered), and a snack before landing. It helped that the plane was only 70% full. My only gripe was with the ridiculously small washrooms which were designed for midgets.

### "4 delayed flights out of 4 flights"
I rarely take the time to write a review but my experience with Air Canada this week is beyond the pale and absolutely why I've chosen not to fly with them for 5 + years. But i had Aeroplan points to use up and i thought, what could go wrong? I was initially booked for travel from Calgary to Boston on sept 11-sep 16. Inexplicably, they cancelled the outbound flight three days before departure and booked me for the day before. We spent 2 hours on the tarmac on outbound sept 10 flight due to "mechanical issues. fly to Montreal for connection and that flight is delayed an hour and they lose my bag - they left it in Montreal). 28 hours to get my bag to me, zero customer service in the interim. sept 16 flight Boston-Montreal gets delayed 4 times for 4.5 hours and everyone misses their connection. Lots of mad people at the gate because they used no less than three separate reasons for the delay. Initially, they told us there was only one AME for the entire Logan airport. lol. Then it was censor problems and couldn't "find the codes. Then waiting for "paperwork" to be completed by mechanics. Everyone misses their connection. We have to hotel at the airport in Montréal, next morning, flight to Calgary is delayed 1.5 hr! Within a week, a cancelled flight, a lost bag and 4 delayed flights out of 4 flights total. Will be giving away the rest of my miles. Agents at the ticket counters are inefficient and useless. I've never seen a disembarkation like this (a single agent scanning each persons ticket to get off during one of the delays, jetway is packed and two other agents with scanners available standing there watching him. Incompetence and they don't care!

### “On board the service is curt”
Please, think twice if you are traveling for business or are on a schedule!! I have flown Air Canada 3 times in the last week for business (out of 3 flights) as code shares for United and they have been +2 - 4 hour delayed every time making me miss connections every time. Their connection management process has also been extremely poor. For example LGA to YUL was delayed missing connection to CDG. Instead of putting me on the next flight to Paris, I was put on a flight (delayed, of course) to Barcelona. This flight was already so delayed when I was issued my boarding passes that it was missing its connection to Paris - before take off. On board the service is curt and the food and amenities are basic. The business class flights I paid for were simply not worth the expense. And the while the premium economy cabin is passable (bumped down due to delays) the delays simply don’t make the experience value for money.

### “it was a terrible experience”
This was my first time flying with Air Canada and it was a terrible experience. The food was extremely bad, the service from the flight attendants was rude and I was treated badly by the flight attendant when I crossed to the other side of the aisle through the space between the wing seats.

### “Needlessly complicated”
I'm writing this review at the airport of departure - DFW - before having flown. My main issues are 1. The booking process for a flight from, in my case, the US VIA Canada to a final destination, in my case Switzerland, does not include the warning that you need a Canadian visa even as a transit passenger in Canada. This makes the check-in process more stressful than it needs to be - just include a step in the booking process on-line that requires each future passenger to enter e.g. their Canadian visa nr, et voila, you immediately reduce passenger and staff stress at the airport. 2. The on-line check-in process in the app and via a web browser does NOT allow you to enter certain passport / visa information, in my case for the Swiss residence permit. Consequently, I had to arrive at the airport early to do check-in at the counter. Needlessly complicated. Reaction of the staff: "high-tech doesn't always work". People. Americans. This is NOT high-tech. This is 1990-tech (and I leave it up to you to decide if it is 1990 BCE or AD). Simple process fixes, it sems to me, that reduce stress for staff and passengers. Fix this, please, global process owners of booking and of check-in process.

### "Seat broken"
Not Verified |  Flight AC 919 in business class Dublin Vancouver. Seat broken, no cushioning on seat 2A as if punctured. Needed to be inflated by hand every 2 hours. Impossible to get into sleep position. Like sitting on a plank for 9 hours. Could not change seat as cabin full in business and premium. The ground crew at Dublin would be responsible for allowing this to happen. They had to know it was broken. First and last time customer with Air Canada. On a positive note the food was good.

### "claims the delay was due to weather"
Our flight from Montreal to Toronto was canceled as we were just about to board. The Air Canada representative said we would have to come back the next day. No explanation, so we stayed in hotel for the night that we had to pay for and went the next day. I filled out claim to get reimbursed for the hotel, Air Canada claims the delay was due to weather. No reimbursement. Never will I fly with this airline.

### "never choose Air Canada again"
I would never choose Air Canada again. The flight was scheduled to take off at 12:30 pm Jamaican time, and we were advised to arrive three hours early for check-in. However, after nearly 12 hours of continuous delays, we finally boarded at 8:40 pm. Accompanied by my wife, son, and baby girl, the long wait was particularly hard on the children, causing them to become very irritable. This ordeal forced me to exceed my budget significantly, as the airline offered no compensation meal or any form of recompense. They sent an email stating the delay was due to unforeseen maintenance, which apparently does not warrant compensation. Having already spent close to 3000 Canadian dollars, the additional expenses were a financial strain. Moreover, our pickup driver had to rearrange his schedule, ultimately picking us up after 2 am, to the distress of my children and the dismay of my wife. I assure you, Air Canada will not find my name in their system ever again.

### “zero interaction from this attendant”
Not Verified | AC1903 - August 29, 2024 - flight from Toronto to Victoria. This was probably the worst flight attendant I've ever been exposed to and here's why: 1) when boarding the aircraft there was no acknowledgement - no hello, no welcome aboard and no indication that my "hello" was even heard 2) when the safety demonstration took place this same attendant spoke so quickly that she was impossible to understand 3) same flight attendant snapped her fingers at me to get my attention - really? How rude! 4) as with point #1 above, when the passengers were leaving the plane there was zero interaction from this attendant - no thanks for flying with us, or have a great day - nothing - it's like we the passengers were a burden. Basically I felt that she hated her job and just didn't care one way or the other about any of the passengers. Or maybe she was going though something terrible in her personal life but as soon as she enters that plane any problems/issues should be left at the door and some form of professionalism coming into play.

### "No one is getting back to us"
No one is getting back to us I have been calling Air Canada since this morning to get my luggage as soon as possible But they have done nothing to get it delivered It’s now 10:30 at night and we haven’t received our baggages People in the call center are just saying that we have prioritized your request but nothing has happened since this morning, we are still waiting I have my medicines , clothing, perishable food in my luggage and I have informed them on the call but they have done nothing I’m not sure even if the call centre is connected to someone here in Canada because no one is fulfilling our requests made through the call centre. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with our experience with Air Canada That's how they treat their customers? When it comes to fare they charge the maximum amount and when it comes to the services they treat their customers like this Who is going to be responsible, my husband is unable to go to work tomorrow after such a long vacation because he doesn't have his belongings My son doesn't have his clothes for school , Who is responsible for all this? No one is getting back to us.

### “first and last time to fly Air Canada”
Boarding pass didn’t work so we had to get in a very long line to speak with someone. The “need assistance” desk was unmanned so we had to get in the “check bag” line. No kiosk existed which is a huge issue. Everyone we spoke to had a boarding pass QR code that didn’t work, like us. Almost seems like a bait and switch to provide a code that fails so we all had to get in a long line. Slow process as only two workers. Instructions at the gate for boarding was chaotic. No intercom, sign flipped, rude AC man. Young family didn’t/couldn’t hear they could board early. This is my first and last time to fly Air Canada.

### "Very good service all around"
Not Verified | Very good service all around. Baggage price very reasonable $34 for 2 hand carry’s, and one large suitcase. I would definitely recommend Air Canada. Flight was half hour leaving, but not the airlines fault.

### "extremely unhappy"
Not Verified | I’m extremely unhappy with Air Canada as I booked my flight for September 18th on June 21st. I was informed that the airline is going on strike September 17th. I cannot change my flight dates. I need to book through another airline to get where I’m needing to go and I asked for a full refund because with the strike happening the day before I know my flight is getting cancelled if they can’t come up with an agreement. I’m a single mom. I’ve been saving for this trip since January this year. And I’m being told I won’t get a refund because the flight isn’t cancelled but I also won’t know if it’s cancelled until the day before. Which in turn means that I won’t be catching this flight and I’m absolutely gutted. DO NOT FLY WITH AIR CANADA AS THEY DONT CARE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. I will NEVER book through Air Canada again.

### "delayed not once but 3 times"
Unfortunately not the first bad experience with Air Canada. They do not respect people’s time at all. On top of that they have the worst customer service. Personally I’ll not travel by a Canadian airline again. My plan was to catch a late work shift at night. But, I wouldn’t be able to make it because my flight got delayed not once but 3 times. As I said this is not the first time. It’s becoming the norm to expect delays and cancellations to the point that you can’t plan ahead.

### "Air Canada being unsupportive"
Not Verified | I flew from Halifax - Toronto - Indianapolis. Due to a tight connection, my golf clubs did not make it to Indianapolis. I was told my bag would be forwarded to Indianapolis the next day and I would be reached out to on next steps. I initially did not here from Air Canada for 4 days. I then headed home to Lexington, Kentucky. Once my bag was found, the intended to forward it via American Airlines to Lexington Blue Grass Airport. They promised me my bag would be there the next day. I arrived at Lexington Blue Grass airport with the flight information provided by World Tracer saying my bag was on the flight to find out it did not make it. While on the line with the baggage team, I was told it was American Airlines fault even though Air Canada never delivered the bag to them. 48 hours later, Air Canada is still working with American on exactly where my bag is. The major issue is Air Canada has essentially 0 employee presence in Indianapolis airport for these situations. Also, I didn't even try to book an Air Canada flight. I booked through United and they happened to book me on Air Canada. Indianapolis airport says this seems to be an issue with Air Canada on being unsupportive. Also, guest services at Indy airport has tried to track my bag with no avail. They have been providing more feedback that anyone at Air Canada. If anyones sees this at Air Canada, this is still an ongoing issue 6 days later.

### "my clubs didn't arrive"
For the 2nd time in 3 weeks, my clubs didn't arrive on Air Canada returning from the US senior amateur. Now im heading to muskoka and have a tournament tomorrow and have no clubs to play with. Direct flight and we were there 2 hrs in advance. What are the chances the clubs which now get in at midnight even arrive tomorrow? I was a 75k flyer with AC and have 800000 lifetime points. I now have become frequent flyer with Delta and well use wesjet as an alternative for canadian flights

### “Nothing has improved”
Not Verified |  My first time in 15 years taking Air Canada and it will be another 15 years before I fly with them again. I usually fly WestJet but I wanted the direct flight from Vancouver to Singapore and I thought it has been a while since my previously awful experiences. Nothing has improved, in fact service and food has declined sharply. During a 14 hour flight in premium economy we had 1 lunch meal after take off from Singapore, rice and chicken and 12 hours later an equally sad breakfast was served. There was a reported “snack” on the flight menu that was left out on the counters in the galleys of a sandwich comprising of hummus and tomatoes. The flight crew was very disinterested in the clients and in doing their job just the absolute bear minimum. The positive, the flights I took were on time. If ever I have other options to the destinations that I travel to I will ensure that Air Canada will be the last on my list.

### "aircraft and time changes"
Several aircraft and time changes before the flight. Also we were not served any meal from YUL to LAX, which was included in our ticket. When reaching out to AC’s customer service they offered us a discount code of 15% on the next flight. That is not so useful for us since we live and usually travel in Europe. When asking them for a compensation in money or a discount for their european partners instead the answer was no!

### “crew was tired and careless”
Not Verified | My family and I took a trip from Montreal to Vancouver. For the first flight, we were delayed by 2 hours due to a mechanical problem of the plane and the crew being late, but the worst was the return flight. At first, the flight was cancelled and they decided to change that plane for safety. I selected the plane (Airbus) and now it changed to a Boeing. We also paid to choose the seats in advance while our seats were moving to the tail (from row 9 to 41). When we entered the plane after 6 hours of delay, the crew was tired and careless. Finally, we arrived and I had to pay more for parking for the delay. According to the airline rules, I must receive the compensation for the delay more than 4 hours and the seat change, but the airline's answer is no. I do not recommend this airline at all. If you must do it, I recommend paying just for the cheapest ticket and not choosing the seat or flight type.

### "fine to seat us separately"
Not Verified |  It is Air Canada policy to seat children with parents. When we checked in we were seated together however, when we got to the airport they seated our 8 and 13 year old children away from us. When we inquired, the lady at the counter said it would be fine to seat us separately. This very disappointing from a parents perspective when flying with the airline. Also, flight was over booked and people were left without options, in my opinion.

### "nightmare I am going through"
Not Verified |  The worst. I cannot stress enough the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Kept delaying my flight on the August17 2024. which was understandable due to the sever weather conditions. 5 hours post departure time, cancelled the flight "due to maintenance". Recovery was for 2 days later. Next day flight rout changed and new itinerary showing I was flying via Houston/ Auckland by Air New Zealand. The appalling customer service begins here: Go to Houston, if you miss your connecting flt, accomodation will be provided! Left YYZ an hour late and missed my NZ flt. AC said there will be no accommodation, find your own! Had to spend the night at the airport as I had nothing, even my carry on was taken and tagged back in YYZ. Slept on airport seats . My whole itinerary changed again and the next day (today) I am flying with United. Asked for my luggage, as I knew no airline would keep luggage overnight. And I wanted to check in with UA. AC staff did not give me my bags saying United would get them tomorrow. While I am still holding bag tags with NZ flt number on, UA does not have my bags. I have been on hold over 45 minutes on the phone for their so called 24/7 Baggage Services to find out where my bags are. UA says AC have you bags in Houston, AC says UA has your luggage. This is the nightmare I am going through and there is no-one here who actually knows what they are talking about ... they ruined my 2 week vacation in Australia in every way possible or imaginable.

### "hands down the worst"
Not Verified |  My original flight from Montreal was brought forward by an hour, when i arrived in Toronto my flight was delayed by 2 hours, Air Canada then announced they had overbooked the flight & tried to buy peoples tickets then delayed my flight to Dublin again by another 2 hours. Air Canada is hands down the worst!

### “Another cancelled flight”
Another cancelled flight from Air Canada because of a maintenance issue. This is 4 in a row. Flying from Vancouver to Toronto plane has to turn around because of a maintenance issue. Flying from Chicago to Toronto 6 hour delay because of a maintenance issue. Flying from Paris to Toronto and flight cancelled due to maintenance issue. Had to rebook with Air France. Today - flying from Toronto to SFO - flight cancelled and changed to next day because of a maintenance issue. Missing the event we had tickets to.

### "uniquely bad for Air Canada"
Delay a flight 6 times before announcing a cancel, with customer service having no idea of the status of the pilots coming in. Making baggage claim so late (by not sending a team to a flight that had been delayed then cancelled over ten hours) that it was impossible to book a hotel. Vaguely saying "we'll give you a voucher" and bailing on you. No real updates. Why not cancel the flight earlier, or release our baggage? Was it worth the slim shot at saving the $600 for passenger comp? Sending baggage onwards without checking in or asking. I waited 4 hours to make sure my baggage is secure, only to have it shipped in front of me ruining the whole point. In two separate points. One agent telling me that they don't care in domestic about bags, so keep it tight with you (why I stayed an extra 4 hours or so) - just to have Air Canada say YOLO and ship it onwards. Not even having the presence of mind to hand out food, food vouchers, anything after passengers were placed in a hot plane, deplaned, and made to stand for 10 hours+. This could have been the easiest token. Having super long lines at every step of the process and being understaffed. For example, the baggage claim line had three people at the counter, and one person checking or doing something while dozens of passengers were waiting in line. Full hands on deck? Not the case with Air Canada, by understaffing. I generally blame management for putting staff and passengers in this situation - that said, some staff members were supremely unhelpful in a way that boggles the mind. Why even make gate announcements if you work for the company and literally have no better idea than any of us what is going on? Is checking who is "priority" really the best way you can use your time given a baggage line that runs hours on average? Is it impossible to anticipate a situation like this and having agents be reachable in some way? Not a great time to have only 2-3 people operate a counter when the line is like 800 deep? One thing that stood out is that this seemed uniquely bad for Air Canada. This is very surprising, because airlines like Flair and Westjet have much worse reputations. But from what I could observe, all Air Canada flights were affected.

### "my plane was delayed 5 times"
This is the worst airline in the world. Never on time, service is awful, and my plane was delayed 5 times.

### "strict with carryon limit"
Not Verified |   Airline is strict with carryon limit, size (even if 1 inch off), so be aware. They demanded I check in bag (w/$35 fee) and made a scene of it (while we were completely silent. Then, checked our bag into someone else's itinerary, delaying arrival of baggage for 1.5 days. Finally refunded the $35 fee but am still waiting for incidentals costs (which I'm not expecting to get - simple night wear, toothbrush, etc.). Then, to top it off, they lost our luggage again for 1 day on our return trip (home). No incidentals incurred this time, but we got our $35 luggage fee back on that one too but within reasonable time. Both of those fees should be refunded immediately without the extra work of filing out forms online, then waiting before receiving. That was our first trip with Air Canada. On the plus side, entertainment and flight crew were excellent (beyond other airline experiences). It took awhile to get our drinks, but I believe that was due to turbulence.

### "thoughtful and took initiative"
Not Verified |   A review to agent Marta at the customer service desk for Air Canada who was so kind to us as we arrived needing help to ensure our delayed flight would not impact our connecting flight. She was thoughtful and took initiative to help us get our bags taken care of and reassure us that it would be okay. This is the kind of service anyone would ask for and really appreciate Marta from Air Canada.

### “I am shocked and disgusted”
On the way to Istanbul the flight from Orlando was delayed, I couldn’t make my connection. Finally arrived to Istanbul for a major oral surgery. Bags never arrived until 3 days later. No assistance whatsoever with that. On the way back, August 14th, I head to the airport 3 hours before the departure time. At the counter I am told that my name is nowhere to be found, I have all the confirmation numbers needed. I had my father contact Air Canada from the US knowing that I had no other way to communicate with them. They tell me that the flight should be good and there is no problem. I go back to the counter. Same thing I don’t exist. I was told that they can see the Paris to Montreal portion but no Istanbul to Paris. Father on the phone for a very long time with Air Canada. No help. The flight has departed. Stranded in Istanbul Air Canada had the guts to ask me for $1700 to fly back the following day. Absolutely disgusting. Here I am stuck in a foreign country, with only a couple large bills on me. And they are asking me for $1700 and that there is nothing they do about it. After numerous calls I was able to find a family member who purchased a one was ticket for me for $1398. What’s else can I say? I am shocked and disgusted. Totally unacceptable.

### “very rude and unapologetic crew”
Had more than 15 hours flight, I couldn’t book halal meal in time so requested crew for vegetarian or seafood meals if possible, they bluntly refused and I couldn’t eat anything in entire flight, in the later leg I learned that they even had some vegetarian meals available but didn’t bother to offer anything, 15 hours without food with a very rude and unapologetic crew who even avoid eye contact and are reluctant to come to your seats for hours when you try calling them, it was a nightmare.

### "minimum service standard"
Service just gets worse. Delays on almost every flight with the odd cancellation thrown in. Planes are old, cabins are tired, food generally poor - breakfast hasn't changed in over a decade. Seems like the goal is to pack the planes and get away with the absolute minimum service standard. Mostly a different, and better, story pre-covid...

### "love the seating and entertainment"
As AC 75k member, I always love the seating and entertainment systems in the long route. It is very consistent layout across all business class (signature class). Some other airlines you need to be careful which exact aircraft you are flying so you get different layout etc. The only thing I hope Air Canada can improve is the food selection. Compared with other asian airlines, the food selection is very limited.

### "my bag was 12lbs overweight"
When i got to the airport i went to the first counter and the lady wanted to charge me extra money because my bag was 12lbs overweight. I took my leather jacket out and some books i didn't need bag was good now. My luggage went to prince Rupert, two days later i finally got my luggage, unfortunately my work gear was in luggage and I missed one day of work because i needed special gear to be on site. I  emailed air Canada tried to call just kept getting the runaround, its been almost two weeks and i haven't heard from anyone.

### "rudest and most annoying response"
Not Verified | AIR CANADA decided on the spot to cancel the connecting flight from Toronto to Washington DC on July 17th 2024 afternoon. When arriving to Toronto from Calgary on July 17th, the connecting flight was on the board saying "on-time". About one hour before the scheduled departure, it changed to "delay 30 min" and about 20 minutes later changed again to "flight cancelled". Checking at the gate what's going on, AIR CANADA person told us there is a weather issue - this why the flight is cancelled. The weather that afternoon in Toronto was perfect! Checking later what was the weather in the destination airport - DCA, shows that at the timeframe we were suppose to arrive to DCA (between 6 pm to 12 pm) about 15 -20 other flights from different airlines arrived and landed safely - so there was no significant major weather blocking this flight from taking place due to weather at the destination either. This was a complete fake excuse made by AIR CANADA, not to operate this flight. Obviously nobody from AIR CANADA gives any explanation or a proof. They just announce it and we - the passengers - can do nothing about it. But - this was only the beginning. Air CANADA didn't offer any solution for this flight passengers, no compensation, no hotel, no meal - not even a glass of water. The option given was to take this flight after 28 hours from the original departure time (just for part of the people - others got nothing). Actually, they kind of "celebrated" the event. This is a Weather case, so we owe nothing to the passengers, this is our regulations, good luck for you" Anyway, this was just a one hour flight +/-, so we decided to rent a car and drive the 8 hours distance and took a hotel for a night sleep on the way, since we had hard obligations for the next day in Washington DC. The rudest and most annoying response from Air CANADA after all this, is that they refuse to pay back the extra expenses taken by us to reach our destination, due to this irresponsible and unloyalty behaviour of AIR CANADA. Bottom line - AIR CANADA has cancelled a flight on the spot without any justified reason, without giving a reasonable alternative solution and refuse to pay back any compensation or expense to the passengers.

### “please fly Westjet”
Not Verified | Atrocious, I have never been more frustrated by an airline. The delays I can understand, but my bags also never making it onto my initial flight (now lost) and now added layovers and over 12 hours in added travel time, I am so sick and tired of this happening every time I seem to travel with Air Canada. Never again, please fly Westjet.

### "Everything went well"
This was a short flight from Vancouver to Calgary in economy. Everything went well in terms of service, cabin crew friendliness, and cleanliness. I've flown on the MAX several times and it's one of the fleets newer and nicer planes.

### "crew was very attentive"
Excellent service on this flight. This was a return flight to Calgary from Montreal, both ways flown in domestic widebody business class (pods). Typically I've flown in B787 pods, but the 777 pods were just as good. The crew was very attentive, and the food was up to the usual high standards, with multi-course meals and ample beverage/alcohol selection. Looking forward to my next flight!

The crew was very attentive, and the food was up to the usual high standards, with multi-course meals and ample beverage/alcohol selection. Looking forward to my next flight. Remarks on readings: generally if it's at or above expectations I've given full marks. For Value For Money I've given 4 just because business is inherently pricey, so passengers need to decide if they feel that it's worth it. For Wi-Fi and Connectivity I put N/A because I did not use it.

### "no working air conditioning"
A very regular occurrence of packing everyone in to the plane with no working air conditioning and sitting on the runway in overheating plane. Happens far too often.

### "missing from my checked luggage"
I was highly disappointed with this airline. When first arriving at the airport the woman checking in our bags were not friendly at all. The food on our 10 hour flight to Greece was horrible, the staff seemed irritated when I asked for a glass of ice and a can of coke (they would have preferred to give me 2 ice cubes and half a can of coke). Upon arriving to our destination I discovered that things were missing from my checked luggage. Trying to call and make a complaint was a joke. Never was I routed to an actual person to speak with. I would never recommend this airline.

### "very caring and attentive"
Not Verified |   I don’t usually write reviews, but I had to share this one experience about a flight attendant. was traveling with my grandma, who’s really scared of flying. Mid-flight, she started to get really anxious and I tried calming her down and one flight attendant I think her name was Angie she had saw and when she noticed she came right over to help. She sat with my grandma for a few minutes and held her hand, and talked to her and me and asked if we had any plans in Austin or if we were visiting other family. After she had continued her duties. She even checked on my grandma during the flight to make sure she had enough water too even though there was many other passengers to attend too as well. It’s nice seeing some flight attendants be very caring and attentive and glad she works for that airline.

### "never came by to check up"
Not Verified |   I fly Air Canada within North America 1-2 times a month and international few times a year. I’ve always found their service mediocre but recently while flying business on an international flight, I spilt coffee on my lap and seat. I went to find someone for some towels. Not only did they give a paper towel, they never came by to check up. I had to go back few times to ask for some more. I don’t expect them to clean up for me nor have incredible service. It felt no different than me spilling a drink at McDonald’s and cleaning it up after myself.

### Air Canada customer review
Not Verified |   I have been a loyal customer of Air Canada for many years, specifically during the 13 years from 2008 when my job required frequent travel. Whenever possible, I chose Air Canada for my journeys. However, I have observed a decline in the quality of service. Regrettably, I have noticed that the attentiveness and politeness of the flight attendants have diminished. In comparison to other airlines I have traveled with, such as Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Korean Air, British Airways, and various American carriers, Air Canada's service has not been up to par. My recent experience with Lufthansa was particularly pleasant; the crew treated passengers with genuine smiles and excellent service. In contrast, Air Canada's flight attendants display a demeanor that suggests they view themselves as victims, and this attitude unfortunately affects their interactions with passengers. For instance, during a recent flight, there was turbulence, and the captain announced that hot beverages would not be served due to safety concerns, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. When the seatbelt sign was later turned off, a flight attendant approached to offer drinks. I mentioned that I would like a coffee but was aware that hot beverages were not being served due to the turbulence. Instead of a polite clarification, the attendant responded with, "Can't you see the seatbelt light came off? Her words were laced with sarcasm, which I found quite unpleasant. As a result of these experiences, I have decided to choose other airlines for my future travels. My wife and I will be traveling to Europe this October, and we have chosen not to fly with Air Canada. I hope this feedback is taken into consideration to improve the service quality and customer experience.

### “exceeded expectations”
Air Canada turned out to be a good flying experience for the first time because of its comfortable seating, friendly and courteous cabin crew and staff, and impressive in-flight entertainment options, which exceeded expectations and made for a pleasant journey.

### "I am grateful"
Not Verified |   I had an issue with my passport but the staff of Air Canada were very friendly, helpful and very nice, solved my problem and helped me a lot. I am grateful.

### "experience has been awful"
Not Verified |   Our flight was canceled, fine. But the service afterwards was awful. From being told one thing by the floor manager. To then having the rudest treated by the customer service representative at the Maple Leaf Lounge. She was rude and obnoxious, talking on the phone about us while serving other customers. We actually did not use the Maple Leaf Lounge due to her treatment. The whole experience has been awful.

### “an infuriating and unacceptable experience”
Not Verified | I am beyond disappointed with Air Canada. A delayed flight caused us to miss our connection, and to make matters worse, they booked us on a Delta flight, falsely claiming our seats were confirmed. We discovered at 6 am in the airport that they were not, leaving us unable to check in and get home. After numerous calls with unhelpful and discourteous agents, we were finally rebooked on an 11 am flight, arriving home 13 hours late. This was an infuriating and unacceptable experience. Avoid Air Canada at all costs.

### “staff refused to help me”
Not Verified | Terrible terrible airline. Not only was I 8 hours late to my destination, but the Air Canada staff refused to help me. One of them walked away from me while I was speaking to them and their customer service literally hung up on me. I received NO compensation because they lied about the reason for the delay.

### "flight home was also cancelled"
Not Verified |   While on a group school trip I was stuck on a plane on the runway at the Philadelphia airport after 45 minutes the pilot announced that the aircraft was running low on fuel and we needed to turn around to refuel then we were informed that the plane had a mechanical issue that couldn’t be fixed and we had to unboard. After a lengthy process we got another plane hours later and finally made it to Canada where we expected to get on a connecting flight to London. This flight however got cancelled and we had to get another one. This was not the end of the nightmares, when we finished packing to come home to the US we discovered our flight home was also cancelled.

### “poor communication to their passengers”
Not Verified | Massive delay at departure lost our connecting flight and then could not find an alternate route to make up the difference. They are understaffed and disorganized, poor communication to their passengers. I dont know why we booked with AC this time, we had avoided them like the plague and ended up losing our car rental and 2 days off our trip to Lisbon. We had to re book with TAP the next day so we could get to portugal Anyways it was a fresh reminder why we dont use AC anymore.

### "Very disappointed"
We generally have preferred flying with Air Canada in the past but had just flown to and from Europe on Icelandair. We then flew home from Toronto to Vancouver on Air Canada. We were seated in an exit row just behind Premium Economy. By comparison with Icelandair, the cabin felt old, dark and smelled musty. The stewards seemed unorganized, did not say anything to us about the exit row protocol and took up to half hour to respond to the call button. The snacks were dry-as-sawdust pretzels, and the beer was warm. The headphone plugs did not work and the fold-up monitor would not rise up to be seen from my seat. It was only when comparing the flight and service to Icelandair did we realize how poorly Air Canada is performing. Very disappointed and will think twice about flying Air Canada in future.

### "no guarantee of reimbursement"
I would like to place a complaint for a flight delay of Air Canada YXJ to YVR and YVR to YZP. I had a flight June 28 supposed to be at 10:20am but the flight delayed from Fort St. John to Vancouver so i missed my connecting flight to Sandspit but the airline refused to give me any compensation for all the hassle because according to them it is not their fault, (air traffic) and the earliest fight they give me will be on June 30 and they refused to give hotel accommodation or even meal vouchers. They keep on offering to go to Terrace or Smithers which is way far away to my destination. They did told me to book a hotel and place a complaint for reimbursement but there is no guarantee of reimbursement. So i have no choice but to stay here in the airport the whole day and night to wait for another flight. The 2 supervisors didn’t explain whats going on and instead they just left me and the ground crew to explain everything. Even the manager didn’t care.

### "not eligible to receive compensation"
My flight on 6/20/2024 from Osaka to Dulles via Toronto, got delayed a few times then cancelled and I got stuck in Toronto for 1 day. I couldn't get hold any customer service by phone or in the airport to give me clear and detailed explanation. They finally rebooked me to different routes back to USA, delayed a few times again, changed gates a few times and final destination to Baltimore instead of VA, so I had to pay extra for uber to VA. In addition, 2 of 5 my checked baggage was lost. They replied to my claim that I am not eligible to receive any compensation because "This flight was delayed due to unforeseen maintenance that does not include scheduled maintenance or mechanical problems identified during scheduled maintenance. My first and last time fly with Air Canada.

### "never fly air Canada again"
Their system crashed May 23, we stood in line for 2 hr and the plane still left us because they couldn’t check our bags. We missed two days of hotel rooms we paid for in London, we paid to go to the airport and charged for extras bags, they took weeks to take the claims and then refused to reimburse our funds to all the things they made us miss. Their staff keeps hanging up the phones. I would never fly air Canada again. Then coming back to America they lost three of our bags..

### "weather as the cause for cancellation"
Air Canada cancelled my flight with less than 10 hours notice by text saying "due to weather". This cancellation caused me to miss all my connecting flights to a trip to Peru which cost me over $3000 to rebook on the day of all my missed flights. Cancellation due to weather was a lie as the communications line to Whitehorse had been severed and therefore, they cancelled the flight because they could not access their systems (can prove this with news stories). This was confirmed by Air Canada Employees at the airport when half of the plane showed up to check in at 3 AM. However, since they had used weather as the cause for cancellation they would not help me cover any of my rebooking costs as they say that they can't control the weather. What's even worse is that they are allowed to change the initial reason for cancelling the flight to something other than weather (like no access to their systems) but because the initial reasoning was weather, they can still avoid responsibility and doing the right thing. Air North was fantastic and was the only reason I was able to make it to Vancouver to rebook my entire trip. This is an awful company that has no compassion, empathy or decent corporate morals.

### “Terrible customer service”
Not Verified | Do NOT fly with Air Canada. They damaged my luggage, had mechanical problems, more than one plane was late, unprofessional flight staff, and gave us the worst flight experience of our lives, and we had business class seats! Food was terrible. I mean TERRIBLE! And they changed our business class seats after we chose them and booked without notice! After all of this, they wouldn't even compensate us with the minimum, a free upgrade to business class on our next flight. Terrible customer service.

### "how well I was treated"
I could not believe how well I was treated on this flight. There was a flight attendant named Tina who went out of her way to make me feel welcome and comfortable. I have had great service in first and business class over the years, but this was the first time a flight attendant treated me so well while I was in economy. It's a long flight from Singapore to Vancouver, and I feel very lucky that Tina was there. I don't know what Air Canada does to reward service above and beyond the call of duty, but I hope that Tina is appreciated.

### "pleasantly surprised with how helpful"
Not Verified |   We were pleasantly surprised with how helpful the Air Canada customer service desk was. We missed our flight due to a change in gates that we didn’t pay attention to, and with two young kids in tow we were almost in tears. Thankfully, the Air Canada customer rep was able to put us on the next flight, no questions asked. We are so thankful! While it’s true that AC has many delays/cancellations, relatively speaking they are still one of the most reliable airlines around.

### "always cancelling flights"
3 delays, left 2 hours and 15 mins late. Tried to bump me and a guest back 12 rows for a stand by. This is the 4th flight I have taken with Air Canada this week, the last 3 were in business class. My flight on Monday was cancelled at the last second and the replacement flight got myself and 7 guests into San Francisco 9 hours late. This airline is always late always cancelling flights. Absolutely horrible.

### "not partnered with your connection"
Due to flight cancelation (notified via phone 2 hours before boarding), we were placed on the next flight. No other airlines/flights were available. This caused us to miss a connecting flight. Our only way to get home was to reschedule connection flight to the next day ($350), get a hotel room for the night ($250), eat out for three more meals than planned ($$), and extend our car parking at our destination ($50). The only thing we got from them was "well, we are not partnered with your connection

### "can't meet normal expectations"
I recently paid $5700 for a flight which was business class outbound and only premium economy return YVR-HKG. On the business portion from YVR-HKG the entertainment system and screen malfunctioned including constantly turning on in a dark cabin while most were trying to sleep. I book business class for 3 reasons, comfort of seat, entertainment value, and meal/in-flight service. When one of these 3 services is not provided then I am no longer satisfied with the fees I paid for this class of travel. The Head-purser tried to reset a number of times then 2 flight attendants spent all kinds of time taping 2 cushions to the screen. My return flight in Premium was no better. Although I had paid $5700 for my flight and the passenger next to me $6000 for his round-trip YVR-HKG in Premium both of us were informed early on we wouldn't have a choice of meals as the Vegetarian was the only option left. While I have experienced this same problem a few years back on Air Canada I really can't believe this airline can't put enough meals on board to offer the selection they advertise. Unlike business, there was no option days before to select the meal you want and alleviate this entire issue. They absolutely treat this class (Premium) like standard economy although they now charge a multiplier of 3-3.5 times the standard economy cost. Wake up Air Canada! In the end I was offered $150 credit for my troubles and after going back to them again and again they have refused to show more compassion. With the offer of a $150 coupon they are basically suggesting I would have paid for this business class travel @ a price of $5700 with an offer of "minus $150" but no entertainment service. Would anyone book that class of travel if they were told of this full ticket price minus $150 because you will not be providing any entertainment? In addition to the absence of entertainment my comfort was significantly disrupted because of a screen turning on frequently with full brightness in a darkened (resting) cabin. Think about other airlines who care if they can't meet normal expectations when you consider your next Booking!

### “long, long way on a single aisle aircraft”
Not Verified | Regarding this airline's choice of aircraft - the Vancouver to Honolulu route is serviced by 737 Max aircraft. TAKE ANOTHER AIRLINE. 5 1/2 hours, single aisle, with 2, COUNT THEM, two toilets at the back. FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE. The other 20 people get to use the 1 toilet at the front. The crew will stop you from using it, if you are in economy. Just TRY getting to one when the cabin crew are serving snacks. Then later, drinks. Then a meal. If you are desperate, YOU ARE TRAPPED. It is a long, long way on a single aisle aircraft. WRONG TYPE for this route. Never again,

### "no compensation for the inconvenience"
I flew with Air Canada on 27 of May this year. I waited at the airport for 6 hours for a connecting flight to Montreal, which is approximately a 30-minute flight from Quebec airport. The flight did not leave from Quebec due to construction at the landing strip at the airport in Montreal, that is what the airline informed us in Quebec City. It seems as if they delay flights until they are fully booked, regardless of the scheduled departure time, and Air Canada offer no compensation for the inconvenience. After finally leaving Quebec and landing in Montreal I was informed there will be no other flight to Miami until the next morning due to weather. No accommodations were provided; I was told to find and pay for my own lodging. And just to add a fun fact I paid 332.01 for one night to Holliday Inn that was near by the airport to take advantage of the free shuttle because transportation was not offer either. This is utterly disrespectful. In addition to refusing to refund my expenses for the night, I discovered the next morning at the airport a couple from the same flight and same economy class received accommodations and meal vouchers from the airline. It's perplexing why some passengers receive preferential treatment. Hard to believe when the tickets are high priced and not even a direct flight. I advise against flying with Air Canada unless you have surplus time and money.

### "charged me a second time for the pet"
I booked with air Canada for the purposes of an international move to the UK. I chose to fly into France because it was the only way I could fly with my dog in the cabin with me. I called and upgraded my ticket from economy to business so he would have more room. I bought a carrier that his head touches when he is standing but he is capable of turning around in. When I upgraded my ticket, I paid for pet in cabin, $100. Air Canada texted me when I was on my way to the airport to let me know my flight had been cancelled and they would update me in 30 mins. 30 mins comes and goes and no update so I call customer service who tells me they’ve rebooked me on the same flight for the same time just a different plane. And they didn't tell me. I would have missed my flight if I hadn’t called. I got to Vancouver at 6 am and spent the next 50 mins attempting to check in. The employee was not going to check me in because I did not have a return ticket from France. I showed him evidence of intent to leave the country in the form of a eurotunnel check in and hotel stay. He would not accept it and asked his coworker for help. Coworker confirmed it would be okay. He still called for a supervisor. Supervisor confirmed it was okay. He still fought me on it because the eurotunnel check in has a return itinerary and even though I explained three times that I was flying and my husband was driving from England to pick me up and we would be returning in the eurotunnel together which he booked with a return trip because he was coming from the UK. Then he made a big deal about the fact that I didn’t have 120 in euros, despite having a bank account with money in it, which his supervisor approved. So then he takes my bags and I’m like do I have to pick them up and recheck them or go through additional security? And at first he was like no, when he thought I had a large case and a carry on. He asked if the large case was my only checked bag and I said no, I have a pet in cabin so I have to check my carry on as well. He was like you have a pet in cabin? I said Yes, it should be a part of my booking. He said Okay I need to look at him. He comes around the counter and looks at my pet in the closed carrier, Asks me to open it. Tobes is laying there and not getting up. The guy is like “I need to call a supervisor.” So he calls the supervisor again. Tells her my dog can’t stand up and turn around, which he doesn’t know because the dog didn’t stand up for him. She asks to see my pet, she gets him out, tells me he’s too big but makes an exception because he’s terrified and jumping into the carrier again. Then the guy tells me that because I have a pet in cabin, I will need to collect my checked bags and go through security again. I’m like wait what? Why? He doesn’t explain, just says that’s the policy. Doesn’t make sense. Later he tells me that I don’t have to do that. Then he bills me another $100 for pet in cabin when I already paid it. I was like if that is the only thing standing between me getting on the plane with the dog, I will pay it again but I’m leaving a horrible review because I’ve been here trying to check in for 50 minutes. He was like if you paid it would say you paid. I’m like it’s a part of my booking, how did I not pay if I booked it? I did not get mad or lose my temper the whole time until he charged me a second time for the pet in cabin. Then, I get through security and get settled at the gate. Delayed boarding one hour making me miss connection.

### "Avoid at all costs"
The worst customer experience team. It’s almost like they train their staff to treat you with contempt and a lack of empathy. Avoid at all costs.

### "let down by the service"
Did this flight last July, and was really let down by the service. The flight crew didn't pay much attention to simple requests from other passengers in my seating area. We had an unexplained delay of about 2 hours flying out of Dallas, and ended up arriving in Toronto airport after 1 am in the morning. IFE and food/drinks on board were barely passable. Do not recommend.

### "Service was average"
Flew this route last year. Service was average and the food options were just ok at best. There was some delays at Toronto airport before boarding. The crew for Air Canada weren't really helpful on the flight and quite non-attentive to simple requests. Didn't have much options for airline choice, as for this particular day, it was either Air Canada or United. Only recommend using Air Canada if there's no other options, or if you can get a discount.

### "The service was terrible"
I purchased a Premium Economy ticket and was very disappointed. The service was terrible without a smile. There were no dedicated toilets and the ones we had to use from Econom) were filthy. My food was terrible, no vegetarian options for the main meal. For breakfast there was no eggs or fruit, just yogurt and a wrapped cake. There was no leg room, even though we booked the first row. The blinds were not closed during sleeping so whenever someone opened them, it woke everyone up. There was almost no service and nothing different than the Economy class. When we arrived, no one said "good bye". The crew were just talking among themselves ignoring us.

### "Flight was late by nearly 2 hours"
Flight was late by nearly 2 hours. The attendant spent an hour asking passengers near the gate to check their carry-on bags since there wasn't enough space, and threatening that if we didn't have enough volunteers all passengers would need to check their bags, "no exceptions". How is that the fault of passengers that you don't have enough space? When it was time to board at the gate, the attendant called everyone in a disorganized fashion, and not acknowledging the fact that the gate next to them had just called passengers too. It resulted in a big bottleneck, and nobody could reach the gate because it was so crowded. We almost didn't make it on the flight. Big mess.

### "Awful experience overall"
Faulty website and terrible customer service. I bought an additional checked bag online. However, that information was not available in the airport system and the agent told me “no you have not paid for it.” After I showed them the email receipt, they had to manually add it, and as I only had an email receipt and not a paper receipt, I had to keep unlocking my phone for the agent to manually add it. Which caused further delays during the check in process. The agent also had a very rude attitude towards me. During check in, when I have trouble lifting such a heavy bag, there is usually always an agent there to help with it. However, when I was having trouble lifting the 50 lbs bag and asked if anyone can give me a hand, the agent mentioned, “no our insurance doesn’t cover it.” I also reserved an aisle seat during the online check in process. However, my boarding pass had a window seat. Customers should not be offered a service that cannot be provided. The website mentioned inflight WiFi but no WiFi was provided. The seat had very little leg room and I’m only 5’1”. Awful experience overall.

### "worst long haul flight"
The worst long haul flight I've ever taken. Started with Air Canada not updating about delays in Toronto due to the food service strike. They waited until the flight was supposed to take off then said it would be a 30 minute delay. Every 30 minutes they repeated the process until we boarded 3 hours late. While other airlines were automatically issuing food vouchers to waiting passengers, Air Canada told everyone on the intercom to "go buy your own food" then delayed us for 3 hours anyway! On the plane, the flight attendant was scoffing at me for wanting something simple like water or to switch a seat because there were many empty rows.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Not Verified |   I recently flew with Air Canada and experienced very comfortable seats, nice movie choices, pleasant landing in both Delhi and Montreal airport. First leg did not have wifi, nice value for money, food was delicious, the aircraft was clean and properly maintained. We will definitely fly with them again.

### “terrible service from Air Canada”
Me and my sister had a flight on 4th April from Toronto to Kuala Lumpur (KL) where we have 2 stopovers, one at Montreal and another at Dubai. The flights to Montreal were delayed at first and then cancelled due to a snow storm in Montreal. So we requested if they can rebook from Toronto to Dubai since flights to Montreal are all cancelled and even if we make it to Montreal not sure if we can able to get a flight from there to Dubai. We waited at the service counter for almost 2 hours since the flight from Dubai is under Emirates and they need some time to check something. They rebooked a different ticket saying that the other ticket from Dubai to KL is still valid. So, we flew to Dubai and had to book a last min hotel since we were going to be there for 12 hours. We checked in 4 baggages and out of 4 we managed to get 3 baggages saying one has already transited to Dubai. When we were trying to check in the luggage, we were told can't check in till we get the other 1 baggage. I literally had to go up and down and finally one of the guy told the other staff that they just have to untag it and give a new tag. The airline staff system knowledge are very bad and seems like only a few staff know what they're doing and others have zero knowledge. Later, we were not able to board our next flight from Dubai to KL (we were already at the gate entrance to get into the plane) because our ticket says that the ticket is cancelled. Apparently, the staff who did the rebooking didn't update the system and even Emirates can't help us since AirCanada made the changes. We called the AirCanada customer service and after an hour we managed to get another flight. So, we had to wait for 10 hours at Dubai airport for the mistake that they had done. We wasted around 15 hours due to this hassle. I can understand if the flight was cancelled due to a cause of nature but it's the staff's work ethics and efficiency is what I can't accept at all. Also, there's no compensation given due to this. A terrible service from Air Canada.

### "refuses to move my flight"
I need to push back my return trip by 2 days and the airline refuses to move my flight, not even for a fee. I get that I have the restricted Economy Basic fare but I offered to pay for the upgrade to the more expensive ticket. Customer service was poor and rude to me. Told me "if I was you and booked expensive flights I would read the Terms and Conditions better".

### "have been in airports for 15 hours"
Not Verified |  Had an 8 o'clock direct flight from Miami to Montreal. The flight was first delayed by 8 hours then cancelled completely. They switched us for a flight with a layover in Toronto. From then on they gave us vouchers for food at Miami, but no restaurants would accept them because Air Canada was not paying the restaurants afterward. The flight from Miami to Toronto was on time, but the flight from Toronto to Montreal was delayed. I'm currently writing this review while waiting for my plane. I have been in airports for 15 hours for a 3.5 hour direct flight I paid.

### "charging hefty airline fees"
Worst airline for charging hefty airline fees. I was charged $150 CAD each for my family of 4 for the cancellation which is probably higher than the fare of the total ticket price. The airline is not customer friendly in terms of fees.

### “Do not recommend”
Worst experience. I was boarding with a 35 L bag for a backpacking trip, and after getting it into the carry on check, they insisted it needed to easily move in and out. Will never be travelling Air Canada again, they don’t appreciate the backpacking spirits, especially when I made an effort to get my bag so small. Do not recommend.

### "no pillow or blanket"
Unfriendly cabin crew. Sandwich old and not edible. Calls for the stewardess were ignored for over 30 minutes. There was no pillow or blanket. Headphones, beer or wine cost extra. Entertainment only ran after a total system restart after almost 2 hours. The positive thing was that the flight was on time. Unfreundliche Kabinencrew. Sandwich alt und nicht genießbar. Ruf nach der Stewardess wurde über 30 min ignoriert. Beim gab es kein Kissen oder Decke. Kopfhörer Biwr oder Wein kosten extra. Entertainment lief erst nach einem totalen System Neustart nach fast 2 Stunden. Positiv war das der Flug pünktlich war.

### "problems of hopeless support"
I bought six business class Air Canada tickets from Washington to Nairobi rtn for a family trip through Expedia. Air Canada provided the first leg but was responsible for the entire itinerary because the tickets were on their paper. Our flights from Toronto to Nairobi and return were on Lufthansa. The night before our departure from DC, AC advised that it had cancelled our initial flights. It was astoundingly difficult to reach the AC help desk and I was kept on hold or talking from 10pm to 4am. Finally, I had my party rerouted, with me now on United to Toronto and my wife on AC. When I went to the United counter, it turned out that the AC agent had messed up the booking. United required me to get AC to fix it, which took a long time. When we arrived in Nairobi I noticed that our return flights no longer showed in the Lufthansa system. AC had screwed up our booking by adding new flights, rather than changing our outbound flights, so Lufthansa treated us as no-shows on the outbound and, as is standard practice, cancelled our return flights. Another 12 hours listening to the AC dialtone and dealing with hopeless AC agents, trying to blame Lufthansa for their mistakes, ensued. Eventually, AC was able to unscramble the mess they'd created and got Lufthansa to honor our return tickets. I waited to do this review hoping that AC might improve, but I can see from other reviews that the problems of hopeless support remain. Buy a ticket on AC at your own risk and only when prepared to spend all night trying to get AC staff to fix the problems they've carelessly created.

### "no-refund of any kind"
Air Canada cancelled our flight in the middle of the night just hours prior to leaving. We were scheduled to have a direct flight to Ottawa from Vancouver and they changed it to a stopover in Toronto 2 days later! After being on hold to customer service for 2 hours I spoke to an agent who was trying to reroute for the Monday, the day we were to return but could only get us home by going to Toronto first. As she worked on the flights we were disconnected, another hour on hold to get a snotty agent who wanted anything but to help. after an hour of attitude she got us through Toronto but delayed and had to spend the night. Heading to Ottawa the following day, now 36 hours after the original scheduled landing. Air Canada refused to pay for the hotel in Toronto, the extra meals, parking. Basically saying it wasn't their fault their plane was unsafe to fly. Just the month before we paid for 4 flights to get to Estonia and back. Paying extra for seat with more leg room. What we got was bulkhead which I expected but they put a baby crib in front of our seats and we couldn't even raise our monitors to watch a movie. Just a kid crying for 8 hours. The next flight our seats were bumped to regular not extra leg room, The third flight the same. Coming home from Frankfurt the bulkhead seat I actually paid for was only half a seat due to the design of the plane. Again no-refund of any kind. What does this airline refund for? We are trying to support a major industry in Canada and giving them support but none is given in return.

### "lack of customer service assistance"
Not Verified | The flight from Narita Tokyo to Vancouver was OK, left on time, arrived on time. The problem started for the connecting flight: Vancouver to Portland). Months ago, Air Canada booked my connecting flight out of Vancouver late afternoon, although there was an earlier one. I could have saved 3 hours (and make my connection! ), not sure why they decided to keep me waiting at YVR for over 5 hours coming from Japan. The plane to Portland arrived late, the departure time was pushed 40 minutes, we boarded, the plane went on the tarmack, there we waited 30 minutes, then back to the gate. There was a mechanical problem. After another 20 minutes, it was decided the flight was cancelled. This is where customer service should have kicked in. The flight attendant said we had to leave the plane. No mention of connecting flights, no agents from AC were assigned to help us; there was ZERO help or assistance to help us book a new flight. We walked for miles, crossed the long airport, picked our luggage, went through immigration and customs, looked for the right Air Canada counter, then waited in line for more than one hour; of course they had a few agents totally overwhelmed with the flow of passengers. The only pm flight to Portland was sold out, we spent the night in VC and delayed 24 hrs our arrival. I lost my hotel reservation in Portland. I dont blame AC for cancelling the flight, for security reasons. But they showed a total lack of customer service assistance to book the replacement flight. They did not bring a replacement plane, we had to search on our own for hours, how to get to our destination.

### "Service and food were the most negative"
First airline review I've ever written. It was that bad. Service and food were the most negative parts. Not only were their minimal vegetarian options available, I got attitude when asked. Can only book food options when buying the ticket, they don't let you do that during online check in. This ticket was bought for me by someone else, so that was an issue. No problems with the airplanes, smooth rides. In flight entertainment was fine, although the complimentary earbuds were lower quality than most. Will happily pay more next time to fly on another airline.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified | Very disappointed. If possible I will avoid flying with Air Canada in the future. I was supposed to fly from Calgary to Amsterdam with a layover in Toronto. On the day of departure I was informed that my flight was delayed with an hour. A few hours later I was informed that my first flight would be delayed 3 hours which would cause me to miss my connection in Toronto. After calling (over an hour waiting to talk to an agent) I was offered a flight over London Heathrow which would stretch my 11 hour trip to a 20 hour trip. Then that flight got cancelled as well and another flight was offered which would mean I would leave 4 hours later than planned and make the trip over 25 hours. I turned that down. That day, I spent over 3 hours on the phone talking to agents or waiting my turn. This trip was planned months ahead of time. I missed my mothers 75 birthday, had taken days off for this trip, had to plan work ahead for the time I would be absent. When I requested compensation, an agent directed me to the website. When I entered my flight information the system didn't recognize my flight information and I was redirected time and again.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified | A flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. I was never contacted or rebooked on a new flight, I had to do this myself and it took over an hour and a half. Additionally, there were limited options to depart and all departures added over 24 hours to my travel, with travel to a new location that required a hotel night stay, transportation, and meals. We also purchased upgraded seats. They emailed back and offered no refund for anything. I would not recommend this airline.

### "distraught and frustrated traveller"
I'm currently on a cruise vacation in South America where I flew from Toronto YYZ to Buenos Aires on Mar 4. I did self baggage drop at YYZ and received an email from Air Canada confirming receipt. I noticed there was a technical problem at the self drop counters 30 mins after my luggage was dropped. Didn't think that affected me but I was shocked to receive a text msg upon arrival that my bag was delayed in YYZ. There were at least another 14 passengers like me. So I filed the incident at EZE and got a ticket. They said my bag would arrive on Mar 6 but I told them my cruise was leaving Buenos Aires on Mar 5 evening and need it delivered to the cruise port before that. The crew said there's no flight between YYZ and EZE on Mar 5 which I find unbelievable. Needless to say that didn't happen and I left with the cruise ship baggage less. My next port is Montevideo  which is very close to Buenos Aires and I would be there on Mar 6 until 6 pm. I heard nothing from Air Canada and had to email and call them several times until I finally received an email saying they will reroute my bag to Ushuaia which is the port of call on Mar 12. That is 8 days late and I'm already 60% into my cruise. Moreover I do not have any toiletries or undergarments plus no winter clothing. Where I started it's 28C and once past Mar 9 the temp will drop to 10C or lower as the ship sails southbound towards Antarctica. I am also booked on 2 excursions for penguins and wildlife sightings before Mar 12 that require hiking boots and water repellent jackets, both in my checked bag. Getting money compensation was not only insufficient to cover all these items, but impossible to find them in Buenos Aires or Montevideo within the 5-6 hrs I have onshore. Air Canada responded that they can ship my bag to an airport that is an hour away from my next port Puerto Madryn and ask me to find out if Princess can go pick it up. Isn't Air Canada's responsible to ensure the delayed bag is shipped to where I am within a reasonable time? From Mar 4 to Mar 8 is already not a reasonable time. Princess has been very helpful letting me use their front desk phone to make international calls to Air Canada and also agrees to go pick up my luggage if it can be shipped to a closer airport than the one suggested. Last I know my bag was scanned at Sao Paulo Brazil airport. No idea why it's there and the thought of losing my bag with all belongings is haunting me. I am not sure how I would continue my cruise and this has ruined an otherwise experience of a lifetime. Air Can has handled this so poorly. A very distraught and frustrated traveller.

### "PayPal charged me twice"
Not Verified |  I originally paid for this flight Brisbane to Vancouver, Toronto - Vancouver - Brisbane, costing $3182.38. The first time I booked the transaction said that it was unsuccessful so I did it again. PayPal charged me twice. Then I contacted PayPal and Air Canada and was refunded one of the booking. Then two weeks later Air Canada refunded the other booking and I was left without any flights. I went to book only to find that the payment would be $3500+. I contacted Air Canada and was given a discount code to use, could not use the discount code on multi city flights so change my plans to fly Brisbane to Vancouver, Vancouver to Brisbane. Using this discount code was $2800 dollars. if I add the flight from Toronto it is another $800 adding up to $3600. this is $500 more than the original flight What a rip off

### “the best flight experience”
Not Verified | Boarding and taxi went fast. Takeoff was smooth. The seats were really comfortable and had inflight entertainment. The bathroom was clean. By the way, when you enter the bathroom you need to lock the door for the light to turn on. Flight was smooth and the landing was butter. This was the best flight experience I've ever had!

### “The situation was a complete nightmare”
Air Canada is the worst airlines I've ever flown or attempted to fly. The customer service is the worst I've ever experienced regardless of the type of business. Had a problem with on-line check-in due to ETA form. Advised by phone Customer Service that check-in desk at airport would take care the problem. Customer Service Representatives (CSR) at airport check-in desk said they could not help. After much pleading for a solution a website for ETA form was given. Completed ETA form. CSR then said my son and me could not fly because the check-In was now closed. They actually closed the desk, without warning, while I was filling out a form! We were not allow to fly. No ability to speak with a supervisor at airport. No local number to contact Customer Service. My ticket was non refundable/re-scheduleable. The situation was a complete nightmare! All customer service is via Montreal, Canada! Average wait time on hold for customer service was 45 minutes. No Supervisor or Manager to speak with on phone. Scripted replies from CSR on phone.

### “wonderful service all the way through”
Not Verified |  I flew with Air Canada last year in October and experienced wonderful service all the way through. Crew was very friendly in explaining the rules onboard for when you have have a pet in cabin. Entertainment system was wonderful as well as wifi and value for money was great too and seat legroom and comfort was wonderful. will defiantly fly with them again!

### “Worst airline experience”
Not Verified |  Worst airline experience I have had in a long time. They loaded the aircraft despite it having known maintenance issues when it arrived on the gate in Calgary. We sat on the aircraft on the tarmac for 2hrs (on what was supposed to be a 1.5hr flight) as the completion ETA was pushed back further and further.

### "not served hot food"
An awful trip on Air Canada in December. Business class was not served hot food or drinks, but a choice of limited snacks - chips, chocolate bars, and candies, instead of hot sandwiches, salads, or something more substantial. The Air Canada lounge in Edmonton was a huge disappointment, with no hot food options, only cold and fairly tasteless wraps. The seat in business class was not a lie flat seat on this 1 hr 50 mins flight. I waited a long time in Vancouver for checked baggage, even though I was travelling in a premium cabin. I expected much better.

### "just rude and unhelpful"
Not Verified | My flight was from Bangkok to Toronto. Air Canada did not come out with the meals until about 60-40 mins before landing. The staff provided the meal fine but came by and threw out the whole meal after I had only managed to get the fruit down. They then came over and verbally attacked me for complaining about it. After the flight landed I had 30 mins before my connecting flight started to board. As this was going from an international flight to a domestic flight I have to collect my baggage (which didn't come out until the other fight was already boarding) go out through customs, recheck my bags, and clear security again before I could head to the gate. I literally had to run through the whole airport to make my connecting flight. I asked for help from the Air Canada desk and they were just rude and unhelpful. My layover was in Vancouver. On landing in Toronto I had yet to be fed anything other than the couple pieces of fruit from the lunch they threw out. I had spent more than a day in the air.

### “reliability has become horrendous”
Not Verified |  If you value your peace of mind, time and money do not fly with Air Canada. It seems over the past year, Air Canada's reliability has become horrendous. My partner landed at PVG to connect to his final flight to TFU and well....They changed the connecting flight airport!! There was no one at the customer service counter at PVG. Luckily I am still at home in Vancouver and after multiple calls to Air Canada I was able to get my partner rebooked onto another flight to his final destination. It seems Air Canada knew of a mistake as luggage was able to be picked up while my partner was told that the luggage would go to the final destination. Just a horrible experience. Additionally, Air Canada cancelled a trip of mine in June of 2023 hours before our departure. These absurd things seem to be commonplace with Air Canada these days an no matter what garbage their CEO spits out, I won't buy it.

### "somewhat disappointed in the IFE"
Air Canada provides a decent service in this class. Seating is pod-style which gives one a fair amount of privacy. Seats convert into flat beds. The only problem is that feet are somewhat cramped for taller passengers. Food is better than average and good selection of beverages is offered. Flight left and arrived on time. FAs were attentive and friendly. I was somewhat disappointed in the IFE as I recall that AC used to have more foreign films on their overseas flights. Movie offering consisted of standard Hollywood fare, some of which is quite poor.

### "medical assistance was very well provided"
My wife and I found an amazing and attentive flight crew. I am writing because I had medical assistance. Your medical assistance was very well provided. I need to comment on the amazing young lady who helped me. Her name is Laurie. She was fully committed to getting me to my destination. I have taken other airlines and was very disappointed with their attention. Thank you very much for your attention. Laurie made our final destination very memorable that we had to tell you about it.

### “Absolutely avoid Air Canada”
Not Verified | Absolutely avoid Air Canada. I am writing this on behalf of my family who has been waiting for their delayed flight to take off. There flight is delayed by at least 4 hours twice (still waiting to see if they delay a third time). They have a connection in Narita that they will miss because of the delay. Air Canada only has flights available before 6pm from Narita and they will land after this time so they will have to stay the night (nothing has been addressed about any of this yet, Air Canada only said they cannot do anything about it from their end in Toronto). They paid for extra legroom and space for their original flight as my sister is nearing her third trimester in pregnancy and my parents have health problems and are over 60. Their new seats are now at the very back of the plane, no extra space which they paid a lot extra for. So now not only will they lose out on travel time, but they will also lose on money and what they have booked for the following day of their trip (accommodation and tours) as they will not be there in time and it is too close to the time to allow them to get a reimbursement. I have many words for Air Canada but none of them are appropriate for this review. When my sister tries to reach out to try to sort things they are unresponsive.

### “shocked by the main meal service”
I was shocked by the main meal (dinner) service in Premium Economy. There were only two choices and both were Indian cuisine. Those two choices were butter chicken (non-veg) and a vegetarian option of rice and lentils with some sort of vegetable curry. For a Premium Economy cabin with 24 pax, only four non-veg meals were loaded. Seriously? Even though these flights to/from DEL and BOM are mostly full of people of Indian origin, not everyone is Indian and wants to have NO CHOICE but to eat Indian food. Would it be too much to have a Western option of, say, lamb or chicken. Ridiculous. The dinner service was rushed and my meal was basically thrown at me. Implements were made of wood and same as what is served in regular economy. Drinks were served in paper cups. Overall, a cheap product. I didn’t find the seat comfortable and got no sleep at all on the 16-hour flight. Prior to departure from Delhi, it was obviously that we would miss our connection in Toronto due to late departure from Delhi. The agent at check-in wanted me to check my bags onto my original connecting flight to DCA. I refused and asked that he confirm me on a later flight to IAD and that my bag be tagged accordingly (otherwise I could pretty much guarantee that my bags would end up mis-connecting and I'd have to wait 24 hours for them to be delivered by courier to my home in the DC area). After much back-and-forth and with the help of the DEL Station Manager, I was protected on a later UA-operated flight, code share with AC, to IAD and my bags tagged accordingly. However, upon boarding in YYZ for the IAD flight, I learned that AC in Delhi had not sent UA my ticket number and we were denied boarding. I had to dash to the AC customer service desk (which, fortunately, was beside our gate), but it was swamped with people. I approached the agent at the side of her desk and she was pretty snippy with me. I then found the ticket number in my emails and ran back to the gate to give it to the gate agent. The doors had already closed, but we were able to board and our bags arrived in IAD with us. But just a lot unnecessary stress due to sloppy work by AC in DEL.

### “Amazing entertainment”
Not Verified | Didn’t get delayed, nice crew, they gave us kits, pillows and blankets. Amazing entertainment and food, comfy seat, nice features and very easy to sleep.

### "Worst service ever"
Flight delay for 12 hours (had to leave in the evening, changed to next morning), and Air Canada didn't bother to provide food and place to sleep. They said, that it's not their fault, it's because "This flight was cancelled due to crew constraints. For example, crew have a ‘duty day’ limit which means they work a maximum number of hours and one explanation could be that they reached". So, it's my fault, that's why I had to pay for hotel and food for me and my kids. Worst service ever.

### "flight was closed 8 minutes before"
Not Verified |  Despite arriving at the airport more than 1.5 hours before our flight and already checked in, but being stuck at the automated baggage-drop machine that did not work, we were told by a very rude agent at the desk that the flight was closed 8 minutes before - when we were stuck at the machine. We lost 2 tickets and checked bags and had to purchase 2 new tickets with 2 checked bags. The agent also provided inaccurate details on other flights out later that day, we had to look online ourselves and ended up finding a new flight way earlier than the one suggested by the rude agent. In short, very unfriendly and unprofessional staff.

### "severely deteriorated in recent years"
Not Verified | I have been travelling AC business class for many years and used to love the service. Unfortunately, it has severely deteriorated in recent years despite excessive price hikes. I found the service comparable to economy now. I had delayed flight but the business class agent was not helpful to find an alternate connecting flight; I was told to use the phone to seek help. The lounge access has become a disgusting experience requiring waits in the long queues. I find that business travel with AC is not worth the money. I had most pleasant experience with Qatar in my recent travel. I am contemplating on making a switch although I would like to support my national airline.

### "Had nice seats all the way"
Not Verified |  A nice flight with two stops Toronto and Vancouver. Had nice seats all the way. Food was good for airline food. Entertainment system also good for long flights.

### Air Canada customer review
Since it was my first Air Canada flight, I did not expect to be so professional and classy. Flight attendants were friendly and professional. Their inflight entertainment system was really crisp and had good choice of movies. Like some airlines, they had buy on board option for food. However, it was complimentary in premium economy. The only downside of Air Canada, is that for the IFE, passengers had to purchase headsets, which needs to be looked at. The inflight wifi was also not working, so they need to look at that.

### "kindness and willingness to help"
Not Verified |  After our cruise that ported in Miami, the flight back to Toronto with my family (me, my husband, 3 kids + mom and dad) was supposed to be at 9:00pm. We got to Miami Airport at around 9:30am. As you can already tell, this would've been a crazy long wait, especially with 3 young kids. We looked for things to do, and places to eat as to not get bored. Around 10:30am, my husband asked an Air Canada employee where the Air Canada lounge is so we can kill time as we wait for our flight. As my husband was walking away, another employee told us that there are 4 seats available on the 11:30am flight. We then asked my mom and dad if they would like the earlier flight so they do not need to wait for 8+ hours. As we ready their luggages, the staff looked for us to inform us that there were cancellations and we could now all be accommodated. He then worked his magic to make sure we are all seated together. It may be just another day of work for him, but his kindness and willingness to help out shows us that he loves his job.

### "I had an excellent trip"
I had an excellent trip with Air Canada on this flight. While there was initially quite a bit of confusion (as for some reason Aer Lingus - who flew the DUB-LHR first leg - wasn't able to see the Codeshare flight), when I called Air Canada the employee on the phone was extremely helpful. They were able to reissue my ticket so that Aer Lingus could see it, and the Air Canada and Aer Lingus employees directly spoke to each other to ensure I was able to get onto the flight as planned. Boarding in LHR was very efficient and was done on time, and the service in the air during the LHR-YYC flight was absolutely excellent. The flight crew was attentive, pleasant, and very caring. The food quality was excellent, and service was very timely. The Business Class seats on the 787-9 were clean, and the in-flight entertainment system was phenomenal (with a very large and highly responsive touch screen). Unfortunately due to the confusion regarding my first leg with Aer Lingus, it appears my bags did not get checked all the way to YYC and instead were sent to the carousel in LHR. When I arrived at YYC and spoke with Air Canada staff there, they were able to immediately let me know where my bags were, and they were delivered to my house the next evening. If it had not been for this baggage issue I would have rated it a 10/10. However, I must commend all of the Air Canada staff who I dealt with throughout this journey, as they were all extremely kind and helpful. I am uncertain as to whether the baggage/flight booking issue was related to Aer Lingus or Air Canada, but that would be the only area for improvement from my perspective.

### “flight attendants were friendly”
Not Verified | Both this trip home and my trip to Mexico were excellent. The flights left on-time and arrived early. The seat was comfortable and I really enjoyed the IFE. It made the flight pass by very quickly. All the flight attendants were friendly. The meal and beverages were tasty and our flight attendant was with us many times to ensure all was going well and whether we needed something. My only suggestion is the Air Canada provide wifi on their 737's. It was an excellent conclusion to a memorable conclusion and look forward to flying with Air Canada again...thank you! !

### “did not like my experience”
I checked in online via app and selected window seat but when I got to the airport and dropped my checked in luggage the csr changed my seat to aisle seat! And to the worst seat on the aircraft 12C. She didnt asked me if I wanted to change seats or if I wanted window or aisle she suddenly gave me a new boarding pass. I am aware the I was put on an emergency exit and fit enough to handle those exits door. I did not like my experience.

### "flight staff was great"
The flight staff was great to my destination, there and back, and made the flight enjoyable. Diet cokes and food was great, and good movies. I would consider flying again.

### "the flight was delayed 6.5 hours"
We had a not very good experience. At the beginning when my husband booked the flight using website the system ask by a middle name, if you do not have any then, the system put something automatically. We try to fix this for many ways (client service, emails, etc.) and we never get the answer. So at the moment to make the check in we have to call again to customer service and ask to make de correction in my name, this take a while. But the worse was the flight was delayed 6.5 hours. We received the notification of this the night before. Because I was travelling with my 3 kids this was very inconvenient for us. We had already booked a taxi to move the luggage to Monterrey airport also we had made arrangement to move the kids in other vehicle with a familiar. We had to change all this. As a consequence we landed very late that the original plan and left the airport at 1:00 am after passed immigration office, the kids was very tired and we had to change the booked taxi that we had booked in Toronto. On the other hand the flight attendants were very kind during the flight.

### “Talk about skimp-flation”
Not Verified | Air Canada biz class; pay more for less. Took early morning (boarding 0635h) flight 341 from Ottawa to Vancouver, one of the few non-stop direct options to avoid the passenger insanity of transiting Toronto Pearson airport. It was still dark in Ottawa but was there lighting inside the aircraft? No way! A dim little infill up at the ceiling above the luggage bins. Otherwise, you had to use your phone light to see if the floor was clear as you counted off the seats to find where your tushy was booked for the flight. Would it strain you to flip the ‘on’ light switch, Air Canada? This was my third seat assignment as Air Canada changed aircraft and I had to complain to Customer Service (aka ‘Support’) via the CEO to get back to a window seat. The included food choices were omelette or French toast. Cabin crew asked if I wanted bread with my toast. Huh? No maple syrup but a sweet red goop with diced apple chunks. Who chooses this stuff? Ya, I know, first world problem. Return Vancouver-Ottawa flight 342 left from gate C45 which for the mathematically challenged YVR management is after gate C46. Mid-morning departure with the usual ongoing announcements about a full flight, limited space, free hand luggage check (isn’t carry-on free to begin with? ), and then some little old lady handling out luggage stickers for carry-ons. No thanks. Had the omelette on the return flight. Took the bread. During this flight the primary cabin crew member disappeared for long periods of time “behind the curtain” and had trouble coordinating her duties. Air Canada has become the bottom feeder among the “charge more, provide less” carriers. Talk about ‘skimp-flation’. I can only hope they do not have the same attitude towards their aircraft mechanics.

### "Very hospitable service"
Very hospitable service. I was assigned a seat by the emergency exit row, so great extra legroom but sucks that I couldn't use the TV while taking off/landing. The wifi is okay and it helped me load my documents to finish some work on the plane. Price is valuable for the journey given the short and convenient layover

### "appreciated her services so much"
Not Verified |  Great services on AC801 from Dublin to Toronto November 8th 2023 . We were lucky to be on that flight! Crew member Isabelle made us so comfortable and our family appreciated her services so much. Isabelle was so professional, friendly and hospitable! She made Air Canada looks great. Thank you Isabelle, you are an example to follow. Also to mention how nice and welcoming was the pilot. That was a dream flight. Thank you again!

### “delayed and late all the time”
Not Verified |  They are delayed and late all the time. Very slow and under staffed maybe. They are not always the nicest either when they speak to you. More like custom officers than nice airline hosts. The constant delays, I understand for safety reasons but every time? How can that be possible. Seems more like other reasons for the sluggish performance. Other airlines I flown all over the world seem far more pleasant, quick and efficient 9/10 times. We also waited to board today after 3 delays. We were next to board and they said we were zone 4 not 3 and to go back of the line even though our connecting flight tickets had no zoned listed. So we thought it was 3 and the other line has zone 3 and 4 passing into zone 2. The person at the front basically tried to embarrass us and said that’s the rules. Back of the line. Then literally 1 second later, he said now boarding zone 4. So seemed a little rude to do that to us. His counterpart was kind enough to board us after and apologize for how he treated us which helped us at least laugh about it but I honestly think some serious training, or incentive or something is needed to make the staff nicer to work with. Pay the pilots or staff more. Air Canada has the potential to be the greatest but these constant delays and tough demeanours don’t help the image.

### "finally found my luggage"
I arrived in Halifax on Saturday night without my luggage because it 'didn't make the connection'. My colleague's did. Today (Friday) I received an email from FEDEX (not Air Canada) advising me they would deliver a package to me on Monday (my bag I assume)! So Air Canada finally found my luggage and instead of loading it onto the next available flight and getting it to me this evening, they have offloaded it to FEDEX, who will truck it here over the weekend. I've been 6 days without my clothes and (even though my luggage was located at 3:00pm on Friday), I now have to wait another three days. Air Canada say they'll repay 'reasonable expenses' for a delayed bag, but won't tell me what this is. So I've had to purchase new outfits every second day, with no guarantee my unnecessary spending will be refunded. Furthermore, do I throw my new clothes into the bin, when I fly back to Australia next Saturday? Because I'll now be over my baggage limit. I'm speechless.

### "never use this airline again"
Absolute worst experience. AC has mixed up my luggage on the incoming flights. Connecting flight to Houston were delayed by 3,5h due to maintenance issues. We’re requested to be borded every 45 minutes. Ground crew at the gate helpless without any information. AC had closed down their business lounge and we received 10 Dollar vouchers for compensation. Desk manager was completely useless as well. Will never use this airline again

### "very helpful and extremely hospitable"
Not Verified |  On Nov 1st 2023, I flew from Copenhagen to Toronto. I like to express my utmost gratitude to the team of flight attendants, Roberta, Mary, Joanne, and Grace for their wonderful job during that long flight. They were very helpful and extremely hospitable. Thank you to Air Canada for providing us with a supportive crew.

### "Extremely poor service"
Extremely poor service, very uncomfortable seat, no space for legs. Bread was very hard, like a brick. Staff were rude, one of the staff didn’t wear gloves and use hand to pick ice cube for the drinks. The worst experience ever.

### “Remarkably poor customer service”
Remarkably poor customer service..... Our initial flight was delayed out of Boston for a "safety" reason, what I have gathered is that this is what they tell you so that it can not be their fault. We landed in Montreal and when we got off the plane, were handed ticket changes to give us a 3 hour delay in Montreal, send us to Portugal and give us another layover there before heading to Milan (adding roughly 7 hours to our travel and making us miss everything we had planned and already paid for in Milan). We got to the gate of our initial flight on time and tried to get our seats, but they had been sold to someone else as we were removed from the flight. We waited for the new connection and got to Portugal. In Portugal we were told by Air Canada that we could not get on the flight as we did not have boarding passes and they could not give us boarding passes because we had not paid for our baggage. I showed them the receipts and was told that there was nothing they could do and they could not even open it up for us to pay a second time. The Air Canada people had me take all of our passports and go out through the exit, find the check in area for Air Canada and get help there since we were short on time as it took an hour just to get this far in trying to get our boarding passes. I ran the 20 minutes to get to check in only to be told that they could also not help me and it was not their problem so I needed to call Air Canada, they did not give me a number or anything just told me it was not their problem and that I needed to call and was pushed aside for the next person. I called the number I found online, only to be told that there was nothing they could do either. So here I am, stuck outside of security with no boarding passes to get back to my family and my family's passports. I was so frustrated that I cried. Finally some nice lady with a different airline helped me and took maybe 10 minutes to fix the issue and get me my boarding passes. By this time I had 40 minutes to get through security and to the gate. We made it, 0 thanks to Air Canada who was apparently content to leave us stranded in a country we shouldn't have been in to begin with as we made it to the gate of our initial connection to begin with. When I complained to Air Canada, explaining that we do not travel often (this was 4 years of saving) and just asked for the money back from what I had prepaid and missed, they told me that it was not their problem or responsibility but here is a $200 Air Canada voucher that you will never use. Their response to my rebuttal asking that they make this right and just refund me the roughly $500 in missed activities as they mishandled our flight from beginning to end, they told me "While I am sorry and understand your disappointment with our decision, our response is in line with the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. Although this may not be the answer you are looking for, I thank you for your understanding and appreciate this final opportunity to reply to your concerns. AKA it's okay for us to re-route you, make you miss everything you had planned, and not even bother to make sure you could get on the extra 7 hours of travel we put you on. Worst customer service.

### "my checked luggage’s are not there"
Terrible service. My transit was in Toronto and Fuel stop in London. I had two checked luggages and 1 dog in hold/excess baggage. First in Toronto, the airport staff for Air Canada was so rude as I just asked them if my dog is there in hold. Especially the supervisor was extremely arrogant and rude with his responses and did not provide any information. Upon arriving at London I got a message saying my both checked luggages are missing. I was so afraid that they left my dog back, I again reached with the ground staff in London who assured me my dog is there but both my checked luggage’s are not there. I reached Mumbai and the Air Canada ground staff told me that I don’t have to worry about anything and they will ship me both of my luggage’s within 3 days. They also provided me with a phone number to reach them back. After all this once everybody took their bags from the belt, they brought my dog out. They did not fill his food neither his water throughout the journey- which I expected that they may do it in Toronto (2 hrs stoppage) and London (3 hours stoppage). Yesterday on November 5th I received one of my backpack which I checked in and unfortunately my main 23kg suitcase did not arrive. I tried calling the number ground staff at Mumbai gave me but no answer, I called like 50 times but no answer. Im so upset with the service as the bag had very important and very valuable things in it. The upsetting thing is I got dog food for my dog for the initial 30 days and my dog couldn’t eat his food because of this error of losing my bag! I don’t have any clue where my bag is what is happening, even if I will get my bag or not, what about the amount of goods that were in the bag, who will reimburse! It’s very upsetting and I would request everyone to never take Air Canada. Very terrible service and very frustrating and very expensive experience. Air Canada ground staff in Mumbai is unreachable, they don’t answer their phone!

### "Value for money was excellent"
Not Verified |   I recently flew with Air Canada from LAX to YYZ and i experienced great service at both airports and in the flight. Very great features on the entertainment screen, no wifi but great legroom and seat comfort and crew nicely explained the rules for traveling with a pet, Value for money was excellent too. Wull definitely fly with them again!

### "will be avoiding this airline"
With less than 24 hours notice, AGAIN!!!! This airline has delayed my 1 hour flight by almost 3 hours. I am missing a very important medical appointment because of this which has been pre-booked months in advance and on top of that I will be charged for this because it's less than 24 hours notice! I booked this flight with additional 2 hours to spare upon my return but even that isn't enough! This is insanity and with zero action. There is no other flight that would get me home on time, and all I was offered was apologies! This is wasting my whole day now since I'm forced to sit and just wait like an idiot. I'm missing my medical appointment and my work isn't getting done because this airline simply can not do its job! I will be avoiding this airline from now on because this is the last drop! Not once in the past year has an Air Canada flight been on time, and I travel on almost weekly basis. It's always an excuse and never any action or responsibility! I really hope that this airline gets disbanded or just stops existing because it is a waste of money and time!! For the amount of money that I spent, it would be faster AND cheaper to drive! With none of the stress! I really hope this reaches someone who is actually capable of making some change to this company before it burns down to the ground with customer service like this. I will also be leaving the same review everywhere I can. Have a great day and I hope one day every single one of its employees gets treated the same way! Thank you for nothing, and a nervous breakdown! !

### “I don’t think they appreciate their customers”
Not Verified | Air Canada staff is generally very rude. I went to their Boarding gate and I was in transit at Frankfurt airport to request if I can be put on standby for an earlier flight which was to depart In 1hr (my connecting flight was in 5hrs), and she directed me to customer service counter, which was closed. I went back to the counter to tell her that it was closed and she said yes I know but that’s where you have to go. From my past experience at Frankfurt, and other airlines, I know it is possible for the staff to help out but this lady was just plain rude. I don’t think they appreciate their customers and also the fact on how happy it makes person travelling 24hrs if someone is just polite, forget even helping him which is by far too much to ask from Air Canada employees.

### "lackadaisical, inefficient"
Not Verified |  My bag was lost between Toronto and Seattle, it has been 30 days with no contact from Air Canada other than a case report I filed. The only # to call is a call center in Delhi, they only take your information, they have no info on what is being done to locate your belongings. Air Canada requires 45 days before they declare your bag lost. If anyone had this experience and knows how to go about contacting Air Canada I would appreciate any assistance, short of flying to Toronto to look myself. I have been to Seattle baggage department 3 times and they were not exceptionally helpful. The attitude shown by this airline is very lackadaisical, inefficient and very frustrating to the consumer. I join others in that i would avoid flying Air Canada anytime in the future.

### "a thoroughly miserable flight"
Not Verified |  Booked extra legroom seats several months before the flight. About a month before we had an email saying our seats had been changed, no explanation. I checked the seating plan and we had been merely moved to the other side of the cabin, so no problem. Two weeks before flying we find we are getting a refund due to being moved once again, this time one row forwards, which obviously were not extra legroom seats. The people in front of us were the sort who find it impossible to fly without fully reclining their seats. Our seats would not recline, presumably so as not to obstruct the escape route behind us. So, a thoroughly miserable flight, with no explanation from Air Canada as to why we had been moved.

### “should be avoided at all cost”
Not Verified | Our connecting flight in Montreal was delayed twice and a few hours later completely cancelled. We were given no explanations, no food vouchers, no hotel vouchers, left sleeping over night in airport floor, no more no less. Arrived at destination one day late, when applied for compensation as per Canadian law, one of us got compensated and two of us were told we were not being compensated because the event the cancelled the flight was not under the Air Canada control. We each paid separately for our tickets and travelled on same flight same airplane same destination! Does this make any sense to anyone? Absolutely a nightmare to reach airline by phone and after 1 1/2 hour on hold were told to apply online which we consequently did but, again, for two of us no compensation, nothing. Morons that should be avoided at all cost, no more no less!

### “the worst airline meal I have had”
One thing ruined this trip. The staff were great. The flight on time and seats comfortable. The entertainment was Canada centric perhaps forgivable. But the food was awful! Boiled chicken with boiled potatoes and tomato sauce none of which had any flavour or seasoning. It was inedible. This is the worst airline meal I have had in 40 years. Including the airline that don't have meals! After 5 hours I was starving and grumpy! If you fly Air Canada bring your own food By contrast we flew out with Norse not amazing but edible.

### "a complete disaster"
My experience with Air Canada was nothing short of a complete disaster. I wouldn't wish this airline on my worst enemy. To start, our departure was delayed by a mind-boggling two hours, and the reason? Apparently, the gate wasn't even available. So there we sat, like cattle, twiddling our thumbs, and wondering if this was some kind of cruel joke. But oh, the delays didn't stop there. No, they continued throughout the flight. It was as if Air Canada had a personal vendetta against punctuality. The flight attendants must have thought they were on vacation too, as they seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than addressing the frustrated passengers. I'd like to say that the in-flight experience made up for it, but that would be a lie. The seats were about as comfortable as a park bench, and the in-flight entertainment was laughable at best. It's safe to say that my next flight won't be booked with Air Canada. If you value your time and sanity, steer clear of this airline.

### "100% NOT on time and lost"
Travel from LAX to Barcelona and back, there were 4 legs on Air Canada (LAX to Toronto to Barcelona and back). They were 4 for 4 for delayed/rescheduled flights and 2 for 2 on missing/delayed bags (1 bag missing/delayed on the way, 2 bags missing/delayed on the return). On-board and airport staff were nice and the process appeared efficient on check in and on-board. Given the repeated delays and resulting excessive travel time and missing bags, I will do everything I can to avoid traveling with Air Canada as a result of this experience. 100% NOT on time and lost ("delayed") bags is unacceptable. How are they rated so highly with the air travel industry sites?

### "I can't imagine flying Air Canada again"
Not Verified |  My flight was an absolute mess. I went from Quebec City to Montreal then to IAD. My first flight was delayed 3 times (with the email service giving me a heart attack by saying my flight is about to leave and then that my other flight had already left) before being cancelled. They wanted to stick me on a flight the next day. I'm a broke, disabled person. I couldn't afford another night in the City, and my cat sitter couldn't do another visit. So, I managed to get moved to a much later flight (I had been set to leave at 9 am, so I got to the airport at 6, and my new flight with a different airline was set for 4 pm). I finally make it to Montreal (thankfully nothing went wrong with this other airline, besides me having to re-check my luggage in) and things go from bad to worse. I mentioned that I'm disabled, I needed the wheelchair assistance, so they come get me, and I'm taken to the service desk (while being bumped into things and people along the way, it's not a great airport for people who need the assistance). When we get there, I find out that the person who set up this new flight had sent me to an airport 2 hours from my home. My normal airport is still 30 minutes away, but I certainly couldn't afford an Uber from this new one. So I say that, and I get blank stares. Thankfully I was able to get shifted to a new flight (yet again, and this one I did kind of miss due to the next issue) but they set me under this really hot light and left me to wait next to this guy's desk. I saw him get through 2 groups of people, the second set telling him that he needed to help me. I had been sitting there for 20-30 minutes at that point. (I had planned to ask what was happening after these kind ladies were done with him) So he says all of a sudden that the guy who should have come for me was stuck on a plane. Which, okay, I get that things happen, but why was I just sitting there when there surely must be more than one person who could have helped me? This guy takes me himself, and then I get left in a hallway with about 10 other people (many of them seemed to also be using assistance) who had had their passports taken to print off their boarding cards and hadn't seen or heard anything since. At this point, my boarding time has come and gone. I'm almost certain I have missed this flight and am more than ready to start crying in pure frustration. Then he finally reappears, gives the people their passports and boarding cards and we continue on our journey. I finally get to the plane (which was miraculously still there) and board (and am super thirsty at this point. Being stuck under that light as well as not having had an opportunity to get anything was really messing with me) and finally start the last leg home. I was freezing, but there weren't any blankets on a short haul, which, fair enough. But I was finally able to get home, much later than my original 2 pm arrival time. Never again. No matter how much cheaper than any of the other companies, I can't imagine flying Air Canada again.

### "The worst experience"
Not Verified |  The worst experience I have ever had. We booked tickets with air Canada to Athens Greece via Montreal on 9/27/23-10/13/23. The first flights was delayed and lost our connection to Athens. The routed us to Rome stuck in middle middle seats that were not what we had booked like and were so small that could hardly move for more than 10 hours and finally Athens and the luggage were lost for 5 days. Every single flight was delayed. The return flights were delayed, lost our connection to San Diego and had to stay overnight in Montreal and fly the next day for San Diego. The staff are the rudest, unhelpful staff I have ever encountered. The flight to Montreal and back from San Diego was the worst. Hardly offered you a water, the lavatories are dirty and the staff only cares how to sell you sandwiches or peanuts. And the luggage are lost on the return trip as well! We are super upset about the whole trip. Air Canada ruined the vacation experience for us and it’s all the delays, rerouting etc. without even apologizing or trying to make it up for us.

### "made me check my luggage"
After years of owning a Travelpro carry-on, Air Canada made me check my luggage. Despite there being many empty spaces for luggage to fit. The attendants seemed to take a perverse pleasure in just eyeing suitcases and deeming them too large.

### "worst check in experience ever"
Not Verified |  The worst check in experience ever. Lady at the counter does not understand the other country rules and does not fully understand the rules when she reads them. Canadian passport holders do not require a visa before arrival and can renew it as they go there. My ticket was for 5 weeks and I was stopped for more than 30 min asking me for a visa. I explained and they had no clue. I said I have been doing this for ages and the previous time the manager fixed this. Customer service of the airport made us wait for 15 min on the line, then they allowed me to go.

### "good enough, but nothing to write home about"
A very typical Air Canada transatlantic experience: good enough, but nothing to write home about. The older B777s with 10-abreast seating are not quite as good as Air Canada's newer Dreamliners, but seat comfort is adequate for a 7-hour flight. In-flight entertainment is decent and quality of main meal is actually quite good. Cabin crew service was fine too. Pre-landing "breakfast" is really disappointing: just a tiny cheap croissant and yoghurt. I don't understand why airlines like Air Canada don't make a bit more effort with pre-landing food offerings. It really would not take much effort or expense to offer a proper snack box instead, and such a small improvement would go a long way to leaving passengers with a more favourable impression of the airline's service. The online check-in process on Air Canada nowadays is cumbersome: in addition to the usual things, you have to enter your passport details and credit card details to pay for a checked-in suitcase (who travels transatlantic without a suitcase anyway?). For some reason you can't do this ahead of travelling anymore. And you have to do it again when checking in for the return flight. Passengers normally know their passport details and how many bags they intend to check in well ahead of travelling, so entering all this information during the check-in process is stressful, particularly when you are abroad for the return flight. With just an improved pre-landing meal and check-in process, Air Canada would definitely be one of my preferred airlines.

### "such a poor experience"
Force you to check bags that other airline allows. Caused damage to luxury duffle. Substandard seat leg room. I am 5’9 and my knees were pressed again the seat ahead of me. Ground and gate staff were very unpleasant but I think that’s more to attribute to Jamaica staff not the actual airline. WiFi is paid hourly for an outrageous amount. I believe a Standard level of service and experience should be provided by large airlines. Would never fly again as there is no value, such a poor experience.

### "scattered all throughout the plane"
Not Verified |  Worst airline. Despite my family and I booking tickets together, we were scattered all throughout the plane. No food was provided. Air Canada is not accommodating. I sat in the back of the plane, which I did not fit in and I am quite small. No leg room and my arms were pushed against the individuals beside me. Disorganized and incompetent. Pay the extra $ and book with a different airline.

### "Will never fly with them again"
My husband and I who are both in our seventies flew from Halifax to Montreal for a connecting flight to New York. Our boarding passes had been scanned twice in Montreal and an Air Canada representative took us through security and on to customs and then left us. We arrived at the boarding gate late and were denied entry to the plane along with 3 other passengers. The staff member stated that he had not been informed that we were on our way. Our luggage was on the plane going to Newark airport. After more than 3 hours and 5 different staff, only one of which showed any empathy for our situation, we were offered separate flights to New York, one from Montreal to Le Guardia and the other back to Toronto then a connecting flight into Newark. We were assured by the staff that any out of pocket expenses incurred would be covered by Air Canada. This entailed two taxi rides, one from Le Guardia and one from Newark into New York and also the loss of money paid to a previously arranged transfer company. Air Canada is not going to repay our out of pocket expenses and is not responding to any correspondence. Will never fly with them again.

### "completely ruined travel schedule"
Not Verified | Prime example of absolute incompetence its a disgrace to airline industry. Flight delayed multiple times with no transparency. No compensation for completely ruined travel schedule. I would not recommend this mediocre service to my worst enemy.

### "delayed 3 times at very short notice"
Worst airline ever. The flight was delayed 3 times at very short notice and the total delay is over 29 hours. There is no Air Canada rep to help at the Bogota airport. The customer service agents my wife contacted from Canada could do nothing to help even to arrange any accommodation. Moreover, the last agent she spoke to regarding the third notice of delay was extremely rude saying "I cannot make a plane appear", when all we wanted to know was whether they could do anything to help my wait here a bit easier. However, Air Canada refused to help with food or accommodation although the delay was well over 24 hours.

### "canceled my flight in last minute"
They canceled my flight in last minute and did not provide me with any information. Very rude customer service. They sent me to a hotel to stay overnight, hotel very disappointing and cheap, taxi driver wanted more money from me. Airport staff not friendly, they don’t answer your questions. I had to stay more than 24 hours at the airport. They have a voucher $15 Canadian for food, just a subway sandwich cost $27. It’s a nightmare.

### "they advise flight cancelled"
Shame on you Air Canada. Our original flight cancels. Get put onto a much earlier flight. Been up since 5 am. Waiting for flight only to be advised flight delayed to 1pm. A half hour to boarding time they advise flight cancelled. Not only did we have connecting flights but a connecting group tour. No consideration from staff. Didn't care and reluctant to offer any assistance. Told us to go to service desk. There must be over a hundred people lined up to a counter as the line runs down a hallway. Only to find there is only one assistant offering service. We have up and booked another flight. Lost our luggage somewhere.

### "delayed for 4 hours"
This is the 2nd time I've flown with air Canada and I'm disappointed that my flight was delayed for 4 hours. Our flight was supposed to be 8:45am and we were at the airport at 6am only to find out that it moved to 12:20 then to 1:20!! I asked whats the cause of the delay and i don't get any real response. This would've been ok if they inform us that way we don't go early but it isn't.

### "not there to provide customer service"
My flight ac 120 was supposed to leave at 5 pm then was delayed to 7 pm then to 930 pm and then canceled. When I lined up for 2 hours to get a hotel voucher the customer service agent denied me and gave me two 15 dollar meal vouchers. My rebooked flight was the next day at 730 am. It just seemed so wrong to not even help me out Air Canada customer service staff are not there to provide customer service.

### "ruined the trip of 3 kids"
Not Verified | I purchased 2 all inclusive trips for my son and his friends with my credit card. Confirmations of the flight were sent and everything was fine. Upon departure date Sept 15, 2023 at 8:15. They were at the counter at 5:00 am. They were told that the credit card was declined. I quickly called my bank but I was told by the bank that Air Canada got their money and everything was fine as the bank was concerned. Later when I called Air Canada, they then advised me that the file was suspicious and they flagged it as fraud. My son and his friends were treated like criminals by Air Canada employees. If they thought this was fraud why did NO ONE contact one of the passengers before departure date and ask them to bring cardholder with them at the airport. I would have gladly gone. They ruined the trip of 3 kids that just wanted to go and have fun. Now they won't even reimburse me back the money. They keep jerking me around over and over again. No one should ever fly with this company again.

### "Our flight left without us"
We went through the checkout security process in Halifax and flew to Toronto. Our flight was delayed one hour. We arrived at Toronto. Had one half hour to get through security again and customs as well. They would not listen to us when we told them our flight was loading and we had less than an half hour before our flight departed. They would not listen. The woman in customs reacted to our rush, saying she demanded respect, then called a guard to take us to another booth. Our flight left without us. No one seemed to care except a kind lady who drove us to our gate in a shuttle cart. Finding out that our flight had departed, she was compassionate and helped find a connecting flight.

### "refused boarding due to the lack of a transit visa"
In June I tried to fly air Canada economy, but they refused boarding due to the lack of a transit visa. I realized that I did not receive any travel advisory from Expedia about the visa requirement. I was in the san Francisco airport at 6 am and my flight was leaving at 8.30 am. Since the Canadian embassy did not open by then, I could not call in to apply for visa. Air Canada and Expedia knew about this refusal of boarding but haven't yet agreed to refund my ticket. It's been 3 months.

### "decided to take the seat I paid for"
In the past month I used Air Canda for 2 business trips. First they cancel a flight and replace with alternate aircraft. Which there was another delay added to my flight. Also for that first flight they failed to give a receipt which I required for the business. I called them, emailed them, seen them in person regarding this twice and still not one individual can help. My next trip I paid for preferred seating at the time of my booking and received a confirmation email that my window seat near the front of the plane was booked under my name. I came to check in today and they decided to take the seat I paid for and give it to someone else. They would do nothing about this issue either, now I'm stuck 2" from the washrooms. Not what I paid for. Also, flight delayed again. This has got to be the worst airline I have ever used.

### "Did not send emails reminding me to get the eTA"
Completely useless customer service, impossible to reach online. Did not send any emails reminding me to get the eTA, meaning that I lost my first flight. At the airport, customer service agents advised me to wait until the eTA was approved and not cancel the flight - which resulted in my return flight also being cancelled. No refunds or compensation for either.

### "I would definitely recommend"
Not Verified |  Very excellent service and very friendly staff! It has been a while since I've last traveled by plane and this was my first international trip ever planned, and I visited Canada to visit my mother's side of the family. Naturally I was very nervous since it was going to be an entirely new atmosphere and tons of unfamiliar places to visit. But the staff really knew how to put me at ease and plus the boarding time for the trip came in earlier than expected, much to my surprise. The pilot was excellent and was able to get to our flight safely and earlier than expected the the stewards really went above and beyond to make sure my mom and I had a comfortable experience with the flight. Going home, they were slightly delayed on the boarding but I didn't mind since the service exceeded my expectations regardless. Also, economy seating felt like luxury to me, very modern and comfortable! I would definitely recommend 100%

### "in-flight services are nonexistent"
The worst airline. The hardest part about travelling as a Canadian is having to constantly be handcuffed to Air Canada. The service is terrible, the in-flight services are nonexistent, the prices are high, and the only thing they're consistent with is delays. Had they not been bailed out they would have gone under years ago. I've gotten better service and in flight amenities flying regionally in Africa.

### "never told us any information"
The attendants sat in the last row chatting and never told us any information. My companion had moved seats and was lying across two seats sleeping and when we started descending, they never told her to return to her seat or buckle up. I had to tell her. There was no welcoming, no emergency instructions, no snacks, no water, nothing. The worst part is that they lost one of my bags and 8 days later I still do not have it returned. There is a trace started but zero results. I called to inquire and the person I called barely spoke English when I selected English from the menu. There wasn't the standard ports for using headphones so I was unable to view movies.

### "truly terrible experience"
Air Canada should be embarrassed for their truly terrible experience. Every interaction I experienced with them was the worst, most unprofessional service I have received. We were to fly from Seattle to Montreal then to Barcelona. We arrived to the airport at 5AM for our flight and it was to leave at 7:50AM. At 7:30AM they started boarding and then promptly stopped due to a "mechanical issue" They delayed the flight by 30minutes, then an hour, then another hour, then 4 hours, finally at 1:30PM they announced cancellation. Through out the delay process, the AC employees would abandon their gate instead of helping answer questions or help us rebook our connecting flights that we were missing. When they were there they would say "we can't talk about that flight until X time" Every time they announced a new delay, we waited in long lines to get service and rebook our connections over and over again. We spent 30 minutes waiting in a line, only for everyone to find out this was just a line for food vouchers! The manager said "I made an announcement about what line to stand in" but no one heard it. People were crying and fighting in line! The AC customers were actually doing more of the communication than the AC employees were. Further more, the food vouchers we were provided would not be accepted by any of the airport restaurants because there was no number to enter into a POS system to close out the sale. Once the flight was cancelled we were told by the gate manager that we would receive $700 in compensation per ticket for the delay. AC rebooked us on a flight with an 8 hour lay over in Dublin. In total, our delay was 15 hours to our final destination in Europe. This delay could have been much shorter had AC cancelled the flight hours earlier and rebooked us all appropriately. When I got home, I filled out a claim for this compensation that was promised to us. It said AC would take 30 days to review it. Less than 24 hours later, I'm already denied. So, I called the customer service line who told me he would escalate to management and I would receive a supervisor call by 9/1. I kid you not, 1 HOUR later I get an email saying that my claim is still denied but they would offer me a $300 credit. Furthermore they did not address my issue about the fact that I had not received my $200 refund for seat selections on the cancelled flight that never occurred. I replied to the email and asked them to please call me. I call again a few days later and a rep tells me that it's protocol to email first and that they will still call. She said to reply to the email and I'll get a supervisor call soon. Finally after 3 weeks and no replies, I call again and speak with a customer service rep who now tells me that customer relations doesn't take phone calls and that both of the other reps have misspoken. I asked how I can speak to a manager about this and she said that I can't because they consider my claim closed. She said she was the highest rep I could talk to even though she claimed she was a "reservation agent" I told her this was unethical customer service and totally unreasonable. She ACTUALLY said she agreed with me.

### "dropped the ball on providing quality service"
Air Canada has really dropped the ball on providing quality service. We went from a selection of pyjamas business class full horizontal pod Seat and multi course meal on Qantas to basic Seat, not lying down, small TV screen, loud cabin, inedible food, terrible ear buds such that we couldn’t actually hear the movie over the cabin noise for a business class paid ticket for over 5 hour journey. The staff were lovely but they could not redeem the poor materials they were stuck with. Air Canada should either spend money to compete or give up offering Business Class that is %#^*. Very Disappointing. We will not fly again unless there are no other airlines on a route we need.

### "used to be a lot better"
My husband pre-paid for my food and it was horrible. The food was cold and the fly attendant just handed out the food to me without any courtesy. it is very sad because the service really was awful, the tickets were extremely expensive and we all deserve better service and treatment. Air Canada used to be a lot better.

### "Lost the baggage"
Boarding completely messed up and delayed for any good reasons. No explanation. Lost the baggage at the airport and no information available. We contact several time the company. Go back to the airport and nothing move. After 3 days they are not able to know where the luggage are.

### "not issue gate passes for military families"
This is the absolute worst airline I have talked with. They treat Active duty military horribly, the service ladies at the front desk of Nashville airport (06:54 Mon, Sep 4) were extremely rude and did not want to help me in my case. The day prior to flights being changed for my fiancé the workers had a horrible attitude and did not make things easy to change flights. They did not issue gate passes for military families, they told me to go find an airport manager.

### "I missed the connector"
Never will I fly again with this airline. Due to the delay I missed the connector (2 hours to late, Toronto to Zurich). Also I had to wait over 1 hour for my baggage.

### "agonizingly bad"
Not Verified | I booked a flight from Cancun to Calgary in early August 2023 using Aeroplan points. Yesterday, I received notification that my flight was changed from a direct flight in business class on Nov. 16th to a one-stop flight, in economy class on Nov. 17th. There was no specific reason given (though unforeseen conditions were mentioned). This is unacceptable. I expect, under these circumstances, to be booked with another airline, which had a direct flight that was perfect for my itinerary. So, I called Air Canada and, after a 4-hour wait, was told that I couldn't address the issue because it was an Aeroplan issue. Unacceptable, even if at the corporate level they are distinct. I was "connected' with Aeroplan. After a one-hour wait I gave up. There was, at that time, no "call back" option. Next morning, I tried again before sunrise. The automated system was cumbersome and of poor fidelity. I was rejected once. Tried again. This time, I at least had a "call back" option. So, as has been the case in the past, I would rate Air Canada as agonizingly bad when it comes to resolving flight issues.

### "Poor service, appalling food"
Not Verified |  Worst business class we have flown. Poor service, appalling food, worn seats. 10 passengers still to go and the lamb choice no longer available. Attendants looked like they didn't want to be there and took ages to respond to requests for water or snacks

### "Am I being unreasonable to expect more?"
Had a terrible experience with AC that *could* have been a very positive experience if AC had even an ounce of humanity in them. Very disappointed and feel cheated on behalf of my parents. Here's the summary: - my parents flew from Toronto to Zurich (Switzerland) with AC at the end of April this year to visit me. They are on the older side (my Mom is 79, my Dad is 82) but physically still OK. So far, so good. - they wanted to fly back to Toronto on May 5 on flight LX4640 (operated by AC, although Swiss was somehow also involved). They made it past airport security in Zurich and got onto a crowded shuttle train. After getting off, they ended up on a crowded escalator going up. Halfway up the escalator, my Mom was shoved (accidentally) by someone just ahead of her. She lost her balance (there was no room to move her feet) and fell backwards onto my Dad, who also couldn't brace himself on time, and he fell too. Both got bumped and bruised, but my Mom hit her head on an escalator step and was bleeding. Both were helped by other passengers and then airport staff. My Mom got a bandage around her head. Neither of them lost consciousness (they got lucky in a way). Perhaps unthoughtfully, my parents felt fine and wanted to continue to the plane. However, understandably, the airport staff told them that there was no way the captain would let them fly. So instead, they were taken to a hospital in the city by ambulance for check-ups. A few hours later, the doctors had cleared them of serious injuries and they were allowed to fly again (see photo of my mom's injuries). Here's where it gets really nasty. They had "non-refundable" tickets (unfortunately bought through expedia), and expedia claimed they couldn't get them onto the next flight the following day - Air Canada is responsible. But AC told me (on the phone) that they couldn't do anything either. They confirmed this later in a couple of emails, basically saying, "haha, we are not legally obligated to help you. You got unlucky. Bye! Here's the kicker: to get back to Toronto, we had to buy 1-way tickets from Zurich to Toronto, which cost them a fortune: $3000 for the both of them for the next day! For the record, this was *much* more than the 2-way tickets they'd already long ago paid for. Since then, we inquired at various insurances and legal services, and nobody seemed able to help...the circumstances were unusual and my parents got unlucky. In other words: - because my parents experienced an accident at the airport that led to them being denied boarding, they were forced to pay $3000 extra out of pocket to get home. What kills me is that AC had free seats on the flight the next day! Imagine how the story could have gone: AC would tell them "Wow, you guys had a tough break, I'm sure glad you turned out to be OK! - and of course we'll get you back home tomorrow...there are still seats free. We would have loved AC from that day on. That would have made everyone happy. And keep in mind: Nobody was asking for a "refund" - they just wanted to use their paid-for ticket to get home!! Now tell me, is this fair? That on top of the suffering they had thanks to the accident, they *also* have to shell out $3000 more to get home - just so AC can get richer and profit from the bad situation? Why do they insist on being so blatantly greedy? Am I being unreasonable to expect more?

### "Poorly managed boarding"
Poorly managed boarding, followed by being directed in and out of lines three times. The staff at YYC Gate D78 were curt, rude, and unprofessional. We eventually made it on the plane, with our small carry on luggage checked. Worst experience with Air Canada in 10 years. Will be prioritizing WestJet for all future travel, and I recommend anyone reading this to do the same.

### "the web site malfunctioned"
Their web page froze a half dozen times when trying to book two trips. At seat selection, could not proceed and had to re-enter the data including our Global Entry numbers 5-6 times. Finally gave up and called for a phone reservation. Took me over five days to reach someone after one hour waits every day. Phone agent was pleasant. Flight from SFO was slightly delayed but we made our connection. Plane was the most uncomfortable, food basic. No entertainment. Returning from Kelowna unable to check in on line because the web site malfunctioned. I was able to use the phone app to check in. At Kelowna airport advised by text that the Vancouver-SFO leg was canceled by United. No way to get assistance for rebooking. Phones and text for UAL unanswered. No UAL staff at Kelowna and overwhelmed in Vancouver. Finally got a friend in the US with million mile status at UAL to get us a flight the next day via Portland-SFO. Went to gate agent in Kelowna and asked to get boarding passes. Told they were not valid flights nor confirmation numbers. He didn't realize being a code share he should look at UAL and not just AC. Then AC had the audacity to send us a satisfaction survey after our trip and while filling out the detailed survey that site malfunctioned and I couldn't send it. We had a business class flight in Sept to the Maritime provinces and we just couldn't stomach flying with AC again so we canceled the flight. Tried to do it on the web site, unable to because you need the original cc information including CVV which I did not have because during the BC trip Chase canceled my card for perceived fraudulent activity and when I received the new card I had mailed back the old one. Chase was surprised that AC required such detailed information when I called unsuccessfully to get the CVV from Chase but they have no access to that info either. Had to call AC again and was prepared to wait hours but to my surprise a charming French accented phone agent answered within 10 minutes. She took care of things efficiently. Since she was the first human being I've been able to contact at AC I outlined my litany of bad experiences and she offered me a 20% off coupon for another flight. So great, now I have a $4200 credit and a 20% off coupon for an airline I never intend to fly on again.

### "the flights were excellent"
Not Verified |  We flew Air Canada direct from Calgary to Halifax and then back Halifax to Calgary in August - a family of 6. From the moment we booked until we landed at both locations, the flights were excellent. As we were travelling with a toddler within hours of booking we had confirmation email with seat selections putting us all together. This was very much appreciated and relieved a lot of mom stress . The seats were comfortable, the entertainment selection great and the on board staff were very professional and pleasant. We would definitely take this direct flight again.

### "Seats were comfortable"
I travelled as a family with my two toddlers. Seats were comfortable, Entertainment was OK and had plenty of options for kids. However since they do Code share with Sri Lankan airlines there were lot of Sri Lankan passengers on the flight. But there were no Sri Lankan films or dramas available (almost all Middle Eastern Carriers do have). Cabin Staff was not friendly at all. (they are always like that in Air Canada). Though I did not experience personally on this flight, I saw the staff was talking very rude to elderly passengers from India and many South Asian origin. Food is again OK. I don't have a complain for that. Getting out and Immigration is very smooth at Toronto Airport. Summary - since we do not have much transatlantic connections to travel to Sri Lanka, I may book again with air Canada + Sri Lankan. But if I can find something like Qatar or Emirates, I would definitely select them. If you travel frequently and no Kids or elderly people, you will not have much issue with AC.

### "failed to load my luggage on the plane"
Not Verified |  I flew from Toronto Pearson to Europe, with a connecting flight through Munich. The plane left Toronto with a significant delay, first it was announced that a fridge had broken and they were waiting for ice to be brought to the plane, then 20-something minutes later they announced that some other gate was missing a tow bar and it had to be borrowed from our gate, so they were waiting for it to be returned. This of course caused many to miss their connecting flights or barely make it, I luckily made it. And they failed to load my luggage on the plane! I arrived at my destination the following day, waited at the belt, only to realize that my luggage hadn't made it. I of course assumed that because of the delay from Toronto, there wasn't enough time for my luggage to be transfered to the next plane and that it remained in Munich. After filing the complaint at the destination airport, I received an email that my luggage was still in Toronto! I guess it's a good thing that they located it, but why is my luggage travelling on its own 24 hours after I did? Gross incompetence, I don't know what's happening but it's like nobody knows how to do their jobs properly anymore! And here I am, a day into my vacation, with no clothes, no toiletries, no medication other than what I had in my carryon, waiting to hear where my luggage is and when I can go retrieve it. Which retrieval, by the way, is very costly, as obviously I don't have a car here so I have to take an Uber or taxi, and where I'm staying is far from the airport so now I have to spend a ton extra thanks to Air Canada's incompetence.

### "still no sign of our luggage"
Not Verified |  Without a doubt the worse airline I’ve ever flown with. Cancelled flight, delays and they lost our luggage. We are home and still no sign of our luggage being returned despite endless phone calls to try and get it tracked and returned to us. Appalling customer service and processes.

### "they didn't sit us together"
Worst airline I've ever experienced. I had 3 flights booked with my boyfriend and they didn't sit us together at any when it was booked well in advance. When asked to switch, they told us we had to purchase seats next to each other. You are unable to communicate with them, their customer service is terrible. They are rude and have no respect for you. I will never fly air Canada again.

### "Really good service"
Really good service and overall a great experience. Free non-alcoholic beverages, excellent in flight entertainment system, friendly crew. Clean washroom. Can't pick seats without paying though.

### "still hasn't been able to locate my bag"
Not Verified |  We left YYZ on August 13th, 2023 to spend 12 days in Bahamas. My luggage never showed up at the airport in Bahamas. We are now 8 days into our vacation and I still don't have my luggage. I have all my clothes in there and my baby clothes. I was told 7 suitcases went missing off that flight. I don't understand how such a big airline can loose suitcases and where do all these lost suitcases end up? Is there some sort of theft ring going on that everyone is just ignoring? I have filed 2 different reports and Air Canada still hasn't been able to locate my bag. Air Canada has made our vacation stressful and worrisome as we are trying to find new clothes and items for our baby which is difficult at a resort in a different country.

### "no consideration for customer service"
We were originally booked premium economy travel from Japan to Boston with a layover in Montreal. Our flight from Montreal to Boston was canceled due to mechanical issues at about 10:45 pm. The staff told all passengers to find hotels for the evening, that these costs would be reimbursed, and that we would all be booked on new flights. As I needed to be at work the next day, when we got to our hotel that evening, I tried calling Air Canada and was on hold awaiting assistance from 11:30 pm to 1:45 am. At that point, I hung up and went to bed. When we woke in the morning, Air Canada had booked us on a flight for Friday afternoon rather than that day which was Thursday. We needed to get home, and saw that there were three business class seats available on the 8:15am flight that day, and thus grabbed those flights. As we were booked on premium economy, I believe that had we been successful in getting to speak with an agent, then Air Canada would have responded by putting us in those seats in order to get us home. However, Air Canada has refused to refund us for this flight. The fact that they would have made us stay an additional day and a half in Montreal when they had 3 seats available, is beyond my understanding and reflects no consideration for customer service. I have reached out to Air Canada three times now, and they still refused. It is also worth noting that on our way to Japan we were also delayed three hours. However their unwillingness to enable us to use available seats after canceling our flight was just unbelievable.

### "embarrassing joke of a company"
Not Verified | Air Canada is an embarrassing joke of a company. Didn't get our bags to Germany and then after waiting 2 and a half hours upon arriving home have now said our bags didn't make it. Worst airline in the country, avoid at all cost.

### "they never loaded my luggage"
On a flight to LAX - AC785 they lost my luggage, and turned out they never loaded my luggage on the same plane. While waiting for boarding, they were taking volunteers to check-in their carry ons. As not enough passengers volunteered, Air Canada staffs forced passengers to check-in the carry ons last minute. For my delayed luggage, they did not give me any notice of being delayed and could not locate it, only advised it was never loaded on the flight. Received my luggage the next day evening, had to delay all my travel plans as I had to pick up my luggage from the airport again. On the flight back to YYZ, flight was delayed 15 minutes due to security issue and when we landed at 7:35PM, luggage was delayed by 2 hours and 30 minutes. Again, was not informed by staff until 9:45PM. People just standing for hours with no clue or whatsoever. I will never choose to travel with Air Canada again.

### "sick of being treated badly"
Do not fly Air Canada if you have a disabiiity. I emailed the airline in good faith over a month ahead of my flight explaining that I need an a seat (window seat, left side) on the flight for medical reasons. I have metal in my left leg and a spinal condition, and therefore on long haul flights, cope with sitting down for a long time, but shifting my entire body weight onto my left buttock and leaning against the plane wall on my left and taking my right buttock off the seat so I don't sit on my painful leg the whole time as it can lead to agnoising pain needing morphine drug treatment and leave me unable to walk for a few days. I use crutches. I have a permanant disability. I received an email back saying that the seat had been allocated and the disability assistance through the airport also. When checking in the night before, my boarding pass automatically assigned me a C seat, the aisle, where I'd have to get up each time the passengers in the window seat and aisle seat required the toilet (my crutches are typically locked away at the front of the plane by the staff); and this would cause me the problems described above. I spent a total of four hours until 1.30am the evening before a 9.00am flight from Scotland to Canada emailing and international-calling the medical desk at Air Canada trying to get the seat changed urgently as I wouldn't have been able to fly with the C seat, and would have missed my flight. For 3 hours 15 minutes, this change was refused by the agents who insisted they had allocated me the seat they thought was best for me (gobsmacked as they were not me or my doctor) who first told me that I could only be moved if another passenger agreed and the flight was full. And then I was told that the medical desk couldn't put this change through as the booking system had been passed over to the airport. I was then asked if I could bend my leg and then when outlining again the full list of medical conditions I live with permanantly, including a life threatening disease, the A seat was mysteriously allocated and apologies given. I was beside myself with tears and distress that despite the correct seat being allocated a month beforehand, I had gone through this distressing situation. Instead of 7 hours sleep, I got 3 hours before I had to travel to the Airport. I live with chronic fatigue following a stroke last year and this has not helped me at all. Sadly I have further flights booked on this trip with Air Canada but I will never fly with this Airline again in future. Disabled people are sick of being treated badly. Our 'me too' moment is coming.

### "pay extra for baggage"
For international passengers on domestic flights it is not comprehensible to pay extra for baggage and the prices are outrageous for an hour domestic flight. The term Basic Fair is a technical term used by Air Canada, it is not defined anywhere. One can imagine that one would have to pay extra for food or alcohol, but not for baggage below the 23 kg limit. Air Canada combines the characteristics of low-cost airlines such as EasyJet or Ryan Air by charging extra for baggage with those of premium airlines International passengers on domestic flights are therefore misled and ripped off and this from an airline that calls itself member of the Star Alliance.

### "impossible to get a hold of Air Canada"
Air Canada is one of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with. I fly at least 5 to 6 times a year (including going overseas to Europe) and I have never taken a flights where a delay cause my flight to not be rescheduled until 3 days later! I was traveling with friends coming back from Calgary and going to Columbus OH. We had a 1 year old with us. Our flight from Calgary to Toronto had 2+ hr delay and was causing us to miss our connection. They could not find alternative flights for 2 days and when we decided to go to Toronto since that is driving distance (6hr) to Columbus our flight from Toronto to Columbus was not for another 2 days. The airline got us a hotel and a $15 food voucher TOTAL. We decided to rent a car that night and drive home. When we attempted to get any sort of compensation (car rental reimbursement or reimbursement for the flight not used) it has been almost impossible to get a hold of Air Canada (they don't actually have customer service that will help with this on the phone it is all online) 1 month later all my complaints have been rejected, we can't get reimbursed for the rental and I want to make sure Air Canada stops being a horrible business impacting people's lives like they are. The original cost savings IS NOT WORTH IT! Never had a flight on time with them out of the 2 times I used them. My first one thank god they rescheduled me on another Airline!

### "they cancelled the flight"
We were flying back from Cancun to boston via Toronto, in Toronto we had few hours layovers, our flight was showing as on time till 15 minutes before departure although the incoming flight was as delayed and didn’t depart yet. At last moment they cancelled the flight with excuse of weather although many flights landed and took off.

### "I was amazed to be honest"
Had international flight this week with A.C. which was delayed ca. 7 hours (mechanical problem); was given £15 voucher for lunch at airport (which was more than enough!) and, upon arrival at destination airport, A.C. team was waiting for me/other passengers with new boarding passes for missed connections. I was amazed to be honest. What I am used to in today's world is being left behind. Left in the cold, forgotten and left behind, and a sea of red tape; the opposite is what I experienced. I was amazed at A.C.'s proactively and professionally taking responsibility, which is not what I'm used to. What I'm used to is indifference and let's hope we get away with it. I'm just a lay dude with a modest income and no connection to any airline. What's more, A.C. is telling me I may be entitled to compensation. I can't believe it. As if the professional, prompt handling of the situation wasn't enough! Fellow passengers are complaining, complaining, it's not enough, don't accept it and try to get more out of them, but it will never be enough, even if it puts the airline belly up.

### "row was missed for beverage service"
Rude and unprofessional flight attendants on this flight. The in flight service team wasn’t aware that there was a wheelchair passenger who needed to be looked after. This passenger was seated next to me in an aisle seat and was ignored and treated rudely by an attendant, who had to be called back to assist the wheelchair passenger to the toilet. My row was missed for beverage service after the first meal service. When the request for flight attendant was activated, it took nearly half an hour for someone to come-by but it was for collecting the meal trays and trash. The flight attendant who skipped us on the beverage service didn’t apologize but took the beverage request and went on to collect trash and then decided to go and grab the beverage and returned with a cup and a can of beverage. All my meals and snacks were awful and my seat was terribly uncomfortable,  torturous on a 13.5 hour flight. My blanket was too small to be practically useful.

### "everything looks a bit bashed up and scruffy"
Aircraft on a wet lease for Air Canada. This was not an Air Canada experience, far from it! There were x2 Air Canada ambassadors onboard so support with French translations. This aircraft interior is looking shabby. We had seats next to the exit row and the exit doors looked they’d been used on numerous occasions already! The seats in economy are uncomfortable and everything looks a bit bashed up and scruffy. Flight was delayed for 1hr 45 mins due to technical issues. Crew were a mixed bag, some were wonderful some were edging towards unprofessional in terms of behaviour talking about inappropriate things around passengers. If Air Canada did this aircraft switch on me again I’d be unhappy, likely to the point I’d investigate cancelling and flying with another airline.

### "crews were excellent, professional"
Not Verified |  What a great way to celebrate my 50th in Style! Travelled Vancouver to Athens via Toronto. Both crews were excellent, professional, food and drink were of a very high quality. Warm and welcoming & extremely attentive on both flights. Flew Lufthansa home & nowhere as good. Icing on the cake was the Signature lounge, what a fantastic space, great food, drink & service. Everything I wanted on this trip & more. Ride to the lounge in Porsche was a nice touch. Air Canada really deserves higher credit for their business product & crews have really improved over this last decade.

### "still no funds in my account"
Air Canada cancelled my flight at the last minute, left me at Toronto Airport. Gave me an accommodation voucher, which I am thankful for, however then delayed my re-booked flight to Quebec City, and lost my luggage. I was without my luggage for 5 days. To add further insult to injury, denied my compensation claim, reviewed it and then granted it. Told me compensation was paid out on 21 July. It's now 12 August and still no funds in my account. I've been following up daily since 31 July. No responses. I've asked to speak with someone more senior and no response. I've asked for transfer/remittance advice. No response. Where are the funds?

### "professional flight attendants"
Despite we left Tokyo with a delay of one hour, because Air Canada overbooked this flight, I appreciated my journey. Clean plane, professional flight attendants and good food. Despite major investments to modernize Montréal-Dorval, the place is still a mess and a horrible to transit. The people who work there are unprofessional, impolite, rude and not customer oriented, especially at the screening checkpoint. The signage are bad and the waiting place are crowded. This place give a very bad image to Québec.

### "friendly but ineffective"
We were traveling from Athens, Greece to Austin, TX with Air Canada. We had three flights to get home (ATH-YUL, YUL-IAH, IAH-AUS). Both our first two flights were delayed. Unfortunately, our second flight was delayed by 1.5 hours which made it impossible to catch our 3rd flight to get to Austin. We had 15' to get from Terminal A to Terminal E and surprisingly, the agent at the gate did not bother (although we asked) to inform the next gate that we were on our way. As a result, we missed the connection by a few minutes (in spite of running across the airport after two long flights and with tired little kids) and were left stranded in Houston. Due to the late hour, there were also no Air Canada agents anymore to assist us with vouchers. We paid out of pocket to stay at a hotel and get to Austin. Even the next day, the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours. Air Canada did not reimburse us for anything because the delays were under 3 hours. We got a standard email reply. In total, flying with Air Canada was a bad experience. Delays, lack of coordination, miscommunication were a few of the things that went wrong. People were friendly but ineffective and inefficient. Would suggest to avoid it by all means.

### "Very good service onboard"
Good flight and on time. Very good service onboard and flight attendants were attentive to the passengers. But the price for the ticket is too high compare to the pre-pandemic period. The inflight entertainment system offer good choice. But Air Canada have to improve the selection of Québec movies and music offer in French.

### "I will never fly Air Canada again"
I have flown Air Canada for 39 years. Unfortunately, my last flight on Air Canada took place on July 17th, 2023. My 10 year old son and I, traveling from Seattle to Toronto boarded the plane at 10.50pm for a four and a half hour red eye. As my son likes to sit in the window seat, he entered the aisle first and sat down as I arranged our carry-on’s. We landed in Toronto at approximately 6.20am. As we got up from our seats I gave way for my son to stand in the aisle to stretch him legs. I looked around our seats to confirm that we had everything. I was absolutely horrified, disgusted, nauseated and upset when I looked at my sons seat only to see the seat, seatbelt, and seatbelt hardware covered in a significant amount of dry blood. I brought this to the attention of both the pilot and crew as we were exiting the plane. It was suggested that I speak with the Air Canada agent at the gate, but there were none. I then tried to locate customer service within in the airport, only to be told that my only option was to call the number posted online. I did submit a complaint to their customer service department, it’s been over two weeks and I have yet to receive a response. In addition I submitted a complaint to Mr. Rousseau, only to hear back from R.A. (Al) Read, Vice President, Airports – North America. His response was disappointing at best. He stated if there were a medical incident on board the crew are trained to manage in. He also started the aircraft’s are groomed and seatbelts are crossed prior to each flight, which is absolutely false. A blood covered seat clearly proves this as inaccurate. He also said that since 10 days had past, from my email to him, it’s difficult to analyse the situation. Again, I immediately reported the blood covered seat to the both the crew and pilot, upon exiting the plane, as well as informed customer service thought their site, with no response. There was no solution provided, or action based response. I will never fly Air Canada again, and would discourage everyone else from doing so.

### "really regret booking on Air Canada"
Worst airline experience ever. First off the web site malfunctioned a half dozen times trying to book the flight. After entering all information (including known traveler number) at the seat selection stage the web site froze. Tried to book by phone. It took me 5 days waiting for over an hour each day to reach a phone agent. Finally got the flights booked but the agent would not take my Global Entry number over the phone, said I could add it at check-in. Got the notice to check in on June 25 and you guessed it. On-line check in malfunctioned. Had to check in using the phone app. Then had to wait again for hours to reach someone on the phone to add the known traveler numbers to get TSA pre-check outbound and Global Entry on return flight back to US. Flight was the most uncomfortable seats we've experienced in decades. Food/drink minimal. Return flight code shared with UAL was canceled, we were notified via text as we waited in Kelowna airport. Unable to reach anyone on UAL via text or phone (as suggested in the text) and no one from AC was able to help us at the airport. Finally reached a friend in the US who has million mile status and he was able to reach someone at UAL and got us booked Vancouver/Portland/San Francisco the next day. With that confirmation number and flight numbers I asked the agent at the Vancouver airport to give us boarding passes. He stated that was not a valid confirmation number nor flight numbers. Called my friend again, he told us they were valid (turns out the AC staff didn't look under code shares) but was able to get us rebooked the next day direct Vancouver/San Francisco. Asked for a hotel voucher at Vancouver for our overnight stay at the Vancouver airport hotel (the Fairmont), told would not give us one but to request it on line when we got back home. Have now found out that failure to give us the voucher violated Canadian air line rules. From A-Z Air Canada was a failure. Web sites don't function for booking or check-in. Phones are not answered for hours and hours spread over days. Emails and web site forms sent later go unanswered or with a rote "it may take 45 days to respond". Fortunately knowing the carry on bag problems with AC (inconsistent application of rules by gate staff) and flying economy (we usually fly business class) we didn't face the lost baggage problems everyone else is complaining about because we used non-roller bag soft sided luggage we had used for a trip to Africa where baggage limits are very strict as the planes get smaller and smaller. Unfortunately we booked another trip to Canada in September which is business class to the Quebec and Maritime provinces. We are dreading this trip and really regret booking on Air Canada. Am anticipating getting disrupted and stranded again and we won't be able to get any help at all.

### "very inconsistent rules"
Not Verified | This airline is the worst. After being removed from a cancelled flight, the same baggage we had on our initial flight was refused on our rescheduled flight by the AC floor manager Vassili. Terrible people skills, no compassion, and very inconsistent rules for each bag and passenger. When I became frustrated with this, Air Canada threatened to call security on myself. No support or information given. Air Canada is all take and no give. Choose any other airline if at all possible.

### "worst in terms of customer service"
This airline is by far the worst in terms of customer service. My flight was cancelled, they lost my bags, and they put me in a 1-star hotel. I will skip my return flight with them because disorganized customer staff will eventually lead to a disorganized flight crew.

### "will fly on this airline again"
Not Verified | First flight got delayed for 3 hours. was supposed to be at 8:30, got moved to 10:50. Then once got there, we were waiting for bags for HOURS. WE STILL HAVE NOT LOCATED IT. WE WERE THERE UNTIL 3 in the morning. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. Did not care or do anything. There was a dad of a little kid, I felt so bad. Never will fly on this airline again.

### "flight crew was kind and funny"
Not Verified |  It was a superb flight, the flight crew was kind and funny. If I have to go again, I would fly Air Canada. Later at landing, it was so smooth.

### "booked vegetarian meals and I didn’t get it"
Not Verified | This airline is horrible. I booked my vegetarian meals and I didn’t get it. 15hrs flying time from Sydney to VC. I lodged onboard written complaint and I was given reference number but nothing happened. I was not able to trace it. I tried to ring them but they put me on hold for more than an hour and gave up. Then my next flight from Winnipeg to NY via Montreal was cancelled at Montreal. My flight was updated automatically and I was given next flight in next two days. No compensation given. I had to fight with manager to get the flight next day morning. It cost me around $500 to stay in hotel and the flight next day wad delayed for hours. No compensation given. Staff was very rude. Then the flight from Toronto to VC was delayed as well I am going back to Sydney today and flight is delayed again I suggest everyone not to travel in this airline. This is a rubbish airline. Customer service is very poor

### "feel extremely helpless"
Air Canada lost our bags. We saved up and worked hard to go on this vacation - however I arrived in tears realizing our bag was gone. We called their baggage hotline every day and they were completely incompetent. I have no idea why they use this third party service. When the trip was over, we went to the Ottawa Airport baggage kiosk. The nice man told us our bag was not there, and that someone had actually closed our file, which he found to be incredibly irresponsible. He opened it again and our bag is still missing. When you fly with Air Canada (especially via Montreal) you run the risk our your bag going missing. If it does, you will feel extremely helpless in the mission to find it. They do not have the infrastructure or organization to make this a simple process.

### "very helpful and kind"
Not Verified | I just wanted to thank the individual working on Air Canada’s baggage claim on July 30th in Calgary. He was very helpful and kind in helping me recheck and drop off my luggage so that I could catch my connecting flight. Flying is often super stressful for everyone, and it really helps to have kind workers that try to help a situation. I appreciated it a lot!

### "stranded my child"
Not Verified |  Air Canada stranded my child, and over a dozen others, in Toronto. On 28 July, 2023, Fight 8957 from Toronto to Atlanta, Georgia, United States was cancelled with no explanation. Air Canada then refused to rebook the flight or make any other arrangements for the safe return of our children, and further refused to take calls from myself or any of the other parents. Still working on getting my 16 year old back as are the other parents of children ranging from 11 to 18.

### "terrible customer policies"
The flight was the first leg of 3 hops for us. We were supposed to board our flight to Toronto at 10:15am. The flight was delayed due to the plane being held up for some reason on the last flight. Air Canada kept giving us excuses. First delayed to 11am then 12pm then 2pm so on and so on until it was 8pm. By then we had rescheduled all of our connecting flights and lay over stays based on Air Canadas projected departure that night. They had our plane waiting outside our gate but decided it was too hot to board. Another two hours to trying to cool the plane down. Then they decided they were going to use another plane that was arriving. Then finally at 10:45pm they announced the flights cancelation due to the plane being too hot and no ground crew available to prep the other plane. After all of us waited for them for 12 hrs in the terminal. As a kicker, they refused to reimburse any of the passengers for hotel or additional transportation because according to them it was a "weather related" delay despite it wasn't weather related until several hours after the initial cause. Terrible logistic and terrible customer policies.

### "staff were excellent"
I just want to say the all the Air Canada staff that helped me complete my journey were extremely polite and helpful. I had to ask for assistance moving from gate to gate at both terminals as I have had a knee replacement and the staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and they helped me greatly. No tip required.

### "worst travel experience thus far"
This has been the worst travel experience thus far. My flight from Jul 27th that was supposed to take off at 330p was rescheduled for Jul 28th without my knowledge. I find out after I arrive at the airport. the Air Canada counter staff were 100% unhelpful. I call Expedia where I had booked ticket from and they could not help me because my ticket was 'locked'. Then I call Air Canada and their person rebooks me to a flight to old city Quebec leaving on Jul 27th, but that had already closed boarding. I find that out at the airport counter. I call them back and they reschedule me for Jul 28th at 330p direct flight to Montreal. Fast forward to Jul 28th. They delay flight from 330 to 1700. now they are not picking up the phone because I want to cancel.

### "delays and cancelations"
Not Verified |  The delays and cancelations with this airline are consistent, constant and terrible. I have flown with Air Canada twice in the last 3 days and have had over 3 and half hours of delays, every flight during this multi-city trip has been delayed. Text and email notices are constant with updates every 20 minutes or so with additional delay after delay--its infuriating to say the least.

### "3 gate changes and another flight delay"
Not Verified | Absolute cluster of an airline. I’d give them 5 stars for their consistency in always being delayed. Traveling from LAX to Toronto the flight was delayed to a “security concern”. When we landed at Toronto, they had not gate for us to deplane at. We had to sit for 45 min in the plane while a ladder truck was found and buses could be rounded up. On the return leg, we had three gate changes and another flight delay of unknown duration. The gate Agent, in not so many word, basically told the passengers to check the app for updates vs coming up to the gate. I expect to now arrive at midnight or later. Every single Air Canada I’ve taken has been delayed. Every single one.

### "couldn’t believe the utter lack of preparation"
Not Verified | Flight initially delayed an hour, boarded, got settled in, only for the flight to be cancelled due to weather, which is understandable. What I couldn’t believe was the utter lack of preparation/knowledge/compassion from every single staff member from the moment we exited the aircraft after the cancellation. No direction on what steps need to be taken to rebook or receive a refund, staff at the airport said they do not deal with rebooking or reservations and told us to call customer service, only for customer service to tell us to sort it out at the airport. Also the phone station we were directed to seemed to be more of a holding pen for customers that Air Canada staff couldn’t be bothered helping. After years of flying with Air Canada I will never be flying with them again, as I don’t feel comfortable hinging the enjoyment of a holiday on this airlines outrageous incompetence. Only gave it a 1/10 because it wouldn’t let me put zero.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  When I tried to check in for my flight online, I found Air Canada completely changed the details of my flight, and didn't notify me. The new flight that was forced on me was so bad, that there was no way I could just accept it. After a long wait on the line, the airline representative (who didn't even offer an apology, let alone a compensation), said the only thing he could do was to rebook the flight to a later date, or give me a refund. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, he said there were no supervisors. I had no choice but to rebook the flight, with all the inconveniences attached to it. Then the rude representative just hung up on me mid-call, so I had to call back and wait forever again just to verify that the details of the new flight were indeed finalized. Terrible customer service, unreliable airline company.

### "Everything about this company is poor"
Not Verified | July 23 flight cancelled then gave us a hotel, gave us a new booking for July 24. Super delayed that it messed up the connecting flight. If I can count the changes of that flight was 6 times! Then hours of waiting to check in at Manchester. Then now we are trapped at Canada looking for our baggage that we are unable to find because of their poor operational activity! Everything about this company is poor! Just don’t continue the service anymore not until you guys fix your problem! It’s embarrassing to the country since you guys carry their flag! From your resources issue to your customer service and all! Fix it all!

### "delays are unacceptable"
On 7/13/23 we had a flight that was supposed to depart at 5:35PM, but was delayed 3 whole hours for some aircraft malfunction. The staff did provide vouchers for food but it did not apply to all airport restaurants. Regardless we arrived at our destination of Vancouver extremely late. Today on 7/24/23 we came back to Dulles DC at 4:20PM on time as scheduled, BUT there was another plane at our gate and we were stuck on the airstrip for over an hour. Multiple people missed their flights due to this and we were frustrated to say the least. Although the staff and service were nice. The delays are unacceptable and there needs to be more alternative planes/gates.

### "garbage customer service"
Not Verified | Canceled connector flight, lost luggage to and from London, garbage customer service in Pearson Airport. Nobody working counters. 2 hours on the phone to find luggage. Disconnected! Another 2 hours on the phone. I would NEVER recommend this airline to anybody. When I fly Delta, it’s smooth every single time. This experience was pure trash. Heck, Spirit is better!

### "Service was abysmal"
Not Verified | The flight was 2 1/2 hours late for no obvious reason. Service if you can call it so was abysmal. Plane was dirty and stank like a garbage dump. Had to pay $75 for a single suite case.

### "no assistance from customer support"
Not Verified |  The worst flight from Montreal to Toronto, they canceled the flight 5 hours before departure and I was waiting at the domestic airport after security, no assistance from customer support or airport representatives, everyone is just saying to mail customer service. Will never take and will also tell family and friends to never take this airline in the future, don’t mind paying more for a better quality airline.

### "waited on the plane for one hour"
Air Canada is the worst company. Sold overpriced tickets from Phoenix to Montreal. Upon arrival in Montreal, they waited on the plane for one hour until they free up space on the door. In general, the earth and the sky in comparison with American Airlines.

### "lost both of our strollers"
Not Verified |  We were flying from Ottawa to Florida and lost both of our strollers. We had to pay for rental strollers everyday at Disney and when we came back we submit our claim online & they offer to give us 25% off on our next flight. We refused the offer and asked for money toward our new strollers. They denied our offer and said now you don’t get the 25% off either and the case is closed. We flew with air Canada all these years but from now on we will never fly with Air Canada or recommend to anyone anymore.

### "very consistent with their horrible operations"
Air Canada is very consistent with their horrible operations! Check in: Sydney staff were friendly but lack of experience, Montreal staff were rude and unprofessional, 2/10 On board experience: Full flight, bad seat pitch and width 1/10, FA 3/10, Food 1/10, Entertainment 3/10, Boarding 1/10. 1 Cancelation and all departures / arrivals were delayed 1/10.

### "Awful baggage handling"
Awful baggage handling and customer service. Not only was my flight delayed for over 2 hours but my suitcase has wasn't transported. I have now waited 60 hours and still no contact to say where it is. How do you lose my suitcase for a 1½ hour flight?

### "incompetent customer service"
Not Verified | First, they changed the tyre; then engine, then another issue - why didn't you check the night before? The plane has been in overnight! Do you know how many people's trips are impacted, and how many plans you have ruined? Please, just do your job. Been a frequent flyer, and Air Canada Gold member for 10 years I can't help but giving AC a 2/10 star. Since the pandemic was over, from 2022-2023, AC has lost my luggage TWICE (it took them 25 days to get my luggage back; and I found it; and they didn't compensate my extra flight to look for my luggage). Also, there have been multiple delays - NOT because of weather. It's terrible management and incompetent customer service. I wonder if it would make any difference if there were a competitor in this territory. We, as consumers, sadly, have no choice. Also, AC workers have union's protection - do we, consumers have any protection?

### "Step your game up Air Canada"
Not Verified | Flight was delayed by almost 4 hours. I submitted a claim for compensation. I am eligible for $400 compensation for person for a total of $800. They replied to me saying "the compensation you are requesting does not apply because the disruption was caused by an event outside of our control". Here are the SMS updates that AIR CANADA was giving me while waiting at the airport: 1. Your flight AC515 to Seattle is delayed further until 20:00 due to a technical issue from an earlier flight. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll keep you updated if anything changes. 2. Your flight AC515 to Seattle is delayed further until 21:30 due to additional time needed to tow the aircraft. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll keep you updated if anything changes. 3. Your flight AC515 to Seattle is delayed further until 21:45 due to additional time needed to tow the aircraft. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll keep you updated if anything changes. All of those events are not out of your control. Step your game up Air Canada and give us our compensation.

### "Air Canada/United didn't lift a finger"
Worst airline/travel experience of my life! My family of 7 is returning to Chicago from a wonderful vacation in Greece, with a layover in Montreal. Board plane Thursday night, 6/29 in Montreal, gate is pulled away, we sit on tarmac for 30 minutes, pilot then comes on intercom and says there is a mechanical problem (never verified or confirmed by anyone at Air Canada/United). Everyone deplanes, we wait in 2 separate lines for over an hour before getting to counter...Air Canada rep rudely says they don't do rebooking at the counter, but here's a taxi and hotel voucher (for 1 night - we were stranded for 3!) every other air carrier does their very best to reroute passengers at the gate, Air Canada basically said shove it! Then waited on hold (at # AC rep gave us 'here, call this # and they will solve all your problems') for over 2 hours before AC rep came on line and said since tix were purchased through United, we needed to call them (4 hour wait time with United) phone reps zero help (we were suggesting alternative routes/cities, etc that they hadn't even considered) - we were stranded in Montreal through Sunday at an extra expense of over $1500 in hotel/food fees. Air Canada/United didn't lift a finger or care one whit about trying to satisfy us, acknowledge they had hosed everything, or try to get us home expediently. Air Canada gets a letter grade of F (will never fly that airline again) United gets a D+ (only because after days of being stranded, they are how we got home. Tragic and horrible example of air travel in 2023.

### "experienced 11, yes 11 delays"
Air Canada Seattle to Comox was the worst flight of my life. In a short flight from Seattle to Comox with a connector in Vancouver. The connector is a 20 minute flight from Vancouver to Comox. I experienced 11, yes 11 delays and gate changes. A screen shot cannot show the frustration or physical pain caused by Air Canada's lacking. Running through large busy airports. Gate changes that required taking the tram in Seattle to different gates. Standing in lines of enraged customers to Information desks. All of us just trying to get to our destinations. It looked like a riot may ensue at the Vancouver airport in the Air Canada section. Employees that were trying hard, but also up against a behemoth company that seemed to care as little for them as they do for their customers. I kept apologizing to employees for expressing my frustration but I was never offered a manager to talk to. I was offered a card with numbers to call. I would not last a day as an employee for this company. I felt so bad for my fellow Canadians that have to work for a company that is so bad that they should not use the word Canada in their name. I could have made this travel by buses and ferry in about 10 hours. My travel by Air Canada with checkpoints and lines started in Seattle before 11am and ended more than 12 hours later. My 66 year old back, legs and bum still hurt the next day as I write this.

### "disappointing experience"
Not Verified | The most disgusting and disappointing experience that I ever had with any airline, as always they overbooked the flight and they didn't let me in on a flight that paid 2000$ for, all they care about is money.

### "my least favourite air travel experience"
3 hours late to take off, poor/slow loading sequence, Air bridge failed to join at Vancouver so sat on runway waiting an hour late for international connection. Aircrew barged down the aisle as usual. Only benefit was I finally was able to use overhead luggage space. Air Canada is my least favourite air travel experience after LAX.

### "Very bad customer service"
Not Verified | I took the flight on 4th July! Sydney to Vancouver and Vancouver to Toronto. They said my luggage will be in Toronto. When I land in Toronto no luggage. File the complaint after 4 hours at the airport! Today is day 11 still no information. My blood pressure medication and my other prescription medication is in the bag. I kept only doses for me! I am without medication! Called Air Canada customer service they are saying we are still tracking. Very bad customer service and no information yet!! Very unorganized airline!! Never going to travel in Air Canada.

### "unable to file a missing luggage report"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by over 3 hours. No big deal. It happens. Toronto to Portland was another story. Because the connection was tight, Air Canada decided to bump us to a Toronto to Vancouver for an overnight, then onto Portland. They didn't bother to consult us; they just did it, without mentioning where we were expected to spend the night, or who would pay for it. When we arrived at Toronto our flight to PDX was also delayed. That made it possible to get back onto our original flight, but not without scrambling from the gate, to customer service, then racing back to the gate again. The customer service approved us for boarding our original flight. When we returned to the gate, the agent there questioned our permission to board. After grumbling about how the other agent had left him to do "his" job, he finally agreed to give us seats. We boarded, went to our assigned seats, then were told we couldn't sit there because they were crew seats. The gate guy had given us seats assigned for crew only. We had to dash around to find two seats. A kind passenger agreed to move so that we could sit together. In the four-plus hour flight, no blanket, no pillow, no food unless you paid for it, no media, no magazines. Only a 2-beverage service. The seating was so tight. As expected, in the change from one flight to another, our bags didn't arrive with us. It was 10:30 at night. Not one Air Canada agent, either in lost luggage or ticketing was present at PDX. They go home at 9pm," we were told. So, we were unable to file a missing luggage report. This morning, I tried to go online to report our missing bags (Air Canada calls them "delayed" bags, not missing). It turns out that unless you've got a file number that's issued at the airport, you cannot use the online system; you must call a service number. I waited 34 minutes on the phone for an agent. When she answered, her accent was so strong that I had to ask her to repeat every question several times. I had to repeat my answers to her questions several times. She asked me for an "original booking number" that, according to her, was on my boarding pass. It was not. I checked it repeatedly. When I explained that I could not find it (I had my ticket number, my name, flight numbers, baggage tags...etc. ), she hung up on me. I called again. I waited about 25 minutes on the second call. I politely explained that I could not understand him, and ended the call. Air Canada did text us. It looks as if our bags may arrive by tonight.

### "Absolutely farcical service"
Absolutely farcical service. Missed my connection at Toronto as the flight was delayed. Rebooked me via Montreal so needed an additional flight, every one of the 4 flights I tried to make were delayed. Having eventually made it to San Jose about 30 hours later than intended, they have also lost my bags. The worst possible airline and the worst possible service you could ever expect. Do not fly with them.

### "basically stranded at Toronto airport"
Not Verified | This is the worst airline that you can fly on. First of all, my flight from Calgary to Toronto was delayed for more than 6 hours so I was not able to catch a connecting flight to Frankfurt. I was rebooked on flight that was after 2 days, so basically stranded at Toronto airport for the next 2 days. The worst of all they didn't even care to give me a hotel room to stay in. When I asked for it the agent on rebooking counter asked me to book a room at my cost and Air Canada will reimburse me for it. Later when I submitted the receipt for reimbursement, they denied saying they don't do any hotel reimbursements.

### "Air Canada is inconsistent"
I think this is the 5th time I’ve flown with Air Canada where the flight has been cancelled due to maintenance issues or other problems. We were all boarded on the plane at sat for an hour then we’re told to wait 2-3 hours while they dealt with maintenance, then proceeded to cancel the flight and rebooked everyone for a different day. They were not able to provide any alternatives for the day and this is a common occurrence for Air Canada. Are they not able to check on the maintenance before they board all the passengers? Overall Air Canada is inconsistent and you likely won’t make your flight. I recommend West Jet instead for domestic flights, much more consistent.

### "cancelled our flight two hours before"
Air Canada cancelled our flight two hours before it was supposed to leave. No one helped us or cared. We ended up on the phone with Air Canada I’m the airport trying to rebook for over an hour and they were not able to find us a different flight. As a result our entire family trip to Disneyland had to be canceled. Crying kids and adults - absolute devastation and Air Canada did nothing.

### "indicated that I was now no-Show"
An expected 10AM departure on AC was cancelled at 8AM. I spoke with AC Call Center at 8:40 (?Philippines) and was told that 'this is either AC or United Airline but we cannot be certain'. I asked to be placed (40 minute call so far) on next available flight and she indicated that she would try to re-route me from Boston to Newark to Montreal. She then disconnected the line. I called back and another indicated that I was now no-Show for Bost-Nwk-Montreal and all my tickets had been cancelled. She indicated that I could now only purchase a first class ticket at 16:40 for Bos-Yul at C$1600 as no economy seats were available, For a meeting that was time sensitive, I had no choice. I await a refund but discussions with Bos Help Center and YUL Help Center leaves me pessimistic of any resolution.

### "This airline needs to wake up"
The customer service agent at the Montreal-Trudeau airport was nothing but ignorant, the expression on her face was disgraceful and her lack of caring really showed. The flight got delayed for 1/2 hour than an hour and now 3 hours. I will miss my connecting flight and all charges are on me. This airline needs to wake up if they want to continue transporting human beings and treat them as such. Very disappointing but not the first time. There is always some type of show attached to this company. Be aware.

### "expect this service off a cheap airline"
Not Verified | First time flying Air Canada and very disappointed for a ‘flagship airline’. Bought expensive long haul tickets and then they want you to pay £50 each to choose seats next to each other. Flight was delayed two hours for ‘technical issues’ then another hour while they tried to find volunteers to give up their seat due to over booking. Once on the plane we sat there for an hour before take off and had to ask three different staff for headphones so we could watch the entertainment system while we waited. Would expect this service off a cheap airline but not Air Canada

### "Baggage tracking is useless"
Worst experience. London to Toronto flight was 2 hours late, which of course means the luggage didn't make the connecting flight from Toronto to LA. Call waiting time is over 90 minutes and staff claim they cannot call you back. Baggage tracking is useless and no one takes any responsibility for finding your bags. It is a disgraceful lack of service. Air Canada couldn't care less. We have another flight in 36 hours and there is a possibility we will have to get on that with no baggage. We've seen other reviews of people experiencing the same thing we are. It's appalling. Air Canada have gone to great lengths to put automated phone services in place to avoid having staff to take ownership of these issues and get the job done.

### "day three without my bag"
We had three bags checked with Air Canada and they lost all three. Tried many times to contact customer service but they kept me on hold for an average of 90 minutes, and the calls are farmed to another country, and it was sometimes impossible to understand the operators. I was able to go to the airport the next day and collect two of my three bags but the third one was lost. This was the important one with clothing and medications. I continued to call the lost baggage number four times (total hold time was 425 minutes) on July 5 and got different answers from each one as to the location of the bag. Tried calling Air Canada's front office, but they only respond to emails (I guess they are afraid to hear customers yell at them). So I sent them an email on the complaint form and got the following answer in my email: "Due to the higher number of current requests, it may take as long as 45 days for an Air Canada representative to get back to you. I am now starting day three without my bag and no answers or help from the airline. I never felt so helpless.

### "no idea where our baggage was"
Not Verified |  We had a connecting flight from Toronto to Montreal after our flight from Rome and we waited over an hour for our luggage. There were 6 flights on the board and not one luggage came out. Our flight also was removed from the board and nothing showed up and we had very little help. This was very time stressful and annoying as we had no idea where our baggage was.

### "No remediation or assistance"
Frankfurt to Toronto was over 1 hour late arriving. Scheduled for 1915hrs actual was 2030hrs. Air Canada (AC) knew this would cause EVERY USA bound connecting flights to be missed because the US Customs would be closed before we could get off the plane. Not to mention the sheer distance between our gate and customs would require landing at least 15 minutes minimum before closing to even try to reach customs before closing. No announcement that we would be stuck in Toronto. No offer of assistance to get us re-booked on a flight after Customs opened again at 0410hrs the next day. No help desk at the airport that apparently CAN help us. 2030hrs When arriving at the closed US Customs the security guy said, "we're closed. come back at 0430 when we reopen" When I told him that we had connecting flights to catch, he said "Welcome to Canada please go downstairs and go through Canada immigration. I thought that meant we could go through that process and still make our flights, but turns out he was actually welcoming us to Canada as we were stuck there tonight and weren't going to make our connecting flight. We were actually told to talk to the person at the desk when you get off the elevator for additional information but that turned out to be a grumpy older man telling us he's not there to help anyone, just go through the line over there. Which was Canadian Customs and Immigration. Several flights were cancelled on the same night to the US. AC claimed would be handled automatically and notified via email about their new flights, but since my connecting flight still left as scheduled but without me or my family, it wasn't like that situation for us and we didn't get automatically rebooked for the next possible flights via email. Waited in the luggage location line for about 45 minutes about our luggage to be sure it wasn't going to the US without us. After learning the luggage was staying in Toronto, they said it would be safer to keep it in 'the system' and get the luggage assigned to your new flight and it will make it there. Otherwise it would take HOURS to locate and get them to us and we would have to check it back into the system anyways once we were rebooked. This was actually true in the end. We asked around for help and were directed by announcement to follow the "connections" signs to get help there. After waiting a while, that staff was clearly overwhelmed and actually started yelling at the customers about how they were NOT going to help anyone about rebooking or vouchers or anything. The line started getting very long when the staff started shouting over the public address, "we are only two people here and we are not going to help anyone get rebooked, or hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers. You need to go upstairs where there are 15 people up there to help you. That turned out to be a lie. We followed the instructions, which ended up being the ticket counters on the departure floor, but eventually were yelled at again by a queen bee in charge stating that their only job is to help people check into their flights and since we didn't have any flights to board as our flight left without us, it was NOT their job to help us get rebooked. No remediation or assistance was given as to how we could resolve the situation either. I tried asking the special assistance table how I might get help and, after explaining our situation, she told us to go to the other area of ticketing counters for my spec

### "inexperienced and inconsiderate staff"
Not Verified |  Most inexperienced and inconsiderate staff. Kept making stupid errors, such as putting the car seat check-in sticker on the luggage and vice versa. They called the help desk a million times and kept interrupting each other. We stood at the desk for 2 hours.

### "support lines are totally overwhelmed"
I purchased a ticket to fly Washington-Nairobi return in business class via Toronto, Frankfurt and Zurich late June/early July 2023. All flights but the first were code shares on other reputable carriers, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. I've had excellent experiences with Air Canada in the past and really looked forward to this family trip. Just before departure, Air Canada cancelled its flight from Washington because of staff shortages. I called Air Canada and, secured a satisfactory booking via Montreal. That was almost immediately cancelled, leaving me trying to call Air Canada support till around 4am. After multiple calls and hours on hold, I was booked on a United flight to Toronto connecting with Lufthansa on to Nairobi. When I arrived at Washington Dulles, United reported that AC had only made a booking, but had not reissued my ticket as required AC staff at the airport said they were only ramp agents, they couldn't sort out the problem. I had to call Air Canada customer support. Eventually, they called AC support, waited 45 minutes on hold, and then had the needed ticket issued. I thought, foolishly, that my problems were over. Alas, AC had only reissued an outbound ticket from Toronto to Nairobi, without replacing the original round trip ticket. When I arrived in Nairobi, my return flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa system on the grounds that I was a no-show for the outbound flight, leaving me stranded in Nairobi. After an entire night and half a day trying to reach Air Canada support, AC staff finally agreed to restore my return ticket. Reaching AC took about an hour and a half on hold on each occasion, and AC dropped most of these calls after a few minutes. Only on arrival at Nairobi airport did I realize that AC had bungled my return ticket, having me depart Frankfurt for Zurich before I arrived in Zurich. Fortunately, the Lufthansa staff in Nairobi were able to sort this out on departure. I understand hat it's tough running an airline right now, resurgent demand, staff and plane shortages, forest fires etc. But the AC system demands that clients call their agents way more than should be necessary. And, at the moment, ACs customer support lines are totally overwhelmed. Having to spend whole nights trying to get through to Air Canada support to deal with repeated errors made by Air Canada staff is totally unacceptable.

### "Dinner service was a bit shambolic"
Late departing Montreal which, according to the captain during an announcement, was because some meals still needed to be loaded on board. Chief Purser later told me that "there are bunch of things that we didn't get today" which means that us, the passengers, won't have those. Dinner service was a bit shambolic with the cabin crew in business class seeming uncoordinated and disjointed. My main course arrived barely warm, so I asked that it be heated up again. It returned quite some time later dried out. It certainly wasn't a meal I'd have expected in a premium cabin on a major carrier. What I have learned about this particular route is that the back of the business cabin is preferred by some customers who have their adult children sitting in the next cabin back (Premium Economy) such that the adult child can frequently come up to the business cabin to check on their elderly parent. I met a Premium Economy passenger in the second J class galley who said he booked his elderly parent's seat that way in order to be able to check on them during the flight. What this means for other passengers is a constant flow of people coming from Premium Economy to check on "mummy" up in business class. It makes the cabin feel busy and noisy and one has to endure great long chats between adult child and hard-of-hearing mummy about how to maneuver mommy's seat, etc. I have about eight such passengers around me and feel like I'm in a flying nursing home.

### "our experience was excellent"
Not Verified |  From check-in to boarding our experience was excellent. Regular texted updates, efficient bag drop and speedy boarding. The service from the attentive staff was excellent. The food was amazing and a reasonable choice of wines. The seats were comfortable and roomy. Great experience. Will do again!

### "flight attendants were amazing"
The flight attendants were amazing. One in particular, Jessie (sorry if I spelled that incorrectly) went above and beyond. She addressed any concerns passengers had. My friend and I were concerned we wouldn't be able to eat, so she gave us some of her snacks because she didn't need them. Those who were worried about connecting flights, she assisted right away. Will definitely fly with Air Canada again.

### "been stuck in Canada for 2 nights"
Not Verified |  This is literally the worst airline ever. I have been stuck in Canada for 2 nights, soon to be a third, due to their incompetence and disregard of passengers. Our connecting flight (which would have been 60 minutes) was abruptly canceled due to no staffing. We encountered quite possibly the rudest woman on earth at the "customer service" area. Not only was she nasty and callous, booking us for a flight in 3 days, she didn't offer any information about what to do next, she literally turned her back. We had to ask a security guard where to go next to try to remedy our situation. 5 hours later, we were sent to a hotel nowhere near the airport with only one night of hotel paid. Fast forward to today, we are still sitting in the airport. Our flight was due to leave 4.5 hours ago. Initially, it was delayed for a late crew, then maintenance, then weather. We finally boarded, only to sit on the runway for 90 minutes before we were deplaned. We have not been provided food or information about what happens next.

### "didn't send my luggage with me"
Not Verified |  Cancelled my first flight due to no crew and provided no hotel or meals for the night. I had to book and pay for hotel and meals myself and now I have to try to jump through all of their hoops and waste more of my time to try to get reimbursed. I had to wait 1.5 hrs at check in the next day. Late flight to Toronto next day caused me to miss connection to Vancouver. Hotel again $20.00 CAD for meals. Re routed me through LAX the next day with a 10.5hr layover They didn't send my luggage with me and said it will be a day late. We'll see their computer and phones systems don't work along with everything else.

### @unprofessional display of attitudes@
Not Verified |  Very inexperienced staff handling matters. The standard answers given to customers are: "we cannot amend anything", "we cannot assist on our end", "please call the hotline instead". Amazing, unprofessional display of attitudes. Employees were just eager to walk away and go home as airport is closing for the day, while many customers are left stranded waiting for the airport to reopen in several hours. Unexplainable reasons being given when aircraft were delayed.

### "No help at all"
Not Verified |  I'd rather not go on the trip than fly with Air Canada. I was stuck for over 24 hours at the airport with no food or drink or idea of how I'd get home. The flight was delayed 100% on them and the manager said he ran out of everything and we'd have to sleep on the floor until someone can rebook our tickets. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Waited in line for over 5 hours. Had to scream in order for a answer to sleep on the floor. Worst experience ever, still trying to get in contact with them to receive a refund and compensation. No help at all. Customer service line has to high of call volume and hangs up on you.

### "would not choose Air Canada again"
Not Verified | This trip was not enjoyable. As a start, there was 2+ hour delay. The crew at Vancouver Airport spoke very little English, and had zero interest in guiding about compensation. Some said finally after looking at brochures: you can get a meal voucher. That queue (100 m line pointed out) gave up on that one. The flight from YVR to YYZ was OK in my seat almost at the back. But Air Canada really should revise their customer message system. First the safety video is like 8 minutes. Then you are forced to view COMMERCIALS for another 5 minutes. Not even Ryanair would do that. And on top, EVERY video were starting with more commercials, that thankfully could be skipped. Once the flight got off, Air Canada interrupted the screen, movies etc, with announcements literally every 10 minutes. First in English, then in French. After the 10th announcement to please take seats and fasten belts, something they did at every small bump, people were like: Yeah, we got it. A simple icon lighting up has worked for years elsewhere. I wish the screen could be set to non-interrupt. Second leg was also delayed 2+ hours. Again NO compensation. Nobody to ask about anything. This flight had much worse seats. Plastic shells like Ryanair, and very narrow. Old lagging movie screens, and again same commercials, same interruptions. Of course in French, on a plane headed to Scandinavia. There probably was 0 French speakers on board. Food served was a tasteless chicken boiled to oblivion. Just before landing in CPH, a "continental breakfast" was served. A VERY dry croissant, and a minimum yoghurt. That's it? Air Canada, you completely fail this breakfast. Among the many announcements, there was not really any about the flight route, or connections on arrival. I would not choose Air Canada again.

### "zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience compounded by zero customer service. Our flight our of Toronto to Lisbon was cancelled a few hours before departure due to "crew issues". We spent the night in Toronto and the following day and were re-booked on a charter flight the next evening via Manchester, where we had a 7 hour layover. No communication the entire time, including the hotel booking in Toronto. And now I just received an e-mail stating that they will not compensate me as they have determined it was "less than a 3 hour delay". Never again Air Canada, beyond ridiculous.

### "Can’t believe an airline could be this bad"
Not Verified | They refused to hold our flight for us even though the plane did not leave yet. On our way home from Rome they completely canceled our flight last minute, literally the day of our previous flight and now me and my family of six are stuck in Canada and all we want is our warm beds. This place also has horrible service and customer service moved us around so much. We ended up getting home three days later than our due date. Me and my family were sent to a hotel without any clothes for two days straight. Can’t believe an airline could possibly be this bad. Would not recommend. If you want to have a good vacation or travel then take my advice.

### "plane was delayed for 2hrs"
Absolutely terrible, plane was delayed for 2hrs while seated on plane because they had to close a cargo door. The airline did not enforce place entrance hierarchy and people from all sections boarded at the same time. No refreshments served during the 2hr+ waiting period while one the plane and the staff told us many times they had no idea why there was still a delay. I will never be flying air Canada if I can avoid it!

### "total of 6.5 hour delay"
We got a vacation of a lifetime and upgraded to business class on the way out of Toronto. Of course, Air Canada didn't miss an opportunity to ruin this experience. We boarded our first plane, got comfortable, and then noticed that it's getting increasingly hot and we're not really going anywhere. Then the plane went dead, and rebooted itself. At this point the captain announced that we're having trouble with the air conditioning, and the plane would be rebooted again. After an hour or so on the plane, we were told we need to get off, but not go too far away, since they need to reset the AC and can't do it with us on the plane, and it'll take about 30 minutes. Then we got delayed by another 30 minutes. Then by 30 minutes more. All this time we had to hang around the loud, noisy, crowded gate to ensure we don't miss boarding. Turns out, we didn't need to worry, because the flight eventually got delayed by three more hours for a total of 6.5 hour delay. We did fly out on a second plane, but well past midnight. To add insult to injury, Air Canada refused to provide any compensation for the disruption, claiming it was "unforeseen safety issue".

### "keep delaying more and more"
Basically we are waiting for this flight to Toronto for 3h and the employees don't explain when we are boarding. They keep delaying more and more. Everyone is standing waiting on their feet for hours waiting to board and they simply don't open the gate and start the process. And this is the second 3h+ delay in a week. And for sure they won't reimburse us. Horrible service.

### "seats are making this trip miserable"
Not Verified |  I purchase the $10/1 hour Wi-Fi to write this review. I flew from Phoenix to Toronto and it was tolerable with the right positioning - the flight from Toronto to Amsterdam is absolutely horrific. The seats are narrow, I’m currently squeezed between the wall and the guy in the middle seat and our thighs still touch. Neither of us can get comfortable enough to sleep. I wish I would have spent the extra $100-200 booking with another airline. These seats are making this trip miserable so far.

### "horrible client care"
My flight from Lisbon to Toronto, AC811, was cancelled on June 18, 2023, due to the crew reaching their maximum duty day limit. The fact that the airline did not contact me via email to rebook my flight, despite giving me assurances that they would, is very concerning. Additionally, waiting on hold for four hours and not receiving any assistance is unacceptable. I had to purchase another flight with a different carrier to get home, as I was left with no other option. I came back home 48 hours after they cancelled my flight. Air Canada did not handle my situation with the level of care and customer service that one would expect from a reputable airline. After calling their client care all I got from the person called Brendan is to file a complaint online. Horrible experience, horrible company, horrible client care. Do not fly with them! If you do, make sure to buy the most expensive flight insurance that exists, because if you don't you will not be compensated.

### "Delays, no explanation"
Worst airline ever. Delays, no explanation. No “gate agent”, so we sit on tarmac for 45 minutes in the sweltering heat. I have a connecting flight to London, no one even asks or mentions it.

### "Delay after delay"
Delay after delay. Worst consumer service ever. Overbooked. Nightmare. Every time that I flight Air Canada is the same story. Do not book with them.

### "try to get compensation from them"
We flew back to London from Vancouver on 12 June. The flight was originally scheduled to take off at 19:25, we got the message of delay for an hour in that morning, then another delay and another one due to their not being able to get a plane there. By the time it took off from Vancouver it was after mid-night. I was so tired and went straight to sleep. When I woke up, it was breakfast time, and all I got was a croissant in plastic bag and a small yoghurt. I wrote to complain and try to get compensation from them, and they wrote back 3 days later to say you are not eligible to receive any compensation. Not a single word to apologize for the misery I went through.

### "Terrible customer service"
We started our day with a delayed flight from Milan (through AC) due to a technical issue. This had us sprinting through the Montreal airport to get through customs and to our gate in time for our connection flight (also through AC). We arrived just in time for boarding - phew! Just kidding because after we boarded the plane, the pilot made an announcement that we all needed to deplane due to another technical issue. After deplaning, there was no in-person communication at all. The woman at the gate provided no apology or information whatsoever. We just received several emails saying we were delayed again and again. We ended up leaving more than 2.5 hours late, and we were again harassed by the same woman checking us in (she actually took my boyfriend’s passport and wouldn’t give it back to him because he’d removed his gate check tag thinking he’d receive a new one since our plane and gate had changed. She was just too annoyed and lazy to simply print out a new one. Terrible customer service. Not to mention we payed more than $1800 RT for these flights, and the quality of service and their planes were subpar. Will not be flying this airline again (even though I’m an Aeroplan member) nor will I be recommending to friends.

### "Horrific customer support"
Not Verified |  We booked tickets to fly from the US to Spain and Air Canada cancelled or changed legs of the trip repeatedly leading up to the flight itself. After calling their customer support repeatedly (and sitting on hold for eons) we got to an agent who confirmed our eligibility for a full refund (also had that in writing) and the agent advised us to cancel our tickets online for the “full refund”. After cancelling the tickets as instructed we find out that the tickets had only been partially refunded and the Customer Support agent had instructed us to follow a process that according to Air Canada is “self-cancelled” despite the fact that they had changed the flights and acknowledged our right to a full refund. We contact their customer support 5 times to explain the situation only to be told, nope sorry we are going to fraudulently keep your refund because you followed the wrong process. Long story short do not ever fly or book tickets with this airline. Horrific customer support, poor communication, training, website functionality - a terrible experience from the moment I regrettably pushed the “purchase tickets” button. Fraudulent crooks. They will end in bankruptcy soon enough.

### "Staff are just rude"
We fly very frequently. I use always go out of my way to book Air Canada. Now, I avoid Air Canada where ever possible. The past few years Staff from check in to boarding to flight attended are just rude. Like the passengers are an inconvenience! Their sole job is to service the passengers and keep us safe. Not deal with passengers like cattle. Do not use safety as an excuse for your ill mannered behaviour. This is me observing how they deal with the majority. If you do not like your job then go find something else to do. Or perhaps a culture coming from the top!! Or is it a monopoly ? ? ?

### "memorable and pleasing flight"
Great experience after 2 not so good flights lasting 15 hours. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and warmth shown by crew during our flight. Comfortable seats, clean pillows and blankets loaded infotainment is all we really needed to complete our trip. Food was just ok, would like to see better choices here. And no free option for Wi-Fi, only paid service for a flight that isn't cheap. Anyway, a memorable and pleasing flight for sure, will definitely fly again.

### "Food on the menu was not available"
The flight was delayed as many families with children were late and the plane waited. I was on time and sat on the tarmac for an hour. Our flight was at 940am we didnt take of until 1045am. After take-off, the entertainment was abysmal as you had to pay extra to login on your phone to watch anything and it was always loosing connection and screwing up. Then a stewardess screamed at me, for me to turn the volume down. The volume was not loud at all. What happened to customer service? She screamed across 2 people as I was at the window. If I acted the way she did at my job, I would have been fired in a heartbeat. Food on the menu was not available by the time the flight attendants got to my row to ask for orders. They had a cookie and a Pepsi, this was what was left. The flight back on September 1st was even worse. I was stuck next to the flight attendant seat so I had this wall of intrusive plastic pushing me out of my seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes. I could not move my left arm without banging it into this wall of plastic. I understand airplane seats are cramped but this big plastic seat intruded on my space. I at least got some food on the flight home, for an extra cost of course. The attendants were maybe one notch better than the trip going, but thats not saying much at all, they were still rude and abrasive.

### "plane was the least comfortable"
This was a new plane and it was the least comfortable I have been on an overseas flight. The legroom was unacceptable for an overseas flight and combined with a poorly designed seat, it led to significant back pain that lasted for the next day. I will avoid this plane (and this airline if necessary - though otherwise I like it) at all costs.

### "Crew service was very slow"
Seat was not functional. Crew service was very slow and poor. Food quality and overall experience poor. Flight kept delayed but nobody answered over a call for 70 minutes.

### "There's no space, it's cramped"
There's no space, it's cramped, half of the menu options were not available, there's no entertainment system. The bathrooms are so tiny you can barely fit. It's like someone in corporate thought of every possible way to cut corners and cheapen and degrade the experience to the point where it's intolerable. No detail is spared when it comes to awfulness. The staff are fine, though and completely not their fault.

### "Overall service is acceptable"
The air craft arrived to the destination on time. The flight was clean and food was not the greatest. The snack they provide at the last leg of the flight must have been changed to a better one( the wrap). The crew was attentive. Overall service is acceptable

### "ground crews in LA were cranky and rude"
The flight going to LA was terrible to begin with. June 1st flight to LA was delayed by 2 hours due to lack of workers in their baggage section in Toronto. On June 4th, coming back here is even worse. The AC ground crews in LA were cranky and rude. The crew incorrectly announced that our flight was cancelled. My brother then asked why it was cancelled. The crew snapped back to say no questions asked, flight was cancelled. Surprised, we then reconfirmed with the other lady crew if our flight was indeed cancelled. The lady told us it wasn’t our flight that was cancelled but the flight next to ours which was AC792. The crew didn’t apologize for the error, instead they took our carry on luggage against our own will saying they didn’t have enough space. I told the guy if I could get something inside my carry on and he refused! My husband told him I needed to take this one important item inside and he snapped back along with the lady crew and said: “If you don’t comply, you can take the other flight which was already cancelled!” Their rudeness continued on as they speak with other passengers in line. These employees need to be reminded of common courtesy and proper work ethics when speaking to people who give them business and existence! No professionalism at all. Bad customer service. The flight attendants were very classy, considerate and courteous. Mid flight the air conditioning broke down, I almost passed out due to warm air blowing on my face, then they had to close the washroom for the entire duration of the flight! I don’t remember having a good experience with Air Canada, but this time I learned my lesson well. Never again.

### "Very poor service"
I traveled from Dallas to Regina. On way back from Regina had to take a connecting flight in Montreal where had to pass through customs. There was so much confusion and no one from Air Canada would guide passengers properly. They were all in a cranky mood and didn’t have patience to listen and guide property. Flight was delayed for 40 minutes as we had to wait for other flights that were delayed. People were upset and complaining that staff was not at all helpful, I had planned to buy food on board but crew just gave me beverage and didn’t ask about food. I thought will ask me later but then I saw crew sitting and eating their dinner. I asked one of crew members aren’t you selling food to which he replied we asked but you didn’t want anything. I told him that is a false statement you never asked me about food. I told him that I would like to purchase food and he said we have nothing. I got upset at his behavior so a senior member came and showed me a menu. There were only two choices so I selected one. They didn’t have much food so avoided asking passengers. When I landed in Dallas I found out that I was the only person on two flights from Montreal whose luggage has not arrived. It was 12.15 am. Lady at the airport said it will come on 10 am flight but was not on that flight. Then I was told will come on 7 pm flight. I am still waiting. Very poor service with non courteous and unfriendly both ground and cabin staff.

### "Worst airline I have ever travelled on"
Worst airline I have ever travelled on. I will never use AC ever again. The flight was delayed 3 times and then cancelled. We were re-booked the following day. They were fully aware that the flights would be delayed and made us wait at the airport from 9am to 4pm. They booked us for a night at a hotel, but were uncompensated for the cancellation. The flight on the following day was again further delayed. Airlines like this do not deserve to be operational.

### "One of the worst airlines I've ever flown with"
We were flying to Vancouver from Copenhagen via Toronto on June 1st. First they cancelled our flight then rebooked us. The flight they rebooked was then delayed by 5.5 hours in Toronto. There were hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport and only one customer service desk to service all the customers. On the way back from Vancouver to Cleveland via Toronto, the flight to Toronto was initially delayed by 2.5 hours then cancelled because of pilot shortage. They rebooked us through United and said our bags will be transferred to United but when we arrived at the gate to board the united flight we were denied boarding because Air Canada never transferred the bags over. It took them over an hour to find the bags. They rebooked the flight the second time eventually after I spent an hour and a half talking with the reservation agent and the check in agent. Both of whom kept saying that I would have to talk to the other. The fact that Air Canada is a star alliance member is mind boggling given that their customer service and flight operations are so poorly run. I can safely say I will avoid any and all Air Canada flights from now on.

### "Absolute disaster of a company"
Not Verified |  Absolute disaster of a company. I can't remember the last time I flew with them and didn't have a flight delayed or canceled. This time our flights from Saskatoon to Moncton via Toronto got canceled, rebooked on a late flight to Toronto and morning flight to Moncton next day. Stuck in Pearson overnight, refused a hotel voucher. Both new flights delayed. Still sitting here waiting for the flight to Moncton, been delayed about 5 times, about 6 hrs beyond what was already a lost day of our lives. I don't know why we even bother, would be cheaper and faster to rent a car and drive across the country. I would never use Air Canada again except we basically have no other choice in Canada.

### "no updates on flight status"
Not Verified | Flight got cancelled and rescheduled after having spent 4 hours in the airplane, parked with no updates on flight status and if or when we'd take off. More than 28 hours of so called 'delay'. Very little communication or ways for them to compensate and make your journey less painful. Air Canada pay their staff poorly and treat them also poorly hence why to call this company pathetic is a compliment. Next time I might as well walk.

### "customer service poor. 2 hour hold"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever! Spirit would be better - customer service is poor. 2 hour hold time! Won't help or give refund! Avoid these people! I'd rather take the bus than fly with them.

### "away from home with no luggage"
We arrived from Tokyo to Miami after having a layover in Canada. We asked at least 9 employees between Tokyo and Canada if we should pick up our luggage and check it back in or if there was anything we had to do in order to not have the luggage forgotten at the layover in Canada. Three of them had no idea what the proper process was and of them told us we did not have to do anything and it would ship directly to Miami. We arrived in Miami and to our surprise our luggage was not there. We then received a text message saying the following “Bag is delayed Tag # (Booking #) Expected to arrive in Miami MIA May 27 22:29 Arrange delivery here: flyac.ca” we arranged the delivery and again to our surprise the luggage is not getting to Miami until tonight and will not be delivered till 3 days later. We called to see if they would provide us with some funds to be able to purchase the necessary items needed for the time being and we’re told we would have to purchase them on our own and maybe after we could put a claim in and see if they approve it or not. We asked for a time line of how long the approval usually take and we’re refused an answer. We asked to speak to a supervisor and we’re told they do not have any supervisors that could help us and refused to put us trough to a supervisor after which they told us to hang up. When we said we would not hang up until we spoke to a supervisor they put us on hold and hung up. We are now left in a city away from home with no luggage and no resources to get the necessities we need.

### "been changed to basic economy"
I booked a return ticket and today received this email for my return flight. I have always supported them and used for my business for years; however, today I received notice that my Premium Economy flight (I had already applied eupgrade to business) from Montreal to Malaga via Zurich has been changed to basic economy. How can an airline treat clients like this, they stated; "We're sorry your itinerary has changed due to unexpected business or operational constraints on our planned flight schedule and we have automatically rebooked you on another flight.

### "We had no seats assigned"
My party of 5 booked with Air Canada to fly from Las Vegas to Vancouver and Vancouver to Sydney in October 2022. I was travelling with my elderly parents and paid more to get the premium seats with extra leg room for all persons in our party. I also chose the flights to ensure our transit and waiting times were not too long, as our party and especially my elderly parents would not cope well long transit times. In November 2022, I received notification due to change in flight schedules, our new flight and transit time in Vancouver would now be 12 hours. This would not work for us, and based on the Air Canada email I would log onto the Air Canada notification I would log onto the Air Canada website and make changes to the new flights or request a refund if the new schedule did I work. If seemed there were no other flights or information available for me to reschedule and so I wanted to cancel our flights to book with another airline, to get a refund the website said to contact Air Canada. This is when I found out there is NO WAY to communicate with Air Canada outside of Canada and the US. I searched all over the internet and only found numbers for people within Canada and US. At my wits end, I posted a message on the Air Canada Facebook. I got a response, and I explained the situation with my parents and that a 12 hours transit time was not workable for my situation, and if there were any other flights available with shorter transit times. I didn't get a response for 4 weeks, and had to continually send messages via Facebook. I informed them of the urgency and the need for a response, I requested that if flights with shorter time I wanted a refund, so I could purchase tickets with another airline. I got a response. I explained that the final leg of my flight from Vancouver to Sydney we had bought specific seats in row 18 with extra leg room, and wanted to confirm there seats were still ours. I was assured that seeing that flight and plane had not changed, so our booking and seats remained the same. I breathed a sigh of relief. All this took 2 months! Then at the end of Feb 2023, about 9 weeks before I was due to leave for my holiday, I received another notification that my flights had once again been rescheduled to the 12 hours transit schedule! I was furious and distressed and once again, had to message Air Canada to explain the situation again, and why a 12 hour transit time did not work and posed a risk to my parents health. I also requested a confirmation that our purchased seats had not changed. I got a response on Facebook and our flights were once again moved to the flights that I had been rescheduled to. They could not explain by my flights had been moved to the 12 hours transit time! Then in May 2023 24 hours before our flight was due to leave from Las Vegas > Vancouver > to Sydney I got the standard check-in email for our flights. I logged in and to my surprise, the seats in row 18 we have purchase 8 months ago were no longer our seats. We had no seats assigned let alone seats with extra leg room. On the app I got a message that if I wanted extra leg room, I would need to pay $164 per seat. The seats in row 18 were no longer available. I spent 30 minutes on hold and another 30 minutes with the person on the phone, who confimed I had purchased there seats 8 months ago, but coudln't explain these seats were no longer available.

### "a LOT to learn about customer service"
I was flying from London to Cape Breton to visit family. I chose a flight with Air Canada because the connections were good - departing London at 9:20 am to Montreal, then Montreal direct to Sydney, arriving late afternoon. Very civilised. However, the flight was more than an hour late departing from London and as a result I missed my connection in Montreal. They rebooked me from Montreal to Toronto, then on to Sydney, arriving at midnight. Effectively adding eight hours to my trip. I requested a pass for the lounge to compensate for the extra time I had to spend in the airport at Montreal. I am an AC frequent flyer, but had already spent a lot of my points. I would have had enough points for lounge access if they had added on the flight from London, but they flatly refused to grant me access in spite of the trouble they had caused me. Air Canada has a LOT to learn about customer service. Besides which, the food is terrible and the service lackadaisical at best. I will avoid them in future if I can. WestJet is the better choice.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Delayed 5 hours I’m Cincinnati for a 1.5 hour flight to Toronto, causing us and 8 other passengers to miss a connecting flight to London. Horrible customer service in Toronto. No compensation for the inconvenience when this has been a birthday trip planned for months. Hotel room in London wasted for the night. Will never let friends or family fly with this airline and will encourage anyone I walk to while traveling to completely avoid them.

### "most unpleasant transatlantic flight"
I fly internationally five or six times a year and recently completed a flight from Frankfurt to Vancouver on Air Canada 839. This was a fully booked flight and because we did not check in soon enough, my wife and were stuck sitting in seats 30 B and C. This row of seats had no window and where there should have been two seats the airline shoved in three, and the door to a toilet was directly beside us in an already narrowed corridor? To somehow squeeze in beside our fellow passenger seated in 30 A seat with no window we were crammed into the equivalent of a 3/4 seat with limited ability to even rest our arms during the flight. It all added up to the most unpleasant transatlantic flight I have ever been on. The bottom line? Air Canada on row 30 on this plane you need to remove a seat! This plane is designed for two seats instead of three in this row, especially with the washroom right there.

### "how badly they handled our luggage"
My family and I flew with Air Canada just two days ago from Sydney to Boston, with two layovers in Vancouver and Montreal. Our flights were delayed, particularly the Montreal to Boston which was delayed by around 2 hours (making the wait 6 hours) and the food was not exactly appetising either - which isn't even the important part. The main thing I really wanted to complain about was how badly they handled our luggage. After our 24 hours of travelling, after arriving in Boston, the last thing I wanted was for us to find out, how our luggage had been stuck in Montreal. And we weren't the only ones - half the passengers on this same flight were also in the same situation. We ended up having to leave the airport with nothing other than our carry-ons which did not hold much and simply had to wait for our luggage to be delivered, hopefully early morning the next day, as they told us. However, even that would not be the case. Our luggage was told to arrive that following morning, yet it did not. We had absolutely nothing and thus our initial personal schedule was pushed back and we could not do the plans we had made. They had delayed our luggage delivery saying that it would get to our door anytime before 7PM. And so we just waited. Until they told us that it would come at 8PM. We waited once again. Later we called them to find out that they could not even contact the delivery people who were supposed to be delivering it, which we found extremely unprofessional. And just as a further note, our suitcases were apparently at Boston since that morning, yet they failed to do the simple job of delivering it at the expected time they had informed us with. Not only that, they must have left our suitcases in the pouring rain as even when we did receive our hard case suitcases, half our clothes and items were very wet and soggy which added onto how annoying this situation already was. They did not compensate, no nothing. I will not be traveling with this airline again in the future.

### "Uncomfortable seats"
Horrible customer service. Awful Lounge and food/snacks. Need to pay for headphones. Uncomfortable seats. Did not honor Star Alliance Gold benefits (baggage allowance).

### "treated so badly as a customer"
I have never been treated so badly as a customer. Although some of the attendants were friendly and kind, there was a very rude, unhelpful, entitled attendant who just seems to treat everyone is such a foul way. Our flight time also had changed and never received an email with the update. We had issues checking into our flight 24 hours before. They seem to split up people travelling together and were spread throughout the plane with no sense of organization. All in all, during our trip we flew 5 different airlines and Air Canada was the worst experience. I will never fly Air Canada again!

### "inside the airport was a complete screwup"
I didn’t mind flying Air Canada. We went from Kamloops to Toronto to Cancun. The problem was that you have to buy everything you don’t get anything free except for a drink, water or juice or pop which is fine But four hours from Kamloops to Vancouver, and buy a bag of peanuts for six dollars is not acceptable. Then we flew from Toronto to Cancun, but we didn’t get a chance to buy anything much in Toronto because we arrived at 5:30 am and there was nothing really open. We had a really bad experience in Toronto on the way back. No Air Canada representatives would help us. We just got sent in circles continually. my friend was trying to put her vanilla for a checked bag, but all they did was make us go through security three times send us upstairs downstairs, and when they did, we had nowhere to go to check her bag we almost missed our flight, but by the grace of God, we caught it, and Air Canada held the flight only because there was a maintenance issue. No signage nobody to help nobody directing us nobody guiding us nobody taking us to where we needed to go to check the bag. There is only two lovely ladies that helped us, and nobody else did nobody was at the customer service desk downstairs. Some lady was standing there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody and nobody was there. me and my friend would like to be compensated for the hour running we had to do going up and down three times Through security through the gates, back through security back through the Gates and for her loss of her $50 in American dollars. There needs to be better service. I appreciate all the flight attendants all the people at the gates all the people that helped because they did their job but when we got to the airport inside the airport was a complete screwup.

### "very professional and efficient"
This was a flight in the economy cabin and a full flight. Boarding was done by zone and proceeded very quickly and efficiently. Only thing that added to the boarding time was the inordinate amount of "drag on" luggage. Prior to boarding the Customer Sales and Services Agents were very proactive in getting some passengers to gate check their baggage. When boarded I found the aircraft to be very clean and the IFE was working beautifully. On board service was very professional and efficient with an excellent choice of the In-Flight Bistro, During the flight the F/A's came by with water service two or three times. The Service Manager was a real treat to talk to and very hospitable like the rest of her crew.

### "Flight Attendants were very helpful"
YVR to YYJ is a very short sector of 12 minutes on average in the air. Boarding was efficient into a very clean regional type of aircraft. There was no service as this sector is short but the Flight Attendants were very helpful with "drag on" baggage. Deplanement in YYJ was very quick and easy as they used a aft door as well to speed the deplanement.

### "minimal assistance and service"
Not Verified |  No food or accommodation on long flights, minimal assistance and service. Terrible and expensive services for region which they cut further while increasing prices. Terrible monopoly business - would not survive anywhere else in the world.

### "treated rudely in security"
We had a slight delay at the beginning, which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control. On the flight my wife became extremely sick. We pressed the button to call for an attendant, no one ever came to check on us. When we landed we had a substantial delay, which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control. We were late to our connecting flight. While in security the first person yelled at us for being late. We were treated rudely in security. We got to our gate 10 minutes before departure. None of the attendants at the gate would talk to us, we waited several minutes and then left to find customer service instead. The customer service clerk was helpful and quickly scheduled us to the next flight to our city.

### "another awful experience of a dysfunctional airline"
Just another awful experience with Air Canada. Flying from Toronto Pearson to Seattle to connect to another flight there. The flight was delayed, and kept on being delayed for close to 4hrs, by which time it was no longer necessary to travel (as I would have missed my connection). The ground staff helped me to cancel my check in and confirmed that I would no longer be flying, and I must say they were extremely helpful, and offered whatever assistance they could. However, everything from then was a nightmare. As I checked two pieces of luggage, it was not possible to retrieve it until the next day. When I returned to the airport to try and locate the bag, I was informed it went missing but the staff assured me that it did not leave the airport. I filed a missing bag report, and then followed up repeated for over a month. Granted, Toronto Pearson had experienced a severe backlog of delayed/lost luggage due to a recent storm, but then this is not helped by the fact that every time I spoke to an AC representative, I was told a different story. Only a month of following up and hoping for the best did I receive both bags back--one of which was damaged beyond repair. I should add that AC were quite responsive in processing my claim for compensation, as I needed to purchase clothing and essentials as a result of the lost luggage. And they paid back every expense (though that did take a while to process). Also, AC did compensate me for the damaged bag as well. Other than this, just another awful experience of a dysfunctional airline (though some of the staff have been quite friendly and helpful).

### "plan for the delays"
Not Verified | Absolutely awful planning by the staff. They haven’t done one thing to help me and my flights were delayed for 3 hours making me miss my flight and making me travel to 3 other airports. They are a disaster. I’m currently 36 hours on the planes my flight from Calgary to Edmonton is 1 hour long but instead I’m going to Vancouver, Kelowna then Edmonton with 13 hours of waiting if you have to be anywhere important make sure you plan for the delays.

### "flight got postponed for 24 hours"
I received an email 1 hour before the flight that the flight was canceled due to maintenance issues. They returned all the bags to us and didn't do anything for us. They said it was canceled due to weather issues (although the email said something else). They didn't provide any voucher for a taxi or hotel. My flight got postponed for 24 hours.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Horrible customer service who was not empathetic with my flight being cancelled and Air Canada not being able to accommodate me on a different direct flight that day. Did absolutely nothing to make up for the schedule change. Horrible. Will never fly with Air Canada again.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience. Travelled with two small children and two car seats. When flight was booked it stated one carryon and one personal item per passenger. We took 2 carry on bags and strapped the car seats to each for more convenient transport since we had two small children in tow. When we went to get boarding passes, they told us we had to check our carryons. I told them it was our mode of transport for the car seats and they said it was policy on small full flights that all carryons be checked unless flying business class. I said can we just check at the gate if there is truly no space. Again told no. I said it would have been nice to have been told this information sooner than the day of the flight o we could have arranged for a different mode of transport for the car seats or packages them properly to check them. The first gate wasn’t too far but to get to the connecting flight it was far. We had to carry these bulky awkward car seats with no good surfaces to hold the entire trip. When we boarded the first flight and the flight attendants were closing the overhead storage compartments, they closed several empty compartments, yet we had to check our bags. Upon arrival to our destination we found that they had now lost our carry on luggage that they forced us to check in the first place. Reported that it was not there and they told us it was in our layover city and they would get it in next possible flight and deliver that evening or next day. Second day of no luggage and we are going to have to buy more diapers and toothbrushes and hairbrush and at least a change of clothes for our children. They cannot even tell us where the luggage is when we call. They are marked and scanned throughout the process so how is that not registering in the system when they enter in the id number for the tagged bags. This is not the first time we have lost luggage on a flight, but it is the first time we have not been able to get information regarding the process of retrieval. There is no good contact number to just call and file a complaint. It was an email process. This airline is in no way accommodating to family travel aside from somewhat early boarding. They give conflicting information when you do talk to a company representative, and offer no real answer as to how they are working to resolve your issue. They offer zero compensation for the major inconvenience.

### "I have lost all faith"
I have had a very bad experience with Air Canada. I was flying round trip from London to Toronto late last year and they completely destroyed my luggage. After a rude encounter with the Air Canada lady at Toronto airport I had to go through months of unanswered emails and calls to try and sort out the situation. Eventually they agreed to refund me for my damaged baggage 3 months later. However, they would only send me a compensation in a Canadian bank account, which of course I don't have as I am a tourist. I explained this over multiple emails and calls, but nothing happened. I was told repeatedly to just be patient and they would contact me when they could find the time! That never happened. The voucher for the compensation expired and they never answered my demands for an alternative payment type. It has now been over 6 months and I have lost all faith. I believe they never intended to compensate me or indeed any other foreigner. I am convinced that if I was a Canadian they would have compensated me ages ago.

### "force me to pay the check in luggage cost"
It has been an interesting experience with Air Canada today, I had flew frequently by carrying on the same carry luggage in February 2023. I had no problem flew with porter three days ago from Ottawa to Toronto, unfortunately, I was stopped by a crew who targeted me and force me to pay the check in luggage cost rudely, and even spoke to his manager beforehand when I requested to speak to. I saw many others carrying bigger luggage than mine, they even didn’t have any problems to get into the gate! My carry on luggage is the right size and needs to push in the measurement but was considered as non compliance. My question is what’s the standard rule with Air Canada to screen luggage and passengers. I made my promise never fly with them again and caution people to be sensitive with the people who work at the Pearson airport.

### "a great experience"
Not Verified | We flew from Toronto, Canada (YYZ) to Providenciales, Turks and Caicos (BPV) for vacation. Everything was amazing the crew was easily 5 stars, we met one of the flight attendants at the gate and saw our kids looking at all the planes, she offered them to sit in the cockpit once we made it to our destination. The kids enjoyed the flight. The flight came with complimentary drinks, the food did cost extra we didn't purchase but other passengers were saying it was well worth it. The IFE had lots of options and the WIFI was very fast. The pilots made a very soft landing we deboarded in 5 minutes, we did deboard last because the pilots let the kids stay in the cockpit for a bit, they learned so much! Overall definitely fly with Air Canada had a great experience.

### "Total disregard for their customers"
Not Verified |  Flight was supposed to be on Feb 24 to Manila via Vancouver. The flight was cancelled on Feb 24 (I was already checked in online), due to "technical issues" we flew on Feb 25 but the flight was delayed by two hours, hence, we missed our connecting flight. They re-booked us on a different airline but in economy (our seats were supposed to be Premium Economy). Tried to complain at the airport bur nobody knows anything at the desk so they gave me a pamphlet on how to claim. Then there's the retrieval of our luggage (tagged "Priority Handling"). Nobody at Vancouver airport knows where our luggage's are to be retrieved so we lined up for two hours at luggage claim (not knowing whether we were in the right line). We asked somebody wearing uniform and holding a walkie talkie (two of them actually) - they said they will find out and walked away quickly - never came back. After two hours online we were given directions to re-book and go back to the same counter where there were more than 80 people lined up. We rebooked our flight successfully - no help from Air Canada. Returned to the line and after another 45 minutes, were able to retrieve our luggage. This was the most horrible experience in my 30 years of flying. Upon return I followed the instructions on re-claiming. After a week, Air Canada came back with claim denied because it is not within their control - "Technical Issues". Everything is a technical issue with this airline. Total disregard for their customers. Never again.

### "They do not care about their customers"
Not Verified |  The worst airline on the planet. They will cancel your flights, make you sleep in the airport and not refund your money after you find a competent airline to get you home. I made it home with the other airline before the Air Canada flight ever left. They will make you wait in very long line ups and then spend hours on the phone to get zero results. They do not care about their customers.

### "Excellent service and after support"
Not Verified |  Excellent service and after support. My car seat was missing, they refunded the amount. I had issues with my flight in Toronto and they have returned hotel and other expenses. Keep up the good work.

### "disgusted in the customer service"
Horrible Customer service. Our first flight was delayed 6-7 hours due to “technical issues” which was going to make us miss our connecting flight, and the only other flight they could get us on was 7 hours after we land in our connecting city,  a total of 13 hours in delays and the only compensation they gave us was one, $300 MXN or ($20 CAD) voucher for food at only one restaurant for the 13 hour delay. It was almost insulting to receive that voucher. I am disgusted in the customer service and policies they claim the must  follow.

### "the worst airline I've flown"
Not Verified |  Awful. We had two legs - first in a Dash-8 from SEA to YVR, then a 777-300 to LHR. Our first flight was delayed by an hour for a number of reasons. When we landed the connecting flight was already in the boarding process and we had to high tail it straight through the airport. Good job we were travelling light with carryon only - at Heathrow we passed a crowd of unfortunate travellers who had checked bags on the first leg and none of them had made it on the second flight. This included a couple whose carryon had been checked because there wasn't enough room overhead. The main leg of the journey was 9.5 hours. The legroom in economy was abysmal - I'm 5'11 and I had to put my knees in the little hard nooks either side of the seat under the next row's armrests. I was fortunate that passengers sitting each side of me were quite petite and were able to twist sideways a little for us all to fit. The entertainment system was good, although don't expect headphones to be provided by Air Canada. You can request earbuds that hurt after an hour or so of use, so make sure you bring your own nice headphones. The food was awful. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian special meal - usually a safe bet for a bit of flavour on an airplane. It came warm on the outside and still frozen in the center. No bread or butter - it consisted of a small portion of plain cous cous, a some rice with a single cauliflower floret, and a tiny pot of tinned fruit salad. The regular meal seemed to be equally unappetising - chicken in tomato sauce. I noticed that my neighbours on the flight both left most of theirs. But at least they got a roll and a slice of cheese with their meal. I also had no drink with my meal, as they served all the special meals first before prepping the others, and they brink the drinks cart round after the regular meal cart. The stewardess who seemed to be most in charge of things had an awful attitude with both passengers and her colleagues. Didn't see a single smile out of them the whole flight. You get a comically small bottle of water on the plane, but getting hold of anyone for another is an absolute mission. I managed to catch a stewardess as they were walking up the aisle to ask for some water, they just said that a bar service would be coming through shortly. It did, albeit an hour later, and that was the only time cold drinks were served on the flight. I also saw some poor victim get the same treatment from the other side of the aircraft - came to the galley to ask for a soda, told to return to his seat and they'd be coming through soon, which they didn't. The 2nd meal wasn't a meal, it was a small dry muffin. (That came with a salt and pepper sachet for some reason). I would avoid Air Canada like the plague. You expect better from a flag carrier, but I'd rather spend 9.5 hours on a budget short haul flight than fly AC again. Certainly the worst airline I've flown with so far.

### "consistently and extremely awful"
I travelled round trip from Seattle to Punta Cana via Toronto. On the way there, there were several issues. First off, seats were highly uncomfortable. Furthermore, the cushions were poorly secured, and slid around underneath you. The leg room was nonexistent. I literally could not fit my knees in front of me on the plane. There were no power outlets or Wi-Fi on the plane. The return flight was what really set this experience apart though. Terrible seats, no leg room, no amenities. However, the airline made a mistake scheduling the flight, causing it to be 3 hours delayed. Our layover was 3 hours and 40 minutes, which meant that we would have 20 minutes to get to our gate. We contacted the airline about this, and they assured us that we would easily be able to make our connection (quote “that is plenty of time to get there”), and that they would hold the plane back a few minutes to wait for us if necessary. Upon arriving after an uncomfortable and long flight, we could not make it to the other gate in time, and they refused to hold it back for us. The airline scheduled us flights to Seattle the next day, with a layover. We were supposed to get to Seattle Sunday afternoon, but our new flight plan had us arriving late Monday evening. We then waited over 2 hours in line at a very busy and crowded Air Canada service desk. the service was incredibly slow, but eventually they told us that there were much better flights we could have got that would have gotten us home much earlier, but they sold out in the time we stood in the line. I am writing this review from the run down hotel they offered us, after having a meager dinner with the insufficient food vouchers they gave us. I fly a lot, but my entire experience with Air Canada was consistently and extremely awful.

### "crew aloof and uninterested"
Fort Lauderdale to Montreal on Air Canada. Check in was smooth and handled by a friendly and courteous agent at the Priority counter. Unfortunately things went downhill from there on. Boarding was absolute mayhem with gate agents giving conflicting instructions. To make matters worse, instead of using the zone-based queues at the designated gate, they decided to use the lanes of the neighbouring gate causing a mass migration, not to mention confusion, for some 200 passengers. The gate agents were not only unorganized they were actually surly with the passengers. In the end it became a free-for-all boarding experience. When I got on board, I mentioned the chaos at the gate to one of the agents who was not even remotely interested in hearing about it and pretty much brushed it off. We were almost 40 minutes late leaving FLL which stretched the flight duration from 3 hours to 4 gate to gate. During this time the FA’s came around with water and beverage service only once and acted as if they were doing the passengers a favour. In all my travels around the globe I have never encountered a flight crew so aloof and uninterested in doing their jobs. The hard product was decent and the IFE had a good selection of movies, music and games. The washrooms looked like they had not been tended to in weeks and they surely were not going to receive any attention from the crew operating the flight. After landing, it took almost 40 minutes for the bags to be delivered. I have travelled over 1.3 million miles with Air Canada and this one has to be the poorest experience I have had.

### "seats that are comically narrow"
The seats that are comically narrow for an average-sized person. I made the mistake of purchasing two round-trip tickets from Orlando to Montréal, hoping for a comfortable flight next to my wife in a two-seat row. Unfortunately, the seats proved to be too small by 2 to 4 inches for most people, and for me, almost six inches. While I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 280 lbs, I am not excessively large. As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off, I had to stand for the entire flight until it was back on, as there was no comfort in those seats for either me or my wife. The flight attendants were indifferent to our plight. In particular, one of them kept knocking into my wife whenever she passed by. Although it was probably not intentional, my wife eventually had to change seats to avoid her. Moreover, the crew at the Orlando airport was making overlapping announcements, making it impossible to comprehend their boarding process and group numbers.

### "It was not possible to get hold of anyone"
Terrible airline! My direct flight was cancelled due to bad weather. Air Canada rescheduled my flight for the next day with a layover without checking if that works for me. My and my husband tried to contact Air Canada to cancel rescheduled flights but no one was answering the phone. It was not possible to get hold of anyone. I tried to dispute $427 transaction without success. Don’t use this airline!

### "last time I will fly with Air Canada"
Flight late leaving YVR to Vienna via Toronto because (we were told by captain) it took too long to load bags. Although we had a layover of about 90 minutes, we were so late leaving that Air Canada canceled the flight from Toronto to Vienna and put us on a flight via Frankfurt 4 hours later. This was despite the fact that, when we landed, our our original flight was still at the departure gate. We were told that there was not time to transfer our checked luggage. Now for comparison, pretty much the exact same thing happened coming home excpt it was Lufthansa. They had a shuttle pick us up immediately on arrival at Munich (which we were flying via) and take us to departing flight. They hustled (a word that seems not to be in Air Canada’s vocabulary) and got the bags transferred. We were of course late leaving but this was made up on the long flight - something AC seems not to have considered. As a national airline it is a true embarrassment. I wish this was the first time but it is not. The last time I will fly with Air Canada.

### "Unacceptable customer service"
The worst airline to travel with. I have had baggage issues twice with this airline. The last one was in Oct. 2022 and they still haven’t refunded me for my broken bag which was due to their negligence. They don’t even give a single cup of coffee free in their flight. When it comes to refunding, they just take you round and round and they say oh the case is being escalated. For $250 USD I have been waiting for 6 months now. Unacceptable customer service at every level..

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service, change our flight schedule from early morning to midnight. Instead of finding an option I was asked if I just want a refund. Disregard whether customers has plan on the day of arrival, or has booked a hotel or rent a vehicle, Air Canada can just change the schedule without letting you know

### "will avoid flying with them"
So so bad! My flight in to NYC - even though I have confirmed my ticket months ahead of time. I ended up having a standby ticket? On my way back I've had to check my carry on and wait for it at the carousel. Staff were rude! Now I hate that airline and will avoid flying with them ever again.

### "substandard food"
Not Verified | AC your long haul inflight catering and quality of service needs to be improved. Imagine on a 14 hour long flight the food was tasteless some kind of chicken on a bed of plain rice or some type of beef. The snack offerings were almost non existent. While bottled water is great on other airlines during a long flight snacks such as chips and items such as small ice creams are offered. If you are travelling with young kids bring your own snack etc., cause on AC all you get is substandard food and a very over crowded aircraft for 14 hours. AC your long haul is not good enough if you are the best rated airline in North America. I shudder to think what the other North American airlines offer on their long haul services. Next trip I am going to take Singapore or ANA.

### "Do not use this company"
Do not use this company. I just purchased two tickets for my wife and 7 year old daughter, and I paid extra money for seats that can seat right next to each other. But when she checked in and board airplane, the seats are not the same we're supposed to have. They had to sit separately. So I called Customer service and they said they don't care, there is nothing they can do. They did not say sorry and couldn't refund the money that I paid extra.

### "friendly, knowledgeable and fast"
Shout out to Phillip at the Kelowna desk for his professionalism. Check was a breeze, friendly, knowledgeable and fast. Thanks you made my trip beginning awesome.

### "excluded priority handling"
Boarding processes excluded priority handling for Star Alliance Gold pax. Departing flight was delayed, causing an impossible connection for my onward journey. Upon arriving at YUL, deboarding was delayed first to cool the engines, then because the gate was being shared with another flight from the USA; which had been given priority. As I was eager to make my connection, an Air Canada attendant suggested that I run ahead. When I did that, I was met with a gate agent who started yelling at me. They insisted that I return to the plane (which I did), they proceeded to take my boarding pass away and threatened to file a formal complaint against me; even though I had followed the guidance of the Air Canada attendant. The gate agent continued to berate me in front of other passengers. After finally boarding my connecting flight, they did not manage to deliver my checked in items. The special (VGML) meals I was served were farcical in standard. The airline charges for everything on its domestic routes, and after paying for headphones the entertainment unit did not work properly or have full seasons of shows (only two or three episodes per season).

### "They lost my luggage"
They lost my luggage on the first leg of my flight for the first 5 days of my vacation and I have to see if I get reimbursed for the new clothes I had to buy. And on my return flight, our flights from Toronto have been delayed and gates changed 7 times and some of the changes were over 30 gates away before changing them again less than 15 minutes later. Air Canada staff in the airports have been less than helpful, and in Toronto, staff was rude to passengers that were trying to make their connection flight due to their own delays.

### "Bring your own food"
Not Verified | 3 lessons learned traveling with Air Canada this month: Bring your own food. Don’t volunteer to check in your carry on luggage (no matter how much pressure is put on you because apparently there is not enough space on the plane) your luggage may end up on another flight and not get to your destination for a couple of days or ever. Hang on to receipts or confirmation numbers or ask for printed copies. If you’re told you’ll get a confirmation email to document a complaint or any dealings with Air Canada, chances are you never will.

### "it was a flight from hell"
On the day of our flight, Air Canada moved us out of our preferred seating that we had purchased, without our permission. We were informed at the departure gates that the refund would be automatic since the change was made by Air Canada, but we have yet to receive any refund. Instead I had to apply for a refund, which will take up to 45 days. At the gates when I asked to change back to my preferred seats, I was told that I had made the change myself, the system had moved my daughter to a regular seat because she did not have a K-eta. Both reasons were preposterous. First, my daughter and I were travelling together. She is a minor and there is no reason why I would separate her from me so that she would sit in a regular seat among strangers. Second, when I said that I did not make any changes to the seating and that I had paid for the preferred seats, the staff at the counter then said that it was the "system" that did it. The story went as follows. We did not get a K-eta three hours before the flight, and therefore the change was made automatically. I also did not have a K-eta, but I was not moved automatically. By moving my daughter to a regular seat did not make her more able to travel to Korea without a K-eta. Regular or preferred seating, one needed the K-eta. I also learned that in the meantime they had sold the preferred seat to another woman. I asked that my daughter's seat be reinstated because we were the original buyers of the seat. I was told that since I could get a refund for my daughter's seat but not the other lady (she had used up her refunds), they would not reinstate my seat. As a result of Air Canada’s actions, both my daughter and I were inconvenienced with the regular seats while the other lady enjoyed the preferred seat at our expense. In other words, Air Canada has placed the other woman’s interest over ours. Is this their corporate policy? They then took 20 minutes to sort out the seating. I was suggested the last row of the plane, just in front of 4 toilets and the food preparation area. There was no other choice given to us unless we were prepared to be separated. I did not want to create a scene at the departure gate as we were already in the last hour before the flight. I reluctantly accept it because not to do so would cause further inconvenience with our travel plans. The seats turned out to be terrible and experience of the flight was excruciating for both of us. During the 12 hours flight, there was constant vacuum flushing of toilets, strong food smells emanating from the preparation area, a male crew member who talked non-stop in a loud voice, and a hysterical crying baby whose parents decided that the back of plane was a better area for her to calm down. Both of us did not get any sleep during the 12-hour flight. All in all, it was a flight from hell. The reason why we chose to pay for the preferred seats was to avoid the problems of being assigned to bad seats. However, Air Canada did not honor its contract with us. We had entered into a contract to fly on the preferred seats and Air Canada had unilaterally cancelled our contract.

### "go with a better airline"
My flight was delayed by more than 12 hours and they did not uphold the Canadian Air Protection rights I was deserving of. They were suppose to provide us with accommodation since it was an overnight flight and the delay was more than 4 hours, but they told us “we don’t offer that service” and we had to spend the night on the airport floor. I have had flight delays before, but I have never been treated so inhumanely. Please, please, pay a little more and go with a better airline.

### "What is the purpose of Star Alliance"
I flew on March 13 the routing Ottawa (YOW) - Toronto (YYZ) - Frankfurt (FRA) - Friedrichshafen (FDH). The first leg was with Air Canada, the rest on a separate Ticket with Lufthansa. Upon check-in in Ottawa I was informed that the tickets cannot be combined and that I had to reclaim my luggage in Toronto and re-check with Lufthansa. This was the first time that 2 Star Alliance tickets could not be joined, on may way to Canada I was even rerouted via Skyteam and it was possible. What is the purpose of Star Alliance then. Later in Toronto I was told that AC personal often has problems solving these issues. If ma flight from Toronto to Frankfurt would not have been delayed I would have missed the connection for sure!

### "a shout out to the Air Canada staff"
Not Verified |  I wanted to give a shout out to the Air Canada staff working the counter in St, Johns NL on March 3 2023 at 5 am. Myself and my wife got held up in Security that morning going on a family vacation to Orlando. Long story short we missed our flight because of the delay and the staff at Air Canada were so great they got us on the next flight to Toronto to catch up with the rest of the family in Toronto. All my years of flying the service and attitude of Air Canada staff was so Fantastic and bent over backwards to help us. A special Thank You to you all at the check in counter and at the gate - will definitely be flying our next trip with Air Canada.

### "extremely clear, helpful, and responsive"
Not Verified |  I have an upcoming flight. I made a mistake in entering my wife’s maiden name instead of her married, legal name. Air Canada was extremely clear, helpful, and responsive in resolving this issue. This started with their actually promptly answering the phone. I’ve been on hold with Aer Lingus for over 100 minutes, but was on hold with Air Canada for 30 seconds. This makes a difference. And the person who answered was very easy to understand and articulate - a native English speaker. I was anxious about the problem and asked a number of questions, on the phone and by email. In every case they responded quickly and clearly, making the resolution happen. I just needed a marriage certificate. They assured me they could resolve it promptly and when I did send the certificate it was resolved in a few hours. I’ve had very different experiences, say with Spirit Airlines. Not sure if it is resolved with them or not.

### "no reason for the delay"
Upon arrival from Cleveland, I began my layover until the scheduled 10:05 Pm departure. However, by shortly after 6Pm they were already warning of what turned out to be constant further delays until a scheduled 12:25 the next day. They began boarding us shortly after the rescheduled departure delay. We sat in a very full plane on the tarmac until actual departure at 2:47 Am. During the entire series of delays both in the airport and on the plane Air Canada gave us nothing including no reason for the delay. Their response to my complaint is that the reason was unscheduled mechanical problem of undefined nature.

### "such incredible and thoughtful staff."
I had a flight into Edmonton for a few meetings, and was scheduled to fly out immediately the next day. Somehow, I managed to join the same flight attendant crew on both flights. The Service Director, Dimitry, recognized me on the second flight and gave me a handwritten card expressing the crew's appreciation for little old me, economy class passenger, who was rushing to get home. What a nice touch! I showed it to my colleague who does the flight bookings for everyone in our office who's said she's never seen anything like that before. I really appreciated that kind gesture and excellent attention to detail! Air Canada is lucky to have such incredible and thoughtful staff.

### "uncivilized staff"
We were travelling from Cancun, Mexico to Boston USA, via Toronto , Canada and there was 6 hours lay over in Toronto (YYZ). Our flight was at 9 pm from Toronto to Boston, the incoming flight was showing delayed and supposed to arrive at 9:52 pm from New York but they were showing our flight was on time till 8:40 pm then suddenly announced flight was cancelled due to weather which was outright lies. They just can not blame the weather to avoid taking care of the passengers when flight between our destination was taking off and landing albeit with some delay. On top of that uncivilized staff and threatening passengers

### "makes travel a nightmare"
We flew from Atlanta through Toronto to Calgary on March 5, 2023. Our first flight was delayed well over an hour and the second one was 1.5 hours (almost all Air Canada flights delayed). There were no weather issues or other explanations offered to anyone. Also, while attempting to check-in online we realized they had not seated us together even though we had booked these flights 2 months prior. The only way to get seated together online or at the airport was by paying a seat upgrade fee, per person, per flight. Air Canada counter person also forced me to check a bag even though my luggage met the criteria for carry on. On both flights we noticed many others around us also separated from each other so among ourselves we moved around til everyone was seated together. We were also bumped from our second flight since an earlier flight had been cancelled, causing us to take a later flight and arrive home 1.5 hours later (at 1:30 am). I realize extreme patience is needed to travel these days but Air Canada makes travel a nightmare.

### "worst airline experience I've had"
By far the worst airline experience I've had. 3 of my 5 flights were delayed, causing me to miss several hours of my vacation, and eventually the final leg of my trip. The gate agents were rude, and refused to answer even the most basic question. My new luggage, purchased brand new at my destination and marked fragile, came back broken and looking as if it were a decade old, it's contents destroyed. I found the food was basically inedible.

### "Everything was decidedly average"
Everything was decidedly average/mediocre. Nothing stood out as being particularly good or particularly terrible. Food (chicken or veggie pasta) was passable and no worse than American/United (though portion size was very small). Only snack available were pretzels. Entertainment system had a good UI but the selection (especially for shows) was lacklustre. Seats in a 3x3x3 configuration and pretty standard for the 787 (seats are exactly the same as the ones on American). Given they have a near monopoly on the Canadian market, I will undoubtedly fly with them again. Wish there were better options though.

### "Very disappointing"
Not Verified |  The inflight WiFi didn't work, the power outlets didn't work, and the cabin and IFE screens felt old and outdated. The cabin crew were friendly enough, but not particularly outstanding. The flight was on time, but my following flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. Very disappointing, considering it was a flagship national carrier.

### "service was horrible"
Our flight was scheduled to leave at 8:55pm but we got delayed until 10pm due to bad weather, then it was canceled. The staff was unpleasant and practically shooed all of us across the airport to customs. We finally got a rebooked flight for 7:50am the next morning. We reached the hotel at midnight and got little to no sleep. Bottom line, the service was horrible and their crew need to return to school. This was my first and last time flying with Air Canada. I purchased their Wi-Fi, it took more than half the four hour flight from Vancouver to Toronto for it to start functioning.

### "No issues with the flight"
Not Verified | Just flew Vancouver to Bangkok direct. We were an hour late leaving but that's pretty usual these days. Seats were comfortable, entertainment system was good. Service was good, food was decent. No issues with the flight overall. Price was pretty expensive tho.

### "didn’t even get a sorry"
Trying to fly from New York to Toronto for the second day today. Agents are very unhelpful and the airline 24/7 call service is not reachable (they said it doesn’t work). They said that hotels won’t be provided and compensations not rewarded if we purchase somewhere else to stay and the best is just to sleep in the airport. We were provided voucher each for 10$ (it’s worth of 2 water bottles in this airport). We didn’t even get a sorry or something. This trip is a disaster.

### "No response from Air Canada"
Tried booking 3 tickets on Air Canada website which said an error has occurred. My card was charged but I did not receive a valid ticket number. The reservation temporarily appeared but also later disappeared off my account. No response from Air Canada - where is my tickets or my money? I tried calling and emailing Air Canada with no response.

### "we spent USD 3k on new clothes"
Flew Business Class with my wife from Dubai to Miami via Toronto. Arrived in Miami on 22nd December 2022 but Air Canada had lost both of our bags. We completed a lost bags form and were told we'd be contacted within 24hrs. Problem was that we were going on a cruise to the Caribbean departing on 24th December. On 23rd December the bags were no where in sight so we made the decision to go and buy new clothes. Three days into the cruise we were told by Air Canada that our bags had arrived in Sao Paolo. When we checked in at Miami airport to return to Dubai our bags were given back to us. I have registered a compensation claim as we spent USD 3k on new clothes and luggage but received no response. I will never ever travel with Air Canada again.

### "I never got an answer"
Besides losing my baggage, I arrived 5 hours late to the final destination. After filling all the reclamation and refund forms (process Air Canada definitively does not make easy if you are not living in Canada or the US), I never got an answer, even after almost 2 months.

### "a very positive experience"
Air Canada is the only airline flying non-stop from North America to Bangkok and this route appears to be a winner for them. The flight left on time late in the day and arrived in the early morning. Standard pod-style seating in the business class which allows one to sleep comfortably on this long (almost 16 hour) flight. Meals were very good, an area in which AC has made significant strides. I opted not to have a large meal immediately after take-off, but rather after sleeping, which was accommodated. This airline has an excellent selection of films in a number of different languages and from a variety of countries. Cabin crew was attentive. All in all, a very positive experience.

### "Bereavement Policy is a scam"
Bereavement Policy is a scam. First sentence of their bereavement policy is "Our bereavement policy offers reduced fares and the flexibility you need during a difficult time. But when I called customer support after I booked through bereavement policy they said they do not guarantee the lowest rate for bereavement fare. It's disgusting that I have to provide all this info to them (death certificate, info on funeral) and what do I get? An extra bag of peanuts for my troubles? I'm flying to Halifax instead of my actual destination of Charlottetown as it is $1000 round trip vs $1800 and then I look up a rates for round trip to Halifax on my own afterwards and what do you know $900, all the same days.

### "Consistently no coffee on flights"
Consistently no coffee on flights. This is not the first time it happening, I would say In my last 10 trips I have only been given coffee once. The more frustrating part is you are told “coffee maker is broken” or “we are brewing a fresh pot and will get back to you” never to receive or be offered an alternative. It’s frustrating, if you are not going to provide it just say so! Secondly, I was charged for a seat that I did not order, but couldn’t receive my boarding pass without paying for it, told to apply for the $ return online and given a website. Did so, received an acknowledgement that the request received and then that was it. probably costs about .30 cents to provide your customer a coffee, and to charge for a seat is ridiculous in the first place, but who knows maybe my $40 will break your bank Air Canada.

### "I really enjoyed it"
I flew on Air Canada from Montreal  to Bridgetown via Toronto. Normally I don’t really recommend flying with Air Canada but in this case I really enjoyed it. Total flight time including connections was around eight hours but everything went smooth. The flight attendants were very nice and caring. The food selection was very broad and surprisingly for the first time ever there was no delays on both flights. at the end, I really enjoyed our family time in Barbados. If you want to take it easy flights, I recommend flying with Air Canada.

### "like a brand-new airline"
After a multi-year hiatus from flying Air Canada due to poor past performance, we we absolutely astonished. This is not the Air Canada of yesteryear; this felt like a brand-new airline. Gate agents were smiling, in-flight team was excellent, seat pitch was fine and seat comfort excellent, even for my 6’2” frame. Food was excellent and well-priced. IFE was superb and the Thales multi-featured moving map is outstanding. Great job AC.

### "never take Air Canada"
Not Verified | Poor service paid $300 CAD for an extra baggage and the ticket price was $2000 CAD for one way flight. Flight was connected with Emirates flights delayed from Dhaka when my wife arrived at Dubai airport at Terminal 3. She can not see her flight number on the screen. After asking Emirates they told me that she need to go Terminal 1. There was nobody from Air Canada to give her any kind of instruction. After calling Air Canada customer service number they told me they are not physically present there they can not help my wife. Worst service and we will never take Air Canada in my life.

### "never travel with Air Canada again"
Not Verified |  I would like to share with you the lack of service from the flight from Toyko to Toronto. The flight was so cold we needed three blankets and we were still freezing. People were waiting hats and winter coats on board. Also when we arrived at Toronto airport we waited for over an hour and 45 minutes for our luggage to come through. Air Canada have clearly lost your capability of servicing customers and your organizational skills are appalling. Would never travel with Air Canada again. Shocking service.

### "service was bare minimal"
Not Verified | I consider myself a patriotic Canadian, I always tried to fly Air Canada because I wanted to support our national airline even if it costed me few $$$ more than the other choices. I write this with great deal of pain that my flying experience with Air Canada in the recent past has been nothing but disappointing. My most recent trip to England (Jan 18th to 30th) for a family tragedy was the last straw. I will try to avoid flying Air Canada unless there is no other choice! My experience from start to end was very disappointing. The service on the plane was bare minimal. The food was horrible. I went to the back of the plane to use the washroom and spoke to the staff, I mentioned how bad the food was, I said people feed their pets better food than what we had, the buns were like plastic (I noticed most of the buns went to the garbage because people didn't/couldn't eat them, staff was very sympathetic, one of them nodded and said "you should complain because they (AC management) don't listen to us". On my return flight I had a layover in Toronto. They didn't offer anything let alone the garbage food they served on previous flights. They were even trying to sell the lousy earphones that would cost then no more than few pennies. They treated me as a domestic flyer despite they charged me over $1600 for a flight that should cost no more than $1000.

### "best customer service experience"
Not Verified | Called Air Canada from Frankfurt to change my flight, was not able to do this online. The customer service rep was incredible, she was able to assist me, after I tried to do it myself for over an hour online. This was the best customer service experience I have ever had from any airlines. This representative did what I couldn't do in a couple of minutes. I waited less than 5 minutes on hold, I will recommend Air Canada to my family, friends and everyone else.

### "delayed by 3.5 hours"
We are delayed by 3.5 hours, i missed my connection they have no idea what to do and no information to provide. Other airlines departed on time, the weather is good so its just incompetence of the Air Canada.

### "Terrible from start to finish"
Terrible from start to finish. Hours and hours of delays because of “IT issues” hardly any updates. Why is this still happening? Don’t they have backup systems? I already avoid this carrier at all costs, next time I’ll force myself to try West Jet.

### "steer clear of this airline"
Air Canada left us with a horrendous ending to an otherwise amazing vacation. Flight out of Cancun at 2pm was cancelled last minute due to "maintenance issues". Got rebooked on a "9pm" flight that didn't end up departing until 10:45pm after waiting over an hour on the tarmac. The AC rep at Cancun also booked us on the late 9:45pm flight out of Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie stating "there was no earlier flight". We later found out that was a lie when 2 other friends booked the 2:10pm flight from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie, after the lady told us there were no other flights. We then arrive in Toronto at 2am thinking there would be AC reps waiting for us to get hotel vouchers and meal vouchers, no one at any AC rep desks until 4am when we finally got hotel and meal vouchers. You only get 20 dollar meal vouchers for the entirety of the next day, when our flight wasn't until 9:45pm. Not to mention, you can only use them at the airport, where a coffee will run you roughly 10 dollars. They also had no idea where we had to go to catch the shuttle to our hotel. Fast forward to the next day, we spend hundreds of dollars on breakfast lunch and dinner, all uncompensated before finally arriving to the airport around 8pm for our 9:45pm flight. We walk into the airport just in time to receive an email from AC stating our flight has been cancelled for a 3rd time now due to "crew shortages" this time. Again, we get our hotel and meal vouchers from thr AC rep. They again tell us we will not be compensated for meals outside of the airport before giving us another measly 20 dollars in terrible overpriced airport food. We are booked on a 11:15am flight tomorrow now, but I'm sceptical it gets out due to AC incompetence. Update: flight was in fact delayed until 2:30pm. I advise anyone wanting a pleasurable flying experience to steer clear of this airline.

### "Economy travellers are treated like cattle"
Air Canada in flight crew could have shown a bit of human decency but did not. We flew Victoria-Vancouver-Toronto-Miami. Victoria to Vancouver was delayed as was Vancouver to Toronto. This put us into Toronto an hour and a half late, cutting our connecting flight time to Miami in half (significant when you have to go through security and customs). We spoke to two attendants on the flight about this, both said they would check and neither of them got back to us. We were also seated at the back of the plane (Air Canada changed our seats at the last minute) so it took forever to just get off the plane, leaving us to run and scramble through the airport. Our plane was loading as we were at security. If flight attendants were decent (no extra work required) they could have asked passengers who did not have connections to remain seated while those that had tight connections left the plane. This would have given us an extra 15 to 20 minutes, and would have relieved the stress. We did make the plane just before the gates closed but only because passengers at customs let us through. No help from any flight personnel. Economy travellers are treated like cattle

### "painful experience"
Uncomfortable seat layout 10 abreast. Pitch and seat not suitable for long flights. Food is mediocre and cold. Flight delay and poor customer service was adding to painful experience.

### 2Extremely rude staff"
Extremely rude staff. The air hostess attending us screamed at my autistic son for making her go aside as she was blocking his screen. He wasn't given any meals/food, we had booked the tickets with a fruit platter for my son. In a journey where as a parent I was super anxious about how my son would do, he was made to feel bad and not taken care of. The air hostess in question leaned over to talk to a passenger sitting beside us blocking my son's TV screen twice. And shouted at him twice when he tried to move her away. We were in the last seats of the middle row. There's aisles on either side, she could've gone to the other side and catered to that passenger or someone else coming down on that side could have assisted him. The staff was obsessed with having our seats upright.

### "only one of our 3 bags arrived"
Not Verified |  I am a Super Elite 2 Million Miler with Aeroplan/Air Canada. Waiting for 2 hours only one of our 3 bags arrived. The AC baggage customer service employee at Pearson Terminal 1 confirmed, looking at the tracking system screen, our 2 bags were left in Montreal. According to his instructions I filed a report. Luckily, we waited for additional 15 minutes and the two bags arrived. Speaking to him again, he reconfirmed that the system is showing the bags were still in Montreal. He turned the screen to prove it to me, I could not see any proof that the bags were still in Montreal. Clearly, he did not know how to navigate the tracking system. We were lucky but there must be thousands of unlucky people left the airport. Air Canada and Pearson Airport need to improve the incompetency level of their customer reps to properly handle people's property.

### "intensely frustrated"
Not Verified |  Stunning incompetence and disregard for comfort, dignity and people's time. I have NEVER had an Air Canada flight that was anything less than painful. Between having to wait on the tarmac for more than an hour for both of my flights this trip, to them being unable to unload passengers at the end for unknown reasons, to our baggage not being made available for nearly an hour on the carousel. It is extremely difficult to be anything less than intensely frustrated. I will never fly air Canada again. Flight attendants were good, but other than that, this trip has been frustrating beyond reason.

### "exceptionally pleased with the service"
Not Verified | We sat in seats 2D and 2F. From the check in at the Priority Counter to getting off the aircraft at West Palm Beach, were were exceptionally pleased with the service we received. We would like to mention specifically the wheel chair assistance for my wife and the flight attendant in our cabin. All of them were exceptional. Please pass along our comments to the Air Canada staff

### "Traveling with Air Canada is a nightmare"
Not Verified |  I was booked on flight AC 1656 scheduled to depart for Tampa at 12.40 am and it delayed until 2 pm. Then it was canceled and they announced to adjust the passengers on AC 1658 leaving at 4.40 pm, which eventually delayed untill 5.15 and then it took off. Traveling with Air Canada is a nightmare and this is probably the worst airline in the world, deteriorating its standard every day. Being a national flag carrier it should have very high standards, but it is not. I will never ever fly with this airline.

### "bread crumbs on trays"
Casablanca to Montreal. My pillow was wrapped in plastic, supposedly to be kept clean, but there was somebody's hair inside that plastic. Disgusting. Also, bread crumbs on trays.

### "Disastrous delayed baggage policy"
Disastrous delayed baggage policy, 4 days and still nothing, they confirmed that the bag arrived in the airport the day after me, but they still could not identify it Plus, call center for delayed bags keeps you waiting literally for hours, it's absolute insanity. Do yourself a favor and steer clear from this airline

### "non-veg meal is over"
Flight delays for maintenance is horrible. Extending delays hour by hour. Even on a good day, flight getting delayed for no reason. Horrible food. After serving 4 rows, non-veg meal is over. Flight time is longer and price is sky rocket.

### "Last time we'll fly Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Coming back from Yellowknife made it to Toronto. Flight to the Soo was cancelled 3 times due to, according to Air Canada, no ground crew in the Soo. $20 voucher issued to each of us - about enough for a coke and bag of chips at airport prices. Luggage situation was ludicrous after having checked our bags then having to spend hours to retrieve them with each cancelation. Hotel room was offered for us (2 adult males) with one queen bed. Total chaos at the airport as no one could provide a straight answer to questions. Last time we'll ever fly Air Canada or route through Toronto airport

### "forced to check my carry-on"
Due to a ridiculous carry-on bag policy I was forced to check my carry-on for an additional $100 CAD. Fingers crossed all my luggage makes it to my final destination, but with this airline, you never know.

### "My suitcase didn't make it"
My suitcase didn't make it. It's been almost 72 hours and it's not here yet. I'm having a horrible experience in trying to communicate with the airline. I try to call by phone or chat and I keep getting responses from robots that are useless and annoying and direct me around in circles. I left a message through some online system and they did not respond. On the phone I waited for 30 minutes and got disconnected, then 90 minutes and got disconnected. The communication with their robots is useless and frustrating and there's no way of reaching a human.

### "delayed by 8 hours at Copenhagen"
Not Verified |  The flight was delayed by 8 hours at Copenhagen. Air Canada provided updated ETA for departure three times. After third time of further delaying the flight, they announced food voucher, which was 100DKK (about $19CAD). This amount was insufficient to buy a food from a restaurant at the airport. There was no other compensation by Air Canada to the passengers suffering the extremely uncomfortable stay at the gate lounge. Due to this delay and unclear communication, I missed a critical meeting at work (estimated arrival was at 2:45PM ET, and my meeting was at 4PM for client year end review) and it has severely impacted my work. My wife and children also got impacted due to the extreme stress they had to go through, with minimal support from the Air Canada staff. Technical issues may occur with any airline/ aur craft, however how are the passengers managed in such scenario is the key for a good/ reputable airlines, which unfortunately, Air Canada failed to do so.

### "Very very disappointing"
Delayed an hour before boarding and an hour after boarding. My dog was required to be at the airport in her carrier at 2:30. It’s 7:30 and we still haven’t taken off. I also have a cat who is on board with me who has been her carrier since 2:30. Have a 5 hour flight and there’s no taking off in sight. Very very disappointing

### "most unorganized and inefficient"
The most unorganized and inefficient airline. I usually travel with United however unfortunately sometimes tickets through United is operated by Air Canada, and every single time I’ve had an issue. No customer service, long check in lane, check in computers don’t work, flight always have delays and lost luggage is very common. This airline seriously needs to get it together or it is better to shutdown…

### "Delayed Flights, lost luggage"
Worst experience ever over the last month. Delayed Flights, lost luggage, staff who are very unhappy about the airline and not afraid to share it. In fact a pilot even shared his embarrassment over the PA on a flight from Toronto to Ottawa.

### "extremely irresponsible and awful"
Air Canada is definitely the most terrible airline I've ever used. They canceled and delayed their flight so many times and do not even apologize for their fault. Especially employees in Vancouver airport is extremely irresponsible and awful. They don't do anything but just stand and tell customers to just make a phone call if we need some help. I'll never use this shameless airline ever.

### "playing ads throughout the cabin"
They are now playing ads throughout the cabin at the start of the flight. Disgusting. Complained to an attendant who stated I am entitled to my opinion. This is the slippery slope to paying a fee to remove adds or having sponsored flights.

### "waited more than 3 hours on the line"
My baggage was delayed. I filled out the baggage delay form right at the airport. The Air Canada agent promised it to be delivered to my home address the next day. I can see in my status online as if my baggage was delivered, but it never did. I tried to reach their argent by phone and waited more than 3 hours on the line and no one replied.

### "nearly sabotaged my entire $8000 trip"
My agent arranged flights with United Airlines and Air Canada for November 1, 2022. Twice my flight were cancelled. Neither time my flight was rescheduled, nor did the airlines notify me. On October 11, I called Air Canada to ask which gate I should arrive at. They told me that my flight had been cancelled on Sept. 12. Had I not contacted Air Canada about departure information, I would not have known. I spent hours with both airlines in the next two days. I was charged another $163 from Air Canada. I had to purchase new flights to Winnipeg. United told me I was due a refund of $26, and refused to give it to me. I informed both United and Air Canada that only I be allowed to make any further changes. They agreed. On October 31, my agent emailed me. She stated my entire, original $805 United/Air Canada charge was disputed by me. It was not. Once again, I had to call the airlines to confirm that her allegations were incorrect. Once again, much more wasted time and stress. Again, on October 31, less than 13 hours before my departure, my agent cancelled my flights with United and Air Canada. The airlines never informed me. They allowed my agent to cancel the flights that I made on October 11, despite their assurances that they would not be allowed to intervene. I spent hours again on the telephone hours before departure hoping that I would be allowed to depart. This new flight resulted in a three hour earlier departure, with an extra stop in Chicago. On November 1, I had to spend more of my vacation time trying to arrange another flight home. These airlines have caused me many, many hours of work, stress and extra expenses. This has been a pitiful experience for me. They have nearly sabotaged my entire $8000 trip to Churchill, Manitoba. I believe that I am eligible for compensation and refunds.

### "I will never use Air Canada again"
I will never use Air Canada again. From the one way ticket cost at the start of December for the Christmas holiday from Calgary to Toronto to Windsor of 2000$ CDN, to saying my flight was canceled only then turning around and offering me the exact same flight number departing at the exact same time, all the way to losing my luggage on the way home, and then the attendant incorrectly entering my information in the system so now I can't even check the status of that lost luggage because he spelled both my name and my phone number wrong. What an absolute joke.

### "completely ruined my holiday"
Air Canada completely ruined my holiday. I flew from Zurich to Charlotte via Toronto. In Charlotte, my bag did not arrive. It finally was delivered three days later. Christmas ruined. I bought another bag and returned to Zurich via Toronto. This time, both bags did not arrive. One bag was delivered a day later and the other one, two days later is still missing. New Years plans ruined. This is only a fraction of the entirely miserable experience I’ve had going back for months since I first booked. Repeated flight changes and cancelations, a forced overnight stay in Toronto (nothing to due with weather) and constant re-booking of hotels and rental cars. Customer service is almost none existent. And often literally non existent. I don’t know what is going on with Air Canada but this is shocking. And somehow just very, very sad for all involved. Choose your airline very wisely.

### "Air Canada is out of control"
Air Canada is out of control! The organization has lost complete control of its Labour. The airline staff, the baggage handlers, the ticket agents. In this past week, December 23rd I flew from Vancouver to Toronto. Mother Nature had wreaked weather havoc across the country, Delays were expected and very much understandable. Many flights were cancelled by all airlines across the country 21 + 22 December. When I arrived at YVR for my flight on December 22 I was pleasantly surprised had our slightly delayed flight was indeed going to go today, in fact, Air Canada had organized four 777 aircraft including mine, to consolidate many of the affected customers. All four of these aircraft were departing for Toronto within an hour. So, after further delays, (2 more hours on the tarmac) we took off for Toronto. We arrived on the runway at 11:30pm, 4 hours after the original schedule l, but all too given the weather. Now the fun begins For the next 5 hours we sat on the plane, on the runway. With no updates or information we all just sat waiting. The airline staff would not serve us as much as a bottle of water. A gentleman behind me asked for some nuts several hours into the wait, told that everything was closed up. The airline staff, although being paid of course, were off duty as far as serving the customers! They did absolutely nothing for the customers, not even in Business class where we pay excessive rates, could we get a bottle of water during a 5 hour sit on the runway! A few days later Now December 27th, I am again on Air Canada flight in business class, Toronto to Doha to begin my journey back to Thailand. I have a 3 hour layover in Doha to connect to Bangkok. The airport (Terminal 3 Predominantly Air Canada) in complete complete chaos! Cannot even get to your boarding gates. Anyhow I do finally fight my way through the Air Canada customer crowds to get to my plane. As I sit in my seat, I receive a 35 minute delay notification from Air Canada. A while later I receive another 30 minute delay notice followed by a 15 and a 25. This goes on for 3 hours! Now I know my connection in Doha is As good as a gone. After take off I approach the In Charge to ask what happens now with me missing my connection l. I am advised to contact customer support after I arrive in Doha. Does anyone realize how long you wait to contact Air Canada customer support? Hours and hours if at all during their current spiral into Chaos! So bottom line, I am shot out of luck! Had to purchase another ticket! Sat in Doha airport sleeping on a bench for half day and Air Canada takes NO OWNERSHIP! And my final point to the readers, this 3 hour delay was due to shortage of baggage staff! This is the update the In Charge shared with me! They don’t have enough staff! Therefore they cannot get the planes loaded with your baggage on schedule! Have a look at the fields of baggage all over Pearson! It’s out of control! Don’t take the very high risk of flying with Air Canada You will be sorry you did

### "3-hour wait to speak with an agent"
Not Verified | We landed in Edmonton with no check-in luggage. Should have carried it on. Their baggage claim at the airport was over a 3-hour wait to speak with an agent. Way too long to speak with an agent for 5 minutes. Not sure if and when we'll see our luggage again.

### "every year it seems to get worse!"
Stay away from Air Canada if you can! This company has been dropping the quality of its service over the years. And every year it seems to get worse! The customer support line is horrible and you have to stay hours on the phone to get a hold of somebody. Good luck if you're late to a connecting flight or lost your luggage in a foreign country with Air Canada. You're pretty much on your own! Let's not forget about the incredibly complicated system to report a problem or request a refund after the fact. I feel that they do this on purpose to make it complicated so you give up on the refund. In addition, Air Canada is doing everything it can to take away your money. Until recently, you could take two 32 kg bags to countries with long routes, now it's a 23 kg bag and an absurd price to carry an additional bag. Air Canada does not care about you. I've had multiple experiences where my flight got delayed, they took 1.5 to 3 hours to pick up the phone when I needed it the most, left me stranded in foreign countries, cancelled the flight minutes before it should have left, not allowed me to board because of a simple name mistake that they took long to fix, deflecting ownership when tickets got purchased from other reputable websites, lack of seat or cabinet space due to overbooking, insane delays while leaving the Toronto airport, lack of communication between employees, and lack of of flight availability in connections. Do I need to go on? Do we all get the point? It's a shame for a company of this size and past reputation to get to such low standards. I've been traveling since I was a kid and I've always liked Air Canada. I always felt like I was "at home" when traveling with Air Canada. Nowadays, just remembering the name makes me angry because of the negative things the company did to me. Shame on Air Canada for firing thousands of their staff. This is one of the reasons why they are struggling to keep up with the customer needs. This goes to show how the leadership team at Air Canada are unprepared for the job and don't care about their customers or the company reputation. All they care about is their big fat bonuses at the end of the year. I really hate writing reviews but I felt an obligation to do so given the horrible service and after what the bad service they provided to me. Again, stay away from Air Canada if you can.

### "staff in baggage claim were a major help"
Not Verified | I have been stuck inside of Vancouver for three and a half days since December 24th of 2022 with no luggage. From the beginning I have been traveling with my family to visit my sister, brother-in-law, nephew and new-born niece. I have not been able to get in contact with my baggage since I have arrived, along with my family as well. However it is December 27th now and I have been able to receive all of our luggage. They have been left unattended outside as we got our bags back soaked from the rain and cold from the snow. Air Canada has been a horrible experience the entire journey through delayed and cancelled flights to losing hundreds of thousands of bags. Only a handful of the staff in baggage claim in the yellow vests were a major help in us retrieving the rest of our bags for a happy holiday vacation. This comment is solely appreciation towards them.

### "staff on this flight had terrible attitude"
Air Canada is really struggling to be bearable. Upon landing at Pearson, it was announced overhead 3 times with apologies that my Tokyo Narita flight had moved to another carousel (quite far away). All passengers migrated to new carousel according to announcement. Ultimately no luggage arrived and had been delivered to the previous original carousel (without announcement). The bags had been removed by airport staff and set aside (with hundreds of others). The passengers became irate at the baggage men. Baggage men instructed passengers that this is not them but rather it’s always Air Canada who is incompetent. The staff on this flight had terrible attitude and looked like they hated their jobs and lives. Always avoid Air Canada whenever possible. If they were not a federal government backed (near) monopoly they would never survive in the real world. Canadians need to allow Air Canada to fail without bailout so a new competitive travel market can replace it

### "did not offer to reschedule"
Not Verified | I booked a flight for my parents to go from Cleveland to Montreal to celebrate Christmas, their flight was supposed to be on Friday December 23rd afternoon, initially there route was Cleveland - Washington DC - Montreal, due to the storm the first flight was switched to connect in Toronto instead of DC, then the Toronto flight got canceled, the airline did not offer to reschedule and the kept Toronto - Montreal flight, the photo I shared is how long I have been waiting on the line to speak an agent, and it is still counting. They indicate my waiting to be 35-52 minutes

### "their plan is no information for customers"
Does Air Canada have a plan for bad weather? Obviously their plan is no information for customers, low staffing, can't reach them on the phone, completely disorganized, just dump people in the airport with no assistance. When I checked in to my flight from Frankfurt, the automated system checked me into my current flight and the next flight that was scheduled to Indianapolis. Indianapolis was canceled, but I was not checked out of the flight. Since I was not off-boarded the replacement flight is there but I can't check in because I was not off-boarded from the original flight. Sadly the check-in crew at the airport can't figure this out and tell me I have to speak with reservations. Reservations are over the phone only and they are not answering the phone. 24 hour later, I finally spoke to reservations and they informed me only check-in at the airport can off-board me from the original flight, they can only get me a rescheduled flight after check-in off-boards me from the original flight. The only way to speak to check-in is to stand in the line with people checking their baggage, so you stand in line for an hour or more. Then check-in says I'm off-boarded, reservations says I'm not. And they don't talk to each other. So I have to wait in the at bag check line for the 3rd time to tell them I am not off boarded. Finally get it straightened out, start checking into flight and it gets canceled. This was the first of 4 different flights to get scheduled and canceled. My daughter finally drove 10 hours to Toronto, Canada to pick me up. I did not know and Air Canada did not tell me that I needed a reference # from baggage at the airport. I was escorted 3 times into the international carousel area looking for my bag, someone could have mentioned this? Since I do not have this # I cannot put in a request for lost baggage on-line. And of course the customer support line for lost baggage is not taking calls. I understand this was weather related, but with some planning and an all hands on deck mentality, this could have been a tolerable experience for customers instead of a nightmare.

### "terrible customer service"
I am very disappointed with my experience with Air Canada. I had a flight booked for 5am on Boxing Day from Halifax to Toronto with a planned layover before heading to Vancouver. My flight was cancelled the night before due to a stated lack of crew members. I was told via text that Air Canada would be contacting me with alternative routes shortly - this never happened. Not only did Air Canada not contact me with alternate routes, but they did not make it clear at all that the only way to get rescheduled was to call in to their call center - which at the time of the cancellation was so busy that they would not even put me on hold. I woke up at 6am the next morning and headed to the airport myself to speak to Air Canada staff, where I was told to call their customer service line as they could do nothing about bookings. After multiple call attempts I was put through to an agent - who told me that there had been a flight from Ottawa to Vancouver - but that I had been too late. Meaning Air Canada could have made the arrangements to save my flight and did not. Air Canada then gave me a flight that would land in Vancouver three days later than expected, stating it was the earliest flight. I just called again to try and rebook and was on hold for over an hour. When the music stopped - there was a blank pause and I was hung up on. I have never had a worse experience with a business in my life. This is an example of terrible customer service, unclear communication, and disorganization.

### "After 3 days no news on luggage"
left Delhi on Dec 22,2022. When I land in Toronto I learned my 9am connected flight to Vancouve is canceled. After 17hrs at Toronto finally my flight depart at 11pm. The staff behaviour at airport is terrible. When we arrived at Vancouver after 35 min waiting for luggage they said no luggage go home and file on line. After 3 days no news on luggage. I am holding the line today from last 3 hrs to get any update. Won’t recommend any body to travel by air Canada.

### "not going to do anything about it or help you"
We began our journey with Air Canada on the Wednesday before Christmas. My boyfriend and I had planned to fly into Montreal as it is one of the closest airports to my childhood home. We wanted to have a nice dinner and do some sightseeing in Montreal before heading continuing our journey home for the holidays. We were scheduled to land in Montreal on that Wednesday night around 6:30 PM EST. We were delayed 3 different times, now making our departure from Tampa around 8 PM EST. During the boarding process Air Canada’s computer software needed to be restated and all passports had to be manually typed into their system. Because boarding took so long, we were now not leaving until about 8:45 PM EST. As my boyfriend and I were sitting in our seats waiting to taxi out to the runway, the captain came on and told the plane “The wing has been damaged. We are not sure if we will be able to fly or if it can be fixed. Well let you know as soon as possible”. We waited at the gate, with little to no communication from the airline crew for over 2 1/2 hours. At one point I walked back to use the airplane restroom and one of the stewardesses was laying down across the empty row of seats trying to sleep. We finally left Tampa after 11 PM EST and arrived in Montreal after 3 AM EST. We were scheduled to fly out of Montreal back to Tampa on the 26th of December. Christmas morning I received the email from Air Canada informing me it was time to check into our flight home. When I put in the reference number the email provided me, I kept getting a message that said “Sorry we are unable to process your request at this time”. I knew something was wrong since the tickets in my Air Canada app were now missing. We both called Air Canada and waited on the phone for over 4+ hours before speaking to a person. Air Canada informed us that our trip was canceled by them because we had “no showed” for our initial flight to Montreal. I have two claim numbers for the initial flight to Montreal for reimbursement for being delayed 9+ hours, and I have receipts from the food that we bought on the flight there. Our passports were scanned 3 separate times by Air Canada personnel. When we said that this incident caused by Air Canadas personnel was a huge breach of Canadas National security, they simply agreed as if it was not a big deal. You can’t let people on a plane without knowing who they are! Air Canada told us it was our fault that we had missed the flight, even though we have proof we were on the flight. They informed us that they would not be looking at the information to prove we were on the initial flight and that they would not be helping us get home to Tampa. We were on our own. They would not help pay for meals, food, or travel that would be necessary over the next couple of days due to their lack of accountability. We spent our entire Christmas Day on the phone with Air Canada to be told, we’re screwing you over and we’re not going to do anything about it or help you at all. Merry Christmas to everyone except Air Canada.

### "Worst flight experience I have had"
Worst flight experience I have had. My flight has already been cancelled twice due to weather conditions when other planes flying to Vancouver the same time as me are able to somehow board and take off. During my second rebooked flight, I went to the airport, was notified of a 4 hour delay, and after waiting the full 4 hours plus the 2 hours it takes me to go through checkin and security, they announce the flight is cancelled. I then have to line up in customer service for more than 8 hours just to claim my baggage and rebook a ticket. No hotel accommodations of any sort whatsoever and my next flight is booked 4 days later! Not to mention customer service closes at 11:30pm and there were hundreds of people in line behind me who are potentially unable to claim their baggage at all. The staff is incredibly disorganized with many staff not able to provide up to date information as they are not informed as well. There is no way of rebooking cancelled tickets online or through phone (as Air Canada is not taking calls), the only way is to stand in line for hours at an airport with no guarantee of possibly any rebooking at all as all the flights are overbooked. It’s absolutely disgusting how Air Canada treats their customers.

### "Flights canceled due to weather"
Horrible experience. Flights canceled "due to weather". But actually because ground crews are understaffed. They say they will rebook you, no just stand in one long line after another to find out they've already canceled your trip. Sure you can get a refund. But your stuck half way to your destination. Airlines need to build margins Into their schedules and not greedily pack out every flight. Otherwise peoples flights who get canceled literally have no way to get to their final destination. Go with a company that actually has customer service.

### "Multiple flight cancellations"
Not Verified |  Worst experience flying I have had. Multiple flight cancellations, left stranded at the airport, no one at the information desk, and it takes an average of 2 hours on hold for anyone to pick up the phone from customer service. No respect for anyone’s time from Air Canada. My flight from Detroit to Toronto was delayed multiple times, it was canceled and no one at the front desk could help, all they could offer was “call Air Canada”. After being on hold for an hour and 45 mins, someone could finally be bothered to pick up the phone. The best they could offer was a flight the next morning. My original flight was at 6AM. They didn’t offer me any accommodation and I would be spending over 24 hours at the airport. Fine. I wait. Only for the next morning to roll around and they messed up the booking so my connection takes off before i get there. Another 2 hours on hold before i can talk to someone at “customer service”. Then they put me on a flight to Seattle to make it to Vancouver that same day. I arrive at Seattle and flight to Vancouver has been cancelled and moved to the next day. Currently still on hold with Air Canada. Tried talking to the guy at the kiosk but he was “busy” and then he just left. If you value your time (at this point I’ve wasted 2 of my vacation days at airports and on hold), and your money. If you want to be treated with respect don’t book Air Canada.

### "painstakingly delayed our flight"
Not Verified | If you want to have a timely trip to your destination, then pick another airline. Air Canada painstakingly delayed our flight by 20 minutes intervals every hour. Once we finally boarded the flight, we had to sit on the plane for an additional two hours “waiting for fuel”. If you want your bag to arrive to your final destination, pick another airline. After years of flying, I’ve never not received my luggage. Second time flying air Canada - they had a personal goal to change that. Thanks Air Canada. Hope you have everything you need for your holiday.

### "the worst trip with Air Canada"
Last night and - still ongoing today, I had the worst trip with Air Canada. First flight from Boston was delayed and they told us 2 hours before, arrived to Canada rushing to make the connection flight when they told me that flight has been canceled, due to crew constraints. They lost my luggage, rescheduled a full day. Between looking for luggage and rescheduling, I waited from 7 pm to 1:30 am to be able to leave the airport to the hotel. I arrive the next day and that next flight is also delayed (2 hours before departure) because of pilot scheduling issues, as if they just found out about this trip. Super inconsiderate for people's limited vacation time. I got this ticket months in advance calculating my vacation days just so I can spend them at airports, baggage claims and desk assistance. Theres also no one to call, and they consider themselves not responsible for these cancelations/ delays because I booked with a booking agency. Safe to say I will never travel with Air Canada again.

### "will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Fort Lauderdale. Rude cabin crew, boring entertainment system, outdated cabins, dirty cabins, and even delayed flights. This is unacceptable, Not impressed by the airline as it used to be a decent airline, but because of the pandemic, the service was downgraded very poorly. I am not happy with this airline and will never fly with them again.

### "I will never fly Air Canada again"
My flight on Dec. 18, 2022 was at 9am it got delayed until 3pm by 4 or 5pm they cancelled our flight. Other delayed flights were able to leave but Air Canada decided to cancel our flight. No hotel provided no food or drink voucher. Air Canada employees are rude and not helpful all they say were "there's nothing we can do to help". I was rebooked for the next day at 7:30pm. I was forced to check in my carry on luggage by this white girl she said that my luggage was too big. I flew the day before from SFO to Winnipeg and never had a problem with my carry on luggage. She was really rude and rolling her eyes at me saying to the other staff loudly so I could hear her "How do you think they will react if we start charging them for their luggage" then gave me a very nasty look. I waited for hours to pick up my luggage at the baggage claim. We were not allowed to leave because if we do they wont let us back in. I didn't eat or drink since 9am because of all the run arounds Air Canada staff giving us. I will never fly Air Canada again. You can really tell they do not care about their customers. I think people should put this airline out of business. Now I know I will never find my luggage because they simple are are worst of people.

### "cabin bags were taken at gate"
Saskatoon to Toronto had pathetic leg space. Despite our tickets mentioned bassinet for 2month old infant, it wasn't provided in both the flights of Air Canada. Our cabin bags were taken at gate and put in luggage to be claimed at final destination despite us not agreeing to it. Travelling with child and infant without having cabin bag was disaster since lot of essential baby stuff was packed in it keeping in view a total of our 40hr long journe trying to find solution at Toronto airport for 2-3 hrs we didn't get any proper solution to retrieve our cabin bags. Comfort was average.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. My flight was delayed due to delay in fuelling the aircraft, two hours delay. As a result I missed my connecting flight to Montreal. Thankfully the connection flight was also Air Canada, and they automatically booked my to a next day flight. However, the problem is that they didn’t give me an option to choose which flight I wanted to get rebooked on, there was no need to book it for the next day as there was another Air Canada flight in 1.5 hours. They allowed other people to rebook to this 1.5 hours flight leaving same day, but they didn’t allow me, the reason they gave me was that they cannot transfer my luggage in 1.5 hours to this flight. How is it that in my earlier travels they have transferred my luggage with 45 minutes layover and they were not able to do this time in 1.5 hours. They had themselves decided which flight I should get rebooked on (in this case it was next day) and they weren’t ready to listen to any logical reasoning from customer. The lady at customer service was angry as to why I am not waiting in line, but she wasn’t listening to the fact that there were 50 people waiting in the line and if I waited the 1.5 hours flight would have been missed. She wasn’t listening to me at all, and calling my behaviour unacceptable and threatening to call security. I was in tears. I get it’s busy - all customer service workers are stressed but there was not once that I felt the customer service was acceptable. Where is it written in your policies that luggage transfer doesn’t happen with in XYZ time limit?

### "horrible service, no communication"
Travelling from Vancouver to Montreal and after Montreal to Casablanca. Because of two hours delay in Vancouver I missed my flight to Morocco. No one would give help either from Air Canada counter or their customer service. I have to stay at the airport another 24 hours to get next flight. Was horrible service, no communication between the agencies during delay.

### "I am currently stuck in Vancouver"
I am currently stuck in Vancouver and was unable to continue my onward journey, even though I was issued my boarding passes to my final destination, because as I have been told by the agents here in Vancouver, there was an the airline made an error with my ticket and your agents in Edmonton knew about it and should never have let me fly in the first place, I am now having to sleep in Vancouver before proceeding to travel for more than 48 hours for a journey that should have taken about 18 hours, missing out family events and income. This is highly unacceptable and should have be caught, had you employed competent individuals.

### "unacceptable customer service"
Delayed departure resulted in our seats on a connecting flight being resold to other passengers and an involuntarily rebooking on a flight leaving the following day. The airline offered no compensation, hotel voucher or apology. Poor and unacceptable customer service.

### "legroom is below industry standard"
Took 90 mins to board and 50 to disembark Very unorganised, staff were not giving any assistance. Most flight attendant were rude to me, disappeared after meal service. For Air Canada, they think the delay is normal and on schedule is not important. The legroom is below industry standard.

### "service on board is so atrocious"
I specifically booked my last overseas flight to Canada on another airline, hoping to avoid Air Canada. Only after I paid was I informed that the 2nd and longest leg of my flight was operated by Air Canada. None of my experience involves any delays or unexpected problems. It was a totally on schedule and uneventful flight. But the service on board is so atrocious. My husband and I, both Canadian and totally fluent in English, were constantly amazed at the rude behavior of every flight attendant on our side in economy class. Every simple and humble request for normal things like a cup of water, a blanket, were met with scorn and loud chastisements. The not-Canadian lady sitting next to me, who was extremely polite, was shocked at every interaction with the flight attendants. Air Canada flight attendants have increasingly become the worst ambassadors for the country. have flown all over the world with dozens of different airlines for the last 30 years, and can safely say that Air Canada has the rudest flight attendants I have ever experienced. Also, nobody seems to clean the bathrooms even on 17 hour flights.

### "staff were not helpful at all"
Not Verified | I was supposed to travel from Newark to Toronto and then to Madrid the entire trip was about nine hours. Well, the flight from Newark was late to take off I missed my plane to Madrid and I had to go to Frankfurt and then Madrid it took almost thirty hours. The plane from Toronto to Frankfurt was so small that it was not even comfortable for me and I am five feet tall. The food was not edible and the staff were not helpful at all. I will never ever use Air Canada again. Awful airline.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. The personnel taking our luggage told us to catch the next flight because she couldn’t place our luggage in the plane. We talked to an agent from Air Canada who then told us to place our luggage in the conveyor that the previous Air Canada personnel said wasn’t allowed. Which is it? Afterwards, another Air Canada employee scolded my tired mother suffering from vertigo to place her empty baggage cart in a hallway - which the other Air Canada employees said also wasn’t allowed. Despicable attitude. Especially toward visible minorities. Not only are your employees somewhat smooth-brained, they are also very rude, lazy, and unhelpful.

### "They have changed my seat"
The worst airline ever. A lot of delays every single time I had a flight with them, very unfriendly crew in checking in. They have changed my seat which I paid extra for it in last minute, I got the seat on Aug and they just put me in a terrible situation by changing my seat in last minute for both flights No explanation at all - like take it or cancel.

### "incredibly disappointed in this airline"
I was incredibly disappointed in this airline. The seats on this plane were incredibly squished together, small and absolutely not realistic for someone to sit in or get any sleep on a 15 hr flight. I know this is common among most airlines but it felt especially squished together more than I’ve experienced on other international flights. I noticed they added another seat to each row. I remember last time I travelled it was 2 on the window sides and 3 in the middle, I noticed that has changed from 3 on the window sides and 4 or 5 in the middle. Then to make things even worse the food was inedible. I’m not expecting a lobster meal or anything and I eat almost anything but that food was disgusting and also in unusual small portions. So not only couldn’t I sleep, stretch my legs out reasonably (causing cramping and pain) but I also hardly ate for 15 hrs. That is cruel to do to their passengers. And in order to get a situation with decent food and comfortable seating, you have to pay hundreds of dollars more. On my flight home from Auckland to Vancouver, there were two seats in front of me that we’re the first row with extra legroom compared to the other seats. Before take off I asked the stewardess if I could sit in those seats since they were empty and in a very snarky tone he told me that passengers pay extra for those and you have to do that ahead of time. I straight up told him I’ll pay for it and he said it was too late. When I was booking the flight that option was already taken so there is no way I could have booked it before hand. I sat for 15 hrs staring at these seats with reasonable leg room right in front of me for my whole flight and it was infuriating. They wouldn’t even let this poor single mom with a baby sit there. I believe making people live in these conditions on a 15 hr flight is cruel and I hope that Air Canada and other airlines change these elitist and exploitive practices of business.

### "Reason was a change of policy"
I purchased my ticket more than one month before the departure date. I am flying YUL-LHR on an Air Canada ticket (personal) and LHR-SIN on Singapore Airlines on a ticket purchased my by employer for business. At the check-in, I asked that my check-in luggage be tagged to my final destination (Star Alliance). The check-in clerk said no. He called his manager who also said no. Reason was a change of policy less than a month ago. No prior communication to customers and when I asked to clarify the policy, the clerk said I don’t know. So when I arrived to LHR I have to go through immigration and customs, pick up my luggage and go to the check in counter, security, etc. I will probably missed my connection. What is the point of flying via the same alliance? I am not a fan of Air Canada and I do not recommend it.

### "Would not fly with them again"
Not Verified | When I flew in Jan 2022 I thought it was such a great airline. The flight was good, they let me cancel my ticket for someone who had covid. But then the problems started. They said I could request a voucher for my ticket and it would be processed in 8-10 weeks. I did it ahead of time knowing it would expire Dec 2022. Submitted in April. It's almost Dec. Now and they have not gotten back to me. I was able to just get them to rebook it over the phone. Then it was canceled and changed to a time that doesn't work for me. Along with that I had to book 2 other accompanying tickets. Website wasn't working so I called. After more than an hour of waiting I spoke to someone who spelled my name wrong so she had to cancel my whole booking. By the time she went to rebook, my original flight was $200 more per ticket. Said there wasn't anything they could do. Now I have a minor traveling alone because we already changed that ticket to match ours before they canceled. Or I dish out money I don't have for their mistake. Would not fly with them again if it wasn't for this pre existing ticket.

### "food was also horrible as usual"
Scammed by booking a non-stop flight that actually had a connection: I checked the flight online and booked the ticket through Air Canada's customer service over the phone. Everywhere it was written that it's a direct, non-stop flight flight, both ways. Even the customer service representative did not give us any additional details. After boarding the flight, we found out that the flight actually has a connection through Sao Paolo (GRU) where we needed to get off, pass through airport security and board the aircraft again. The ticket and booking confirmation did not specify any of these details. To our dismay, there were people who would board the plane from those connections and get better seats where we never got the chance to select our seats again. If it were considered a legit connection as it should have been, then we may have been able to select better seats for some parts of the flight. I believe Air Canada did this intentionally to boost their flights ratings on search engines like Google Flight so that their flight shows up above other airlines' flights who actually show a stopover. They can also charge a higher price by claiming this to be a non-stop flight. This is essentially scamming the customers. Horrible food: Their food was also horrible as usual. The chicken sandwich was cold and stale. The food was so bad that on our way back, we actually had dinner at GRU airport. That return flight's food was actually worse. I had to ask for a different menu item because the pancakes were as dry as the Atacama Desert. Narrower seats: Since they cannot reduce the leg space further because then passengers will have to stand throughout the flight, they narrowed the width of the seats to fit at least one more seat in each row in the economy section. It was pretty much impossible to turn on your sides, do anything that required some mobility or even sleep properly. The most difficult exercise was eating. There was no room to keep your hands at the minimum angle required to even use knife and fork properly to cut and eat food. My photos show the evidence. Usually the food tray would have enough space for the meal tray and a cup. However, if you want to keep the meal tray properly, you won't get any space to put the cup and vice versa. Such a shame for a company that's Canada's flagship carrier and has monopoly over flight routes.

### "Delayed 3 hours"
Horrendous, had so many flights with Air Canada and like all others there are major delays. Delayed 3 hours for an 1 hour 30 minute flight. No apologies, no food, no water and worst of all no discussion with those who had connections or important events to attend. Always a bad experience.

### "no food provided for economy class"
Air Canada is severely over rated. The customer service is taking forever to respond. There is no text message chat function for Air Canada customer service, which is not wise in "modern society". In flight, there is no food provided for economy class.

### "A horrible experience from the beginning till end"
There was a 3-hour delay, which apparently is not unusual. The delay was due to the fact that somebody forgot to fully close the cabin door, and the de-icing liquid got inside the airplane! They lost our luggage! Their customer service was speaking very poor English, and couldn't do anything anyway. A horrible experience from the beginning till end.

### "Rude Cabin Crew"
Not Verified |  Unclean Aircraft - Horrible maintenance aircraft washroom. Rude Cabin Crew - Very bad attitude and behavior from the lady cabin crews. I asked for some water to take my medicines and the arrogant female cabin crew started yelling at us. Some who were not females, were well behaved and empathetic. Unfriendly website: Air Canada website is technically faulty and did not allow me to change flight. Dicey and misleading refund options: I opted for a refund. But Air Canada refund policy is not transparent because you pay 0$ cancellation fee but you are not refunding full amount. So hidden deductions but Air Canada will not share with customers.

### "absolutely cannot change a flight date"
Not Verified |  Couldn’t make a flight due to family emergency. I still ended up driving an hour to the airport to see if I can talk to someone regards to just switching the flight. I wasn’t looking for a refund and even though I offered to pay a fee for rebooking I got zero help. I don’t believe that you absolutely cannot change a flight date! The situation was handled with zero care! I called a bunch of customer service numbers and got the same treatment pretty disappointing

### "The check in process for Air Canada is atrocious"
The check in process for Air Canada is atrocious. You have to do everything yourself, the equipment hardly works. There is no staff to assist you either. I requested assistance via the self luggage check in, after 10 minutes of holding up the line someone came to help. Every single person had an issue with the baggage check in. There was a roped off area nearby with actual people working but we weren’t able to go to them for assistance? Why pay Air Canada prices to do all the work yourself?

### "Service on the admin side is terrible"
We originally booked and paid for a direct flight to Barcelona, where we were to board a cruise ship. Air Canada cancelled that flight only 2 days after we paid for it, and bounced us around on at least 3 other non-direct routes, but never offered a refund for the lower priced tickets. This final flight, via Lisbon, had a 75 minute window to connect on Air Portugal flight 2676. About 24 hours prior to departure from Toronto, we received an email announcing that the flight from Toronto to Lisbon would be 45 minutes late leaving Toronto. Once in Lisbon, we found out that Air Portugal had a second flight to Barcelona about 2 hours later. Air Canada should have made that our connecting flight from the very start. With about 2 dozen fellow passengers from the Air Canada flight scrambling to get to Barcelona, that later Air Portugal flight was quickly full. We did not get tickets for that flight. There was absolutely NO Air Canada presence in the Lisbon Airport, and Air Portugal denied any and all responsibility to even assist us. More like “Star Non-Alliance” from our perspective. A Portugal police officer, stationed at the airport, was the only person who gave us assistance during our 17 hours stuck there. With the help of Holland America, we finally got a midnight flight to Malaga Spain and joined the cruise ship two days late. A loss of almost $2,000 for the two of us. Air Canada responded to my detailed inquiry with an unsigned form letter stating that the delay was not their fault. To me, it smacked of arrogance. Check out Air Canada’s FAQs on their web site. Read their definition of how they calculate a mechanical delay at the origin if it happens to subsequently coincide with a weather delay at the destination. It’s all about protecting Air Canada and denying any responsibility. I have long disliked this airline. Customer Service on the admin side is terrible. On the plane, it is not bad. Phone them and you are routinely on hold for an hour plus.

### "do not have anything positive to say"
My girlfriend and I changed our booking prior to our flight and we have a reciept saying we should get 100 euros refund as a result of us changing the booking. We have waited 5 months so far and have not received a cent. We have contacted air Canada several times to ask where the money is at. The first time we were told it would arrive shortly. The second time we were thrown around between different people until we got hung up on out of nothing. The third time today I called in and asked where the money was at and now they say my name isn't even the one on the ticket and booking reference I've made. They refuse to receive my boarding pass and receipts which state that the ticket is of course mine. As to the actual experience flying with Air Canada I do not have anything positive to say. Our food was extremely small portions and very bland. I would not recommend buying anything through Air Canada if you can avoid to do so.

### "to me its an airline from the stone age"
Not Verified |  Just a horrible airline, very bad service, very expensive, old airplanes, dirty and fallen apart seats, rude staff. They need to learn from some airlines like Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways or even Aeromexico. My last trip with Air Canada was an embarrassment, they charged travelers a 1 cad for earphone and serving water from this dollars store 1.5 litre of water, very embarrassing. I misplaced my credit card and I only had my debit card on me and I wanted to pay for the earphone, the flight attendant handed them to me and proceeded to get the payment but apparently their payment system doesn't accept debit cards, so she told me that my payment wasn't accepted and asked me hand back the earphone. A nice lady behind was a witness to this surrealistic situation and paid for my earphones, I fly at least 3 times a year for many years and I always avoided Air Canada until then, to me its an airline from the stone age.

### "got a bad impression"
Not Verified | My wife travelled from Chennai (India) to YYZ. I had few questions for customer support like the price for 2nd Baggage (as they have been charging for 2nd bag recently). Support informed 105 CAD, also I asked about 3rd baggage - she said its again same, so my wife took the 3rd baggage too and at airport she was asked  pay 300 CAD for second baggage. They also did not give an option to pay online which would have been less for me but at airport they have charged 8500 (142 CAD). This is total daylight robbery. I would never opt for Air Canada next time. Poor Support. Also another support person mentioned that passenger has to get second boarding pass at Frankfurt (transit) which gave me more panic. And that is again not true. Lufthansa issued both boarding pass at Chennai (MAA). Support is totally not aware of any of the airline policies and also they want to rob ppl at their throat. Total regret and got a bad impression from my wife during her first travel.

### "Check in was easy"
Check in was easy. Only serves drinks on aircraft which is not bad for 1.5 - 2 hr flight I checked in online without any issue. Then at the airport lady helped me with luggage check in.

### "Absolutely no complaints"
Flight left delayed however Air Canada informed us early enough via email and text so that we could leave for the airport later. Plane was clean, all classes fully booked but boarding went nevertheless smoothly and orderly, cabin crew was excellent/superb and to my surprise food was well presented and good. Even deplaning - which in Toronto is at times plagued by delays - went without a hitch. Absolutely no complaints.

### "Changed the time 5 times"
Flight was delayed. Changed the time 5 times before it finally departed. The captain was saying different reason as to what the information texted to the passengers.

### "our worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  This was our worst experience ever. Air Canada did not do its job well. The flight was just sitting on the runway for an hour at the Toronto airport. When we booked the flight and given the itinerary, it was just a 45 minutes technical stop over at London for which we were not required to offboard the aircraft. It was announced that we need to offboard and there is a lay over of 2.5 hours. We had to go through all the security checkins again. They did not start boarding until 25 minutes and then when we asked, they said it’s delayed for 2.5 hours due to technical issues. Again until 35 minutes before the scheduled time they did not start boarding. The staff at the gate did not have any clues about flight time. So many people missed connecting flight from Mumbai. Our bags did not arrive at Mumbai airport. Overall the whole flight experience was a big mess. Air Canada needs to show a responsible behavior and notify customers in advance if they already have such plans of extended pay over.

### "absolute worst customer service"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst customer service. Will never fly with Air Canada again. We were going from Vancouver to Toronto and our flight was canceled a few hours before the flight and we were put on another flight 7 hours later, which meant we lost 7 hours of our vacation, 5 of us had taken days off work which we could have worked, by the time we reached rental cars were closed, we didn’t get the hotel rooms we had wanted, and missed some of your planned events for that day as got to the hotel at 5am. I have contacted air Canada several times via calls and email and received 1 computer email giving a percentage off the next flight within 2 years for 4 people (even though we were 5). I have been requesting to speak to a representative for 4 months and still have not heard back.

### "there is no reaction at all"
We booked a flight from Terrace CA to Zurich via Vancouver departure on the 17 September and arriving on 18 September. Flight number AC8440 (YXT to YVR) and AC882 (YVR to ZRH). While checking in at the airport in Terrace on 17 September we were told that the flight from Vancouver to Zurich has been canceled without upfront information. This resulted in the situation that we had to travel via Frankfurt to Zurich and arriving 10 hours later in Zurich as originally planned. In addition, we booked Economy Premium Seats for additional costs but were not delivered with Premium Seat class. I reached out to customer care on 17 September 2022 via Air Canada homepage, on customer care hotline on 24 October 2022 and via e-mail to customer care on 25 October 2022. As of today, there is no reaction at all.

### "I will never fly again with them"
I travelled from Charlottetown, PEI to Dallas via Montreal. My first experience was pretty good. My return flight was Dallas Fortworth to Charlottetown via Toronto Pearson Airport. My dallas flight experience was good. My troubles started when flight to Charlottetown from Toronto got delayed and later got cancelled. I received a message that my Charlottetown flight got cancelled. To know my options I approached a Air Canada personnel near the gate. That person suggested to contact Customer relations on Level 2 near escalators. I waited in que for 2 hours and want to know my options. One more personnel came to us that Customer relations at that place were overwhelmed and We need to see another customer support team on Level 3 at Toronto Pearson Airport. Me and some other folks came to see Level 3 customer support team as instructed and Customer support team said to us that they are not aware why we are standing in line. Before making this announcement, we waiting in line for almost 1 hour. When it is my turn, I asked the front desk attendant what are my available options as I need to attend work tomorrow. If I get refund, I would like to make a reservation with another carrier. She yelled at me and said that they don't handle refunds and I should email or contact online. I went online where I made my initial reservation and It doesn't give me an option to cancel the flight. Instead it checked me in for another flight on the next day without my approval. In the website, it clearly says "If you are at the airport, see a customer service personnel and they will gladly help with changes". They made me speak with a manager and his advise was that I have only one option. My next flight was more than 12 hours. They didn't offer hotel rooms or food vouchers. Instead they suggested me to reserve a hotel room and they will refund up to $300. They said Air Canada ran out of hotel rooms in big city like Toronto but as a individual I should be able to book room on my own. I should make my own to and fro arrangements from the airport to the hotel room. I felt disappointed for purchasing a expensive ticket with them. They treat their customers like shit and has no respect. If they delay your trip, you should be fine with their decisions even if it means that you can attend your job and lose your pay. Very unprofessional, very rude and pathetic customer service. I will never fly again with them.

### "Never using this airline again"
Not Verified |  This airline lost both my husband and my checked bags and they never made it Iceland! We had to spend about $1,000 USD on clothing in Reykjavik to survive the weather. Then, after we were home they found my husband’s basic black travel bag that was full of stuff he had already replaced. I never got my bag with irreplaceable items. Air Canada is only allowed to compensate $1,600USD. I got a check finally, 4.5 months later. But honestly I’d rather have my belongings. Never using this airline again.

### "I would fly on Air Canada again"
Flown Air Canada from Seoul (ICN) to NYC (LGA), however, despite so many negative reviews, the service attention by the crew members were high quality and excellent. Very casual and yet professional and courteous. The business class pods were very comfortable and clean, nice sleeping pads and blankets and plush pillow and lots of movie selections. The quality of food and presentation was not impressive with not much flavor though ample enough to fill you up. Drinks were plenty. The lighting in the business cabin was relaxing. Flight was diverted to Montreal due to heavy fog in Toronto but the pilots and the crews were right on providing updates frequently which avoided passengers frustrations. I would fly on Air Canada again and recommend those to try it out.

### "hostile staff at the boarding gate"
Horrible experience, first paid in advance for our food only to find out none of it was offered and of the 9 choices we had only two were available. Then we had our gate changed across the airport last minute and as it was announced we rushed across the entire airport only to be met with hostile staff at the boarding gate. It was terrifying. Thankful to be on the plane and get back home but will making it a priority to avoid this airline in the future by all means necessary.

### "extremely dissatisfied with Air Canada"
I am extremely dissatisfied with Air Canada. Besides the flight attendants themselves on the plane, the rest of the experience was awful. It began when my friend accidentally put down my nick name, "Chase" instead of Charles on my boarding pass. When we attempted to change, we ended up having to "upgrade" all 3 tickets for over $3500 and we didn't even get "upgraded" seats. I understand that is an error on our side, but I find it absurd that it cost everyone that much for one name change and  that we couldn't just upgrade one ticket instead of all 3. Also, the agent I spoke with on the phone was very rude, as was his supervisor. After I was told that everything was clear and I was good to go with my flight. I was woken up in the middle of the night (the morning of our flight) and told that I needed to get up and send more documents over. Next, while we were at the airport, the customer service agents at the desk were rude from checking in our bags, to the service desk in the terminal. Our flight was delayed twice (understandable), but when we approached the counter to ask about our connection that we were going to miss, we were told, "go sit down, we have to go on our break right now" and they two agents grabbed their stuff and walked off. We were left not knowing what was going on at the gate because the screen at the gate still read the previous flight's info the entire time we were sitting at the gate.

### "complete debacle around finding bags"
In August 2022 we flew from Sydney to Vancouver and our three bags didn't come with us. Two of our bags were found and sent over to Vancouver but only only one bag was then received at our hotel on day 3. AC airport baggage staff told us that only one bag was sent over but luckily we had a chip in that second bag and could see that it was at the Vancouver airport and after getting senior service staff involved we received our bag out of the lost baggage area. The third bag wasn't located whilst we were in Vancouver and was only received back in Brisbane in October. We put a claim into AC for the expenses incurred because of the delayed/lost bags and it has been two months and still nothing from them. I can understand bags going astray but it was the complete debacle around finding them and then getting them to us that amazed us. They push bags into the lost baggage area but don't take any details down so when they go looking for your bag they are looking for a black bag amongst the other hundreds of black bags.

### "class change was not recognized or refunded"
Not Verified | By far the worst airline I have ever flown. 1. Plane was diverted to Winnipeg 2. Agents could not book anyone on new routes for 3+ hours 3. A $20 food voucher was offered for the restaurants that are past security (without a ticket you couldn't eat) 4. Took 4 hours to line up hotel vouchers 5. Rebooked on a later flight, but the class change was not recognized or refunded will never fly Air Canada again.

### "No way to contact anyone for support"
Terrible Experience. Except for the in-flight staff. They seem to be trying to do a good job. Our trip had 4 flights from Calgary to Toronto to Windsor Ontario and back. Fog in Toronto led to a cancelled flight. Rebooked for the next day, then cancelled again and rebooked for the day of the return flight. No way to contact anyone for support. Took the train to Windsor or we would have missed the wedding we were travelling for. Then on the return trip, just a comedy of delays. Delays in the terminal, then 90+ min in the plane, while they waited for additional passengers, then they swapped out pilots, then we waited for the ground crew to return, then more new passengers, then replay all the safety info, etc etc. etc. We did finally get back to Calgary. The plane was nice, but the airline has clearly lost contact with its customers. There is no attention to the customer's experience and no regard for delivering on what they sell. Their focus is on limiting costs and increasing revenue - only. I'm just glad we managed our risk by limiting our luggage to carry-on only. I am highly reticent to travel with Air Canada, as each time I've flown with them I've had the same bad experiences of overbooked and cancelled flights. They are the worst airline I've dealt with to date.

### "staff were friendly and attentive"
I really enjoyed this flight with Air Canada. The Toronto Maple Leaf Lounge was comfortable with some excellent food on offer and I was able to find a very comfortable chair and get some work done. The flight was delayed a little but we arrived in Vancouver on-time. Overall it was a smooth ride with little turbulence. The Dreamliner is a very comfortable quiet plane and one of my favorites in the Air Canada fleet. The staff were friendly and attentive. I like the Air Canada app as I was able to pick out the films I wanted to watch and I appreciated all the choices. There are quite a few I look forward to watching on my next flight. It was great having access to wifi. Dinner and the wine were excellent. I appreciate I can review the menu on the Air Canada app before the flight. This year it has been great to be back traveling and I'll continue to be a regular customer. I look forward to my next flight.

### "likely never fly with Air Canada again"
A letter I just sent to Air Canada. I think it pretty much summarizes my feelings for them at the moment. ------ Hello, I am still waiting for a status update for this case. We have been now waiting over 90 days for communication from Air Canada. We cannot check the status of our claim because we are now receiving the message "Access to your file is no longer available. Please contact your airline for more information". Please expedite this request. We need to talk somebody in regards to this claim. COVID is no longer an excuse for how poorly Air Canada manages customer luggage. For Air Canada, customer satisfaction now seems like an afterthought, which is why we will likely never fly with Air Canada again. Even after suffering through this, there have been multiple instances where the customer care members will simply hang up on us, requiring us to sit through it again.

### "I am highly disappointed"
Not Verified |  I am highly disappointed, frustrated, and traumatized by Air Canada. My flight from Cairo, Egypt to Toronto, Canada was a normal flight. We arrived to Toronto to take another flight to San Francisco. With 10+ hours of flying and only 1 hour to go to our next flight, you can imagine the exhaustion we had. We asked the workers if they can let us surpass the long line but they rudely told us to wait like everyone else. My family and I (which was 8 of us total) got in line. It was our turn to get inspected and we got through somewhat, however we had the concern that our gate was already opening. After the inspection, we had to wait just outside of it where there was a screen to wait for our names to turn green as they were x-raying our luggages to get to the US. With the last minutes of our gate closing, our concern grew and we were starting to panic because our names have not turned green yet. Not one worker helped us get to our gate and it seemed they did not care if we missed our flight. We ended up missing our flight and they told us to get to an air canada desk (which they were not specific about where this was). All of us ran through everywhere to find a desk and the workers were extremely rude and uncooperative about looking for a flight. They finally told us we had to get through the immigration customs, to get to an air canada desk to rebook our flights. We got through the immigration customs and we had to pick up our luggages. We face another issue where we could not find them. We initially thought they were on the flight we missed but fortunately they were just misplaced. We wait 30 minutes for them to give our luggages and once we get them we go to the desk. We get there and we are greeted rudely by an air canada employee where she tells one of my family members in a nasty attitude "where does the line start?! , implying that we should move out of the way so that other customers can be helped. We told her she was being rude and she denied it. Still, we moved out the way. An employee helped rebook our flights but we all had to get separated but at that point we did not care. They gave each one of us a hotel and meal vouchers but not to me  (which at the time i didn't check). So I had to pay for my meal which was $50. The next day we all take our flight but the last 4 of us faced the same issues as the prior situation. We fly to Montreal with no issues, but yet again we had to go through a long line to get inspected and wait in front of a screen to wait for our names to pop up. We had 2 hours for our gate to open so I thought it would be a quick wait since this should not happen for the 2nd time to us! But I was wrong. Before our flight departed, I go up to the desk and tell them why our names has not been called and they tell us they thought we each had 2 luggages but we had 1 each. That was the whole wait up and they had to make sure the system says we are in the clear but through all that we miss our flight while heading to the next long line to immigration. So, we go back and they help us rebook our flight within the next hour and hasten ourselves because we are already traumatized that we will miss our flight for the 3rd time. We get to our gate as they were calling the last of the people to get to the plane. We arrive to San Francisco with a huge relief because we are finally home! But of course, they lose our luggage. But the only good thing is that they returned them to our homes 2 days later.

### "worst I have ever encountered"
Not Verified |  On October 20, 2022, my wife and I arrived at Raleigh Durham Airport (RDU) to take Air Canada flight 8839 to Toronto, connecting to Dubai. I was with a group of about 20. My experience there was the worst I have ever encountered while traveling. There were in fact 5 major problems I encountered trying to get tickets I had already paid for. 1. I tried to check in online the day before but their system wouldn’t let me. I then called Air Canada and was on hold for 4 hours. When someone finally answered, she told be to try again 24 hours before the second flight. That didn’t work either. 2. Since system did not allow me or many others to check in online, I showed up early, at 2:00 pm. They told us we had no tickets, we were not in the system. The same thing happened with another couple we were traveling with. After 20 minutes and several phone calls they said we had tickets. 3. Then they said we had to get an app and fill out a Covid form for Dubai. They had previously told our trip leader this wasn’t necessary, so none of us were prepared. The app worked poorly and I got locked out with the app saying I could only redo in 24 hours. Air Canada then told me they not give me a ticket. I eventually redid the app and change to my wife’s phone number. I later talked to fellow travelers in our group who took a different airline that did not require this app. 4. With a working app, I went again to the counter for my tickets. This time they told me they couldn’t scan my and my wife’s passports. No one else had this problem, and I didn’t have this problem 3 months earlier when flying on Air Canada. They had to call their office and after 40 minutes they manually got it to work. 5. I was so relieved to finally have tickets I didn’t look at where the seats were. We had previously paid $234 for seats that were next to each other. The ones we got on the two flights out were not next to each other, and the one on the flight back was next to each other but middle seats we didn’t order. Air Canada owes me $234 for not giving me the seats I paid for. I don’t want a credit because I am never flying this airline again but I'm sure that's what I'll get. During the leg to Dubai all 3 bathrooms on the of the plane left were out. Also, the movie I was watching was lost after a pilot announcement. This happened to many others too. In Raleigh, there were 3 times I was very worried I would not make it on the plane for a trip I had paid a lot of money for. This was a scarring experience and two weeks later I am still very upset.

### "gone extremely down hill"
Air Canada is a horrible airline, it seems they have gone extremely down hill. My flight was cancelled 8 hours before take off, they rescheduled through United but with many lay overs and a bad route home. I called (on hold for 2 hours) to ask if there was another option, but there was not. I asked if I could choice my seats as I had paid extreme for my seats on the originally flight but they said no. The customer service over the phone was rude, and no help at all. No refund or Air Canada credit for the inconvenience, I understand stuff happens but maybe me kind when you make a last minute change to your passengers. Recommend anyone else.

### "such a poorly constructed website"
Not Verified | The worst part is trying to book. The website judders, freezes, doesn't allow you to change your dates, takes forever to load flights, makes it impossible to choose new flights if AC change your booking and the new flights don't suit. I have never used such a poorly constructed website and it's been like this for years. AC don't answer tweets, emails or phone calls. Planes are OK. Service is hit and miss, economy food can be dreadful. I take sandwiches. If there was a reasonable alternative I would not travel with AC. Post pandemic prices are up 25 to 50% and more.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Flight cancelled at gate at midnight. Blatant lies told by boarding agents. Options: sleep in airport or find yourselves a local hotel and reclaim reimbursement at customer services next morning. Arrived next morning and customer services non - existent. Submitted compensation claim. Emails ignored 40 days later and still nothing. They are selling seats and deliberately robbing people. Flight deck crew and cabin crew were waiting at the gate. There was no plane!! Even easyjet provide hotel accommodation overnight and prompt reimbursements. Do not fly with this airline.

### "my experience was quite positive"
After reading so many negative reviews, I was nervous about my flights on Air Canada. However, my experience was quite positive. A slight schedule change was communicated to me weeks ahead of the flight via my 3rd party agent. My flights were basically on schedule. On my 8 hour flight Tokyo to Vancouver, I had 2 full meals that were as good as any other economy class meal. While cabin crew didn't walk around offering extra water, they were quick to respond when I asked for water. Entertainment options were satisfactory. On my super short flight Vancouver to Portland, pretzels and cold beverages were provided. My experiences were much more positive than I expected.

### "I was impressed with Air Canada"
Not Verified |  This was my first trip anywhere since the pandemic (2019) & even longer since I flew with Air Canada. I was hesitant, but I was impressed with Air Canada. Minimal delays & good service - to Peru & back. But I want to give a special shout out to Adelfredo (I hope I have spelled his name correctly). He is a ticketing agent at Miami Airport. He really assisted me today. He was at that desk since 6am & he still had a smile on his handsome face. I really appreciated everything you did for me. To Air Canada, please keep up the good work. I don't like to hear or read bad reviews about anything that says Canada.

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience with Air Canada! In Toronto, we came to pick up our baggage. On our carrousel supposed to come baggage’s from 3 more another flights! Finally started came baggage’s from our flight. We waited for 1 hour near carrousel and getting little stress as we had connections flight and we needed to put our duty free staff to put in our baggage, to go trough the control and  our next flight was already checked in! All people were waited and finally they called that all the rest baggage’s are transferred to the connection flight! So, we got a lot stress as we had to wait so long time and nobody let us know that they already changed their service and we had a duty free stuff with us and had to go through the customs! We were late to stay in the long line for control and our checking in was almost finish. Not anymore will go with Air Canada! Very bad service. No meals only drinks water and juice for free.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Not Verified | Lisbon to Atlanta via Montreal. Terrible, horrible customer service. Our flight was delayed because of technical problems. Then we get to airport in Canada we have to go thru customs and security again! The workers were only letting certain people skip the line so everyone who was missing their flights were angry and confused why they were not permitted to skip the line. People whose flight left after us were getting to skip the line. We finally had to grab someone and get to the front of line. Then they said your luggage isn't there yet so you cant get on flight you have to wait. Then they didn't tell us when it said it made it thru. Of course our gate was the last gate at the end of everything and we missed our flight. The "customer service agent" rebooked us 4 hour later. No seat together, no we're sorry seat upgrade. Nothing. They said they couldn't even track where our luggage is. Worst customer service ever! Never will fly Air Canada again.

### "lack of anything resembling competence"
Not Verified | Our recent experience on Air Canada is the worst I have had in decades of flying. One should never book on that wretched airline. The problems arose when we were changing planes in Toronto after flying Air Canada from Europe. The flight from to Toronto was a bit late but there was still ample time for us to go through customs and all the other steps and make our connection to go home. But, Air Canada had bumped us from that flight to the same flight the next day. Even though we got to the gate for our flight home in ample time and there were seats on the plane, Air Canada refused to let us on, because, they said, our bags wouldn’t make the connection. (They easily could have made the connection had the airline tried. In fact, it seems that one of our bags did make the connection.) We said that we wanted very much to fly home then and that we’d pick up our bags the next day if they did not make the flight with us. The airline refused, including appeals to various higher ups. So, we had to waste a day at a lousy airport hotel when we needed to be home for medicine, our pet, etc. This was inexcusable. Moreover, we heard others having like awful experiences with this airline (on our flight and on others) while we were in the customer service line and at the hotel. Apparently, this airline bumps people all the time for poor reasons. To top that off, with one exception (the man at the gate to our home airport, who tried to get permission to let us on the plane), the staff was worse than useless. Every step took way longer than it should have and they had no sense of helping the much inconvenienced customers. (The woman who told us we had been bumped when we got off the plane from Rome replied, when I said we needed to get home for medicine and our pet, “the airline doesn’t care”.) Everything was extreme bureaucracy and rigidity and a lack of anything resembling competence or due process.

### "made me pay $34 for my carry on"
Never going to travel through Air Canada again. They made me pay $34 for my carry on baggage and that’s the bag I always carry when I travel. Never had any issues with any other airline. Most of the people around me had the standard sized carry on baggage which just couldn’t fit in their bag sizer. It was probably their strategy to make more money. The lineups to check in my bag were crazy and the staff was horrible. They were extremely unhelpful and their kiosks were not user friendly at all. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend people to travel by Air Canada especially if you’re getting your flight from Toronto.

### "still waiting for reimbursement"
Worst airline ever for customer service. Our flight was cancelled at the time we should have been boarding. No staff available to help at the gate. We took ourselves back to the Check-In area where a member of staff told us "to sort ourselves out and claim expenses back from Air Canada when we got home". Over three months later we are still waiting for reimbursement for the cost of our hotel and meals and the compensation to which we are entitled to. We cannot speak to anyone and emails are just ignored.

### "worst customer service"
They rebooked my connection for no reason. Had to wait 8 hours for a new flight. Staff are extremely unhelpful and rude. One of the worst customer service experiences I've had.

### "seating was extremely tight"
Economy seating was extremely tight for a 13 hour flight. The drinks cart came late after the meals and the crew seems to be under staffed or stressed out. Meal options could not get any better. I will think twice before I fly air Canada.

### "inform us that our claim was denied"
Not Verified |  Flew with family for a vacation in Portugal leaving late June 2022, returning early July 2022. Original itinerary was round trip from Newark to Lisbon flying via Montreal on Air Canada. On day of departure our flight from Newark to Montreal was cancelled without any notice. We found out when we went to the airport. Initially Air Canada rebooked us on a flight with another airline, but when we went to check in with that airline we were told their flight was already full. Next Air Canada rebooked us to fly to Lisbon via Toronto. We arrived in Toronto but the flight from Toronto to Lisbon was delayed and then cancelled at 1:00 am. Air Canada customer service manager at Toronto announced the cancellation and said we were free to make our own hotel arrangements and that we could submit a claim for reimbursement with Air Canada. Eventually we got to Lisbon the next day. On the return journey, the flight from Lisbon to Montreal arrived close to schedule but delays in the airport meant we missed our flight from Montreal to Newark. Once again, Air Canada announced we could arrange our own hotel room for the overnight delay and submit expenses for reimbursement. Air Canada booked on a flight to Newark the next day with another airline. When we got home, we followed the process on Air Canada's website to request reimbursement and provided all required documentation (flight numbers, receipts, etc.). It took 83 days for Air Canada to respond and inform us that our claim was denied because flight delays and cancellations were due to Covid and safety issues and so did not qualify for compensation. When I responded that we submitted expenses for reimbursement based on airport announcements made by Air Canada at the airport, then came back and reiterated our claim was denied.

### "systems were down for close to 2 hours"
Not Verified | Toronto to Lisbon. I honestly want to support Air Canada but they keep making it harder and harder. We arrived for an 11.00pm AC flight to Lisbon at Toronto Pearson at 745pm. Their systems were down for close to 2 hours. Finally managed to get through check in and security. Announced a 1 hour flight delay to 11:55pm. We arrive at the gate at 11:10pm and “no plane” but it is coming! Are other airlines any better? Time to find out.

### "seat itself is very comfortable"
Flying premium economy with Air Canada exposes you to both economy and premium economy service. It starts out very impressive in the sense that they did a quick beverage service with glassware and real bottles of wine followed by a meal served on porcelain tableware. My understanding is the meal is the same as economy class but it certainly is presented in a nicer way. The portion size might be a bit larger in PE. I was very impressed with how quickly the service began, it seems like we were fed within 20 minutes of the plane taking off. The only disappointment was the indignance of the male flight attendant when I asked him about the difference in the white wine selection. He just couldn’t seem to handle that. Another flight attendant heard his behaviour and came back to ask me how I liked the wine I selected. I thought that was very nice of her. When another flight attendant came to remove my tray and I held on to the wine glass, she asked me if I wanted more. I appreciated that and she even came back one more time to refill. I mention that because this distinguished PE from regular economy. The PE seat itself is very comfortable with a pitch of 38 inches. The problem is that you are exposed pretty much to the economy service for the rest of the flight. There are  no snacks in the galley except juice and pretzels and water. It is the same Air Canada pretzels they served before the pandemic. They used to have these biscotti, but they reappeared as part of the snack that was served halfway through the flight with a tuna sandwich. Two meals were served (breakfast before landing), and the breakfast is served as economy class. When meals or the mid-flight snack were not being served, the crew never circulated through the cabin to offer a glass of water. They sat in the galley and people could come and get water or pretzels or ask for juice.

### "suitcase and bicycle bag did not arrive"
Not Verified |  We had a boarding delay of several hours in Montreal. Upon arrival at Malpensa, my checked suitcase and bicycle bag did not arrive. I waited in line at "Lost and Found" for an hour and a half with approximately 60 other passengers from my flight. My bags arrived 2 days later. I have tried to call and have gone online multiple times to get a refund for my extra bag charges. I has been impossible to get a real person to answer any questions. I was charged extra bag fees in Milan but was dismissed by the Italian ticket agent without getting a receipt, so I don't even know how much I was charged. Thought flying with Air Canada through Montreal would be nice. Never Again.

### "This is a long haul flight and the food was poor"
Not Verified |  We arrived in Toronto for our connecting flight to Dubai, we had to walk a long way to the next gate, after about an hour they changed our gate and another long walk, when we arrived at the new gate Air Canada advised us that our flight was delayed 2 hours, they didn’t advise their flight crew who all showed up at the original time only to find there was no airplane. We were in the last row of premium economy and after take off a baby started screaming right behind us for 2 hours, I finally had enough and requested the staff fix it. This is a long haul flight and the food was poor.

### "crew ladies were very polite and courteous"
Not Verified |  The two crew ladies at the boarding door were very polite and courteous. They have maintained a smooth flow of passengers and are courteous to people on wheelchair. Her announcements are very clear. It's a packed flight. Crew members are cooperative.

### "Never again fly with Air Canada"
Not Verified | On October 8th 2022, we were suppose to fly with Air Canada from Jakarta to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific then contacting flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver with Air Canada. When we went to check-in counter at Jakarta we were informed by Cathay that Air Canada has changed out flight we will have to wait more then 24 hours at Hong Kong Airport in order to fly back home and in Hong Kong they will put us in quarantine for 3 days. Cathay tried for 3 hours to contact Air Canada but they never respond there call, finally after waiting for 3 hours at Jakarta, Cathay changed our flight for next day so that we don't have to wait for 24 hour and we can still fly out of Hong Kong with our original flight Air Canada on 9th October. The next day again we went back to Jakarta Airport to fly with Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong then with contacting flight with Air Canada again we found out that Air Canada has cancelled our reservation. We ended up to buy another 2 tickets from Jakarta to Vancouver for $1400 dollars. Never again fly with Air Canada incompetent airline which is the worst.

### "never fly this airline again"
After multiple delays, flight adjustments and additional stop overs being added to my flight, my luggage is now missing. Air Canada help desk can not provide any updates and just tell you to wait! I have to move onto my next destination with no luggage and no direction on support! I will never fly this airline again!

### "Already 4 hours late"
Already 4 hours late. But we got a complementary water. Multiple switching connections that keeps changing. Will see if we ever get to take off. 1/10, would not fly again.

### "second flight was very poor"
Not Verified |  The flight from Denver to Toronto was fine, apr. 3 hrs. The A220 was surprisingly comfortable and we liked the large windows. Service was mediocre as we were just served a packaged roll and I chose coffee. After that we were completely ignored for 2.5 hours but it is only a medium length flight. The second flight was very poor. A Boeing 787-9 in premium economy. There was nothing "premium" about it! I was in the first seat in the premium economy section and was constantly getting bumped in the head by rude passengers with backpacks, turning and slamming me. The seats were very uncomfortable and there weren't even minimal footrests. The leg room was no greater than on the previous A320 economy. We were served lunch. It was O.K. and consisted of a lamb shank and mashed potatoes. Also a mini rather dry salad and a very mini piece of dry cake. No after lunch beverages were offered for 8 hours. The flight attendants went into hibernation. They came out of hiding about an hour before we landed and served us breakfast. It consisted of a yogurt and an inedible packaged chocolate filled roll. I practically had to trip a flight attendant to get a second cup of coffee. And that is Premium Economy on an Air Canada long distance flight! A.C. is Never Again for me!

### "missed my connection with another airline"
Disgraceful airline and an absolute shame to Canadian standards. I had a simple 1.5 hour direct journey from Boston to Toronto. This unfolded into a nightmare that lasted about 12 hours. Two of my flights from Boston to Toronto in the morning were cancelled, thus missed my connection at noon with another airline! Rebooked flight was from Boston to Montreal to Toronto of which both flights were delayed by over 1.5 hours. If you are looking for punctual and good service, look elsewhere please!

### "Will never fly Air Canada again"
Will never fly Air Canada again. Checked in 4pm at Victoria BC for first leg of trip to Vancouver. Could not get seat allocation for my wife and I for Vancouver - Sydney second leg. Told to get that in Vancouver. Had to wait at check in for 3 hours until someone turned up at check in desk 35 mins before scheduled departure to obtain seat allocation. And we booked the airfare some 6 weeks earlier. We were allocated middle seats in separate aisles, so in 30 years of international flying, we could not be seated together for a 14 hour flight, nor allocated a desired aisle seat for myself. Even then, I finished up swapping seats so another couple could be seated together.

### "this has ruined my flight"
Before boarding, the terrible customer service people at the gate made people check their bags even though there was an excessive amount of space in overhead compartments. With their terrible rate of baggage loss, this has ruined my flight and others.

### "I will never fly Air Canada again and neither should you"
We flew Air Canada from Cairo, Egypt on a 787 Dreamliner to Montreal. Business class. Nice flight terrible food. We got to Montreal late but our connecting flight was also delayed. No flight crew. We were finally boarded for the short flight to Chicago. We waited on the plane for another hour. Air Canada cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues. We then had to wait hours in line to get hotel taxi and food arrangements. It was after midnight before we got to our hotel then up again at 4.30 am to get back to the airport to catch the flight to Chicago then another flight to St Louis. I was told I would be reimbursed for a Chicago hotel room I had already booked and paid for and was too late to cancel. Well today I was informed no reimbursement because unscheduled mechanical issues. Needless to say I will never fly Air Canada again and neither should you.

### "Worst airline ever"
Phoenix to Calgary. Worst airline ever. Every few years I decide to try them again. How could they mess up this time?. Well silly me. I booked a return flight. Then my client who I was traveling to see moved the meeting so I needed to change the inbound flight. Airline said no changes allowed. I was happy buying a new inbound ticket but they said if I didn't show up for inbound flight, the entire ticket would be cancelled.

### "highly unprofessional"
Not Verified | Montreal to San Jose via Toronto. The Airline lost my backpack on the connection in Toronto. I filled the form out and hoped to get my luggage back soon. The next morning I receive an email with a reference-number. With that and my last name I should be able to check the status of my lost luggage. Long story short, the wrote my name wrong in the computer so I wasn't able to log in. After I fixed this I was shocked. My address, were they can deliver the backpack was not in there. Phone number was filled with the luggage-number. Customer-service gave me a number. The number can only be contacted with WhatsApp (highly unprofessional). The "WhatsApp Baggage-Claim-Support" told me they don't know were it is, that it may take 2 more days, more likely longer, and than stopped answering. Absolutely no recommendation!

### "Air Canada is simply a disaster"
Air Canada is simply a disaster. We had a wonderful trip in Europe with my family, but the flights were a nightmare. They lost are luggage for 3 weeks, I came back home before my bags, they took my baby stroller and sent it straight to Seattle having a stop in Montreal for 3 hrs. There are never employees at the counter, they always tell you to call customer service that takes 1hr or so to get a representative, also they are not able to transfer you at the phone, so be careful when you pick an option in the main menu, and etc.., I can keep telling many stories that we had with them. Please do not fly with them, at least abroad.

### Air Canada customer review
Not Verified | I had only been to Canada once before to Montreal by bus- when I was young and poor - that was a considerably better experience than Air Canada- that is disorganized filled with ambiguous phrase or non-articulated conditions on charging and delays and shamelessly indifferent to customer comfort. I think the Canadian government should look into this company. From a distance I have always had the absolute greatest respect for Canadian culture — this airline is a liability - it has utterly changed my sense of this nation and culture I will certainly never again fly Air Canada - will never come to Toronto again - and will as widely as I can - disperse the information of Air Canada's unrestrained jerking around of its customers — my flight itinerary has been as simple as can be — Toronto NYC - a simple hour and some minutes flight on a Sunday — my flight at 6 am was cancelled - I was on the phone for three hours, three hours wrangling with customer service who seemed to have no authority on what they were doing who were claiming I had to pay to be placed on another flight pay extra in addition to my flight - even though Air Canada had cancelled! What kind of a scam is that? Complete incentive for the airline to cancel on people left and right — Later in the airport an agent informed me that my basic ticket purchase has no “protection” against airline cancellations — completely unregulated unprincipled gouging — I was placed on a flight with a 2:30 departure - that again was cancelled - no COVID congestions no serious weather advisories in Toronto —it is a sunny day —yes the weather is not good in New York but the airport delays are by 15 minutes nothing more serious — over a simple hour flight I have been delayed by 14 hours with the prospect earlier had I not vehemently defended myself of paying for this privilege — REPUGNANT -

### "This will be my one and only flight on Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Flight from LA to Toronto went fine. The problems started when we landed in Toronto. We had a 5-hour layover and were trying to catch an earlier flight. Made it through customs in minutes, looking good to catch the earlier flight. That’s when things went horribly awry. After customs, you get dumped out into the main departures section of the terminal - outside security. Then, after waiting in security line, they test every piece of carry-on luggage. Smallest test rack I have ever seen. I have an internationally sized roller bag and have never had an issue with carry on in any country. In fact, the luggage fit fine on the Air Canada overhead on the first leg of the flight — not in Toronto! Giving up on the earlier fight, we accepted we would need to bag check and head back in through security. At least we could get food or go to an airport lounge. Wrong. Even though Air Canada flew us from LA to Toronto, they treated the second leg of the flight like we just walked in off the street. No checking bags until 4 hours before flight is scheduled to depart. So now we have to wait outside near the main ticket counters for over an hour until we can check our bags. If we had checked our bags in LA, they would have had them off our first plane almost 6 hours before the next flight departed, so they can definitely do it, they just refuse to. So Air Canada changes the carry on rules mid-trip, spits us outside security and won’t do anything to resolve the issue, on a flight and connection they booked. This will be my one and only flight on Air Canada. I strongly discourage others from using them. Their overbearing rules and inconsistent standards can leave you hanging and they just don’t care. Complete clown show.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. My fiancé came in on a flight that was delayed by 2 hours causing her to miss her connecting flight home. It was delayed due to technical issue but her connecting flight was still missed because of this, they refused to hold the plane for 10 minutes that it would have taken her to make it. So we missed the flight home and the only other available one was 8 hours later. Several other people were at the customer service desk complaining about missing their flights because of the issue and the staff was very rude to every one of them, despite it being Air Canada’s fault that they’re all late.

### "worst case experience"
Edmonton to Chicago via Toronto. Edmonton to Chicago. I had a worst case experience with the staff and their services. I asked one of the air hostess for a cup of water as I was feeling very thirsty. Then they replied me that we are going to land so that’s why I can’t offer anything with very rudely. It was like 30-mins to more to go to land the flight. I would never recommend to anyone to go by this airlines.

### "Very disappointed"
Awful experience. Our flight was cancelled after check in so we were put on the next available flight. Luggage was lost but has been sent to us after 5 days. The luggage has been damaged, it’s impossible to find a uk customer service number for Air Canada and difficult to see who can now help me. Very disappointed, awful service

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience on 10.5 hours flight from Toronto to Tel Aviv. Old and uncomfortable fabric seats little leg space for this class, seat trays and video monitors were difficult to open and retract, not enough blankets, families with infants and toddlers upgraded to premium. An unfriendly flight attendant who did not want to be bothered and got annoyed when my wife was not sure what to order. First and last time on Air Canada. Never again.

### "You pay 5 star price and 2 star service"
Not Verified |  Worst airline in North America. Rude staff, late, expensive, low quality rather zero customer politeness. Not on time, staff think they are carrying prisoners rather customers. I have been flying for last 25 years. Always same story. Wanted different airlines but due to family emergency this was only option available. Never again. You pay 5 star price and 2 star service.

### "service is consistently terrible"
The flight duration was 9 hrs & 15 min. There were only two food/drink services throughout the entire flight. They did not even offer water. You had to call the flight attendants to get water and you could not even buy drinks on the flight. The service on Air Canada is consistently terrible. If they had some meaningful competition, things would have been completely different, in my opinion. To be fair, the in-flight entertainment was good.

### "experience with Air Canada was not good"
After my travel agent booked my flight, I found out, on the ticket, that I had to pay an extra $75 per suitcase. On my way to Manchester, the plane was late. I was told that the preferred seating (leg room) which I had paid $162 for, one way, was no longer available. After several attempts, the person in charge finally got me a legroom seat after all. On my way back from Manchester to Toronto I got to the airport at about 8;30 am for a 12;30 pm take off and was told the flight was cancelled. We were put up for the night, meals included, in a mediocre hotel. Food was also mediocre. After boarding the plane next day I was told once again that the leg room seat I had paid $149 for was not available. As the plane was not full, the stewardess noted a legroom seat that was unoccupied and said, "you'd better grab that one, but if someone else claims it, you'll have to move. I paid a total of $311 extra, on top of my flight for legroom seating and was eventually granted these seats as if it was a favour. Another steward told me to put my mask on as I was taking it off to eat. They were bringing the meals at the time. I ignored her so I could eat. After that she ignored me, not once, but twice, when the drinks trolley was brought along. I had to go after her to request an orange juice. The second time, I had to ask a different stewardess for a cup of tea because madam seemed determined not to serve me, and once again cruised past me, refusing to make eye contact, while I called out to her. Her behaviour was appalling. No one can eat with a mask on, and food and drink service was included in the price of my ticket. Overall, my first experience with Air Canada was not good. And I thought Air Transat was bad.

### "lack of organization once you land"
Air Canada is incapable of taking off on time. While on board the service is great, there is the same lack of organization once you land. Baggage delays etc.

### "Boeing 787 seating was torture"
Flying home from Zurich to Toronto the Boeing 787 seating was torture. It was so tight it was a task to get up to use the washrooms. That plane with it's seating arrangement is totally unsuitable to use for a 9 hr overseas flight. From Toronto to Halifax, on an A320. Plane was lovely, we boarded and then waited for an hour for a piece of cargo. Of course late getting home.

### "confined to the limited legroom of a 737"
Without question this is the worst long haul flight I have ever taken. I couldn’t believe that for 11 hours we were confined to the limited legroom of a 737. Was the 737 designed for long haul? The first leg of the overnight flight, from Vancouver to Halifax, didn’t serve a meal, but put out the lights and expected us to sleep. During the night we were hungry and thirsty, and had to go to the galley and ask for refreshments. Thank goodness we managed to buy a decent breakfast at Halifax Airport! Then back onto another 737 for the second leg of the flight. The meal offered was small and fairly tasteless (I think the worst I have ever experienced on long haul), and again the need to visit the galley to stay hydrated. The overhead lockers were absolutely jam packed by the time we got seated, and I ended up putting my rucksack under the seat, eating into my already limited legroom. It’s almost impossible to compare Air Canada with other carriers which I use for long haul e.g. BA, Thai, Malaysian, Cathay, Emirates, where the passenger is kept fed and hydrated by attentive staff. When I arrived at Heathrow I took two flights to reach home in northern Scotland- with BA and Loganair. Each flight was less than an hour and had I more room and comfort than crossing the Atlantic!

### "Overall very bad experience"
I took my Air Canada for the first time. First flight was travelling to Doha on Sept 8th that was delayed 5 hours sitting in the plane. Then flight was 13 hours. So total spent 18 hours in plane. Next connecting flight luckily was delayed that's why able to get next flight. On way back the flight of Air Canada was from Cairo to Toronto on Sept 24th. Boarding was done sat in the plane then after 2 hours was un boarded. Then sat in the waiting area for 2 hours more and then advised flight is canceled and next flight will be next day 24 hours. That next day flight was delayed again for 30 mins but reached Montreal on time. From Montreal to Toronto again same Air Canada flight was delayed in departing one hour late and then we reached sat in the plane for half hour due to an emergency happened. Overall very bad experience and will try not to travel in this airline again.

### "only 3 delays and rerouted tickets, I was only 11hrs late"
Not Verified |  After only 3 delays and rerouted tickets, I was only 11hrs late. Then they canceled my wife's return ticket without notice, and I was forced to buy a brand new ticket to get home in time! So wonderful, truly a memorable flight experience. They offered me a “discounted” direct flight home for only double the cost of my original round trip ticket, what an amazing deal. When I showed them the same flight on their website for half that price they were completely confused. Ended up purchasing that ticket, because it was cheaper than the “solution” they were offering for the problem they created. 0/10. Zero stars. Looking forward to this companies inevitable restructuring and name change so they can go about offering terrible service under a different moniker soon.

### "the staff was rude and very unprofessional"
Not Verified |  If you don't want to lose your mind with delayed and canceled flights I would avoid this airline. Our pilot was funny and informative, but the staff was rude and very unprofessional. The Air Canada app is another sore point. If you can get it to work, it kicks you out and makes you verify everything again. Will never fly with this airline again.

### "not a great experience"
Not Verified |  Seats comfortable, very thin blanket more like a large dishcloth, small but adequate pillow. Food just about edible, handed a paper bag with an undercooked croissant and a yoghurt in it. Staff very sad looking and totally disengaged. Overall not a great experience.

### "the food was minimal and beverages were few"
We purchased premium economy tickets with the view that the higher class ticket would provide more comfort for the 14 hour flight. Much to our dismay the seats were not comfortable and provided less room as compared to Emirates or even Cathay Pacific. I will also echo the sentiments of others that the food was minimal and beverages were few. If travellers have any other option, I would highly recommend choosing another airline.

### "AC agents were so rude, creating unnecessary delays"
Not Verified |  Flew from Toronto to San Francisco, Air Canada was making all passengers place their roller bag and personal items in the baggage sizing tray to make sure they were up to par before letting them proceed to security line, created a long unnecessary line just to size bags and many people were told their personal items were oversized despite clearly being small enough to fit under the seat, and were made to go back to the check-in desk agent to pay 30$ per bag to check in a small personal item (and go through another line, no less). No other airline was doing this except for Air Canada. I travel frequently, approximately every 6 weeks and travel carry-on only, my backpack was also refused despite having taken this backpack on Air Canada and other airlines multiple times before and fitting perfectly well under the seat as my personal item, and when I brought this up to the agent they said 'that was before, we're auditing people now'. Despite being 3 hours early to the airport, we still only made it to our gate 15 mins before boarding because of this unnecessary hassle. The AC agents were so rude, creating unnecessary delays. Will not be flying Air Canada again.

### "Food portions were stingy"
A completely full flight. Departed and arrived more or less on time. Seats in economy are of the type that slide forward when you recline, which limits reclining ability for anyone over 6 feet tall. In practical terms it means leg room is reduced cf. advertised. It was bearable though. Main issue was with the food and beverage service. Food portions were stingy. Two tiny drinks in 9 hours is simply not enough to stay hydrated. Service was unfriendly borderline rude. Overall not terrible but could be much better with improved service.

### "Very frustrating experience"
Not Verified |  Very frustrating experience with Air Canada. Overbooked, assigned seats separately and not able to change that to have seats together. Crew was not helpful and very irritated, makes you feel sorry that you asked anything. After continuous delays, when we finally started disembarkation the crew was very eager to leave the plane and rushed us in a rude manner.

### "disgusting level of due diligence"
I flew Dubai-Toronto (4 hour layover) and Toronto-Montreal on June 15th/16th 2022. Two things happened on this trip, first, the Boeing 787-9 (long haul flight) upkeep and comfort was in dark contrast to the Airbus A220-300 used for the 1 hour flight. Yes, the Airbus A220-300 was a much more comfortable flight in everyway. Second, I arrived in Montreal after a very very long journey and had to wait in the understaffed luggage claims line, for another hour, with 30 or so other passengers from exclusively AC flights, all of us with missing luggage, confused and tired. During this wait, we witnessed the comedy act of airport security walling off the luggage carrousel which was overpiling with late / delayed lost baggage. No information was shared other than, we will let you know, enjoy your stay in Canada. After 2 weeks of calling, filing in useless complaints reports on AC's website and making trips to the airport, I was finally re-united with one bag, which was in a 3rd party storage facility a 15 mins drive from the airport, the 2nd bag was delivered the following day. Compensation? fill in another report and attach your receipts (what justification can you give a passenger for delaying their baggage for 2 weeks, I flew to your hub in Toronto for God's sake, the layover was 4 hours how did you misplace the luggage?). During this time all the communication and effort was one way, this is a disgusting level of due diligence from an airline which promotes itself as excellence. This is not excellence, this is utter garbage. On my return flight I flew premium economy, little did I know, I would experience the novelty of skipping a hot meal on a flight for the 1st time in my life, the food was inedible. In September (3 months after my flight) an AC customer service agent emails me stating ''we have decided to compensate you for your 14 day delayed baggage, we are happy to give $400 CAN. $400 CAN for losing my luggage for 2 weeks. On top of that, the customer service agent instructs me to share all, and I mean ALL, of my banking info. so that they could transfer this meagre payoff. Why? They do not have a system which allows transfer's to customer's living abroad. its 2022, I used a credit card to pay for the flight, all details of which are logged and registered on your system, at least, a normally functioning company's system. I have now spent 2 weeks advising AC that it is unacceptable to make such a statement (international transfers) and unacceptable to ask your passengers to share their bank details online via email. Air Canada as an airline is a total disgrace to Canada.

### "not my favourite way to cross the Atlantic"
First flight on AC on the route from Frankfurt to Toronto. Overall, it was a solid experience with some light and lots of shadow. The flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200LR with a 3-4-3 seat formation, which is standard today for this type of aircraft, but meant that seats were rather on the narrow side. The legroom was relatively tight. In particular, it bothered me that the life west of the seat in front of me blocked a lot of the room under the seat so that it was difficult to stretch my legs, something I have not experienced on the same type of aircraft with other airlines. However, the recline was fine for a standard economy seat. I did not find the food tasty, and the portions were also rather on the small side. But the service was overall friendly and attentive. There was a bar for (non-alcoholic) drinks during the flight and the cabin attendants occasionally passed through the cabin to offer water. The worst part of the experience was the deplaning: We arrived at the gate half an hour late. It was announced that only connecting passengers should leave the aircraft (regardless of whether they had a tight connection), while everyone else had to stay on board (of course, this was not enforced for Business class passengers). When all the connecting passengers (or those who claimed to be) had left, we had to wait for five minutes (why? ), before everyone else could deplane. Overall the process was chaotic and inefficient. It took 20 minutes from arriving at the gate, until I could leave the aircraft even though I was seated at the front of the cabin. Overall, it was by far not my favourite way to cross the Atlantic. Yet, I would probably not mind to fly AC again if the schedule works and the price is right.

### "none of my food was edible"
Not Verified |  We flew from Athens to Montreal on the 8th September and from Toronto to Athens 19th September. Both routes 10 hours flight. We bought extra leg room seats so it was bearable. The food was probably the worst food i was presented in my life of flying. Poor quality, cold and not edible. I was shocked that on the return 10 hour flight we were given hot poor quality dinner (with solid hard cold bun and butter and tasteless brownie,) soon after take off and then one hour before landing a cold croissant with fruit yogurt (only edible food during the flight). It would have been better and more respectful to their customers, if they did not serve anything and asked people to get their own food on board. 10 hours flight and we got off starving as none of my food was edible.

### "Flight attendants friendly and helpful"
The flight from Calgary to Frankfurt left and arrived on time which is an achievement in these times. Flight attendants friendly and helpful. Good selection of movies, including French (of course) and international, The pod seats recline into a sleeping position and are quite comfortable. Usual amenities provided in a kit. Decent selection of food. It is here that AC has improved its game and uses outside chefs to provide menu items. Still, some minor services which they used to provide were not available. No welcoming glass of champagne or hot towel service. Also, they were not able to hang up my sports jacket and I was told to simply put it in the overhead bin.

### "All the flights were delayed"
Not Verified |  I normally go to USA every year. This time my agent bought me and wife return tickets to fly from Brisbane to Minneapolis. Normally I used two flights to travel from Brisbane to Minneapolis. But it appeared that this trip had three flights via Canada. All the flights were delayed and we miss the one from Montreal to Minneapolis and had to spend time at the airport over night. The return trip back to Australia was worse; again all flights were delayed over 4 hours and we miss the one from Vancouver to Brisbane. They put us up in a hotel in Vancouver and promised to pay all expenses. But when receipts for expenses were submitted they refused saying that it was due to computer glitches. Moreover, we were put on two flights from Vancouver; one from vancouver Sydney and the other from Sydney to Brisbane which means we had 4 flights from Minneapolis to Brisbane. Each trip took 2 days instead of 1 day. When landed at Brisbane one of luggage was missing and it took 2 days to get it back. Never fly Air Canada.

### "11 days later still no luggage"
Not Verified |  Air Canada lost our luggage on day one of our once a year vacation. 11 days later still no luggage. They have no idea what they have done with it. Because they delayed our flight and changed our flight 4 times causing this catastrophe.

### "service was friendly and efficient"
The flight and check-in process went well. The information provided in the app was useful, though the seat map displaying which seats are occupied differed between the Air Canada website and the app. During boarding, ground staff grouped zones 4 and 5 together after boarding zone 3, which confused several passengers, including me. There was also a long line in the jet bridge. The cabin was clean and service was friendly and efficient. There was a rude passenger whom the stewardesses dealt with professionally. A stewardess also confirmed a special meal I had requested and was respectful regarding the handling and opening of the meal package. The IFE system in the seat next to mine was broken, which is odd, even for an older 787. Overall, the flight was up to my expectations for an Air Canada economy class flight and was generally average.

### "the crew made us feel welcome"
Not Verified |  I was expecting the worst when I stepped aboard this 787-8 at EDI. I was the first passenger aboard and there was no one to greet me. After an initial rush of excitement that there was no crew and we would have free run of the aircraft cabin crew dashed up the aisle to greet us, looking slightly surprised that boarding had started without their knowledge. We were shown to our seats, stowed our hand baggage in the 787's massive overhead bins, and settled down. Cabin crew came by to introduce themselves and take our food and beverage orders. There were no pre-departure drinks nor hot towels. I looked at the amenity kit; socks and an eyeshade, unbranded, in a black plastic pouch. I grimaced. We taxied out to the westbound runway and were underway about an hour after scheduled departure time. Drinks service commenced swiftly after takeoff and I was soon enjoying Laurent Perrier brut and a packet of cashews. My eighteen-month old son had fallen asleep in my arms during the take-off run - as one does - and was now sleeping soundly. The purser came and suggested I make use of the empty 1D as a bed for him. Seated in 2A I could just about see his feet if I poked my head over the aisle - the privacy on this configuration of seating is very good. Lunch was served as we climbed out over the Western Isles and was very good. Drinks service was decent throughout the first two hours of the flight and nothing felt rushed, or too much trouble. My woke at about the two hour point and was hungry. The cabin crew swiftly prepared a meal for him and none of it felt like too much trouble at all. After about three hours it was time for bed, with the cabin crew locking the window dimmers and turning off the lights. The fact that it was early afternoon local time and mid morning at destination didn't seem a factor. most of the business class cabin obeyed the crew's wishes and went to sleep. I turned to the entertainment system. While the choice of movies is pretty decent, the decision to include two episodes, mid season, from TV shows is baffling. As is the inclusion of three-hour long music programmes, which must be listened to in entirety with no option to skip to the song you want. Why whole albums can't just be uploaded giving the user the ability to navigate to the music they want to listen to, like almost all airlines do these days, is truly baffling. The entertainment system doesn't feel cheap at all, but this particular part of it felt like it had been beamed in from some tragic charter flight from 1990. After a couple of hours had elapsed the intermission was over and it was time to wake up again. Normal service resumed and we were served a snack of charcuterie, cheeses, bread, and pickles. Soon it was time for landing and we found ourselves back on the ground in Toronto. The cabin crew answered that "metered deplaning" was in effect and 50 passengers would be allowed off every five minutes, with connecting passengers taking priority. Although we couldn't provide evidence of having a connection as we hadn't been able to check in online for our onward United flight, the purser let us off anyway. This is clearly a paired back service, with Covid as the excuse. Despite this, the crew made us feel welcome, went the extra mile, and probably broke the rules, all for our comfort.

### "customer service is really bad"
The price was affordable but the service was lousy. When I arrived at my final destination I realized that they lost my checked-in baggage for which I paid 250 euros! . At the counter they told me that they would solve my problem in 3 days and I have been waiting almost 1 month for information about my luggage, unbelievable. The customer service is really bad, I had to wait up to 1 hour every day I called to be attended! The other thing I wanted to emphasize was the punctuality of this airline. Unfortunately, I had to fly back with this airline and to make matters worse I missed my last flight connection from Brussels to Hamburg because the plane landed 1 hour late in Brussels. The boarding gate was slammed in my face ... I waited 6 hours, after Air Canada rebooked my flight with Lufthansa, which means that I waited around 6 hours more in order to arrive to my final destination. Please avoid traveling with this irresponsible airline.

### "Crew were pleasant enough upon boarding"
I flew with Air Canada from Vancouver to London Heathrow today (17/09/2022) and I have a 10 hour layover so I thought I would post a return review but it doesn’t get any better than my outbound flight. The Crew were pleasant enough upon boarding and they were more present in the Cabin on the return flight but that’s about it. The menu choices were the same and not appealing. A hot meal was provided but the Continental Breakfast did make everyone laugh. A croissant & a Yogurt. A crew member was later shouting at a passenger when starting approach into London as the passenger had put their backpack behind their feet instead of the overhead lockers and they were sat next to an emergency exit. This woman shouted from the other side of the aircraft “Your bag can’t go there”, “it wasn’t there on takeoff was it so it can’t be on landing”, “it’s an emergency exit”. This crew member should’ve approached this individual on a 1-1 basis and speak to them. I had a Cold on this flight so I needed to change my masks frequently. The first time, I went to use the Bathroom to blow my nose and as my mask was soiled, I binned it and walked towards the back of the aircraft with a piece of clothing covering my mouth & nose and a staff member acted as if I had the plague. The second time I had to do the same and change my mask, I stood at the back of the aircraft whilst the crew were talking once again and I was ignored.

### "I would avoid this airline"
I don’t know what to expect from Air Canada as it was the first time flying to Canada and with Air Canada. I would guess that the crew did not want to be there but this was clear as day. The crew were pleasant enough upon welcoming but no where the standards that I am used to nor that I was expect from a long-haul airline. The Crew were quite rude when they were present in the Cabin. Crew were in the back of the aircraft chatting amongst themselves with the Curtains drawn. This was a day flight that took off a little later than scheduled, after 14:00 which added more to the confusion. Passengers were searching for Crew for Drinks and went to the back of the aircraft where they still stood talking and were asked when there would be another service. They answered “Help yourself and take some Pretzels whilst you’re there”. I was astounded at service or lack of, and expected way better. I would avoid this airline at all costs unless this couldn’t be helped!

### "smooth flight with very attentive FA’s"
We had been dreading this flight because of all the negative reviews but it took a couple of minutes to check in at business class, get through fast track and into the Maple leaf lounge . Great smooth flight with very attentive FA’s. We had the middle 2 seats and the only thing we didn’t like was the fact the divider didn’t go down so we couldn’t communicate very well. Great film selection and food not up to most first class airlines we’ve flown with but perfectly nice. No complaints and would fly with them again

### "worst airline for service communication"
Not Verified |  I've been a long time user of Air Canada flight passes and up until now they have worked well for me and my family. I don't know what has changed with Air Canada but be aware they are not what they use to be. I booked my Wife with her flight pass and selected her seat. At this time the plane was just over half full. Immediately after booking her seat I tried to book my own seat with my flight passes. I got an online response back saying the plane was sold out even though I could plainly see there was over 40 seats left unsold. I called customer service only to be told my flight pass was an M class ticket and there were no M class seats available. The only reason I purchase flight passes in the first place was to be able to book my flights in the busy season knowing I could always get a seat. 80% of the time the regular economy fare is much cheaper than the cost of a single flight pass. Once again Air Canada you have taken the lead as one of the worlds worst airline for service communication and performance. The last couple of years I really thought you were getting your act together in these very tough times. But now it looks like you are falling back to your monopolistic, don't give a damn take it or leave it ways.

### "won’t be flying air Canada again"
Plane was tired but clean, staff were dreadful. Saw the staff with a meal at the beginning of the night flight and then again at breakfast time before landing. No drinks even water offered through the night. Family with two year old twins behind me, never witnessed any help or a reassuring word offered to them. The staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone. Went to the toilet in the night and it was awful, smelt and the seat was very dirty, needed checking a little more often. Breakfast was a brown paper bag with a croissant and plain yoghurt, the croissant was so cold it really was inedible, so as you might have gathered we won’t be flying air Canada again

### "Very disappointed in Air Canada"
Air Canada disappointed in so many ways. We scheduled our flight with a connection having plenty of time to make it. Leaving late from ATL still left us two hours to wait for the next flight. For some reason Air Canada rescheduled our connecting flight to one four hours later. We saw people from our flight board the connecting flight with no problem. Only on presenting our Boarding Pass did we find out we could not board. No notification from the Air Canada app. Customer Service was zero help. Supervisor tried to prevent me recording him in a Public Area and threatened to not allow me to fly out. Very disappointed in Air Canada.

### "I asked to be compensated "
After waiting at the gate for one hour as the plane had arrived late and had to be inspected, we finally boarded at 10pm. Once inside the plane, we were informed we had to wait due to an electrical storm. An hour later around 11pm, the plane attempted to move but had a technical issue. The staff attempted to fix it for hours but were unable to. We were informed at 2am that our flight was cancelled and we had to exit the plane and retrieve our luggages. We were also informed that there was no hotel available. As we exited the plane, we waited an extra 30 minutes to be able to reach baggage claim and leave the airport. We received zero  compensation: I had to pay for my taxi there and back the next day, accommodation and food. The plane was reschedule for the next day at 5pm (not ideal in my opinion, I asked to change but they refused). The plane was delayed because it arrived late from a prior trip: this is not an issue out of their control. The plane was delayed an extra hour due to a problem out of their control. The day-long delay was their fault: technical issue is their fault. Air Canada does not care about its customers (safety or otherwise - honestly 1 hour to check a plane in between two flights? No.). I asked to be reimbursed for the expenses, they refused. I asked to be compensated for the 1 day delay, they refused. I tried again using Air Cover, they refused. This is a joke of an airline.

### "not choose Air Canada in the future"
I will never fly Air Canada again. My family and I had a 10 a.m. morning flight scheduled to depart Dublin with a 5.5 hour layover in Toronto in order to make it stress-free back to Florida. For unknown reasons (not weather-related) Air Canada delayed our Dublin flight so it did not leave Dublin until about 1530 (3:30 p.m.). They did not offer any sort of compensation for meals while we were stranded in the airport waiting for information about the flight, they kept pushing back the departure time in small 1-2 hour increments. When we finally arrived in Toronto, we had to run through the airport to another section, then had multiple stops for Immigration and Customs. Air Canada did not offer assistance getting through the airport nor offer any assurance that we would make our flight home. We had no time to get a bite to eat or rest because the 5.5 hour layover I planned did not happen. The only reason we made our flight from Toronto to Orlando, was because Customs searched the plane for 60 minutes looking for drugs, according to the Air Canada Rouge pilot, since the plane just came from Montego Bay. We were the last people to board the plane, breathless of course from running through the airport. I was stressed, my children were stressed and it was a horrible day. I requested compensation for the 5-hour delayed flight from Dublin to Toronto but because it was an "in-transit" flight, I am not eligible for compensation - no matter that I was inconvenienced tremendously. I will not choose Air Canada in the future.

### "the experience was horrible"
Not Verified |  From the moment we entered the check in kiosk the experience was horrible. They do not help with the process, made too much of the hustle with the documents for custom which they shouldn't because they are not custom! Required vaccination certificate even when the flight was to the country where the vaccination status is not required anymore. Boarding was rushed, the staff were screaming at people.

### "worst flight and service"
Toronto to Paris. I would say the worst flight and service in my entire life, rude flight attendants. You should have food supply according to the numbers of passengers - how do you run out of food? The food quality is disgusting - will never fly again on Air Canada.

### "supposed to go on wheelchair"
Air Canada did not help my mom that supposed to go on wheelchair when she was getting out of the plane from her flight Calgary to Vancouver. Because of this she walked long distance and got lost in the airport because she was a first time flyer. She developed edema in her legs when she got home and her legs was painful. She said she showed her boarding pass to the crews and asked but they said wheelchair wasn't noted on the boarding pass. I asked this matter to the ground crew when he hand me the boarding pass and he said its already in the system. But to the crew who don't see it in the boarding pass even if costumer ask will don't mind it. The law state that whoever identify themselves who needs wheelchair should be given. Air Canada was irresponsible and i was so disappointed.

### "disappointed by Air Canada"
Not Verified |  I was disappointed by Air Canada. They don’t provide headphones (although they will sell you a set). It was a 4.5 hour flight, but they don’t provide even the smallest snack. Worst of all, they charge $35 to check a bag in. So people don’t do that if they can take a large carry-on for the overhead locker plus a smaller one for under the seat. Consequently, on my flight they ran out of room in the overhead lockers, so had to start offering to check some bags in to the hold for free. What a ridiculous system. Most airlines encourage as much luggage as possible to be checked in which reduces the chaos in the narrow aisle when embarking and disembarking. They encourage cabin luggage but don’t have enough capacity to handle it when the customers do exactly what the airline encouraged them to do. And they give their passengers jet lag by having the blinds down on a daytime flight - flying eastward in daylight you have to stay awake. Chatting to one of the staff he said it made it easier for the staff if the passengers sleep.

### "Appalling customer service"
Not Verified | Toronto to Manchester. Appalling customer service, before flight and during. They clearly treat their customers with disdain if not contempt. During the flights Manchester to Toronto (and return), the cabin staff did the bare minimum. An elderly woman had to ask three times for a glass of water. The food offerings were just about edible. No water service at all, during a long haul flight. Absolutely the worst cabin service I've ever experienced, and that includes the dire Ryanair. The flights were delayed. Indeed, all the Air Canada flights from Toronto that day were delayed. I had booked my ticket on 18th October 2021 and checked in for the flight online as soon as I was able, but I was not allocated a seat but placed on standby. Yet Air Canada was still selling economy seats on the flight after I had checked in. At the airport we were informed that the flight had been overbooked. Absolutely appalling practice. Will never fly Air Canada again and would strongly recommend others to avoid like the plague.

### "don't really care about their customers"
What a terrible start to the trip. We paid for premium seating and were given coach. Told there was nothing to do about it because the flight was full and we'd have to call for a refund. And we will. I'm just venting because there isn't anything any airline will ever do about this type of bad customer service. Air Canada is just another addition to a long list of airlines who don't really care about their customers. They just are collecting dollars hoping for the people who won't chase down the refunds. And we didn't even choose this airline. They partner with United and we got stuck. Thanks, United.

### "A huge disappointment for me"
Problems started in Calgary where the flight has been postponed (always by half hour cca) in total 3 hours delay in start. First we have been waiting for the pilot / after a technical issue occurred. Due to the delay in the start i missed my original connection in Frankfurt. Air Canada agent sent us directly to Lufthansa to arrange issuance of new boarding passes. Of course it has not been coordinated with Lufthansa so few passengers have "travelled" the airport here and there. Delay was clear Air Canada mistake and no effort from their team to manage the situation. A huge disappointment for me Air Canada used to mean something - reflect quality. Do not expect that anymore.

### "Air Canada handled itself brilliantly"
This was our first trip post Covid to Germany and as it was high season, we wanted to be comfortable so we booked J-Class for our trip to and from FRA via YYZ from YOW. Our check in at YOW was seamless as well as being very professional. The Maple Leaf Lounge was well staffed, spotlessly cleaned with very fresh tasty food and drink to enjoy. Boarding was very easy via Zone-1 and we were able to get our carry on into the overhead lockers (Full flight as well) on the new Airbus-220 in which we found clean and well appointed. Service as expected on a short inter city flight was well done by very polite professional crew. On an arrival in YYZ we transited to the Air Canada Signature Lounge where we enjoyed a small hot meal with appetizer with appropriate wine and champagne. Boarding in YYZ for FRA was seamless using Zone-1 and flight left late due to the number of passengers (full flight). On board service, food and drink selection was excellent due to the type of overseas flight. On arrival in FRA, we start at the B-Concourse with a 20-minute walk through immigration to the baggage hall where our baggage (4 pieces) was coming off the belt. On our return we changed a later flight to an earlier domestic connection easily thanks to the FRA staff. The MLL in FRA was excellent well appointed with food, drink with helpful staff. Even took advantage of having a shower before departure which was very nice. The FRA YYZ flight was exceptional service as well great food and drink. Even the Captain entered the first J Cabin to talk to passengers which was a nice touch. On arrival in YYZ no issues with customs or immigration with thanks to the Arrive Canada Ap and NEXUS. Our last flight was delayed due to a weather issue from the aircraft leaving DEN for YYZ. The CCSA kept everyone informed on delays as well as my email and Ap messaging service. On arrival in YOW our baggage arrived so no issues with this flight. In conclusion Air Canada handled itself brilliantly and the number of emails as well as text messages were very reassuring that they were doing their best to keep us informed at all times.

### "Amazing service"
Not Verified |  We were traveling from Fort Lauderdale to Montreal. During check in Zaira noticed that we won’t have enough time to get to our connecting flight (thank god she noticed). She then proceeded to help us get to our final destination Italy (which is where she is from). She rebooked our flight and got us a travel voucher to go to MIA. She even went above and beyond by helping us check in and get our luggage paid. Amazing service from an amazing person. She deserves a raise.

### "help resolve this long-overdue claim"
On 17 Jul 22, my family and I traveled under Air Canada (AC) booking # 4GN88Y to catch a flight (flight # AC8927) from Toronto (TOR) to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) leaving Toronto-Pearson IAP at 2030 hrs. We had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to TOR on AC flight AC897 from Athens, Greece; an exhausting/grueling 10-hour flight. We had about a four-hour layover between flights. Around 2025 hrs, just before our scheduled boarding time, an AC rep, announced over the PA system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour, as a co-pilot had not arrived for our flight. Surprisingly, around 2045 hrs, the AC rep announced we all would board the plane for PIT. All PIT passengers boarded the flight for PIT, after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the co-pilot hadn't arrived, the flight was canceled, and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see AC personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight. My family/all of the PIT-bound passengers deplaned & went inside, where an AC rep let us know we would have to go through Customs (Again! ), and try to get rebooked on another PIT flight. This would be the last information an in-person AC rep gave us at TOR IAP, and things became very disorganized. We made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags; no AC rep was there to give guidance/assistance (took over an hour!). The AC area was a catastrophe complete with crying children & stressed-out adults who didn't know what to do. When we finally got my daughter’s luggage it was badly damaged (caster wheel missing/hard case cracked); the luggage was only a few yrs old, and cost around $100. We discussed renting a car (one-way to PIT) and driving home that night, as my wife and I had work the next day, and my daughter had a law school prep class. We were exhausted & just needed to get home. While my wife & daughter, who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage, I went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an in-person AC rep, but to no avail, all AC personnel appeared to be gone for the day. An airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact AC for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight. I called from the bank of phone; got disconnected! However, a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an AC ("Brian", I believe), who advised he could book my family on a AC Flight from TOR to PIT the next afternoon around 1415 hrs. He also advised he couldn't help with securing a hotel, but if we could manage to get a hotel room, we could submit the expenses to AC for "prompt" reimbursement. I asked Brian about getting reimbursed by AC for renting a car and driving home (one-way rental to PIT); he informed AC would definitely reimburse us for this expense, as well as fuel costs for the vehicle, if we submitted receipts to the AC website. Based upon the affirmative representation from an AC rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for vehicle) we made the decision to rent a car, which took over an hour and cost $300; we also incurred fuel and toll charges. Arrived home about 0545 hrs, totally stressed out and sick to our stomachs. Filed a claim with AC & after now about 45 days, all we have received is an auto reply email AC rec'd our claim. No reimbursement, no phone call from AC with an update, & certainly no apology from AC! All we ask is that someone from AC have the decency to help resolve this long-overdue claim.

### "they lost my bags for 3 days"
Not Verified | Tel Aviv to Saint Louis via Toronto. This airline sucks! They had the rudest flight attendant that was waking people up and running around trying to enforce a mask rule. Karen of the skies. Then they would not let me on the flight to Saint Louis in Toronto as they said I had to fly with my bags? They rerouted me to Chicago with our my permission then proceeded to cancel the flight. I had to stay in Toronto overnight. Then to add insult to injury they lost my bags for 3 days. No way to get a hold of them, no apology. RUN! !

### "the most uncomfortable seats"
I almost lost my connecting flight to Egypt because I arrived late at Montreal. Some of the staff members don’t even know that you don’t need to follow the Arrive CAN protocol if you are going to Canada just to connect flights. To top it all, on my way to Egypt the aircraft had the most uncomfortable seats. For an international flight that takes over 10hrs this aircraft has horrendous seats.

### "first and last time taking Air Canada"
Air Canada has been my worst experience. Their customer service is one of the worst. I was asleep and the cabin crew just passed the breakfast box to me, without waking me up or asking if I wanted to have. I was travelling with a my 15 years old son who has special needs (autism and hypermobility) and requires a lounge for calmness, the lady at the desk was so rude, suggesting that I go to lounges to see if they would let me in. It is my first and last time taking Air Canada.

### "experience was my first and last"
My Air Canada experience was my first and last. From a steward that wouldn’t let us carry on baggage (that we were able to on every other connecting flight) to delayed flights, canceled flights and re-routed flights. Then they topped it off by losing our luggage. They talk the talk but can’t walk the walk.

### "no customer service at all"
It was a traumatic experience to fly with them. I was denied boarding a flight that I had confirmed ticket for! The reason, they stated, was overbooking! I was not given any option but to choose another flight which was after few hours. My original flight was a direct flight from Toronto to Paris and they re-routed my trip via London Heathrow. I asked them multiple times to check if my luggage was on board. They assured me that my luggage was transferred to the new flight. It's been more than a week now and my luggage is still missing! I was off to Europe on my vacation for a week and I just had to spend it without my luggage. I cannot curse this airline enough to ruin my vacation completely. There is no customer service at all.

### "impressed with our experience"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Halifax via Montreal. We used another airline to fly from Florida to Halifax. But our Air Canada experience from Halifax, to Montreal, and then to Orlando, was handled really well. As we all know, many airlines are understaffed, flights are cancelled and flyers are left waiting at gates for hours while crew from another flight arrives. It's routine, every time I have flown in the last year. Our departing flight from Halifax was a half hour late. We received a prompt email and were reassured our connection in Montreal would be held for us and 16 other passengers. The counter check in was smooth. The clerk was polite and friendly. She told us the connecting flight would be held to accommodate us and the other passengers. When we arrived at the gate, announcements were made to reassure us that our trip would not be cancelled or further delayed. We boarded the flight when they said we would. Our arrival in Montreal was also guided. The clerks moved us to Priority security check-in, and then to a counter for entrance to Customs. So apparently, US nationals are put through customs in Montreal before we fly back to our country. That went smooth too. In addition to us, there were about 30 other passengers expedited through this staging area and onto Customs counters. A man directed all of us to the counters and assured us our flights were waiting for us. He was emotionally poised and seemed to know exactly what was going on with the flights. The customs counter woman was also polite. I am impressed with our experience with Air Canada and I will fly them again.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service, so rude staff, to start with my flight was delayed by 1 and half hour due to technical issue but no compensation or at least good customer service should be given. As we entered no one greeted. I had already called in earlier to customer care for my 1 year old baby bassinet and the request was in place but the air hostess though had the seat too but did not provide me one. Moreover when i asked for baby food, no one turned back to me and later when i asked they said they don't have it on flight at least as an courtesy for the little one they would have told me. The worst part was as my baby pulled out the instruction guideline from the front net, the air hostess snatched from his hand so rudely and said it is not a toy. I understand this but the behaviour is totally unacceptable.

### "I will never fly with them again"
The worst flying experience and I will never fly with them again. Terrible terrible experience. 4 flight delays and 4 hours late. I will only fly with American Airlines moving forward.

### "requested a refund and booked elsewhere"
Cancelled because they said not enough staff, booked again Sunday then they cancelled again. Wanted to send me on a 2 stop flight and I’m 88 years old and do not walk well enough for that change of flight. After twice on the phone for an hour requested a refund and booked elsewhere, won’t fly again until this is straightened out

### "worst airline I have flown"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is by far the worst airline I have flown in recent history. My first flight was delayed 3 hours, and no reason was given. When I did some more digging, I saw that the same flight had been cancelled almost every other day (and at least one flight each day from a different time but same route was cancelled). When we arrived in Toronto, we sat on the tarmac for an additional 90 minutes! The crew and staff could not have cared less. They were indifferent, as this seemed they were used to it. Toronto Pearson was a complete mess - crowded, trash everywhere, it was embarrassing.

### "Air Canada never again"
Not Verified |  August 21 transfer at YYZ to AMS. Arriving AMS: no bag. Apple AirTrace showed bag in YYZ. In the following days I shared the exact location with Air Canada numerous times, now August 29 bag is still in YYZ. Nobody mailed or called me. Nobody had decency to dispatch someone to locate my bag and put it on a flight to AMS. It’s incredibly frustrating knowing exactly where bag is but nobody is listening. Air Canada never again!

### "Never flying with this airline again"
Never flying with this airline again. Toronto airport is abysmal. Our flight sat on the run for 90 minutes due to a broken plane (as stated by the captain). We missed our transfer due to this, but when we asked to be rebooked and provided a hotel (due to a 23 hour layover) we were told ‘I don’t know why the pilot told you that’ and the customer service agent insisted the delay was due to the weather (despite the fact that we had already landed before the delay). No hotel was provided and the airline proceeded to not load up ur bags on our new flight meaning we arrived home with lost baggage. Please do not fly with this airline, the price and customer service is awful, I would rather fly Ryanair.

### "Horrible customer service"
I will never fly Air Canada again. They delayed my flight over an hour and instead of holding the connecting flight for 10 minutes for the many people on the late flight they have us a 6 hour lay over. I saw they had a large standby list for that flight so I get the feeling they delayed it specifically to accommodate them while still taking my money. Horrible customer service, flight attendants were rude, and zero compensation for the costs I will incur having to stay in a different city.

### "I had a horrible experience"
This my first and last time ever flying Air Canada. I had a horrible experience. My plane was scheduled to leave PDX Airport at 6:30 am on 8/25 I arrived in more than enough to to board the flight the Staff announced that the plane would be late because "there were too many planes in the air. We were told that the plane would be leaving PDX Airport 45 minutes late. I was scheduled to land in Vancouver BC to connect with my flight to Puerta Vallarta to leave at 8:50 am. When I inquired if we arrived late how would that affect my flight out of Canada the flight attendant informed me that I would have 26 minutes to get to my next gate she reported it was narrow but I would make it on time. We landed in Canada we were quickly notified that there were no steps available to leave the plane and that their would be a 15 - 20 minute wait because they needed to find steps so we could deboard the plan. We waited on the tarmac for 30 minutes once the steps arrived folks was fussing, cussing, and angry that multiple patrons including me the missed their connecting flights the staff did not care they offered no support or assistance I had to walk around talking to several air Canada flight Staff members no one had answers they all acted as if they had no clue about their jobs. I asked to speak with a manager this was no help at all he was rude as well when I asked if they could assist me with finding a flight he told me there was nothing he could do. They also lost my luggage it took them hours to find it when they finally did I got no apologies. I arrived at 7ish in the morning had to sit in the airport over 15 hrs while in Canada until 11:35 pm to catch a new flight to Puerta Vallarta that will have me arrive at 8/26 at 10:11 am.

### "I will never fly with this airline again"
Arrived early for boarding, once we got to the front of the line, they told us we needed to check our bags in because they ran out of space in the overhead compartments. I really don't understand how you can run out of space, when you arrange for an aircraft for a certain number of people. The Air Canada rep was very cold and careless about the situation. It's one thing to have changes, but at least be friendly and show some respect to your customers. She brushed off any questions that I was about to ask, and rushed me through. Couldn't get two words in. When we boarded the plane, the seats were very dirty - crumbs, tissues, and garbage in the area of the seatbelt and around the chair. This made us feel unsafe, considering we are still in a pandemic. You say you are taking every possible precaution to maintain the cleanliness for the safety of the passengers, but clearly we are not seeing that. The menus and the safety feature pamphlet were also filthy and sticky. Very minor issue - no free snacks? come on. Another minor issue - the outlets for the headphones are for those that don't even sell anymore. Like what? After we landed, we waited almost 45 minutes to exit the plane, because they were not able to dock it in the right spot. Something was blocking? It really was not made clear to the passengers as to what was happening. It would have taken you 30 seconds or less to explain to the passengers, instead of leaving them hanging. Exit the airplane, to find out our checked luggage had not been loaded. Waited another 40-45 minutes for them to load it and collect our baggage. I will never fly with this airline again. Horrible representation of what Canada is all about. I have flown with cheaper airlines and received more compassion and respect, and overall customer service. Unacceptable.

### "Service and food were pathetic"
Air Canada staff was rude and discourteous. If they do not like their job they have no right to spoil anyone's journey especially when we have paid a tremendous amount. My last time ever to travel by this airline. Service and food were pathetic as well. Anyone who wants to travel please don’t travel by Air Canada and their horrible staff.

### "Air Canada is really struggling lately"
Air Canada is really struggling lately. They used to be my go-to despite often having some delays on their routes, but nowadays it's just completely spiraled into nonsense. Their website is often broken. They cancelled two of my flights - both citing weather reasons. Once it was actually legitimate as across the board flights got cancelled. However, for the first time they had cancelled 6h ahead of time (how could you know the flight can't take off that early?) while other flights by other airlines and a bit later in the day was still able to fly. The only redeeming quality is that now their customer service line doesn't take 4h like it used to to connect to someone. Only took me 20 minutes and the person I got actually knew what they were doing. That might be a fluke and I just got lucky though, but I will certainly not be flying Air Canada anytime soon if I can help it.

### "messed up our flight multiple times"
They messed up our flight multiple times, where we were stuck because of this for 3 days. Our checked bagged was returned to us with stuff taken and bag ripped. They gave us a measly discount of 30%, when we were through so much exhaustion and we had rude team members not wanting to help

### "their customer support is terrible"
Horrible, just horrible. If you can fly with a decent company, please avoid Air Canada (I know I will). My early flight got cancelled for some obscure reason. There were two other direct flights to the same destination on the same day, but the customer service didn't bother to try and put me on them. I spoke with at least 8 different people on the phone, and they all told me different things. All were acting as if it were my fault that the company cancelled the flight. I went to the airport, trying to get on one of the direct flights. After waiting for 45+ minutes in line (only two registration stands were open), I finally got to speak to someone. The person was very rude and again acted as if I were to blame for the cancellation. Anyways, after multiple phone calls I got a flight on the same day. It was later in the day and not direct, so super inconvenient. Because of Air Canada I missed a very important event and wasted my time trying to get some response from them. Like I said, don't fly them - they are unreliable and their customer support is terrible (okay, just one out of 8 people was actually helpful - the one who helped me book a new flights). AVOID

### "Will never fly air Canada again"
This is the worst trip I’ve ever experienced in my life. It started with each flight being delayed which it didn’t really affect my trip until I was coming back to Jeddah. It started when my flight got delayed in Minneapolis causing the missing of my next flight from Montreal to Cairo. I traveled with 4 kids and it was such a mess trying to catch the flight we’ve been rerouted to which is from Montreal to Athens. I asked the agent who printed our boarding passes if my luggage will be rerouted and she said yes! After a long, hard, tiring trip and a long wait in Athens, we made it Jeddah and guess what no luggage. I checked in 12 pieces of luggage none of them arrived and the worst is that Air Canada doesn’t want to file a claim for me stating they’re not the last carrier I traveled with. The other airline company doesn’t want to file a claim for me either stating that their name is not on the baggage tags. To summarize this, Air Canada is the worst airline company I’ve traveled with in term of service, food, timing, comfort and customer service. Will never fly air Canada again

### "I will never use Air Canada again"
Air Canada is terrible. I paid over $300.00 for a direct flight from Montreal to BWI. I could have purchased a ticket for $120.00 if a wanted a flight with stops. I selected the most expensive direct flight option. Thur flight got cancelled and replaced with a two flights Montreal to Toronto and Toronto to BWI. The flight from Montreal was very late. While I was in the air the second flight from Toronto to BWI got cancelled. According to the customer service no flight was available on the same day. They offered me to fly back to Montreal and from there to DC the next day. Then they instructed where to pick up my luggage. However, I couldn't find my checked in bag. I had to speak Air Canada rep and he told me that my bag got checked in for the next flight and would stay in the airport. I tried to explain that all my belongings were there but he didn't want to listen to me. I had to find an emergency accommodation and buy a few things to spend the afternoon and night in Toronto No assistance or accommodation was offered to me. Next day I flew to Montreal and I was assured that my bags were loaded on the flight. In Montreal I had to wait an hour before I was able to pass the custom office control because my luggage couldn't be found. It remained in Toronto. My flight to DC was rescheduled twice. Originally I was supposed to land around 3 PM but instead I landed after 5 PM. I still don't know where my luggage is. No compensation or even a simple apology was ever offered by Air Canada. I lost a precious vacation day because my original flight was cancelled. I had to spend extra money because my stay in Canada was extended against my will. I am feeling traumatized and abused by Air Canada. I can express how much stress and inconveniences Air Canada caused to me. They are unreliable and inconsiderate. I will never use Air Canada again. This company is a nightmare.

### "Worst travel experience of my life"
Worst travel experience of my life. Supposed to be heading to Germany for a work convention. Flight was delayed out of Newfoundland which made us miss our connection in Toronto. So they tried to put us on a different flight with a different company but "couldn't" actually transfer our tickets because they used a European operator called Eurowings and we had already "checked in" at our original departure. So be aware if your Air Canada flight is operated by another company because they'll use that as an excuse to screw you over. If you're reading this Air Canada rep; maybe don't make deals with other companies if you can't provide customer support. So now I'm stuck in Toronto, going to be over 24 hours late arriving to a work thing and they're doing everything not to help. Sure they gave us a hotel room for the night and $20 each in food vouchers for the airport but that doesn't begin to make up for the stress of all of this. Can't even call to get compensation because you have to "go online" so they can proceed to ignore your claims. Terrible company with even worse customer service. One lady did try to be helpful but here we are in the end, screwed over. If I could give a 0/10 I would.

### "I’ll never fly with then again"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is the worst company. I’ll never fly with then again. They change our flights hour 3 different times, then after more the 4 hours delay they cancel the flight. I was travelling with my grandmother and my wife. They give to us a other flight, but they cancel it again. I needed to rental a car and drive 8 hours from Newark to Toronto to be at my home!

### "Lost luggage is a major problem"
Lost luggage is a major problem for Air Canada as I learned the hard way. Lost 2/2 bags, huge line at Copenhagen airport of other Air Canada customers who similarly had lost luggage on multiple AC flights. What is most disconcerting is the number of large carts of lost luggage labeled with dates going back up to a week in full public access that had not even been touched by AC staff which makes me highly doubt the AC claim that they are doing everything they can to reunite lost luggage with travelers. If you are planning to travel with Air Canada, my advice is not to check bags right now.

### "will never travel Air Canada again"
Traveling Air Canada was not a good experience for me, all legs of my journey were late, returning - to the point I missed my flight and they could not get me on another flight until morning. I had to pay for the hotel myself, as they were out of hotel vouchers and told to submit for a refund online, which I did only to receive a response that it could take up to 30 days for someone to make contact with me. That was on July 11. It is now August 22 and I have yet to even be acknowledged, let alone refunded for my hotel. At this point I am frustrated and will never travel Air Canada again, if this is how they treat their customers.

### "I will never fly Air Canada again"
I will never fly Air Canada again. Gate staff are inflexible. Our flight from Rome to Toronto was delayed thus we missed our connection to San Francisco. There were about 10 people on the flight that had to make this connection. The Staff at customer service had called the gate and let the gate staff know we were all running to the gate to make the flight and to please allow us to board. We got there 5 minutes after they closed the doors, the airplane had not moved from the gate, but they would not let us on. This I accept as I’m unclear about FAA rules once an airplane door is closed. What I don’t accept is the absolute incompetence of booking us on different flights, losing our luggage, and having absolute no remorse about treating passengers like cattle. Every nightmare you read about plane travel occurred, which I accept that it’s a difficult time for this industry, but I do not accept the rudeness of staff, total apathy to help customers.

### "charged me 100$ for 2-3 kgs above weight"
Terrible experience in YUL with a rude supervisor at baggage drop who charged me 100$ for 2-3 kgs above weight. I was never charged these fees in Geneva. The company applies different policy in different countries. Also, the food is terrible on this flight. Flights always delayed.

### "force you to check your carry on"
Absolutely worst customer service. Do not fly this airline. The boarding staff are rude, aggressive, and completely without compassion. They force you to check your carry on despite it being a half empty flight or denying boarding with zero support. I had a terrible experience in NY and my girlfriend was denied boarding out of St. Louis despite having passport information, global entry, an enhanced licensed — everything!

### "Worst flight and customer service"
Not Verified | Calgary to Delhi via Toronto. This was most terrible experience I ever had with Air Canada. Worst flight and customer service ever. Less than 12 hours, I was informed that my flight has been changed. That caused my husband to auto cancel his flight. The new scheduled flight from YYC - YYZ was scheduled at 1300 but got delayed by 45 mins. which made my connection tight at YYZ. I had almost 1 hour to connect with my flight from YYZ but due to some reason, when plane reached YYZ, it didn't connected with gate for almost an hour and I had to rush to my gate with my carry-on and an infant in 10 mins. The gate was closed and I was a min. or 2 away to miss my flight to DEL. After arriving DEL, I waited for my baggage to arrive for 2 hours, no luck. I asked Air Canada for help, they wrote down my info and gave me my baggage tag numbers only not the file ref. no. My husband in YYC contacted Air Canada who registered the complaint for missing luggage and gave him file ref. no. My first red bag arrived after 5 days, which had all milk supplies for my infant. My 2nd bag was delayed and arrived after 10 days because they forgot to pick my 2nd bag. In addition, both rear wheels of the baggage arrived broken. Left wheel is missing and right wheel is not aligned with the bag. This is the WORST flight of my life. I will never fly Air Canada again.

### "No one answers at AC"
Got to Athens for my cruise but luggage was left in Toronto. Luggage had AirTags so we knew it was there. Luggage service took report that’s it. Our cruise ship customer service could not get thru to AC and apparently this is happening to a lot of customers who were there with lost luggage. No one answers at AC. Useless trying to get thru. Our cruise ship lost and found went to work and managed to recover our luggage after 5 days. At this point we had bought enough clothes for 4 bdays. We are now trying to get compensated but again impossible to get thru. Terrible airline.

### "Not a good experience"
First and last time flying with this airline. Flights going and coming were delayed numerous times, customs was a nightmare. We had to wait for our pilot. Not a good experience. The flight attendants were fabulous.

### "huge decline in customer service"
Air Canada is extremely behind in customer service in all areas of services. Call centers, airports and even on board a plane. This review is based on my own personal experience with the airline through which i noticed a huge decline in customer service. The issue started with 2 hours delayed flight, flight attendants with very bad attitude and lost bags. if that's not enough, the customer service representative hung up the phone on me when I called to voice my concerns. I finally filed a complaint online via the company website and got a reply back states the following "it may take as long as 45 days for an Air Canada representative to get back to you". Canada in general is way behind in customer service but Air Canada hits rock bottom.

### "food and service were great"
I've not had the chance to fly Air Canada for a few years and I am pleased to say the experience was just as good as before with only one letdown. My checked bag did not make it onto the plane! It was however returned to me two days later in Duluth, USA. The flight left on time and arrived on time, both of which are a big plus these days. The seat was very comfortable, the food and service were great and the IFE was good enough.

### "Try to avoid at all costs"
All was well, until I reached Toronto and joined the Air Canada chaos. No one knew where to line up, to check in. No one was there to give us information. Because my connecting flight was at 6 am, we were there in the middle of the night .... waiting. After 4 the first desk agents finally showed up. I guess the one agent got out of bed on the wrong side, because she started screaming at us, like "what is wrong with you all, you are standing in the wrong aisle, and why isn't your mask on properly, and why is your carry on so big, you'll have to check that in, and put your mask over your nose!! And so on. Welcome to Canada! When I had checked in my carry on, I was finally able to get to the gate. I had had a long night of waiting and not eating, but I thought it's ok, I'll get my breakfast on the fight. No food for an almost 5 hour flight. Not even a snack. Water and coffee, that's it. It confirmed everything I had already heard about Air Canada. Try to avoid at all costs! Next time I fly to Vancouver, I will be going different route, in order to avoid Air Canada and Toronto Airport!

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. On my flight up to Toronto some of my friends coming to the same destination had their flights canceled, others had theirs delayed by 8-10 hours it was ridiculous. Don’t have so many flights if you are so understaffed. On the way back my friends and I took a plane from Halifax to Toronto and then to Houston. The Halifax one got delayed by several hours but thankfully we were able to get on an earlier one. About an hour before the flight to Houston it got canceled and then we had to book a flight for the next day. Except on my booking it said I was rebooked for a different flight the same day and didn’t have to wait. Unfortunately after waiting 4 hours they basically said “Sorry you just got tot fly tomorrow”. The help desk people were always actually very nice and seemed helpful. Our flight the next day was supposed to be at 2:30. I am currently writing this on the plane at 5:15 because there has been 3 more hours of delays and we still have no taken off.

### "I wouldn't fly with Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Flew Air Canada overnight from Montreal to Heathrow. The flight back, despite the seat being rather comfortable with thanks to the extra legroom seat. The cabin crew were rather rude. I asked for a bottle of water and was told that they were able to only offer me a cup of water as they didn't have any bottles leftover. They gave me a cup of water and when I asked for a second cup, the purser told me that I was only allowed one. My food was nothing short of dreadful and came in tiny portions on plastic trays with stale bread buns. For breakfast, all that was offered was a small yogurt pot and an Air Canada special - a croissant. On the outbound flight to Canada, I flew with WestJet and they offered 2 Complimentary beverages and snack services in addition to one hot meal service on nearly a 7 hour flight and the cabin crew went out of their way to help from bringing me hand sanitizer to showing me how to work the entertainment system. At the start of the return flight, I asked for some eyeshades to sleep with to which they shrugged their shoulders and declared that they 'do not have any'. They didn't offer any snacks during the flight. On a positive note though, when I asked one flight attendent in the galley for food, they offered me a meal from the dinner service that was leftover. However, on the whole, I wouldn't fly with Air Canada on the basis that the flying experience was significantly worse than that of the vast majority of others airlines which I have flown.

### "Food had to be purchased"
6 hour international flight, 1 small drink provided during the entire flight. Food had to be purchased but they fail to mention it's only heated up at the start of the flight, so if you want something hot later on you're out of luck. Definitely the worst flight experience I've had from the US. Avoid this airline!

### "hard time to get my luggage at Dubai"
I had a seriously hard time to get my luggage at Dubai. It took 4 days after my arrival. Only around 40% of my claim for purchasing essentials during missing baggage has been paid. Undesirable experience, think many times before booking with Air Canada for next time.

### "No one smiled, no one was helpful"
The employees at Heathrow were wonderful and helpful. Our flight from London to Montreal was mostly uneventful except for the flight attendant yelling at people for not wearing their masks. We were instructed like children to wait until the entire row was served and the attendants had proceeded to the next row before removing masks. There were no friendly attendants. Most looked like passengers were bothering them, and they wished they were somewhere else. The flight from Montreal to Newark was horrible. This airline knows exactly how many passengers are scheduled to arrive and depart probably down to the minute, yet for multiple flights connecting through Montreal there were only 3 customs agents. The delay was nerve racking, but we were able to make it to our gate in time except, our flight was delayed. Four times. Our entire time waiting at the gate, we never saw one employee of Air Canada. We would receive a text message or email telling us our flight was delayed for 45 minutes. 30 minutes after that, we'd get another delay message. No plane was present at the gate during any of these delay messages, so I knew it was going to be much longer than 45 minutes. After 3 hours and 40 minutes of delays, several of the passengers waiting hailed an Air Canada employee briskly walking by our gate hoping to be unnoticed (she was looking at the closed bistro across from us). She did promise to get a manager. About 30 minutes later, someone shows up. She never announces anything, never talks to anyone, never asks if anyone needs assistance. My son, who has a seizure disorder, needed sleep but there were no accommodations for him and we had no idea how long the delay would ultimately be. The only restaurant in the terminal had an hour and 45-minute wait and were out of most things on the menu. There were two kiosks for fast food and drinks. Both of them were out of food and closing 20 minutes after we arrived. Finally, the gate agent that shows up starts calling zones to board. Never asks if anyone needs help, never smiled once, never even looked people in the eye. She typed fast and furious and just watched people scan their tickets to board. The attendants on the flight were the same as the previous flight. No one smiled, no one was helpful or even remotely friendly. At least they were consistent. If I have to fly out of my way next time or pay more to not fly Air Canada, I will. Traveling Is hard and expensive enough these days. I'm going to fly with an airline whose employees can at least pretend their grateful for the passengers that ultimately pay their salary. I gave them a 2 rating because we made it safely to our destination. Which is probably the only positive thing I can say about this experience.

### "didn’t consider my connecting flight"
My flight to Toronto from London go delayed but they didn’t consider my connecting flight from Toronto to Regina. I called and customer service was rude and gave me two new flights. 3 hours before my flights, they all got cancelled again and I was given new flights and this time it was fly from London to Toronto then to Calgary then back to Regina. I missed a whole day of work, had to find a place for day because I was a fully day delayed to get home.

### "The most horrible experience"
The most horrible experience I've had. After being in airport for 5 hours they canceled the flight with no clear explanation. No customer service at all. Later on they sent an email with new dates for flight with no other options, they even told me they can't refund my money back. Either take the new flight or not.

### "This was very disappointing"
Recently flew from Halifax to Vancouver in economy class. I booked comfort fare so I was eligible for preferred seating. I was also given the option at the time of booking to purchase a Chef Jerome meal box for $14.95. The two options looked really good so I made the purchase. Check-in was smooth, and boarding was just about on time. Seat was 20D in an exit row and offered excellent legroom, During the first (and as it turned out, only) service I was asked if I wanted to purchase anything. I said I had pre-purchased a meal and the Flight Attendant said that they weren't given a list so asked to see my boarding pass. After digging it out I showed my boarding pass which had 'meal' listed on it and she then asked what I wanted. I said I ordered the Chef Jerome meal box and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said I could select one meal and a snack so I ended up getting a cheese/fruit tray and some nuts. This was very disappointing as I was looking forward to the meal box I purchased. Furthermore, there was only 1 beverage service on this 6 1/2 transcontinental flight, which is absolutely unacceptable. There were also no Care Kits handed out like there were on my inbound flight, although perhaps these have now been discontinued. The aircraft was clean and new, although the bathrooms were not kept very clean throughout the flight. I did have a very positive interaction with one of the FAs as I was leaving the lavatory area. She asked how my flight was going, made some friendly small talk, and asked if she could get be anything which I appreciated. It was almost like she felt bad that only one service was provided. Landed on time and my checked bag arrived in a reasonable amount of time despite the airport being very busy.

### "I was disappointed with this flight"
Used Aeroplan points to upgrade to business class for my outbound flight to Halifax. Non-business class passengers were using the priority check-in so I had to wait about 10 mins for check-in. Although priority security screening was apparently included, I was sent through the regular security line which was fine as it wasn't busy. Headed to Maple Leaf lounge, which was quite crowded. The buffet consisted of a few salads, two soups (one labeled as cream of mushroom but was clearly cream of broccoli), and a limited selection of light snacks. Wine, beer and soft drinks also offered. It was only after I noticed someone getting delivered a hot dish that you could order 2 different meals from your table. I ordered the flat bread pizza, which was ok. The other option was a vegetarian curry, I headed to the gate early but as I arrived I received a notification from AC that the gate changed so I went to the new gate. Boarding was delayed just over an hour as inbound aircraft came from the US and was at the US gates so they had to wait for it to be towed to our gate. Boarding was chaotic as ever but since I was in zone 1 I got to board right away. I was not greeted by name. I took my seat (4D, aisle seat in the last row of business class). A couple asked me to switch to 4B so they could sit together. Since it was the same seat just on the opposite side of the aisle I obliged (I like aisle seats). FAs handed out Air Canada's Care Kits before departure and they took orders for dinner. The options were a chicken dish with a rice/quinoa mix, or a vegetarian gnocchi. Pillows and blankets were handed out but they were just the cheap ones used in international economy. Cheap earbuds were also offered. The seat was clean but not at all comfortable. I booked business so I would have a more comfortable 6 hour journey overnight but I found it very uncomfortable. While the legroom was good, the entertainment box impeded my legroom. My preferred seat in economy on my return flight (separate review) was actually more spacious. Dinner was served shortly after takeoff. Since it was close to midnight at this point I really wasn't in the mood to eat but I went for the chicken dish, which was small and quite bland. Surprisingly that was the only service offered on the 6 hour flight. While I wasn't expecting another meal I did fully expect a beverage service before arrival. I am sure I could have asked for a coffee but was surprised we weren't offered another drink. They did pass out some snacks from a basket before arrival but it was mostly chips and chocolate bars, not something I wanted at that hour. The business class washroom on B737MAX aircraft are notoriously small, and Air Canada's is no different. It was kept quite clean. The Flight Attendants were efficient but not overly friendly. My checked bag arrived at the carousel in a timely fashion. Overall I was disappointed with this flight. North American business class with Air Canada is nothing special and the seat was very uncomfortable. The meal was small (which was ok as I wasn't hungry) and quite tasteless. A comfier pillow and blanket would have been appreciated for this overnight flight rather than using the same cheap ones used in international economy. North American business class with Air Canada is not worth the extra cost in my opinion. Stick to economy and splurge on a preferred seat.

### "demoralizing experience"
We had a bad and demoralizing experience while flying back from Delhi to SFO via Montreal. On the flight from Delhi to Montreal, there was an old Indian lady sitting behind our seat. She either had hearing issues or she did not speak English. So the flight attendant had to repeat something twice before she could understand/respond. The flight attendant sounded so mean and disrespectful. On another occasion, flight attendant when requested by my daughter to replace the headphones, was rude to respond. While we were boarding from SFO to Delhi the other day (June 19th), the check-in lady would not accept the digital copy of my covid-19 tests. She wanted me to print them. I almost missed my flight as I had to run places to get the prints. Overall food was good. Entertainment was lacking. Wifi was glitchy but we got credit for that.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
The worst airline I have ever flown with. Cancelled every flight due to “weather” so they don’t have to be responsible. When you go to the support desk, they tell you it’s not their problem and that they essentially don’t care what happens to you or if the flight they’ve rebooked you for days out interferes with your ability to work or see family. I will never fly Air Canada again. Worst company I’ve ever dealt with in my life.

### "Worst possible experience"
Worst possible experience ever. I flew with my pregnant wife SFO to Montreal, Montreal to Athens Athens to Toronto to SFO. Every flight was delayed and we missed all our connecting flights. Will never use this airline or airports again. Everything was understaffed.

### "seats are small for an overseas flight"
This is my first time flying Air Canada and it will be my last. My husband and I volunteered to check our luggage on the flight from Cleveland to Athens. We were told our luggage would be waiting for us when we landed. It was not. We had to go to the baggage carousel and wait almost an hour for our carry on and then go through customs and security. Members of our flight felt lied to and were very upset as we were. We were the two middle seats in the middle of the plane. There was absolutely no room and it was absolutely miserable. I almost had a panic attack about five hours in. My entertainment system did not work from the time we took off, and despite telling three flight attendants, no one cared to help me and in fact insinuated I was the one who broke it. We landed in Athens and my husband’s checked bag did not make it on the flight. It took two and a half hours to get through the line. It took him two days to get the bags back. On the way from Athens to Toronto, I tried to upgrade our seats to no avail. We were in zone 4. By the time we got on the plane, there was no overhead space left and we were told we had to check the bags. We had an hour and a half layover in Toronto and did not have time to go through customs again. I started crying and only then one flight attendant helped us put our bags in the closet up front. The seats are small for an overseas flight and it is a form of torture.

### "need to take down our luggage"
The flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto was Ok On the flight from Toronto to Montreal. After we passed the counter to the plane the staff came to us (4 persons with 2 small children and told us that we need to take down our luggage to the bottom of the plane. I asked the staff to make sure or to take our luggage up when we will arrive, since we know there are problem with the luggage and we are afraid that we will not receive it. The staff just told me that i have 2 choices to get down from the flight to the next flight or to put the it down with no explanation. I felt humiliated 4 people with tickets with no option to take, as was declared our back up luggage on board and very low service.

### "multiple canceled/delayed flights"
Not Verified |  Air Canada ruined a week long vacation to Ontario by multiple canceled/delayed flights that were so bad we said “screw it” and decided to just stay in Toronto since they couldn’t get us to our final destination after trying for 48 hours. To rub salt in our wounds, they lost our luggage! After persistently haggling with Customer Service, who had no idea where the bags were physically located (ironically they did make it to our final destination), we finally got them after 5 days (thanking Air Canada for the new wardrobe I had to buy) . And if you thought that was bad enough, to put a cherry on top of this grand disaster - they again lost our luggage on the return flight.

### "the worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst customer service. Flight got cancelled, no representative at IAD, got automatically rebooked to a flight 2 days later, had to go back to our hotel and call a 1800 number and took 2 hours to get rebooked on a flight the next day. Next day’s flight also delayed by 3 hours. Currently sitting at the airport. Now waiting to see if it’s going or if it’s going to get cancelled again for the second day in a row.

### "a very dissatisfied customer"
Horrible experience. Flight got delayed 4 times, finally once boarded we waited another hour inside the plane due to a technical issue. Once landed in Vancouver we waited in taxi for another 40 mins because they had no one to operate the gate on the side the plane landed on. Overall a very dissatisfied customer.

### "Delaying flights like there’s no tomorrow"
Not Verified |  Delaying flights like there’s no tomorrow, and had all the passengers from our plane walk to the other end of the airport to only come back to the same gate we were at before. Such a horrible experience I’m stuck here at an international airport and I can’t find another plane to fly 30mins away.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Santa Ana to Vancouver. This was one of the worst experiences I have had with any airline. Even though their boarding pass states "Gate closes 15 minute before", they would not let us into the plane 35 minutes before the flight at the gate. Then they booked us for the next day husband and wife separate to make us pay for two seats next to each other still in the economy section of the plane. I feel embarrassed at front of my wife for not having read the airline reviews checked before booking. Please do your due diligence to not use this airline as I have promised myself not to ever do so.

### "no employees anywhere"
Lisbon to Raleigh via Montreal. On August 2, 2022 I flew business class on a ticket purchased from Air Canada beginning in Funchal, Portugal with Star Alliance partner TAP. The second flight (which was on Air Canada) was delayed more than 90 minutes leaving Lisbon due to a "catering issue. During the Lisbon - Montreal flight I was told by flight attendants that a gate agent would meet the flight on arrival in Montreal to help with connections which turned out not to be the case. There were no employees anywhere around where we exited nor any monitors on connecting information as all arriving international passengers had to go through immigration even before going to their connecting gate. Air Canada sent me a text since I had missed my connection in Montreal notifying me that it had automatically booked me on two new flights to replace my prior non-stop flight. There were no new boarding passes tied to the text and so I went to the Air Canada customer service desk on arrival to get my new boarding passes. The employee there said I would need to go to baggage claim and speak to a representative there first to get my bag and then I would need to recheck it on the 2 new flights. I then ran the gauntlet trying to get through passport control, Covid protocols for Canada, customs, etc only to wait in a long line in baggage claim. When I finally got to the front the agent looked up my claim ticket and said my bag should be automatically moved to the 2 new flights which was great to hear (but did not actually happen). This incredibly frustrating and time-consuming process in the Montreal airport could have been avoided if the original customer service agent had given me accurate information. By following the Air Canada customer service agents instructions I had to exit the secure area which meant technically entering Canada. This led to having to go through security (and twice disposing of liquids bought post-security at the prior airport) and their lines two more times (both in Montreal and in Toronto) as well as Canadian customs and Covid queues that I should never have had to deal with as a transiting passenger. My Montreal to Toronto flight was uneventful but then my Toronto - Raleigh flight was delayed more than 2 hrs due to supposed baggage system failure at the Toronto airport. (The Air Canada Toronto to RDU flight earlier in the day had been cancelled after passengers had boarded and sat on the plane for an hour! They then waited 6 hrs and were rebooked on my flight only to be delayed another 2 hrs) I arrived at RDU 7 1/2 hrs after my original ticketed time to find my luggage had not automatically been transferred to my new flights as the baggage agent in Montreal had claimed. With my checked bag not arriving, this required waiting in another line at RDU along with 6 other passengers whose bags also did not arrive. The baggage agent at RDU had no pre-printed forms to fill out but rather hand-wrote the information needed on blank 8 1/2 x 11 pieces of paper where we then filled in the fields needed. How hard is it to print out a standard form or even have us complete them online so that the information is not then required to be manually input?

### "Hands down worst experience I’ve ever had traveling"
Not Verified |  Hands down worst experience I’ve ever had traveling. The employees don’t know their own rules and would not let my 8 month old infant on the plane. We left our house at 4 am with a 3yr old, myself and my 8 month old. (We were all pre checked in). When we got to the the desk to check in our bags, the rude, extremely unknowledgeable women working the desk told me that my 8 month old couldn’t board the plane because she didn’t have a passport. It states on the Canada travel website as well as Air Canada that she doesn’t need one to enter the country only a government issued ID (which we had). She wouldn’t even discuss it and when I showed her prof she was wrong she continued to argue. We unfortunately are missing a family reunion now as well as a celebration of life for my grandma. I would walk to Canada barefoot before I even consider Air Canada again. Garbage from start to finish.

### "lackadaisical about their service"
We traveled from Boston to Montreal to Delhi to Kolkata (India) and return on Air Canada business class. We were flying to Delhi on Air Canada and the last leg on Vistara. On the journey to return, Air Canada had a lot of weather problems. Our flight got canceled. The next day we ended up going on Montreal to Doha to Kolkata on Qatar business as a result. On the return, we flew Air Canada from Delhi to Montreal. Having flown Qatar business on the way over, the contrast was very clear. The lie flat beds were nice, but the air Canada attendants were pretty lackadaisical about their service. It was as if they did not care much about why they were there, just perfunctory about their service. The joy of flying wasn't there. The food was reasonable but the service just made it an average trip. Furthermore, when I arrived in Montreal, Air Canada has changed my connecting flight airplane type. Instead of a business class in a jet flight, I was changed to a propeller plane, all economy. I did not receive any compensation for this. Or, even a apology letter from Air Canada to this effect.

### "Thank you so much Alex from the ground crew"
Such a great Airline. I am flying Air Canada every other week for work, today, I brought along my wife and daughter, Montreal Airport customs was so long we would miss our flight. I figured I would try to make it to the gate by myself using Nexus and ask to hold the flight for a few minutes. I did, my wife and daughter arrived at the gate 10 minutes later than the flight time but we still made it. Thank you so much Alex from the ground crew who helped us so much and happy birthday! 51 flights and counting this year with Air Canada, this kind of attention keep your clients loyal.

### "never fly with them again if possible"
Air Canada cares zero about their customers. Flight cancelled after an 8 hour delay and 4 hours stuck on the airplane. No help with hotels and rebooking at 2:30am. Still waiting on compensation over a month later. Sad to see how bad they have become. Will never fly with them again if possible.

### "This is the worst airline known to man"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline known to man. They should change their name to Always Cancel, they’re an embarrassment to Canada. My flight was delayed and cancelled more than twice. I missed my reservations to other appointments. It’s so frustrating. You dont deserve to be the carrier of Canadian Flag and namesake and your personnel helping at customer service was so rude.

### "What's the point of paying so much for first class"
I booked first class. Flight was delayed by 1 hour. The flight rep at the entrance forced me to check my carry on (prescribed size) and counted my packaged rum as a piece. She was rude about it as well. I noted that my overhead bin was empty when I got to my seat. and then be treated this way?

### "no working tracking app"
Late boarding, late leaving the gate, sat on a taxiway for 45 minutes. Then late into Denver sat 30 minutes on a taxiway, so our connection and departed before we we unloaded. Lost bags no working tracking app, stuck in Denver for 18 hours. No assistance with transportation or lodging. Not even a kma. Their customer disservice is just that.

### "get the worst service ever"
I transferred from Qatar Airways to Air Canada, me and my kids were rushed from 1 gate to other although I have knee problems but they made me run. When I got to Canada none of my luggage arrived, had to wait in line outside air Canada office for over 4 hours. I paid so much $ to get the worst service ever.

### "I was impressed. Very pleasant"
Calgary to Delhi via Toronto via Air Canada. While travelling from Delhi to Calgary, my parents accompanied me via wheel chair. Over the past month , i read about horror stories with Air Canada and poor staff performance. I was really scared. I had a 1:37 mins layover at Toronto, while going to Delhi. The flight from Calgary to Toronto was on time (july 22). Perfect. I got my connection to Delhi. The flight was delayed by 40 mins or so. But that did not matter. We still reached Delhi appx 30 mins ahead of scheduled landing time. On the way back from Delhi July 28th, I had my parents accompanying me. The flights were all on time. The staff in Montreal was spot on. I was impressed. Very pleasant. Very polite and efficient. But my flights both ways were appx 24 hours long and Air Canada would get a 5 star from me. No issues with baggage or anything really.

### "36 hours of stress and exhaustion"
I have never been treated so badly than flying with this airline. There were three nice employees of air Canada our entire trip. However the miscommunication that occurs within air Canada is horrifying. We had to go through US customs in Toronto so we had to wait for our bags to be cleared. We were told “do not come speak to an agent unless you missed your flight or your flight was canceled” so we didn’t. And we waited for 4 hours until we finally missed our flight and still hadn’t been passed through. When we went to reschedule our flights there wasn’t a straight through so we had to make another stop and not even fly out of Toronto until the next morning. Spending the night in the airport is never fun but they made us go to the E gates and the next morning we were told “there will be someone working in customer service to escort you back up to the F gates at 4 in the morning.” Well guess what, nobody was there! Waited an hour and nobody came but luckily there were many other people waiting to get escorted also and security finally let us go through to the F gates. They also lost our bags so all that waiting for them to get checked in Dublin just so they could lose them. They delayed our flight again so now we will probably miss our next connecting flight that we wouldn’t have had if they had their act together in the first place. Air Canada turned what was supposed to be a great end of our honeymoon (18 hours of travel) into a nightmare of 36 hours of stress and exhaustion. Shout out to the few kind employees that didn’t treat us like idiots, prisoners, and overall disrespect.

### "didn't let us in our connecting flight"
They didn't let us in our connecting flight to Toronto so they rebooked a flight that arrived more than 24h later, our surfboard arrived 3 days later and our return ticket was "on hold" so we couldn't take our return flight and they rebooked a flight the next day, so we also missed a working day.

### "You will be very disappointed"
Montreal to Philadelphia. Air Canada was the worst, they kept delaying our flight till finally they said due to shortage of staff, all flights are canceled, I had a flight from Montreal to Philadelphia, not to mention flights to Philadelphia have been canceled for several days (my point is they knew, they would cancel this flight too but wouldn’t want to initiate sooner), they didn’t help passengers in any way, some people were going back and forth for 4 days, the employee at the gate reassured us that AC will refund for the flight they didn’t operate! I also had to pay extra for the luggage they didn’t deliver to the destination! I had to be in Philly and since I saw all of those passengers from previous canceled flights, I chose to rent a car and drive to Philly, car rentals charged me $480 US dollars for 24 hour, and I had to drive about 8 hours, I came to Philly, contacted them for flight and luggage refund and compensation, and they replied to me after about two weeks to tell me that it was due to pandemic and they can not refund anything, so basically they rip off the passengers, charge them for the flight THEY DIDNT OPERATE AND the baggage THEY DIDNT DELIVER! I forgot to mention that all suitcases were at the airport unsupervised, anybody could take any suitcase and there was at least 200 unclaimed suitcases there I decided to call them and I was on the line for about 3 hours and they told me that they can issue a refund and it should go through another airline! PLS DO NOT FLY WITH AIRCANADA! You will be very disappointed.

### "22 plus hours sitting in airports"
Detroit to Calgary via Toronto. 16 flight changes, 4 plus gate changes, 22 text messages 2.5 hours on the tarmac, 22 plus hours sitting in airports.

### "seating was very uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport to find that the flight from Manchester was put back from 12.15 to 12.30 then to 13.15 with no explanation. When we finally started to board everything came to a stand still as there were apparently 19 passengers who had got on with boarding cards that didn't have a seat as the aircraft. We were told that the aircraft on the stand was different to the one that we were checked onto and had a different seating configuration but no-one had told the check in staff! We eventually left at 14.30 which made us very anxious about missing our connection in Toronto. We needn't have worried as the 18.55 Toronto to Vancouver flight was delayed and then cancelled. We don't have a mobile 'phone so couldn't get text or e-mails and were told very curtly by the only AC staff we could find to go to the customer service desk but when we got there the queue went into infinity and didn't move. Fortunately the people in front of us were also going to Vancouver and kindly relayed the messages that they were getting as there were no PA announcements. Not very helpful to those with no 'phones! Another flight was eventually found and was supposed to leave at 21.15 but that was delayed 3 times and eventually left at 23.30 which meant we got to Vancouver at 01.25, five and three quarter hours late. The return flight from Calgary via Toronto was not much better and got us back to Manchester only four and a half hours late. There was one AC lady in Calgary who was wonderful and helped us with our boarding card and took the checked in bag for us as we couldn't drop it off because we were outside the four hour bag drop time because they changed the flight time and we didn't know. Once on board two of the overhead lockers wouldn't shut so a mechanic had to be sent for twice, the seating was very uncomfortable, the international leg food inedible, the domestic food had to be paid for, my husbands seat back entertainment didn't work and the staff were rude and unhelpful. The only good think was the checked in case arrived on the same flight as we did which wasn't the case for a lot of people! We've tried not to let those two days travelling spoil our holiday as in between we had a great time but Air Canada, never again.

### "could not care at all about their customers"
Not Verified |  Flew 4 Air Canada flights in 2 weeks, each time they disregarded the own carry on limits and allowed what I would deem as full suitcases on board, each flight I was told there was no room for my carry on in the overhead lockers and I would need to jam it under my seat, even though I'm clearly 6ft 3. When I flew back to Melbourne they knowingly sold me a connecting flight with not enough time to self transfer at Sydney airport. 3k for flights and I had to self transfer in 2 hrs, take a train between terminals at Sydney airport, requiring clearing customs and negotiating a 3 hr domestic check in line. Air Canada knew these delays as its been on the news every day for 3 months. I would stress that this airline could not care at all about their customers, terrible experience.

### "split travellers in a single booking"
The latest trend from air Canada after several flights between march and July, is to split travellers in a single booking. Always putting us only 1 or 2 rows apart in an attempt to force us to pay for seats together. And apparently all seats other than ours are "preferred" and come at a cost. It's abysmal how this monopoly exploits its position. It is shameful and very disappointing.

### "great job at failing amazingly"
Not Verified | Dublin to Toronto. I wish I could give this airline a 0 but the system won’t let me. After flying the most uncomfortable and inhumane seats on the planet, by adding way too many seats than this plane could fit to make more money. This airline has done a great job at failing amazingly. Service is just horrible, never been treated worse. Was tapped on the shoulder by a flight attendant quite aggressively and shortly after, was asked a question with an arrogant tone and loud volume. If it says there is WiFi, there really isn’t. Overall, never again. And don’t even get me started on the airport (YYZ), that’s for another review. P.S. plane is older my grandpa.

### "not reimburse us for the premium seats"
Not Verified |  Currently stuck in Zurich. On our (my wife and I) return flight from Athens to Zurich, Zurich to Toronto our connection flight was delayed for over an hour but arrived with 20mins before boarding ended (9:30a). After running through customs and airport (customs called ahead to our gate) we arrived at 9:32a. Air Canada denied us from boarding (the plane was still hooked up to the gate). There were others that had gotten there from another connection before us and had also been denied. Air Canada said they would also not reimburse us for the premium seats we had lost. Just awful, would never trust to fly with them again.

### "Not at all a great experience"
Not Verified |  Not at all a great experience. Dinner was served shortly after takeoff, and was okay even though the portions was small. Beverages was served at the same time. First 6 hours later beverages came again, together with the worst breakfast I have ever had on an airplane. A small yoghurt and a dry and cold croissant. An elder man besides me asked for a cup of coffee, but was told they didn't have more, and they could not make more because we would land in 1 1/2 hour. We sat in the first third of the flight, so not many could have gotten their coffee this morning. Not impressed by either service or by quality

### "Our family was put through so much stress"
The worst airline I flew ever in my life. We had a flight from Barcelona to Newark connecting through Toronto. First, morning before flight they sent info that all our flights are cancelled and we have an option to fly through Istanbul but only next day. When we got to airport it turns out that flights were not cancelled but delayed by 1.5 hrs. When we got to Toronto we found out that connecting flight to Newark was cancelled. They put us on another flight to LaGuardia New York 2 hours later which was even further delayed by 3 hours. The connections hall in Toronto was a total mess. People were standing in line which was barely moving and agents just kept getting up and walking out without any disregard for passengers. On top of everything when we got to LaGuardia it turned out they've lost our luggage. When we filed claim we found out luggage was simply not put on our flight. Our family was put through so much stress. You have ruined our family's beautiful vacation in Spain. Never again in my life I will fly this airline.

### "It's a horrible airline"
Worst airline I ever used in my entire life so far. Their ground staff agent at the boarding gate forced me and many other passengers to check in our carryon bags without giving us a chance to remove any important items. Long story short my carry on was left behind in Montreal and I never got it until now. It has all my home and car keys. It's a horrible airline and staff are so rude.

### "Worst flight experience"
Worst flight experience by a long shot. First flight was 2 hours late, only airline to mandate masks and aggressively did so, even between sips of coffee. Cut it close to connecting flight, stressed through customs only to eventually find out it was canceled due to staffing shortage. I suspect they knew all along but didn’t want to pass that information on. No instructions given on how to rebook or get hotel, ended up waiting six hours in line with hundreds of others in a similar situation. Ended up in a hotel at 4 am, now hoping I will be able to fly out today. Will be flying to a different airport than originally planned but I have a job so can’t just wait three days to come home. They won’t be paying my extra parking, cabs, lost income or any of that I’m sure.

### "Worst flight of my life"
Not Verified |  Worst flight of my life. Flight delayed by 2 hours, which they let us now 20 minutes before scheduled departure. Then another delay, total of 6 hours. We only received a 10 cad meal voucher for which one can't even buy a sandwich together with a drink at a regular store at the yvr airport. Finally they let us fly, serving one small hot meal after take off and then nothing for 9 hours! All of this while telling us that the consumption of our own food is prohibited! Before landing they decided to give us a small yogurt and  plain croissant.

### "Never will fly again"
Bag lost. Flight delayed. Next flight cancelled. Put in hotel. Flew out at 4am. Next flight with air Canada also cancelled. Luggage still lost. Spending the night again. Never will fly again.

### "delayed my flight for 3 hours"
Not Verified |  Air Canada delayed my flight for 3 hours for the simple reason of not having a gate agent. No one told us anything until minutes after our flight was already supposed to be in the air. Incredulous. Pay your gate agents more or make them less essential in getting planes in the air on time. Giving a 1 out of 10 for the funny and helpful flight attendants. Guess we will just drive if I go to Canada again.

### "no respect to their customers"
Not Verified |  This airline has no respect to their customers, delayed my flight for over 4 hours, then cancel it, without any vouchers etc, had to stay at a hotel for an extra day in Toronto with no help from them. They put me on a flight for 4 the next day only to have this flight delayed for another 3 hours. Air Canada are not taking your calls, I am stuck in Canada with no help from them.

### "they proceeded to lose my bag"
Air Canada lost my luggage. But this is not the worst, they returned it but it was not mine. While the plane was boarding, they said that they have no space for the hand luggage in board for some reason, and asked me to give in my hand luggage right on the boarding site. After that, they proceeded to lose my bag and then return me the wrong one. Now I have to find the real owner of the bag and have a meet up with them. Also they delayed all my flights for 2+ hours.

### "26 days and I have yet to receive a reply"
My flight from Toronto to Atlanta was cancelled. After already flying from Asia to Toronto, this was the last leg of my journey home. The flight was cancelled without an announcement at the gate; the flight was simply removed from the departures board. I received a text notification of the cancellation about 2 hours after it was cancelled. At this point, I also received an email with a rebooked flight with a connection for the following day where I would arrive in Atlanta in early afternoon. Since I had to work that day, this was insufficient for my travel needs. There was no agent at the gate to help with rebooking. The wait for customer service was over an hour as stated on the customer service line when I called. Thus, while staying on line with customer service, I was told I needed to go through Canadian customs as I could not stay in the gate area overnight. I went to the Air Canada customer service desk and waited in line for about an hour. At this point, an Air Canada employee walked around handing out customer service business cards and stated that the customer service desk was closing for the day. No one ever answered the customer service line. I had to book a flight on Delta for first thing the next morning to get me to work on time. Once home, I submitted an online customer service request for reimbursement. It has been 26 days and I have yet to receive a reply. Today, I called the customer service phone number provided, which went to reservations. I was told there was no one in customer service I could speak with. I was also told that because I booked my ticket through priceline, all reimbursement requests would need to go through priceline. However, priceline had already told me to deal directly with Air Canada for reimbursement. The Air Canada representative said I was welcome to file a complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency.

### "5 pieces of luggage were left behind"
Even before our flight left we should have known that we shouldn't have picked them as our air carrier to take us on our holiday. They changed our flight info several times even before we left. When we flew to Edinburgh all 5 pieces of luggage were left behind at the Toronto-Pearson Airport. Got 3 pieces of luggage on day 7 of our holiday and the other 2 pieces of luggage didn't arrive until day 14 of our trip and we left 2 days later. So needless to say, it was not an enjoyable holiday as we were worried about where our luggage was at with all our clothes. If they had a -10 on the scale for rating that's what I would give Air Canada.

### "Customer service was terrible"
Not Verified |  Air Canada was the worst airline I’ve ever flown. Rebooked our flight mid travel home to the next day. Leaving us stuck overnight in Canada. Then lost all 5 suitcases. Customer service was terrible, no help at all. Montreal airport baggage claim area is flooded with unclaimed suitcases just piled up everywhere. I’ve never seen anything like it.

### "nonchalance of the staff at Montreal Airport"
Not Verified |  These are not the best of times to travel and I quite understand that. However, what I feel untenable is the nonchalance of the staff at Montreal Airport. In my decades of air travel experience, not even in developing world was I made to feel the way I now feel after waiting over 27hours to fly to London due to a last minute cancellation. Its a shame that they are never helpful. Their answers is either "I'm not sure" or " speak to the next person". I would say they lack empathy and motivation for what they are doing. Customer service is 0% .When it comes to passing information, this Airport is the worst. You have to start asking your co-traveller to know what's next. Air Canada is fast becoming synonymous with delays. Flights never go as at when due and for no reason. I'm really sick and if there are other viable alternatives, I don't think I want to use this Airline again. For certain, I will never fly through Montreal Airport again.

### "5 hours to exit the airport"
I will never fly with them again. In these times, flying is not going to go smoothly - this I expected. What I did not expect was the lack of respect, compassion, and assistance from the staff. They were rude to my travel agent and to my friend and I when all we asked for was directions in Montreal Airport on arrival. This lead to it taking us 5 hours to exit the airport.

### "My trip has been a nightmare"
My trip with Air Canada has been a nightmare. Our flights were cancelled a week before our trip citing “labour shortages.” Once we finally rebooked, we found out only hours before our flight that it was so delayed, we would miss our connecting flight and had to frantically rebook everything again. Our new itinerary included being stranded in the airport lobby overnight because we weren’t allowed to recheck our bags or go through security as our delayed flight caused us to arrive after all the check-in counters were closed (11:00pm). We were told to come back to the counter at 2:30am and by 4am, there were still no employees in sight.

### "has the poorest customer service"
Not Verified |  They don't respect peoples time. I had four flights with them all were delayed, everyone lost their connections, and there were no AC agent at the airport to help us. I witnessed lots of family dramas and disappointed passengers, rude staff and many more. Air Canada has the poorest customer service. When I wrote to their customer care they offered nothing for a 15-hour delay in flights and they just said the events were out of our control!

### "Treated like cattle"
First delay notification came 6 hours prior to the flight due to cabin cleaning issues, once the flight was actually supposed to leave at the delayed time, the announcer indicated they have overbooked the flight and will be kicking people off and facing further delays due to baggage spacing. Then we get another delay notification due to crew members being MIA, followed by another delay due to "operational issues". How can you over book flights with a digital system with seat numbers and counts? While typing this I received a 4th delay notice still due to cabin crew being MIA. 44 minute long flight is now more than 200% delayed. Treated like cattle for a premium paid service, not to mention we just spent 80% of our two week vacation without any luggage, because Air Canada lost it.

### "a very poor experience"
Our itinerary was a very poor experience for us. We dealt, almost exclusively, with rude staff. And when it wasn't being directed at us, it was toward other passengers. We encountered rolling delays, for which we were given bizarre explanations. For example, we were told that embarkation was awaiting the plane to "cool down" because it was "a little warm". This delay was allegedly ten minutes, though would actually be thirty. All this was after three initial delays (each 45-60 minutes). Once on the plane, it would be almost another hour before wheels up. Overall, a very unpleasant experience which caused an almost 30 hour delay in our travel plans. Further, we understand that their refund policy is not very customer friendly. If they grant us a travel voucher, we will regard it as a loss.

### "Definitely has gone downhill"
Just awful. They suggest that you get to the airport 3 hours early (I arrived at 5am for an 8:45am flight) and then make you wait for 1.5 hours before going through security. I was among the earliest people to get into the line at security and I still almost missed my flight. Coworker was right behind me and he did miss the flight. Definitely has gone downhill.

### "worst airline experience ever"
Not Verified |  Rogue airline, and worst airline experience ever after giving it a second shot. Flights are delayed and they think food vouchers are worth compensation. Flight was delayed for 7 hrs while already at the airport with my 97 yrs old dad together with other older folks at assistance corner, and they didn't care at all to find them any comfort for the long stay, and staff were extremely rude and lacked compassion

### "I lost my two checked in bags as well"
I booked a round trip flight from MCI to IST and return flight from AYT to MCI, Air Canada from MCI to Toronto was delayed for 30 min. Air Canada from Toronto to Manchester was delayed for two hours and 15 min. That was why I lost the next flight from Manchester to Istanbul, and I lost my two checked in bags as well. I received a text message from Air Canada that I would receive my two checked in bags in Istanbul, while in reality I should have received the checked in bags in Manchester and check them in again for Turkish flight. I filed a claim in Istanbul airport, and I have to call multiple times until I get my bags, I received the bags after 3 days.

### "thank you so much for a job well done"
This flight was the final leg of our journey from Rome to Honolulu via Munich and Vancouver. All of our flights were delayed, we flew Lufthansa from FCO to MUC, then MUC to YVR. Our final leg from YVR to HNL was with Air Canada. Our flight from MUC to YVR was delayed leaving MUC, and landing at YVR. Going through customs and immigration at YVR was long and frustrating. Looking at the Departure screen our flight AC 519 to HNL was in the final boarding process. I asked the AC agent on duty at the passenger screening what could be done to insure my wife and I didn't miss our flights. She escorted to the head of the line. After going through security, it was then through passport control, then customs, very time consuming due to the large amount of people. By the time we cleared customs, there was an Air Canada agent with a cart to take us to our gate. What a very nice touch. We arrived at gate E80, we were the last people to board, even on the screen our names were displayed for last call. We were able to board the plane thanks to the assistance of the ground and cabin staff. Air Canada's service was remarkable and I can't thank them enough for their service and their going out of their way to get us onboard our flight. The 737max8 is such a quiet, comfortable aircraft, and quite roomy. To all the staff of Air Canada at YVR and to the flight crew aboard AC flight 519, thank you so much for a job well done and for all your assistance.

### "The worst airline that exists"
The worst airline that exists, the crew was rude to me, the food is average. If you call customer service they tell you that the waiting time is 2 hours. I flew Miami Montreal Athens, what a nightmare, the first delayed flight, I was able to make the connection because all their flights are delayed. Back I had a layover of 3 hours and I spent all of them making lines in the corridors of the airport trying to check point for American citizens, something incredible. On my last flight Montreal Miami I had upgraded my seat to one in aisle since I had come from a 10 hour flight and I wanted to be more comfortable and when I finally got to the counter they changed my seat to one in the middle and told me that they would make me a refund. It was not about the refund but that I had paid and chosen a seat and they changed me without any explanation. Extremely rude plane crew, really do yourself a big favor and avoid this airline.

### "why we cannot be upgraded for free"
We were flying from Toronto to Seattle with stopover in Vancouver on July 1, 2022. Flight AC103. Our flights was supposed to leave at 8:15. At approx. 7 am we received a sms that our flight was delayed until 10 am. Since we had to embark on Alaskan cruise on July 2nd I went to the Customer service and asked them if they could bump us to an earlier flight so we won't miss our connecting flight in Vancouver. She said no because we had checked luggage. We've waited and at 9 am we've got another text message that our flight won't leave until 1 pm. We waited again and at need we got a message that our flight is cancelled. When approached the Customer service I was told the they have no idea when and how Air Canada will send us to Vancouver. When I pointed out that we have a cruise coming next day and we must be in Seattle by the end of the day July 1st they said that it cannot be guaranteed. I went to Air Canada website and found a direct flight Toronto-Seattle leaving at 7pm. I brought this information to them and asked us to bump us (there were free seats) to this flight. They said no because there were only seats in business class available. We couldn't understand why we cannot be upgraded for free to the business class if Air Canada cancelled our flight. Long story short we were told that if we want to be on the flight AC543 Toronto-Seattle we need to buy  tickets to business class! Since we couldn't miss our cruise we did that paying about CAD5,300. We went upstairs to Air Canada Counter and asked to redirect our luggage to Seattle with our new flight AC543. We did this twice with two Air Canada employees and they both reassured us the we are going to get our baggage (with all our clothes for cruise - active, dressy, casual, toiletries etc.) When we got to Seattle no need to say our bag was lost. Today's in July 12 and it's still sitting in Seattle (we got a call this morning). So we had to go to department stores and buy pretty much everything.

### "I will never fly Air Canada again"
I will never fly Air Canada again. I had a horrible experience on the second leg of my flight -- Toronto to London, Ontario on 6/20/22. I received text messages every 20-30 minutes indicating the flight was delayed, only to have them send a text hours later that the flight was cancelled - at about 11:20 p.m. This was followed by another text indicating I was rebooked on another flight on the 23rd. I could have walked to my final destination in less time. Myself and other passengers were left stranded in the airport with no help. After much wandering, I finally found an Air Canada employee who was unable to help, but directed me to another area, where there was no one to help. I eventually made my own plans to get to my destination. To add insult to injury, today, Air Canada informed me I would not be reimbursed for my cancelled flight because it was due to weather. At no point in the many texts I received or announcements that were made was weather mentioned. Days before my return flight, scheduled for 6/30/22, I received notification that my flight from London to Toronto, Ontario was cancelled, and had to make arrangements to get to Toronto to catch my flight home. I suppose they'll find a way to blame something not covered for that cancellation as well, despite the fact that I incurred additional charges in order to get it. The indifference shown to paying passengers is unforgivable. They literally just stole our money, inconvenienced us, and are responsible for additional expenditures since they left the entire flight stranded.

### "they are incompetent"
Not Verified | Manchester to Calgary via Toronto. I am writing this review on behalf of my elderly parents. The entire experience from Air Canada has been horrible. My Father had all ETA visas needed, confirmed online by CIC and because of a glitch in (I assume) Air Canada software was unable to board the flight. My mother had to board by herself. Delays at all ends both times. First delay caused the missed connection at Toronto. No hotel was offered, 33 hour journey, had to sleep on floor of airport. My father was rebooked and was refused 2nd leg of transfer in Belgium. Leaving him stranded overnight. Eventually got back home to UK next day totally exhausted and literally near collapse. No explanation can be given as to why he was (a) refused to board in the UK and (b) was allowed to fly via Air Canada from Man. and subsequently denied boarding on the 2nd flight to Toronto. All flights were operated by Air Canada. Tried to call Air Canada help desk and was on hold for 4 hours, yep that's right, 4 hours! Phone eventually stopped playing music and went to dead tone. As I write this I am just hoping that the flight from YYC to Toronto isn't delayed for longer than the 45 mins stated. If it is then the whole ordeal will start again. My advice, if you have no other option but to use Air Canada, get to the airport the day before. The only word I can use to describe the whole experience would be "ordeal". Covid may have started this but greed has been the driving force behind this terrible experience. I am not going to rest until I have every penny of compensation legally allowed. Needless to say the next time we spend thousands of dollars on air travel we not be using Air Canada. I simply think they are incompetent. Rant over.

### "Don't make our mistake, do not even consider using them"
Not Verified |  This is the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of trying to work with. We had a group of 31 people, their pilot decided to up and leave an hour before our flight. We tried to call Air Canada to get this resolved, but guess what, they don't actually have a customer service at all apparently. The reps at the airport are contracted and really have no sway over their system at all. Air Canada to this day has still not worked with us or helped us get to our destination. Good luck speaking with someone, I honestly don't know how a company like this is able to still operate. Don't make our mistake, do not even consider using them.

### "experience is just overall negative"
The experience for my wife and I was bad; the kiosks were non functional, not easy to follow (bad user experience design), check-in staff were very sub-par and lacked the emotional intelligence to respond accordingly with non working kiosks, even with the queue elongating. They also would not assign me and my wife next to each other with regards to seats on the plane. What kind of airline lacks the awareness of assigning seats to people when a ticket for a couple or family is bought together. And then at the gate, it’s the same for the staff. The whole crew is so underwhelming and the experience is just overall negative. It’s really sad that common customer service experience cannot be provided. Just utterly horrendous service.

### "absurd fees for changing the flight"
I would like to make a complaint. It's funny how things are! When Air Canada sends us an email from the CEO explaining that we may be facing some delays or even cancellations of some flights, and this email is an early apology, and in this same email they ask us to be understanding. However, when the situation is the opposite, that for some reason we cannot travel on the scheduled date and we call to try to reschedule the flight, Air Canada imposes absurd fees for changing the flight. My wife had surgery on June 24th, at first it was supposed to be a simple surgery and the next day she could leave the hospital. However, after the surgery, my wife had complications and almost lost her life, having to spend 5 days in the ICU, having to receive a blood transfusion, losing more than 7 kg. But luckily the worst is over and now she is recovering at home. We have all the information about the surgery and what happened, and a letter from the doctor asking my wife to postpone her return to Canada. She was supposed to return now on June 24th, the doctor requested something around 30 more days for her to fully recover. Based on this, I called Air Canada's medical office to request a change to her flight, and I was informed that this situation was not a medical situation and that they cannot change the ticket. That I should contact the call center, normally as if it were a normal situation. So, I called and talked to an attendant, he said that I should pay a difference of 800 dollars if I wanted to change the ticket for the given date. My wife's ticket has 3 destinations, Foz do Iguacu to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo to Toronto, and Toronto to Ottawa. I asked if it would be possible to change all these trips to just one direct trip from Sao Paulo to Montreal, but I was informed that the fee to make this change would be 1800 dollars.

### "How inept can 1 airline be?"
Not Verified |  Air Canada had always been at best a 3 star airline. Now since covid they don't rate even one star. Every flight has an issue. Waiting an hr for ground crew. Canceled. Delayed. As I write I'm sitting in Montreal at 10pm. Flight was scheduled for 8.30pm. 3 delays later they now tell us they "just" discovered a mechanical problem and the planed needs to be changed. How inept can 1 airline be? Jeez. You'd think Trudeau was the one running it.

### "have zero regard for their passengers"
Wow. I had no idea how bad Air Canada was until I had a terrible experience with them 2 days ago and went online to see other customers experiences. Everything you read is absolutely true. Do not fly this airline. They are bullies and have zero regard for their passengers. Save yourself the gaslighting and book another carrier. They called LAX security on me because I asked for a bully flight attendants name. Of course, once security arrived they did nothing because it was ludicrous. Unbelievable behavior.

### "Attendants rude as always"
Absolutely horrible airline. In every sense. Horrible customer service. Was on hold with them every day for a month to try to get my newly wed wife and I to simply be sitting together (TLDR didn't end up happening even at check-in when we begged for it much to their indifference), they fed us 2 times in a 16 hour flight, which, mind you, was pushed to 16 from 14 because they made an unexpected stop to "refuel" literally a few kilometres from our destination, likely because they wanted to save time for an upcoming flight, at the comfort and convenience of their current passengers. Attendants rude as always (noticed this trend in my last few flights with this airline) and could be audibly heard mocking passengers. Abhorrent. I know sometimes we have no resort but to take this airline, but if there's ever an alternative (e.g. biking), do it.

### "so kind and was a great help to us"
Not Verified |  My Boyfriend and I missed our flight from Ottawa to Halifax but rescheduled to leave later that day, not knowing since we booked a round trip our tickets back would be cancelled. When we arrived to the airport to return to Ottawa, we didn't have tickets for our flight. Luckily Mo, the Air Canada boarding agent was there to help us! Even though we were stressed and frustrated with the situation Mo was a delight and so kind to us. He did everything he could and got us tickets for our flight (which was leaving in an hour!) charge free and without hassle. he was so kind and was a great help to us! thanks Mo!

### "this will be my first and last flight with Air Canada"
Not Verified |  I have flown with different airlines and I haven’t come across such a terrible airline, I am extremely disgusted with their service. These people are immune to delays, my flight was consecutively delayed for 3 hours and while waiting on the plane to taxi at the last minute they were still loading passenger luggage and we were informed that the plane was going to fuel. Who runs this airline, how dare you let passengers go inside the plane before finishing all the requirements. They had the nerves to tell us some one was missing from the crew to do this and that. For myself this will be my first and last flight with Air Canada, it’s a waste of time, money and energy. Passengers your time is valuable.

### "Awful, awful, awful"
Not Verified |  Awful, awful, awful. The app does not work consistently. Phones are not answered. Check-in agents self reported a lack of training. Flight from Indy delayed 4 hours. Toronto airport was a sea of chaos. The flight from Toronto to Amsterdam was delayed an additional 4 hours. Then! Luggage lost. Wondering why Viking cruises would use this airline.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever. Last minute before boarding they decided to change the gate, we flew 2 hours after our original time. As for the food, how bad it was. The staff only walks to bother you, but when you need them, they never come.

### "traumatizing and costly experience"
My flight was cancelled and I spent the night at the airport. They didn't provide a hotel or care to tell us when we will fly. It was a very traumatizing and costly experience. I had to book a very expensive hotel the following day for two nights (no refund), then my luggage was delayed when I arrived at my final destination. (no refund). I will never use this company anymore.

### "have no clue where our luggage is"
Not Verified |  There is honestly no words to explain how frustrating, delayed and genuinely bad this airline has become. Initial flight delayed 3 hours, second flight cancelled, third flight routed to a different country before finally arriving in Naples over 14 hours after expected. It’s been 4 days and they have no clue where our luggage is. There is zero customer service that is able to help. I have called their customer service number over 20 times and the response is always the same .. they have no clue where our bags are.

### "still in airport waiting on flight"
Air Canada flight was delayed from Newark to Toronto. My family and I had a connection flight to Calgary. We only had few minutes to make to the connection flight, but we still made it to the gate. But we where told to go to the customer service since our flight has been rebooked for the next day 10:35 am without letting us know. When we got to the customer service they told us to go back where we were supposed to be boarding, by this time they are in the process of closing for 9:45pm flight. We got there around 9:10pm. They already gave our seats. Now, I asked the earliest flight since my 3 kids are exhausted. They told me there is nothing they can do and the costumer service is closed. The staff said she can’t help us but she would give us $100 meal voucher. I told her I can afford to buy meal for my family. I asked her for any hotel accommodations she said no. Now we still in airport waiting on flight for 10:35 am - Only 5 hours flight extended to close to 24 hrs.

### " Will never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Worst experience so far. We have flown plenty of airlines but it's first time for air Canada. All planes were delayed for atleast 2-3 hours minimal. They lost our bag and didn't get bag for whole trip. We had to pay for taking bag to the trip and unable to use it but still had to pay it to bring it back. One of the flight was delayed for an hour and half because their catering wasn't there yet and we had to wait for it while it was only for business/first class. Will never recommend this airline.

### "frustrated, disheartened and discouraged"
Flying Air Canada/Lufthansa Business Class home from Naples, Italy, the flight was delayed and we just made the connection in Munich. Our bags did not. Upon arrival in San Francisco, I filed a delayed baggage report and was assured that my bags would be delivered within three days. It has been ten days, and still no word from Air Canada. The baggage help line is a recording with no options to talk to a person. I have filed every online report available. Still, no word from Air Canada. Our bags were tagged and marked with flight numbers and identification. I am frustrated, disheartened and discouraged. We expected better service for Business Class prices.

### "devastating and horrific"
Not Verified | Montreal to Detroit. Our flight was delayed for three hours. On top of this we did not receive a ground crew so our plane was not fully fuelled and we were kept waiting for gas as well as a crew to pack our luggage. Just as everything seemed to be turning around and looking up, me and my group of friends were hit with a devastating and horrific catastrophe. The airline did not give us our checked luggage bags. When the nice people from DTW airport in Detroit tried to help us and check the Air Canada office, nobody answered so we never received our luggage back. Air Canada sucked the spirit out of a group of friends in a cold, harsh way.

### "Every flight was late"
Terrible experience, what should have been a 3-4 hour trip became a 48 hour ordeal. Every flight was late. I almost missed my connecting flight coming off of my Toronto to Montreal flight. The Montreal to LGA flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours and was cancelled due to weather which was not the case in reality. We deplaned, and I had to wait 5 hours in line to rebook. By this time, it was 10pm and I was rebooked to the next morning to Boston. The only hotel left was $450 and needed to pay it upfront myself. The next morning, my flight was cancelled due to staffing issues. Spent 1 hour waiting to rebook and was rebooked to Boston via Toronto and would arrive in Boston near midnight. They lost my luggage on this flight, which only got to me 48 hours later.

### "nothing positive to say here"
Not Verified |  I have nothing positive to say here. Delay after delay. App says the inbound aircraft has landed, but looking out at the gate, there isn't one there. I have spent at least 10 hours on hold booking and rebooking parts of this trip. I really don't know how people are chosen/promoted the make decisions with airlines, but from what I have seen lately, competence is not the main criterion. I will go out of my way to avoid booking on Air Canada and WestJet for the foreseeable future.

### "Luggage never showed up"
Not Verified | Edmonton to St John's. Flight from Edmonton to St John's was supposed to be a direct flight and now it's not. Two hour stop in Toronto turned into nearly nine hours. Flight was delayed seven hours. Luggage never showed up either. Good times for all.

### "I've been calling for the past 3 days to get my refund"
Not Verified |  I don't suggest you fly with this company. The reasons I'm rating with 1 star are the following. I had a flight from Greece to Montréal and then I had to change flights to grab another one from Montréal to Los Angeles the same day just one hour away from the arriving time of the first flight. When we landed in Montréal they told us that our next flight got cancelled and that you have to re do the whole procedure from the start. After waiting in lines for 2 hours (after a 10 hour long flight) an Air Canada staff member comes to the line to tell us that we will not be able to catch a flight on this day and that we should book a hotel. She told us all the hotels are booked here so "go figure it out". As you can imagine this caused a lot of anger as it was unacceptable. Oh! They said the reason our flight got cancelled was due to "lack of staff due to covid". I guess hiring extra hands in times of need are too much of a cost for a small company like Air Canada. Anyway after 100 passengers waiting in line to book their already paid for flight complained she went on to talk with an Air Canada manager. When she returned she told us that we will wait in line to rebook our flight as we were already doing and that we are going to go to a hotel for the night (she then proceeded to give us a list of hotels). She told us to keep the receipt and that Air Canada will refund you for your stay there. You just need to call this number". (She gave us a number to call). I paid 250$ for a night at a hotel. Traffic was so high due to cancelled flights that you couldn't get a room easily. I was tired and frustrated so I got this hotel. Long story short I've been calling for the past 3 days to get my refund and Air Canada puts me on hold with an estimated waiting time of 3 hours. I called reservations (they were the only ones that picked up) to tell them what's happening. They said "Yeah you have to wait 3 hours but then you will definitely get service". I told them there's no way that's ok to say! I asked for an email that I can contact for possibly skipping the phone call and they told me "No you have to wait on your phone call". Keep in mind we are talking about a $1000 flight. And this is their customer service.

### "friendly and professional"
London to Halifax. After reading all the reviews on Air Canada we were apprehensive about out our trip from Heathrow to Halifax, Nova Scotia on 4 July. We encountered a few problems at security Heathrow which caused a few issues before boarding which was nothing to do with Air Canada. We were greeted by the crew in a professional manner and welcomed on board. Service throughout the flight was friendly and professional. The food was excellent and seat comfortable. A good selection of inflight entertainment. Special thanks to the Service Director on this flight who looked after us. I will certainly use Air Canada again.

### "I’m extremely disappointed"
This was my first ever experience with Air Canada, and I’m extremely disappointed. I’m a constant traveler, but this was my first time flying into Canada from the US. I didn’t mind using air Canada for the first time. I will never make that mistake again. Not only did I get delays from Montreal, but the aircraft had electric issues. The delays continued on when I landed in Toronto while trying to get back to the US. Not to forget to mention that the landing was rough, and my baggage got lost. I would rather pay more for a smoother and easier flight.

### "don't use Air Canada"
Not Verified | Tel Aviv to Chicago via Toronto. We were flying from Tel Aviv to Toronto and that flight went smoothly. When we landed, my mom got a notification that our connecting flight from Toronto to Chicago was canceled. Now, this is common, but the next flight we were booked for was for the next morning, and it didn't even go to Chicago. It set us up so we go from Toronto to New York and to Chicago. We went to the luggage pick-up place and found 1/3 luggage. We rented a car and drove home to Chicago. Now, do note that that entire time we were going from one line to another over the span of many hours. That was a week ago, we still don't have our luggage, and the tracking thing shows that they still haven't been found. We heard that thousands of lost luggage are getting accumulated at the airport with no practical way of digging them out. We assume that our luggage is most likely at O'Hare. Most of my clothing is in there, and we have several valuables there too. This is the story for many others. We met a man who also had his flight canceled, but he was rebooked to a flight for two days later. Don't think you can just get a hotel there either. The hotels in the surrounding area are packed with people who also had their flights canceled. Just don't use Air Canada.

### "If you have a choice, don't choose Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Their website doesn't work, neither does their app, Air Canada's website is atrocious. You often try to buy a ticket, only for the booking to fail right at the point of purchase. The app is also prone to failure when buying a ticket. The custom support waits are terrible (50 minutes on hold, and they'll hang up on you). Other things that suck: try adding a credit card from the mobile app if you live in Washington, DC. Sorry, there's no "District of Columbia" state or "Washington DC" state that you can choose. You're just stuck if you're trying to use the mobile app. Sometimes you're told that the purchase didn't go through, only to find out that you did buy tickets. Better double-check under your bookings on the website, except that webpage often fails to load too. I couldn't find a way to use airline vouchers to pay for flights in the mobile app. You'll have vouchers because when you issue a refund - sometimes you don't get a refund on your credit card. Instead you get groups of $2000 vouchers. The rules for vouchers are also esoteric. Those are the things that suck from my most recent interactions with Air Canada. If you have a choice, don't choose Air Canada.

### "had to spend the night in the airport"
Not Verified |  My flight was delayed 3hrs. We were then stuck waiting for a gate (after we landed) for another 3hrs. The flight itself was only 1hr and 15mins. This caused my entire group of 35 people to miss our connecting flight to Paris. It took 12hrs to rebook us. We had to spend the night in the airport. In total most of spent 24hrs at the airport. After all this they even lost 1/3rd of the groups luggage.

### "most disorganized airline"
Horrible experience. Tossed on Standby then the flight took off with a seat for me and others on Standby. We were then abandoned in the airport told to see area after area until morning came 14hrs later and management arrived. Finally got re-booked and then booked the airport hotel which I was told I am "owed" which was a $500 nap that I haven't been reimbursed for. My bags in the "Standby holding" were also lost, I couldn't immediately retrieve them. How is that even possible? It's been 15 days and my things are are still lost; I have been travelling with nothing more than a backpack and a grocery bag of clothes. They have to be the worst most disorganized airline in existence. Avoid Air Canada at all costs.

### "many screens were not working"
My flight from Venice to Toronto was 2 hours late. Fortunately I had a long layover, but many other passengers missed their connection. My flight from Toronto to san Francisco was also 2 hours late. The airport in Toronto was a mess: flights by Air Canada were hours late. The flight from Venice to Toronto is 10 hours, and many screens (including mine) were not working. When I tried to politely ask for information, the flight attendant was extremely rude. The onboard WiFI for messaging - which is usually free in other airlines - cost around 9 USD per hour. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "a totally horrible experience"
Have had a totally horrible experience with Air Canada. They cancelled a flight on us due to mechanical issues and did not send notification of rebooking. Rebooked us for the next day but we couldn't get a in touch with anyone from reservations or support to see if there were other options as we had the flexibility to try another airport in the area. No one at the airport could help and they directed us to phones that supposedly went to their reservations support team. The phones said someone would answer quickly, but there were people there who had been on hold for more than an hour. After waiting on hold for over an hour, we gave up and went with the rebooking. Additionally, since the cancellation was due to a mechanical issue, we asked for a hotel voucher. They said they would not give it to us. We had traveled one way to Alaska for a cruise and this was the end of the cruise in Vancouver and we were trying to get home. They viewed this as we were "originating" our trip in Vancouver and therefore would only give us a voucher for a taxi to take us home and bring us back for the flight. Totally ridiculous. Then gave us a card to contact customer relations to get a reimbursed for the hotel and meal. Tried calling the phone number and it is not in service.

### "This airline is terrible!"
Not Verified |  If you are thinking of flying Air Canada, you’re a total idiot. This airline is terrible! I had been out internationally. When I woke up the day of traveling, I get a whole email completely changing it all. I arrived in Montreal and instead of going straight to my destination with a 1 hour wait, they made a 16 hour wait. We had to pay for a hotel, which by the way was expensive. And instead of going straight to my destination, they put us in Houston for 1 hour. The service is also terrible. On a a regular plane, the snacks cost money and they are very  rude about serving drinks. An international plane is nothing better. The food is terrible and on top of that they lost our baggage! Our baggage didn’t arrive. It was a waste of money and now we don’t even know if we are going to get our bags back.

### "Absolutely do not recommend Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Absolutely do not recommend Air Canada. Months ago we booked at flight home from Geneva to LA and while the first leg (Geneva to Montreal) went fine, once we landed we were told that our Montreal to LA flight was cancelled and they had booked us on a flight the next day. Unfortunately we had additional flights and events planned from LA so started looking at other options to get us back sooner. There was an overnight Montreal to Calgary and then a Calgary to LA flight (with a 4 hour layover in between) so we took it, but the Montreal flight was delayed by almost 5 hours so we missed our Calgary connection. Next they sent us Calgary to Vancouver with a Vancouver to LA connection - both flights were delayed but we finally made it home 20 hours after our initial arrival time and without the premium economy upgrades we paid for. Unfortunately our luggage is MIA and we can't get a hold of anyone to help - lines are too busy to even accept your call or let you leave a message. We repeatedly asked the Air Canada luggage agent at LAX about our bags and he simply handed a paper with call information and had I not been too tired (40+ hours of travel at that point) I would have noticed and insisted that he needed to give us a file tracing number and never even mentioned it or offered. He absolutely needs to be fired for his complete disinterest and failure to do even the basics of his job. While a number of the ticketing agents we spoke to tried their best to help, we saw a number of reps who were downright rude or like the baggage agent were completely disinterested and incompetent in their job. I now start the process to get refunds, etc.

### "waited over 1.5 hours for our luggage"
We were two passengers on a flight of 4.2 hours but then waited over 1.5 hours until 1:15 AM for our one and only single piece of luggage. There were hundreds of other pieces of luggage left from previous flights presumably by people who gave up in frustration waiting for their luggage.

### "Air Canada has serious issues"
Air Canada has serious issues at high levels. (Pun intended!) Starting at LAX they had limited staff who were not trained. All four of our flights during the two week trip were delayed. We spent one and a half hours sitting on the airplane on the runway/tarmac waiting for a parking place to de-plane, which resulted in numerous missed connections by members of our group. There was utter confusion at every AC kiosk. In Toronto, Air Canada had approximately 75% of flights canceled (in good weather). You could literally be looking at the electronic blue flight status screens and see your flight change from "On-time" to "Canceled" while you watched. So many flights were canceled, changed, and re-routed, they even lost pilot's luggage! Three times my daughter's connecting flights were canceled. They finally sent her to a rental car to drive four hours home after an 11.5 hour flight. Their car rental affiliate then charged $700/day to get a car, and she was told it would be months before she gets a refund from AC. Customer Service cannot be reached by phone, only by email. Proper management and organization at the top, along with employee training, would prevent this domino effect their errors are causing. I will never fly Air Canada again, ever! The attached image shows one of ten carousels with baggage.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Stay away from this airline - if you can. It’s terrible. The check-in crew don’t seem to know what they are doing. My bag was delayed on arrival. Air Canada baggage service couldn’t trace it - even with baggage tags issued by their system. Then I had to deal with their off-shore call centre. I called several times. They will keep you on hold for well over an hour on average (and at times will drop your call after the long wait). The nightmare begins when you go through and speak to their representatives. The reps are low-energy and lackadaisical. They don’t seem to care about their client’s issues. They still have not found my bag. Don’t let this happen to you. Stay away from this airline.

### "missed our connection as I expected"
Not Verified |  My Greece family vacation started out on June 13 leaving Miami International Airport arriving into Montreal for connection to Athens . I decided to carry 3 of our 4 bags on. The trip went without a flaw. After 12 days in Greece it was time to head back home to Miami. When we board our return flight from Athens to Toronto with a connection to Miami I decided to check all 4 piece of our luggage. Flight boarded on time and was suppose to leave at 1:15-1:30. Wasn’t cleared to take off until 3pm. At that point I realized we were not making our connecting flight to Miami. After arriving in Toronto the disaster began with this airline. We missed our connection as I expected. When asked for assistance on rebooking was told by multiple Air Canada employees to use the “White Phones” located at gate #15. Upon arriving to gate 15 and waiting in line for over an hour I discovered most (50%) of the phone were not in working order. When I finally got my opportunity to use a working white phone I was on hold for over 2 hours. I had enough and hung up. I then proceeded to Gate 4 international re-bookings where I again waited for over two hours with hundreds of other people to be told they are closing the gate at 12 midnight and will reopen at 4 am. I was then handed a card and told to call this number to rebook your flight. They offered no  hotel vouchers, no food vouchers, no  beverage vouchers. Employees said to find the nearest hotels. We decided to find the best location to sleep for the night. I figured I would give the phone number in the card a try -after 3 hours and 7 minutes of being on hold I had enough. I had to book another flight to Montreal to connect to Miami. Instead of arriving in Miami on June 23 (original return flight) we arrive on June 25. I forgot to mention my luggage was lost. They assured me it was on my flight before I boarded to travel to Montreal. Well my luggage arrived June 30.

### "Air Canada is unacceptably awful"
I travel multiple times a week for work. Air Canada is unacceptably awful, from cancelled flights to delays to poor communication and making false excuses and blaming COVID or the government for the issues. Use a different airline if you can.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline I have experienced. The crew was unprofessional and the food was cold and disgusting. On my flight at least 50 passenger’s luggage was missing. My flight was delayed by an hour and my connection ended up being 6 hours late due to air Canada's lack of preparation. I will never fly with this airline again and warn anyone about to book a ticket.

### "customer support is very bad"
Not Verified |  I flew with Air Canada and except the long delays everything was fine. At least that is what I thought. after I arrived in Frankfurt I waited for over 2 hours for my baggage but nothing arrived. I submitted the report for lost baggage and I need my baggage very quick. Sadly the customer support is very bad. I don't get any answers per email and since I am now in Germany the customer support with the international number does not feel responsible for my problems. They say the only place where I can get help is the Air Canada baggage office but they just have a North American number which I cant call for free. I don't want to pay for this airline another cent. I called the international hotline and asked for a check in fees refund but they claimed that its not possible even though their own websites says otherwise. They just don't want to pay for my delayed baggage and lie for that. That is the most horrible airline I've ever flown with in my life.

### "you have lost a customer forever"
I have been without luggage for 17 days, I left for Athens on 14th and came back on 23rd and spent hours on hold with Air Canada for the call to most of the time be dropped after 1 hour waiting or to be transferred to a call center where all you hear is “I completely understand your frustration”. I have done everything requested, submitted receipts, checked web tracer twice daily, reached out on twitter facebook Instagram and even linkedin with ZERO reply. My bag was “never scanned in” so I do not know how they will find it. They kept saying “it is not lost”…well I consider it lost if it does not arrive to my destination nor 17 days after the initial departure. They also do not deem the bag lost for 20-30 days so I have to wait to file a claim with my travel insurance until they indeed confirm it lost. Today I called again and there is now a recorded that says they have too much volume to even place you on hold, ever heard of a call back number? For someone who travels 50% of the year, Air Canada you have lost a customer forever. I will only fly WestJet moving forward. You should be embarrassed at your customer service.

### "Oh what happened to the airline industry"
Not Verified |  Oh what happened to the airline industry. First flight there was no wifi working so I do nothing for hours. Flight back guess what the TV in my seat isn't working and there are only three people in business class and the stewardesses takes it upon herself to let a family of four come from coach to stay in First Class. Now I am not pretentious but I paid for this and you didn't so you sit where you paid.

### "There are no words to describe how bad their customer service is"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Both legs of the trip were delayed by hours, they lost 2 suitcases, when I tried to get help there was none. There are no words to describe how bad their customer service is. Lazy, indifferent employees at all levels. I could write a small book about all the problems me and my family faced. Due to delays and cancelled flights, the total time for the 15 hour trip was 48 hours. They have a customer service number for customers to call. When you call you are usually on hold for 2 hours and then the call is often dropped so you have to call back hold for an additional 2 hours. Once you eventually get through, you get no help. Two weeks after my suitcase was lost I still haven't received any communication from them. Awful, awful airline, the worst I have ever flown with. Management should be ashamed.

### "Has multiple delays and then misplaces luggage of passengers"
Not Verified |  Pathetic airline. Has multiple delays and then misplaces luggage of passengers. Imagine going on a vacation on this pathetic airline and loosing all your belongings. Never ever fly on this airline if you want to enjoy your vacation.

### "the usual miserable experience from flight attendants"
Air Canada reached a new ‘low’ on my flight yesterday. Boarding was chaotic. Clearly the staff weren’t trained properly in customer service or queue management. Once on board, the usual miserable experience from flight attendants - no smiles, no effort to help elderly passengers around me and at lease one flight attendants who was rude and sarcastic. How on earth are these employees allowed to get away with such appalling attitudes? The selection of movies was awful and to cap it all, they ran out of food. But again no apologies. A dreadful experience.

### "An empty shell of its former self"
Not Verified |  Significant delays on outbound and inbound journey. An empty shell of its former self. Planes were dirty, bathroom had no running water. Food was of very poor quality. Way too many announcements. Used to be my go to airline, now I am considering cancelling another trip I have planned with them later this year.

### "This company is rotten to the core!"
Do not ever consider flying with this company, my family and I had the worst experience ever flying with this airline. To verify our part in this story we arrived at Heathrow without our eta as we were in transit only and did not realise it was a requirement. Entry to Canada visa's. We made a mistake but boy did Air Canada do everything possible to compound the issue with their arrogance and incompetence. This could have been sorted out in no more than 15 minutes if their team had been organised and trained correctly. Instead we paid £1,500.00 to book alternative flights, taxi's, overnight accommodation, arrived a day late to our destination and had more stress than with any other airline in all our cumulative flying time. This company is rotten to the core! To add insult to injury, to resolve the issues we experienced, they said they would give us 25% off our next flight with them. Why would they believe that following our worst flight experience ever we would come back for more. There's an absolute arrogance within this company. I received their offer on the 06 May 2022, my wife was absolutely disgusted and upset. I replied to AC on the 09th May 2022 suggesting they take an extremely long look at themselves but we've not heard back since. I stress do not book a flight with this company, you have been warned.

### "not recommend Air Canada to anyone"
Started off with them bumping me out of the premium seats I had booked, was irritating but shrugged it off. Then, due to airspace constraints around Toronto, the flight left an hour late. Then, once we landed, we had to wait 45 minutes to park at the gate. I had to go through a gauntlet of locked doors (where we had to wait for an agent to come and unlock/open), two sets of these actually. Then had to fumble through Canadian passport control (even though was just a connection) and ultimately missed the connecting flight to Barcelona. Then, had to go to customer service and wait in line for 45 minutes because they only had one agent working (they eventually increased this 30 minutes into being in line, which helped). They then booked me on a flight through Frankfurt that left about four hours or so later (was supposed to leave Toronto direct to Barcelona at 7PM but ended up leaving for Frankfurt at 11:30PM. Then the flight out of Frankfurt to Barcelona (Lufthansa luckily) was delayed a couple of hours but ultimately arrived in Barcelona at 6:45PM when I was supposed to arrive at 10AM so ended up there 8 hours or so late. Because of the missed connection, my bag didn’t make it to Barcelona so had to wait three days for them to get that over to me. There were no apologies (other than the automated letter they sent after I lodged a complaint) and then to add insult to injury, on my flight back, they bumped me out of premium again so at that point, being nervous about further delays I booked another flight back home with Delta, which turned out to be a good move because on the return trip (which was through Montreal), they cancelled the final leg of my flight back to Detroit so I would have been stuck in Montreal. I would definitely not recommend Air Canada to anyone, even though all the other airlines are struggling as well, it just seems that Air Canada is struggling the most.

### "no intention to fly with AC again"
Washington to Seoul via Toronto. 1. My parents were supposed to fly from Washington to Toronto to Seoul on 5/22/22 and booked their tickets through Air Canada (AC8681, AC061). Air Canada switched their flight from 1 layover to 2 layovers without any reasonable compensation, Washington to Pittsburgh to Toronto to Seoul. On the day of travel, they were notified of the Pittsburgh-Toronto flight cancellation AFTER they arrived at the gate in Washington. Their baggage had already been checked in and sent off to Pittsburgh, even though the flight staff knew of the cancellation in Pittsburgh. Air Canada gave ZERO update on whether or not the baggage arrived in Pittsburgh or were put on a return flight to Washington. Air Canada's phone support was only an automated system and no human picked up the phone. After many attempts to reach the airline, my parents began DRIVING to Pittsburgh from Washington on Monday, 5/23/22, when Air Canada told them to go pick up baggage in Washington, 1 hour after they started their trip to Pittsburgh. They had to reschedule their flight to 5/25/22 and cut down their trip in Korea by 3 days. Again, no compensation was provided from Air Canada. 2. My parents got on their return flight on 6/28/22 from Seoul to Toronto and they were supposed to arrive home same day in Washington. Upon arrival in Toronto, they were told that the flight from Toronto to Washington had been cancelled and that there were no flights available for the next two days. They have been stuck at the airport for 2 hours now trying to get assistance. They are offering hotel assistance of $300/night with hotels just around the airport when there are less than 10 available rooms around the airport when there is a giant group of passengers stuck at the airport because they are unable to return home to the US. They also provided only $10 for food and drinks until their rescheduled flight. What in the actual hell can they get with $10? 3. Air Canada agents had claimed that the baggage would be transferred by Air Canada to their rescheduled flight. However, my parents arrived in Washington today (6/29), only to discover that their baggage did not arrive with them. We don't know if the baggage is still sitting in Toronto or if they are lost. They just took a taxi home without their baggage and both my parents had 2 bags each with a lot of stuff brought back from Seoul. All Air Canada so far has offered is 20% discount for my parents' next flight with Air Canada. My parents have ABSOLUTELY no intention to fly with Air Canada ever again after this experience.

### "succession of unacceptable events"
Cleveland to Athens via Toronto. From beginning to end, it was only a succession of unacceptable events. Aircrafts delayed one after each other and no reason provided. Stuck 2.5 hours in a 96F plane with 56 people, agitated and getting dizzy. Condensation dripping from the ceiling and no AC. All connections missed and had to sleep in the airport, on the ground as they were having no customer service open on site or on the phone. Stayed on hold 2.5 hours, twice, to not even able to talk to someone. Lost luggage at the final destination and not able to even be located. Will never fly with this company ever again. Rude staff or just not even assisting.

### "never book this airline"
Not Verified | Ottawa to Frankfurt via Montreal. Worst airline I've flown in my life. What happened: 1. There was a mother with a small child, the child was thirsty and the air hostess refused her water, she drank secretly herself. Me and one other person were yelled at by a staff member because we started eating too early. I've flown a lot in my life, I'm really not a person who is exhausting and wouldn't write the review if I hadn't been personally attacked. It's a shame that the cartels and the mafia are so strong in Canada, poor country. I am happy that I will never book this airline again. I can only advise the Canadian people to fight back. | Die schlimmste airline mit der ich in meinem Leben geflogen bin. Was ist passiert : 1. Da war eine Mutter mit einem kleinkind das Kind hatte durst und ihr wurde von der Stewadess das Wasser verweigert, selbst hat Sie heimlich getrunken. Ich und eine weitere Person wurden von einen Sint Steward angebrüllt weil wir zu früh angefangen hatten zu Speisen. Ich bin in meinem Leben viel geflogen bin echt kein Mensch der anstrengend ist würde die Bewertung auch nicht schreiben wenn ich nicht persönlich angegriffen worden wäre. Schade das die Kartelle und die Mafia in Kanada so stark sind armes Land. Ich freue mich das ich diese Airline nie wieder buchen werde. Dem Kanadischen Volk kann ich nur Raten wehrt euch endlich.

### "definitely wouldn’t recommend"
Seattle to Athens via Toronto. There was only one Air Canada employee who took the time to actually assist us. Aside from that, we had the worst experience recently. It is too much to write here, but basically everyone from the flight attendants to the agents at the airports all acted as if they were being inconvenienced when asked a question. The agents at the airport would literally just walk away from customers mid question, the flight attendants sat at the back of the plane 95% of the flight and told us “if we want something we can help ourselves to it in the back.” Then, after a delayed flight that resulted in us missing our connecting flight, every agent we tried to speak to regarding direction and assistance would just say “I don’t know, you’ll have to figure it out” then walk away. Even when we returned for our flight the next day - same experience regarding customer service. I walked up to a desk where 4 employees were just standing around and one was texting on his phone. I asked him a question and he looked up from his phone with annoyance beyond measure and then gave me a snarky response that was also not informative or helpful. Our overall experience was awful UNTIL we spoke with the staff who answered our simple questions and pointed us in the right direction! Air Canada is a step above Spirit and I definitely wouldn’t recommend.

### "last time flying with them"
Calgary to Toronto. The flight was delayed by two hours, like always. I have flown with Air Canada now 5 times this year and every single time the flight was delayed, there was no apology any of the times. This time particularly I had checked in early and picked a seat I knew I would be comfortable in as a tall person, last minute the gave me a new ticket and shoved me at the very end of the aircraft in the middle row with no explanation or apology. They are set up poorly and have the worst customer service I have yet to experience. This is the last time I will be flying with them.

### "Air Canada couldn't seem to care less"
I arrived in Athens after my flight that departed from Montreal to find that my one checked bag had been 'delayed'. I was sent over to the baggage supervisor who gave me a baggage code for online tracking, they took down my temporary address in Mykonos and said it should take 2-3 days for my luggage to arrive and be sent to me, and that I could check the WorldTracer site for updates or call their baggage center number. 4 days later I still don't have my baggage, and neither myself nor any of my friends or family are able to access the WorldTracer website without it completely crashing, and when we call their baggage center phone number, an automated message says that Air Canada is "sorry" that they "cannot put any calls on hold at the moment due to the high volume of calls". No callback option was offered, it only said to try calling later. I tried talking to their online chat service, and I don't know if the whole thing is a bot or what, but long story short all it did was tell me to use the services that I'd tried, or to try sending a message to AC via Twitter of all things. I've been calling AC hourly for a week now and still haven't spoken to a real person. My baggage has medication in it that I have had to try and replace in Greece at my own cost, not to mention all my clothes and other important personal items. Air Canada couldn't seem to care less. I do lots of flying around the world for my work, and now I'll be doing everything I possibly can to avoid Air Canada so I don't have to deal with this ridiculous lack of customer service again.

### "the worst customer service and attitude I have seen"
Worst airline experience to date. My flight was canceled from Montreal to Pittsburgh. Air Canada rerouted us to Toronto where my group of 32 got stranded. There was no possible way for us to get back home to WV, USA. No busses, no rentals (when there were rentals they were $600+), and hardly any hotels. They offered no help and seemed annoyed by our frustration and concern. So, we sat in the baggage claim for 20+ hours until a couple of family members were able to drive 7 hours to get us. On top of that, some luggage was lost and damaged on the flight to Dublin, Ireland through Air Canada. Overall the worst customer service and attitude I have seen in an airline, and I will never fly through them again. I will tell everyone how terrible Air Canada is!

### "my bag was missing"
Toronto to London via Montreal. Flight was absolutely great - no complaints at all. Arrived at Heathrow T2 early morning of 16 June. Waited a long time for bags to be delivered. After additional one hour wait my bag was missing. Waited another hour in queue for the AC baggage handling service Global Baggage Solutions. Finally met someone - 'Yes, your bag arrived on the flight and it is tracked as being misdirected to Terminal 1 (which is incidentally closed). Was advised to wait at airport and return in the afternoon, when it will have been brought across. 7 hours later (multiple Costa coffees) I went back in airside to be told that it had not been delivered yet. Was told to complete an online GBS World Tracer misdirected baggage form. Twelve days later, following multiple emails and over three hours in the queue (calling North American from the UAE), didn't manage to get to speak to anyone nor receive a reply from Air Canada. My bag contains business clothes which I have managed to make do without up to now in the misguided belief that the bag would be back to me quickly. Will have to spend significantly and claim against AC which is a shame but its clear where the responsibility lays. In fact, just one email during the last 12 days from AC to say, 'we are on it, would have gone a very long way but sadly non-communication is the business model. My ratings hopefully show where the issue is and is not.

### "take it or leave it attitude"
Not Verified |  Air Canada will not answer the phone. Not for customer service nor for lost baggage updates. And it is byzantine/impossible to pursue much of anything online. Yes, my 12 hour itinerary from Lisbon to Pittsburgh became a 49 hour nightmare. No, there was little to no help on the ground at Toronto or Montreal. Yes, my bag is still lost a week later. No, there is not a way to get an update about this situation. They are impossible to work with and it seems to be a take it or leave it attitude. Once in the air it is fine, and I could even tolerate some delays and inconvenience. I am a seasoned and patient traveler. But the lack of transparency, the impossibility of finding help - these entrenched values are unethical.

### "No support from ground staff"
Started my journey from Bangalore on june 25 IST and was suppose to reach Dallas on June 25 CST 9.30pm via Montreal. We missed our connecting flight because of long queue of luggage security check. No support from ground staff. Had to spend 5 hrs in queue to find the information of dropped Luggage. And then had to spend 13 hrs in another queue to re- book for another flight. Got some relief when got another ticket Montreal-Toronto-Dallas. Today on Jun 27 reached Toronto and to our surprise we find the flight from Toronto to Dallas is Cancelled without notification. And now again we have to go through same hassle of collecting luggage and rebooking flight. Pathetic organization. Stuck in Canada past 3 days and still see no hope to be home because of this airline.

### "cabin staff were rude"
Not Verified | London to Kelowna via Vancouver. Why or why do we do it? Obviously being English we don't want to make a fuss! Used this airline now several times every year, we have family in Canada and obviously it makes sense - never again, The cabin staff were rude, made us feel like 2nd class citizens, this is a common issue, their fake smiles and sniggers about passengers goes on all the time. The food is so dull and boring, its their standard, the inflight films are old and nothing new or to-date. That being said the more senior the staff the less they care. I am one of so many who have expressed an opinion, when I previously emailed and complained only to receive a standard reply something a 5 year-old could put together. The 4/10 reviews say it all. Oh please don't expect any favours or genuine concerns from anyone no one there wants to help.

### "Horrible service"
Rome to Los Angeles via Toronto. Never again and will be advocating against flying this airline. Horrible service, delayed flight, lack of basic service and list bag on top of everything. Trying to call their bag handling service and it’s impossible to get of hold any agents, their website for the lost/delayed luggage has not been updated since we filed the report, it has been almost 2 full days since we landed and we have not heard from anyone regarding our luggage! Calling reservation service and the automated message is saying they can not answer the calls!

### "simply ambivalent and arrogant"
Air Canada as an organization is simply ambivalent and arrogant. I’ve flown with them twice in the last month and have experienced massive delays (in excess of 4 hours each time) without so much as one apology, let alone complimentary food or beverage once you eventually get on the flight. They simply act as if nothing happened. They’re a disgrace.

### "absolute worst experience"
This airline is the biggest joke. Most recently I travelled from Sault Ste. Marie to Edmonton and we had the absolute worst experience. They let us board the plane in Toronto with no food or water on the flight. It was a +40 Celsius day and we were trapped on the plane for over 3 hours in the heat while we waited for them to deliver food. About an hour into waiting they said it was going to be at least another hour and half delay and stated they would bring their manager to see if we could de-board the plane. We heard nothing else about this and we were trapped on they plane for another 2 hours. They eventually brought us lukewarm water (one cup each) and a granola bar that wouldn’t feed a small child. Finally we were able to take off and by the time they brought back the food cart they were completely out of food… so much for that 3 hour wait. We were starving and had absolutely nothing on our 4 hour flight (not even pretzels). The economy class is so uncomfortable and packed together you’re basically on top of each other. If I could choose to never fly with them again I absolutely would.

### "I really don’t like Air Canada"
Not Verified |  A simple regional route within the same province (BC) and Air Canada was unable to have my checked bag meet me at my destination. Zero customer service, the “delayed” baggage phone line is just an indefinite hold as no one ever answers. You might think they’d have the call back option but they don’t. You might think they could let you know how long you will be on hold but they don’t. I really don’t like Air Canada at all.

### "Staff behaviour unfriendly"
I traveled Air Canada business class May 18 Delhi to Toronto and On June 21 Toronto to Delhi. Delhi to Toronto no welcome drinks, no hot towels. As they say COVID times. Ok. Food service cold not warm bread. Breakfast eggs but no taste. Cold bread. Staff behaviour unfriendly.

### "the worst experience ever"
My whole 20 days trip became miserable. The flight from Detroit was delayed more than an hour due to selling extra tickets. Due to the delay we missed our flight from Montréal to Frankfurt. Even though the plane was still there they did not open the gate for us and said boarding is over. Then they rebooked us on a flight which depart after 28 hours. I have a two years old daughter and nine years old son, and a wife. we lived these hours like we are homeless. After that our flight was on AC866 which departs from Montreal to London. After we entered the plane, something was wrong with the aircraft which made them cancel the flight and made us leave the plane after 5 hours waiting with no luck we left to the counter waiting to be rebooked. I called air Canada customer service and stayed with them around 4 hours on the phone to be rebooked. When they answered i requested to cancel my whole trip and go back to Detroit. they said next flight to Detroit is after 36 hours which is insane. They also offered next flight to Beirut through Greece after 15 hours. At that time it was around 4 am and we requested hotel since we have been at the airport for around 48 hours and all hotels were fully booked. So we spent another 15 hours. On June 16th after more than 72 hours we arrived to Beirut and waited 3 hours to get our bags but no luck our luggage were not found. i went and filled a claim at the baggage center. i have been waiting since 10 days ago and until now no luck. they lost my luggage. My whole trip is 20 days, now 13 days passed without answers about my belongings. This is the worst experience ever.

### "I will never fly with them again"
They are incompetent and unorganized. Flights were delayed, causing us to miss connecting flights. The waiting to get through security and customs was ridiculous. We missed one of our connecting flights because our first flight was delayed 3 hours, not sure why originally, then it was delayed longer because a toilet on the plain was leaking. When we finally landed at our connection it took 60 minutes to get through customs and security. We missed our connection flight. Then they sent us to 3 different Air Canada customer service kiosks, which got us nowhere. They made us eventually go back through customs and security and gave us a card with a few numbers and said “good luck.” We waited on hold for over 2 hours before we finally got through and someone found us a flight, that was of course, delayed. However it was a good thing cuz it took so long to get through security and customs. I will never fly with them again.

### "staff were friendly, food was good"
Not Verified |  We were scheduled to fly from Athens to Toronto to Vancouver. I checked us in the night before, but woke up in the morning to an email that our flight was changed to a flight via Montreal 2 hours later than our original. We decided to go to the airport at our original time and inquire. The AC rep in Athens was very polite and helpful, although she didn't understand the change, as there was a good chance we would not make our connecting flight. As we waited at the airport, I received another email that our flight was again changed to the next day via Munich on Lufthansa. (We fly on points, so can fly on any Star Alliance flight). We found this very odd as we were already at the airport and had our boarding passes. We met another family that had the same issue. (I believe it was a computer glitch). We took our chances and went to the gate at boarding time. Yes it beeped red when they scanned our passes, but the girl was able to reissue the tickets within a couple minutes. We successfully boarded. Our flight was delayed in leaving by an hour. No fault of Air Canada, there was a lot of air congestion in Athens. We finally got in the air. We have flown quite a few different airlines in business class. The staff were friendly, food was good. Not sure why they charge for wifi in business class. Every other airline we have flown it's been included. The lavatories could be kept cleaner. We were about an hour out of Montreal when the captain announced that we were in a holding pattern because of heavy congestion at the airport. When we finally landed, we were kept on the tarmac for close to an hour as our gate was occupied. Again, the captain gave us regular updates. We missed our connecting flight, as I'm sure half of our flight did. We have spent the night in the airport, as there were no hotels available in the area. We have a 7:25 am flight. The staff we dealt with thanked us for being understanding. I understand everyone has somewhere they are trying to get to.

### "Currently stranded in Montreal"
Not Verified |  The worst most disorganized airline I have flown in 15 years. Currently stranded in Montreal while trying to get home from Dublin. Flight from Dublin was delayed by more than an hour. The staff at Montreal made people miss flights by stopping us from getting to the gate till our checked bags were green as scanned. They falsely told everyone that they will call out for any people whose flights are about to leave and they won’t miss their connection. Even with an hour to spare when we reached Montreal their silly rules made us miss our connection. Then we had to wait 2 hours in line to talk to an agent who rebooked us on a flight to nearby airport 2 days later. Went from agent to agent after that trying to be let out from the terminal to baggage claim. There they said our bags were coming on a belt. We got two and waited for an hour for third one to show up. Kept being told at baggage counter 3 rd bag was also there and coming and finally a third time an agent tells us the bag is in Baltimore already. Cannot reach any one at customer service number. Hold time is 2.5 hours.

### "unreliable and incompetent organization"
Most unreliable and incompetent organization I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Round trip flights to Ireland and all four were hours late. All had planes in place but no pilot or no cleaning staff. The morning flight from Dublin to Montreal ended in chaos with half of the passengers missing connecting flights. Yes post Covid travel is different but I’ve never seen or experienced this level of complete organizational failure. We were sent to three different lines by three different employees trying to get to our rescheduled flight after spending hundreds on an unexpected hotel in Toronto for the evening but no need to rush, it’s currently an hour late as well. The most pitiful excuse for professionalism I have ever seen.

### "I find this attitude totally wrong"
Not Verified |  Check in queue at Montreal was long and taking a ridiculous amount of time, mainly due to the amount of luggage each person was checking in. When we got to speak with a checkin agent (the only remotely helpful person we met from Air Canada) he advised the flight was 20 minutes late but that he’d checked and we were fine for our connection and we headed to departures 20 Minutes turned into a 2 hour delay which would have meant us missing the flight to Manchester, though we had the pilot and cabin crew for that flight on our flight from Montreal, so the next flight would be delayed too & we had a chance of making connection. On landing in Toronto I received a text advising that my booking had been changed and I was now booked on the Toronto to Manchester flight the following evening - no other info. We made a dash to the gate our original flight was leaving from, with our original boarding cards to see if we could get on the flight - we were denied boarding as they had already given our seats to someone else (not acceptable) When we asked what our next steps were as we would now be in Toronto for at least 24 hours more we were told to find a customer service agent as theY were the only ones who could help, then ignored when asking where we would find one. We had to brave arrival border checks with the ridiculous machines they have in Toronto, then explain the story to the Border Guard to be let through to departures again, where the queue was to see the “customer service” agent. The queue was not moving very quickly and at around 23.15 one of the agents announced that they finished work at midnight and not everyone would be dealt with - as the issues are purely the fault of a disorganised & inept airline I find this attitude totally wrong, and feel there should be someone there to deal with issues at whatever time is needed, especially as they also do not answer the phone. We did manage to speak with an agent who printed new boarding cards for us (no apology) and told us that we were entitled to a hotel but they did not have any available so suggested we book and pay for one ourselves and try to claim it back. I refused to do this and stood my ground, advising I did not have the money to pay for a hotel/the taxis to and from it so they would need to find a hotel for me - amazingly enough a hotel became available after about 15 minutes, along with $20 each for food for the next 24 hours. Before leaving I checked where my luggage was as we had not seen it since checking in, I was told it was tagged to travel with us the following day. We headed to the hotel with nothing in the way of toiletries/change of clothes or anything as we do not carry hand luggage to ease the traumas at security We returned to the airport the following day, Toronto Airport was chaos, with too many flights leaving at similar times, all delayed, and not enough seats so many people just sat on the floor. Eventually we boarded the flight 25 hours later than we should have done, we’re met with miserable staff, the seat back entertainment didn’t work properly which is an issue on a 7 hour flight, the food on board was lousy, and I ended up just eating the bread roll. Arriving into Manchester we had to wait to disembark as the air bridge could not be attached immediately (airports fault not Air Canada) We then had to wait for 2&half hours before we were told that our luggage had not made it and to fill in a report, and hopefully it would be delivered to us

### "Absolutely the worst airline"
Not Verified | London to San Jose via Montreal. Absolutely the worst airline I've ever flown. 1. MOST of their staff literally don't care. 2. The gate agents (at YUL at least) are disorganized, badly trained, ill disciplined and poorly equipped. My experience: LHR to SJO via YUL - 100 minute layover - told by ticket clerk it was plenty. No chance. Flight 70 mins late leaving London "because COVID" so while in the air they deplaned me from my flight to SJO (because I had a bag checked) and put me on a plane to LAX (6hours) with a connection to SJO (another 6 hours) and another 90 minute connection. The connecting agent didn't know this though - and neither did I till I read my sms's two days later when I got home. Instead she tried to get me on standby on the flight I was going to get, I got on - but then they pulled me off the plane - I didn't notice but they'd given me someone else's boarding pass who arrived after me. He looked very pleased to be getting on the plane, they didn't explain to me that they'd messed up giving me his boarding pass and I hadn't noticed till someone pointed it out later. So the gate agent said "go to customer service" and there isn't any in YUL departures so I had to find a gate agent. Anyway, I was now stuck in departures like Tom Hanks in the terminal with no plane and no reason to be there so I can't exit - I then spent two hours begging AC people to help me and they kept sending me to other people, eventually I found a lady who was eventually sympathetic but initially thought I'd stolen someone's boarding pass. So now we spend another 30 mins roaming the gates trying to find one without a plane so they can let me through to arrivals and I can try again with the rebooking agent. Oh hi! sorry you didn't make it - let me see what I can do". Well what they could do was - book me on a flight to YYV the following morning, then on to SJO that night, ok can I have a hotel? Yes sure. Wait two hours, checking every 15 mins - then, oh sorry we've run out of hotels, you can pay and claim it. Bye. Don't forget to get your bags for extra convenience. Welcome to Canada. I head down to arrivals, clear customs, absolute chaos, thousands of bags by the carousels and a 100 meter queue for the sole baggage clerk (who incidentally was awesome if utterly overworked). Got to the front of the queue "go to 8A, it'll be there in a minute", two more hours waiting. Book a hotel - for the wrong night in exhausted state - non refundable of course. Curses. Book another hotel and get a cab into the city, room next to a wedding party, three hours sleep, back to the airport. Get to departures, use kiosk - doesn't print a bag tag, automatic bag machines all broken. Head to the bus class check in, to meet a queue of 50 people with one person on the desk dealing with someone with 20 bags and a desire for a different massive, comfy seat to the one he's been assigned. Hail a few AC automatons "yeh we told them they need more people - sorry", "I can't do any more" (this is a favorite), "you'll get there eventually" etc. After thirty mins three other surly miserable people show up and start checking people in. Queue is now over 150. Get bag tag, get told off for removing old bag tag from non existent flight. Told to calm down etc. Go to security, absolute shambles. 90 mins through security to gate, flight to Toronto is an hour late of course, but that's fine I'd allowed 8 hours. Get to YYZ and flight to SJO is being pushed back slowly - I dearly hope it leaves this evening.

### "we haven’t had our luggage"
Not Verified | Boston to Athens via Montreal. My family and I flew with Air Canada from Boston to Montreal and we had a connecting flight to Athens. They delayed our first flight and they told us they would hold out connecting flight to Greece, once we got to Montreal we got on our plane, however they did not care to put our luggage onto the connecting flight after they told us they would. We have talked to them about it and they have not done anything about it. It has now been 2 days since we haven’t had our luggage.

### "Horrendous customer service"
Not Verified | Sydney to Toronto via Vancouver. Departures always delayed, causing missed connecting flights. No support calls being taken when I tried to call and get on the next available flight. Horrendous customer service overall.

### "I'm trying to get a refund"
We flew Air Canada from Houston to Montreal and then to Casablanca Morocco and return flight from Casablanca Morocco to Montreal and then to Houston TX. All four flights where delayed leaving, the reason for leaving late was there are waiting for more passengers, each time we waited 1 hour to a 1:30 minutes, but as we waited, no one else boarded the plane, and then they said we are ready to depart, even after they close the main door, we still just sit there for another 30 minutes. This happened on each flight. The crew is so rude, and they don't give any real reason for the delay. I told the one flight attendant that we are going to miss our connecting flight and she said hopefully your flight will be delayed, no help at all. We did miss our connecting flight, I called Air Canada the next day after we finally got home, and they said it’s not their fault for missing our flight and that we have to contact United for any help. I'm trying to get a refund from Air Canada, they say it can take up to 30 days.

### "impossible for this airline to run on schedule"
Not Verified |  No idea how this is the flagship airline of our country. It seems impossible for this airline to run on schedule, and to communicate properly with its passengers. Both my flights in and out of New York were delayed multiple hours, with updates drip-fed every so often which basically meant I wasted hours standing around by the gate rather than being able to rest or relax at an airport lounge or restaurant. This is nothing new, more than half of the flights I’ve had to take to and from Montreal have delays for one reason or another.

### "never fly with Air Canada again"
The airport in Toronto was complete anarchy with hundreds of people with cancelled/missed flights. I waited over an hour in customer service line and eventually found out they are unable to book me on a new flight or get me a hotel because everything is full because too many people have missed/cancelled flights to be able to accommodate everyone. The lady at the customer service desk I was talking to got into a fight with her boss in front of me complaining about how terrible management is. I was told to book my own hotel and I could get my checked bag downstairs. (Shortly after I left they just closed down that customer service desk leaving the hundreds of people behind me with missed flights not knowing what to do with themselves). When I went to get my bag, I waited in line another hour just to find out they're refusing to give anyone their bags, because there's no way they can go back into storage and find 500 different people's bags. I was told to take my baggage claim ticket and submit a claim to arrange for my bag to be delivered to my apartment in Dallas, my final destination. I did that, and they put in the claim my address and that Dallas is my final destination. I booked a separate flight home on American, then the following Thursday I get a voicemail saying my bag is at the Dallas airport and they need to know whether they should mail it to me or if I want to pick it up. The callback number in the voicemail wasn't working for me, so after work I drove to the airport to get my bag, then was told the sent it back to Toronto because they didn't hear from me. Apparently they didn't know Dallas was my final destination, even though it was clearly in the claim, so they have to send it back to where the claim originated, and they made that decision to send it back in less than half a day, giving me very little time to respond. I shouldn't have even had to respond to anything at all, when I submit the claim in Toronto I was told it would just be Fedex'ed to my apartment in Dallas and that was it. Now I need to wait for it to circle all the way back to Dallas again. I can't wait to get my bag back so this can all be over and I can never fly with Air Canada again.

### "poor service, sloppy security and mediocre lounges"
Not Verified |  First they claimed my flight was cancelled due to weather, then not the weather but staff shortages, then just cancelled. They offered me a flight that arrives 12 hours after my original flight arrival time (Flight time is 1.5 hours). I'm guessing the mystery was to avoid pay-outs for cancellation, and we did have to upgrade to business to get the same flight path. Recent comments from staff suggested shortages in work, no breaks and long hours. What we witnessed was untrained staff, staff on their cell phones, and a general "not my problem" approach. If you are going to have poor service, sloppy security and mediocre lounges, my request would be to remove the "Canada" from the name. Just call the company Air. We are all hoping things improve, but staff will need some assistance to get there. Positive side, everyone seemed pleasant enough.

### "Their delays are constant"
Not Verified |  Their delays are constant, if you want to move to a window seat they charge you over $300, their app is horrible and not user friendly. Worst airline I have ever used. Monitor in the seat ahead would not work and inflight wifi is always unavailable.

### "the air hostesses were unfriendly and cranky"
Not Verified |  Air Canada was terrible to fly with. There’s not much I could compliment. I usually fly Qantas direct or Virgin Australia via the US to come to Vancouver, but this time decided to give Air Canada a go. I wouldn’t recommend this airline. Upon leaving Sydney the flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours extra because of some baggage issues. Okay these things can happen, at least allow your passengers to sit at the airport so they can walk around or buy some food or drink and are not stuck in a small airline seat in a cramped environment where they can’t walk around and no drinks are served to them. At least make your passengers comfortable and relaxed by offering them a water or juice or something. Nope none of that. What further annoyed me was that they kept saying another 15 minutes and another 20 minutes again and again for 2 hours. Furthermore the air hostesses were unfriendly and cranky. The flight back was just the same. First my flight was delayed by one hour which was fine. Then once again we were put on the plane and made to sit on the tarmac for a further two hours before our flight took off. A flight that’s meant to be 15.5 hours has now become a 17.5 long and uncomfortable flight. Not impressed with Air Canada at all and won’t be using them again. Watching the news while in Canada it seems that it’s happening a lot. Be aware before you book.

### "try to avoid most unreliable airlines Air Canada at any cost"
The flight was delayed due to weather and diverted to Ahmedabad Airport, we stayed over 3 hours on the tarmac and were finally allowed to deplane and then we stayed 5 hours at the airport to find out the plane to destination, AC crew left us at the airport with no contact and told us to go to hotel for a midnight flight, 3 buses of over 300 passengers. At night we arrived at the airport to take 1.30am flight to origin and were told go back and will fly the next day, no one from AC to talk or discuss, just AC abandoned us in the city far away from destination. I bought a new ticket to the origin and now AC refuses to reimburse. My advice - try to avoid most unreliable airlines Air Canada at any cost.

### "Incredible incompetence"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. Crew had not left their hotel until 30 minutes after we were scheduled to take off. Once we landed we were in the runway over an hour since Air Canada only had one groundcrew. Incredible incompetence. Also on a 4 hour flight with no entertainment options or wifi.

### "still no update on luggage"
Not Verified |  Scheduled to fly June 17th, flight 3 hrs late boarded everyone that was not connecting through Tokyo to final destination let plane leave then let us all know we would not be leaving because would not catch connecting flight. No updates on new flights had to badger then on hold for 4hrs + until rescheduled. New route was much longer with delays both times. Finally arrived 3 days after original schedule with no luggage. Still no updates and many mixed messages where luggage is located. We are traveling with senior and toddler. 2 days into trip still no update on luggage, calling long distance each time for an update hold for 2+ hrs only to be hung up on. Never again and still waiting.

### "I am beyond disappointed"
Not Verified |  I purchased a round trip from Toronto to Columbus and on my return I got bumped off my flight because 2 of Air Canada's flight crew members had to return. No other explanation given. I could not believe that simply because I was a lone passenger they kicked me off a flight I had purchased and planned for. You can imagine my stress and anxiety as I found myself stranded in an airport, in a foreign country. I had to wait over 10 hours for another flight which arrived 2.5 hours late. As an international airline company their priority ought to be their paying customers. In the last little while I have heard and witnessed a few of these incidents and I am beyond disappointed and upset about their services. In the future, and I travel often, I will do my best not to travel with them. And no favourable reviews will be given. Very disappointed!

### "they don't seem to care one bit"
My family and I flew from DEN - YUL on a direct flight. Upon arrival, we found out AC lost all 4 of our bags. We claimed it right away but since then for 7 days, we can't get an answer, their wait times are 3-4 hours and no one answers even after that time frame. We literally cannot reach anyone to find out what's going on - they don't seem to care one bit. After flying 11 years internationally, I've never had this happen before. I will never ever fly Air Canada again and will actively dissuade others from doing so.

### "the airline staff here didn’t care at all"
Air Canada is without a doubt the worst airline I have ever experienced in my life. Prepare for a rant. We booked our flights through Norwegian cruise line and all of our flights to Italy were delayed by anywhere from an hour to 3 hours every time. But it turns out dealing with that was the easy part because the way back was a horrific nightmare. We get to the airport ready to go home and saw that our international flight would overlap with our connecting flight and the Air Canada attendant said that our flight was actually leaving earlier than what I was seeing and that we would have no problem making it, but if we did miss it they would handle everything in Montreal. So guess what? We missed out connection by over an hour because the international flighted ended up being delayed by 3 hours. To shorten the story from here we searched for our luggage for 4 hours with our entire flight of hundreds and ended up staying two nights in Montreal on our own dime because the airline staff here didn’t care at all and acted like it wasn’t their problem and just wanted to go home. It took standing at United instead of Air Canada and demanding a flight in order to make anything happen. This is the most incompetent and irresponsible airline I’ve ever seen.

### "Horrible airline from start to finish"
Horrible airline from start to finish. We started in BNA (Nashville) and got the worst first impression. We walked in to a long line at the ticket counter that wasn’t moving at all. Employees were either standing there or conversing amongst each other. We get on our plane to Toronto and everything is fine and we even land a little bit early. Then, we get told we have to wait for an open gate. That’s fine, we didn’t mind it. We waited and waited and the captain got back on the PA and told us that he got lied to and that nobody was responding the whole time until after at least an hour past, and that we would have to wait for another gate to open. The captain then stated that one shouldn’t be long. He didn’t come back onto the PA until another half hour past to let us know they were about to clear that gate up. All in all it took us close to 2 hours to get into a gate. You would think this would have made us miss our flight to London Heathrow. But the good thing about Air Canada is that flight was delayed too. So we made it and didn’t take off for almost another 2 hours from the scheduled time because they were waiting on the pilot or first officer AND ground crew. We finally took off and arrived in LHR and were cutting it close to our next flight for Istanbul. We were hoping to get into a gate immediately this time. We waited 30 minutes in the tarmac this time which inevitably made us miss our next flight. We get to LHR to find out that our bags weren’t there with us. I wonder what the two hour delay was for but that’s beside the point. If you had 2 hours extra, you would think they’d get everything right since they already had so much go wrong. We idk course just accept our fate and go get rebooked for the next flight out to Istanbul. Of course it was the biggest inconvenience for them to rebook us for their mistakes. I even got questioned as to why I couldn’t make the flight if we landed at a certain time which I then responded to the associate and let them know we had landed but we’re just hanging out on the tarmac with no gate. She had no response and didn’t even apologize for the accusation that we purposely missed the flight. Everything beyond this point got so much easier in terms of dealing with airport personnel. We finally make it Istanbul and got make a report with Turkish Airlines to get our lost baggage. We would call everyday to get an update and it was something different everyday. I don’t blame Turkish Airlines for this. They didn’t lose the bag. They just are delivering it. I didn’t get my bag for 3 days and it was at night on the third day. So that left a total of just one day of the trip with my belongings. I had to wear the same outfit until I could go and maybe buy something else. My friend didn’t receive his baggage at all and they said it would be delivered the day we were leaving which means it would get here after we’re gone. He called Air Canada to see what they would do to make it all right and the response he got was atrocious. He kept getting told he would get his baggage for sure and they could deliver it to his home address.

### "will never fly Air Canada again
I paid more for a shorter international flight, their aircraft were late and I missed my connection, went from 17 hours of travel time, to no report of a delay, to no rebooking, to not being able to find my itinerary, to rebooking me to 35 hours of travel time - over double. On top of that, my partner, who was on a separate itinerary was only rebooked through Toronto (our second leg) and not all the way to Lisbon. An amazing woman at the United counter fixed it so we were able to get their only 4 hours later than anticipated. But my bag was still lost for 4 days. I am just baffled at how poorly this was handled twice, I am already trying to change my itinerary so I do not have to fly on any Air Canada and will never fly Air Canada again.

### "What a terrible experience"
Not Verified | I purchased my tickets and seat assignments on 3/12/2022. Upon checking in today I was informed that even though I had spent over $400, above the standard ticket price, for confirmed premium seating that I had been placed in the rear of the plane, middle seat and not in a premium or exit row. I was initially told that the best I could get was a refund of my premium seating cost and that could only be done by a gate agent as the flights I was on were oversold and the phone center had no ability to issue refunds. When I spoke with a gate agent I was informed there was nothing they could do for me - they couldn’t fix my seating assignment and they couldn’t initiate a refund. I was told that I had to contact Customer Relations - which was over a 2 hour wait on my previous call. We’ll see how that goes trying to get my $400 back. Air Canada is like the the Greyhound of the skies. What a terrible experience!

### "Worst cabin crew I've ever met"
Not Verified |  Worst cabin crew I've ever met, poor service and entertainment, stingy by everything even the smiles. Always there are delays and it becomes a routine. Seats are very small and close together to get more passengers. Ground staff are not qualified.

### "not recommend this airline"
The worst airline experience I’ve experienced. My journey started on June 16th from Nashville to Toronto. Once we landed we waited for over 2 hours for gate. Finally after arriving to the gate we had to run to our next flight from Toronto to London to find out that flight was also delayed. Scheduled departure was 8:35Pm we didn’t leave till 10:35 pm. Once we arrive to London our next flight to Istanbul departed due to the delayed air Canada. We had to rebook and wait in London for 6 hours. Once we arrive In turkey 7 hours passed our original arrival time. My bag was not there. Arrived in turkey June 17 today is the 20th and my bag still in London. Leaving back to the USA tomorrow June 21st and that’s when my bag will arrive. The worst customer service with air Canada not able to provide me with no compensation no nothing still waiting on a call that’s been over a day now, I had to buy everything from cloth to shoes to a whole new suitcase to travel back to the USA. this is beyond frustrating and beyond inconvenience. I will not recommend this airline to anyone else.

### "A very frustrating experience"
Air Canada from Montreal to St. John’s. Check-in for premium passengers moved like molasses as they only had two agents and both of them were on the phone trying for extended periods to sort out an issue with passengers they were serving. Despite a call for help from the Concierge desk we got no response. Flight boarded nearly 1 hour late due to late arrival of the aircraft from the maintenance hangar. Once on board, we waited for another 90 minutes as crew and maintenance staff tried to sort out an issues with the cabin management system. Following multiple power downs and reboots, we are still on the aircraft with no sign of relief in sight. Between boarding delays and hold up on the plane, we are now delayed longer than the planned flight duration. A very frustrating experience.

### "stranded at Toronto airport with an infant"
Never again. After countless delays for multiple flights (both ways) they cancelled our flight and my family of 5 and I were stranded at Toronto airport with an infant. There were no hotels or car rentals available because we got in to Toronto so late. Air Canada wouldn’t help us find a hotel or car rental. We ended up sleeping on the airport chairs. Other people ended up sleeping in the floors at the airport. Very disappointed.

### "never fly with Air Canada again"
The pilot was missing for a hour so we were stuck on the plane with no one offering drinks despite our flight also being delayed for an hour. When I asked to have more than one drink the staff refused because the flight was full. Apparently I can go to the back of the plane to get more drinks. I was in the 30th row. There was rubbish around my seat and the table had coffee on it. The food was tasteless. I will never fly with Air Canada again.

### "2 hour wait for customer service"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to San Francisco via Montreal. Delayed flight from Frankfurt to Montreal made me miss my connection. A 2 hour wait for customer service, and they cannot assign a free aisle seat (asked to charge $64) for their own fault.

### "We are incredibly frustrated"
Our flight was cancelled the day (June 16 at 08.10hrs) due to weather - not sure what weather as it was clear and sunny in both Toronto and Thunder Bay. We were rescheduled for June 17 at 15.55 hrs. We are sitting in the airport and now delayed until 17.10hrs. So far these cancelations and delays have cost us approximately $400. If we are delayed again it will add another $4-500 as we have a 4 hr drive once we land. We are travelling with a 10 yr old. We are incredibly frustrated and remember why we never fly AC.

### "they lost my luggage along"
Worst experience ever. Not only were we delayed in LAX, they lost my luggage along with the luggage of a lot of people connecting in Toronto. We barely made the flight but I guess the plane did not transfer the luggage from AC 790 from LAX to Toronto to the connecting flight from AC 820 Toronto to Barcelona. So many people were only going to be in Barcelona for a few days and going on cruises and now this negligent and incompetent airline lost the luggage. I still have not received my luggage, the world tracer thing just says that they're trying to locate it, which is crazy because you would think they would know where it is.

### "the worst airline experience"
This was the worst airline experience I have ever had. We booked tickets on Air Canada (myself and my 2 year old daughter) to fly premium economy to France. There was one stop planned in Montreal. All was well the night before the trip, checked in, bags packed, etc. I received a text notification at 11:30 pm that our flight had been rescheduled. I was asleep and so somewhat groggy when I checked the updated schedule that showed an 11:20 am departure (instead of the 9 am). The trip had been rebooked on United Airlines. I was annoyed but okay since this is just a slight change. I tried calling Air Canada immediately since I didn’t receive any additional information regarding necessary paperwork or documents to fly with United. I also wanted to confirm the trip. I tried to call Air Canada multiple times and received a message that the call volumes were high and so they would not be offering a hold. No other communication from this airline regarding these changes. I finally got through and was put on hold at 5:30 am in the morning with a wait of over 2 hours… I believe I was on hold for 2 hours and 10 minutes. When the representative checked my information I learned that I was actually booked on a flight schedule for the next day. I hadn’t noticed the date change because of the time of night when I looked at the notification. Air Canada then proceeded to explain to me that the first leg of my trip was delayed and I would miss the connection in Montreal so they booked me and my toddler for a different flight for the next day. There was nothing they could do for me and my only option for my flight is the next day as scheduled. I finally hung up and checked on the connections in Montreal Canada… there were at least 5-6 flights that were available as viable options to get me and my daughter to CDG on the original date that was planned. This has been the worst customer service and biggest nightmare. We have airport travel schedules, hotel reservations and other activities scheduled for our vacation that we will now miss but will still be charged because of the late cancellations. This is the only airline I have ever encountered where they sent a text of a flight change that is on a whole different day and give the customer no alternative flight options or even the option to cancel. You have to call and be able to speak someone in order to cancel your rescheduled flight with Air Canada. Their claim to flexible flight options and customer care is absolutely false.

### "Worst airline experience"
Was traveling as mother with two young children, from Raleigh to Ahmedabad via Toronto and Delhi. Raleigh to Toronto air Canada flight AC8839 was delayed (from 5 pm to 7:pm) that resulted in missing connecting Toronto to Delhi air Canada fight Ac 42. No help or customer service at all provided at Toronto airport. Staff was very rude and clueless. They emailed new route Toronto-Doha-Ahmedabad with flight on next day 8 pm. Did not provide hotel just said everything is booked and nothing available. We just spent 24+ hrs on airport floor/benches. Doha flight AC58 was delayed as well. Finally we reached Ahmedabad almost after 50 hours to find that we did not receive our luggage. 3 bags they sent to Delhi. Now we are struggling to chase/claim luggage with no clothes etc for our vacation stay in India. Worst airline experience, never use this airline !

### "they have not loaded the bag"
My Original flight was scheduled to leave by 10.30pm from SFO as direct flight. There is no weather issues at SFO and due to gusty winds in YYZ, the incoming flight was delayed and we all understand this circumstances as natural phenomenon. By 11.30 pm or so once we were in the flight the main door was still open and we were told that the bags were still to be loaded and some logistical delay. Three plus hours gone and still the main door was open and still no progress and I asked the one of the nicest flight attendant he said that there are no ground crews to load the bag and waiting for some solution. Today, by 10.30 Am (4.30 min after schedule arrival) finally we landed and was able to disembark the flight and after all the delay in the Immigration line, while waiting for the bags only realized that they have not loaded the bag. It is now almost after 2h from arrival we realized that part of our bags are not loaded. There is no responsible ground crew in the baggage claim area other than 4 people attending the long line of missed baggage people who can answer one customer for 10- 15 min to attend. It is clear that Air Canada has more priority to have the commercial cargo not giving considerations for the passengers.

### "There was no support from the Air Canada staff"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed taking off from Dallas as pilots needed more rest time. Could not land in Montreal on account of bad weather. The flight was diverted to Ottawa where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours. Flight took off for Montreal again but could not land this time because of excessive traffic. Plane then routed us to Toronto which resulted in us missing our flight to Athens. We were made to do customs and check out our bags in Toronto. We left Dallas at 1.45 pm and deplaned in Toronto after 10 hrs in the plane. No help whatsoever from Air Canada! Stayed overnight in Toronto airport. There was no support from the Air Canada staff. In fact the ticket supervisor was rude and belligerent. Awful awful experience. Still waiting for re booking information after over 10 hrs of being stranded in Toronto! Worst airline and worst airport!

### "missed the next connection"
The worst customer service I’ve experienced. The staff are rude and simply do not care. My flight was delayed 2 hours and missed the next connection. Their best service was to give everyone a phone number to rebook the next flight. I stayed a long time on the line and no real person answered the phone! Air Canada does not respect you and your time.

### "I will never fly them again"
My husband, daughter and I booked tickets to fly Air Canada for the Canadian GP. Checked-in and waited to board. During boarding, the lady told me that my ticket was on standby but that my husband’s and daughter’s tickets were okay. How could they tell me only when we were about to board? They put me as number 5 on standby and I didn’t make it so I told my husband and daughter to go without me. How could they break up groups like this and not tell you until the last minute? It’s not like I paid for a lower fare, why would they bump me without prior notice and have no empathy at all for my situation? How horrible they treat their customers. They arranged to have me fly out the next day but I’ll be missing one whole day of the race. They are not compensating me for the stress, my time or the things that I would miss. Absolutely horrible airline. I will never fly them again.

### "this was a very stress free trip"
Not Verified |  I am a single mother with a 20 month old child. This was my first experience flying alone with my daughter. I have nothing but great things to say about air Canada. From the moment I walked into the airport with a stroller a suitcase a car seat and carry on luggage. A gentleman ran over to help me immediately. He completed my check in and tagged up all my items. He carried my suitcase to the belt, bagged up my car seat, and gave me directions to the security section. I couldn’t thank him enough and all whilst he was rushing around to help me he took the time to interact with my daughter. The cabin crew were amazing, constantly asking if myself or my daughter needed anything. I again received almost the exact treatment at the Winnipeg airport when returning home to Ottawa. Very impressed with the help I received without asking anyone. Thankyou Air Canada this was a very stress free trip and I will travel alone with my child again.

### "book your airline travel plans with other airlines"
Not Verified |  I'm begging you book your airline travel plans with other airlines other than Air Canada. I do not have a clue why the global travel industries allow Air Canada to operate. Our flight plan from Venice to Dallas with a connecting flight in Toronto was a nightmare. We were unable to catch our flight due to AC delay, we ended up spending the night at the airport with missing luggage. We end up booking a different flight out of Toronto with American Airlines spending over $1000, AC refused to refund or compensate us for the portion of the flight and also our luggage is still nowhere to be found. Paying more for your flight with your sanity is worth more than trying to go through the cheap route.

### "avoid at all costs"
Worst experience ever! I paid for a seat upgrade, and was forced to check a carry on despite there being a ton of space in the aircraft. I wasn’t able to retrieve medicine from the carry on that I required and had glass items in my bag that were damaged as a result of having to check them. Never use this airline, avoid at all costs, the gate attendants will lie to your face.

### "the worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Literally the worst experience ever. They were 3 hours late for my initial flight to Toronto, which led to most of the flight literally running to catch their connecting flight. Only to get there & be told that our flights had been switched. I no longer was on a straight through flight to Athens. I was switched to an 11:50pm flight, with a layover in London. I won’t be in Athens at 11:40am, but now 7pm. Losing a whole day. It is now 12:26am & we are just boarding.

### "made my vacation into nightmare"
This company had made my vacation into nightmare. First the flight was delayed, then we did not get a gate at Pearson airport, so we stayed in the plane for 2 hours due to that I missed my connection. Now it is midnight. We got off and guess what. There was no one at the airport to help you from air Canada. No staff. We were told to stay at the airport whole night the staff will Arrive at 4am for the morning shift. Not to mention the night manager for Air Canada was there the entire time and did not come to help. Now that it is 4 am. We are made go from one aisle to other aisle. Now it is 6am finally the reservation area for re book open - they didn’t have any direct flight for next 2 days. No meal vouchers they wanted to provide. Even for the hotels, they will make you pay out of your pocket and then they will refund you later (which will be another nightmare to get your money back). Since I couldn’t wait for 2 days. Had to cancel with air Canada. Paid another $1500 to book with different airline for the same day. Now I am in baggage area to check out my bags with air Canada, so that I can check in with different airline. The manager at bagging area, refused to help. Her excuse was I do not have manpower now to send someone and grab your bags. She told me to go in my flight and once I reach the destination, I should report to air Canada counter for baggage. Not that I didn’t force her but she was absolutely useless. Since I had to get on the flight, I left. When I arrived at my destination airport, there was no air Canada office here. And the counter only opens when there is a flight schedule. So now I am stranded here without my baggage for last 5 days. No update. Trying to get a hold of the staff. My vacation is just turned into a nightmare.

### "I will never fly Air Canada again"
Multiple delays followed by a cancellation. Excuses used included, mechanical issues, weather, air traffic control issues, pilot availability, crew availability. Flight was rebooked - but no details given. I contacted customer service in person and was notified of a same day rebooking. This flight was also delayed multiple times. Final departure listed was 9PM we left the gate at 10:10. Upon arrival in Toronto the plane was forced to sit on the tarmac for over 1 hour due to gate availability. We finally deplaned around 12PM. We proceeded to the assigned luggage carousel. One hour later another passenger informed us that the plane was not going to be unloaded until next morning. No notification from the airline. We then had to wait in a customer service line to report our luggage for almost 2 hours. I missed my car rental pickup and had to pay almost $100 in cab fares. I did not get to my hotel until after 3:30 AM. I will never fly Air Canada again!

### "All the same complaints"
I hope someone from Air Canada is reading these reviews about their airline. All the same complaints - rude staff, inability to reach anyone by phone, general disregard for passengers, canceled and re-scheduled flights. I recently flew LAX-YVR in economy. I was surprised as a United Million Miler and Star Alliance Gold (for life) that I was not automatically allocated seating in AC's premium economy section. Instead, I was right at the back in a seat with an inhumane amount of leg room. Greedy Air Canada trying to squeeze as many people in as possible.

### "we should pay for a seat for our infant"
Flying with my family 2 daughters (4 years and 10 months) my wife my children and my self were at different seats. When we tried to fix that with the crew at the airport we got the worst service ever: no compassion, no empathy and very rude attitude. We were told if we want to sit at the same place we should pay for a seat for our infant which in our case couldn’t help at all … 8 hours fly with the baby stress and moving between people to relief my wife. Last time I will use this company and will strongly recommend to not use it.

### "terrible and horrible experience"
Incheon to Houston via Vancouver. The fight schedule changed one day before schedule date. The new schedule included 12 hours layover at Vancouver airport. I asked Air Canada customer service and staff if lounge service was feasible. However, all answers was no. It was my first experience by Air Canada. It was really terrible and horrible experience. My family never ever use Air Canada again.

### "ridiculous and disrespectful"
Not Verified | London to Windsor via Toronto. Of 4 flights with Air Canada during a trip from Canada to Europe, all 4 were delayed and 1 was cancelled. No compensations were given for any of the flights and there were few to none help desk staff available at any of the airports. Our connecting flight from Toronto to Windsor after London England to Toronto, was cancelled, rebooked, delayed and then was cancelled the minute we touched down in Toronto. No other flight options were available that day and our bags were loaded directly onto a plane that would depart the next morning. The baggage offloaders specifically told us all bags are taken off the plane and unloaded at belt 6. We waited over an hour and our bags never appeared. We asked an Air Canada help desk and they said all cancelled flight bags are sent to belt 1. We waited at belt 1 and the bags never appeared, We asked another worker and they lead us around the airport to area where he said the bags would be and they were not there. We then visited a different Air Canada help desk, where the woman behind the counter got up and talked with a friend, instead of dealing with the line of customers. When we finally got to talk to the counter, they said they must be on the flight added for the following day and that we are not allowed to retrieve them. 5 different workers wasted our time and all gave different responses. The bags were said to leave on that plane regardless if we are on it. We could not wait until the following day and they would no compensate for a hotel, food or in any other way, So we had to Uber back from Toronto to Windsor and then pick up our bag from the airport the next morning. That flight was also delayed so our bags were still late. And nobody checks to see who is picking up the bags or if they belong to those people. They have now emailed us and said that rather than refund our cancelled flight for 180$ that they are refunding us $15.27. I have been on hold for over 4 hours in what should have been a 1.5 hour queue. Air Canada was consistently absolutely ridiculous and disrespectful!

### "Worst experience in 30 years of flying"
Not Verified |  Worst experience in 30 years of flying. Flights cancelled 3 times: departure flights x1, return flights x2. In all cases Air Canada acknowledge the fault was theirs. Hours on the phone during the rebookings, multiple mistakes made. The Air Canada desks were absolutely inundated, requiring multiple hours to make overnight arrangements. To make matters worse there the staff we spoke to over the phone to try and arrange refunds had not a single empathetic thing to say. I have never written a bad review before - never felt like it was worth the effort. But the sheer incompetence, the magnitude of the travel disruption, and the impression Air Canada gave of not caring was just too much.

### "I wouldn’t recommend anyone travel with Air Canada"
I had a flight from Las Vegas to Toronto yesterday, after 4 hours delay we got on and waiting for 3 hours, announced we have an issue, which never explained what, and we are going to Vancouver first and after one hour layover we are flying to Toronto. So we are on airplane for 15 hours and they only after 10 hours give us a KitKat and juice They didn’t even serve people proper meal and by the time we got in Toronto was almost 5. I wouldn’t recommend anyone travel with Air Canada.

### "one of the worst airlines of the economically developed world"
Not Verified |  Air Canada, simply put, is one of the worst airlines of the economically developed world. They did not honour any single benefit of the business class I paid for, has lost my baggages, with no one accessible in any way to respond for their incompetence and a waiting time of more than 2 hours to speak to someone by phone.

### "staff fall far short"
Not Verified | Toronto to Vancouver. It would be nice if AC customer service at the airport could find it in their capacity to drop the sarcasm and flippant responses to customers who have be loyal for many years. Once again staff fall far short of the basics in respect for those customers paying the bills. I witnessed the same staffer upset a series of customers in a row and when I said I can hear because of a hearing impediment she rolled her eyes in annoyance. Sorry for having a disability! Perhaps more training is needed.

### "staff very pleasant and service well done"
Three flights, a long trip, two countries. Check in staff at Halifax friendly and efficient, the Australia visas held check in up a bit but not the airlines fault. Once checked in went to the lounge, it was comfortable with good runway views. Flight to Montreal was short with good service. Short layover in Montreal and straight on to the Vancouver flight, no time to visit the lounge. Vancouver flight excellent, staff very pleasant and service well done. Seats and entertainment good as expected. No complaints. On arrival in Vancouver a quick walk to the departure gate where there was a delay boarding so could have gone to the lounge. Flight down to Sydney very smooth. As we had a full dinner on the way to Vancouver we asked about the "dine on demand" option. Staff seemed surprised and hesitant, in the end it never happened. The mid flight offering should be looked at by Air Canada as we felt it was sub par and could have been much better. Staff not very friendly on this flight compared to the previous 2 and that's reflected in the overall cabin staff rating. There seem to have been some catering issues at Vancouver as some beverages were unavailable. Seats and entertainment good as expected.

### "flight good, no complaints, cabin staff good"
Travel from Sydney to Halifax via Vancouver and Montreal. Check in staff at Sydney very pleasant, check-in very quick and straight through security. Air Canada uses the Air New Zealand lounge at Sydney. A very nice lounge with good runway views, staff excellent and breakfast offerings good. Flight from Sydney to Vancouver very smooth, cabin staff very good and meals and beverage service good. Seats and entertainment good. No issues. Cleared customs quickly in Vancouver and off to the lounge. The Vancouver lounge is nice but could do with a make over, having said that staff good. Vancouver to Montreal flight good, no complaints, cabin staff good. The lounge in Montreal was good place to wait between flights as we had 3 + hours. Montreal to Halifax flight very good, as this was a late and short flight not much service expected. Cabin staff good. Bags all arrived so no complaints. A long day!

### "The cabin staff couldn't care less"
No gate number displayed until about 20 minutes before boarding. This would have been OK if the gates were near, but at Heathrow it took 20 minutes or more to get to the gate. Once at the gate there was no call made for boarding, nor were people boarded section by section, resulting in a jumbled mass of passengers at the gate. No calls for those needing assistance or families traveling with small kids, who then had to jostle with others to board. Very disorganized and devil-may-care attitude right from the outset. The flight took some time to take off even after boarding, and for that I don't blame the airline - it could have been just heavy traffic at LHR. However, they took their own sweet time, even after take off, to distribute headsets, so we could at least watch something while waiting. They forgot to load one of the hot (snack) meals onboard, and so most of the passengers didn't get any. OK, we all make mistakes, but it's usually courteous and good manners to let the passengers know and apologize. Neither was offered - and passengers only knew what was going on only because some of the other passengers asked the cabin staff. Instead they decided to serve a bag of pretzel without explanation. Hands off, miserable and disinterested cabin staff. There are passengers who either need help stowing lifting up carry-ons into the overhead compartment or simply don't know the most space efficient way of stowing luggage per compartment. Usually (even on Air Canada) the cabin staff help with both. No help offered on this flight, so there were infirm people struggling and not enough space for some passengers to stow luggage because of other poorly placed luggage in the overhead bins. The cabin staff couldn't care less. Usually after a poorly managed flight, you'd think the cabin staff would like to salvage some of their poor customer service by at least saying goodbye with a superficial smile. These employees couldn't even manage that - they wouldn't even look at any of the passengers as they were deplaning. I've never seen such unhappy, uninterested and poor quality staff.

### "Book an alternative airline"
Not Verified | Toronto to Fredericton. Book with an alternative airline if at all possible. I lost an entire day on a domestic flight with almost no notice from Air Canada. The news is bashing this airline for good reason. It won’t be surprising if they go belly-up.

### "very bad experience"
It was very bad experience. First delay for plane to take off. When I landed in Toronto, I made it on time but they would not let us board. That made one day delay to my schedule. Their alternative was very bad let us after long international flight to stay 14 hours in New York prior to flight to Saint Louis. The bags were lost and I was not able to pick them from Toronto after 5-6 hours in the airport and next day the customer service said something different from night shift people and at the end I was not able to pick my bags.

### "Lack of staff and respect"
Not Verified |  The worst flight in both my round trips. Always delay flights and when I arrived to Toronto, they cancel my ticket and did not let me board because my bags did not arrive. No one is trying to help. A lot of people lost their bags. I stayed overnight at my expense and I booked another flight with United Airlines. Total extra cost 1000 dollars in addition of losing one day of my work which needs RVU base. My experience with Air Canada was terrible and I do not recommend them to anyone. Lack of staff and respect.

### "5 hours delay"
Not Verified | Toronto to Vancouver. The worst airlines ever, 5 hours delay and no one is willing to talk to the travellers. Have been in the airport for 5 hours and another 2 hours inside the plane waiting to take off, my son (diabetic) who was joining me started suffering and got so exhausted because of the long waiting hours at the airport and inside the un-airconditioned airplane.

### "most clueless airline"
Not Verified | New Orleans to Amman via Toronto. The most clueless airline I’ve ever traveled with. They required a visa to a country I am a passport holder to. Which is unheard of. Then refused to help and called security. When we cleared it up on the phone with a different airline we found out the flight was completely cancelled and other airlines refuse to work with them to give them tickets. After they “found” another flight they had no idea what airline the connection was with. Another thing we had to find out ourselves. After checking in we find out it was delayed another 4 hrs. After the original 2 hours to begin with. The people who work at the counter are utterly clueless and can’t tell the difference between the name of an airport and an airline. They are literally guessing and barely literate let alone competent. This is the first and last time anyone I know will travel through them.

### "don’t care about young families"
Frankfurt to Vancouver. One of the airlines who absolutely don’t care about young families and infants in particular. First, no sign of any interest in the well being of an infant during the flight. Even more disgusting the fact that they honestly keep strollers behind to keep the schedule. Although it was Air Canada‘s decision to have 4 economy check-in counter Open for 3 or 4 departures. We’ve waited more than 2.5hrs to drop the luggage. Now waiting the second day of the delivery of our stroller. But great to see that Air Canada is looking much at the well being of their crew. Never seen more cabin attendants watching movies, reading newspaper or enjoying business class food in the empty economy rows while watching their movie. That airline will not be used again.

### "amazed a business can run like this"
Staff had no idea what was going on. Sat on the tarmac leaving the airport because stewards forgot something inside. Then arrived in Montreal and Air Canada couldn’t find their flight agent to connect the gate. Absolutely amazed that a business can run like this.

### "Staff are confused and running around like headless chickens"
Not Verified |  Got into LAX airport at 10.20am. Our flight is at 1.25. There were 3 flights to Canada. No proper line up orders. No organization to let passengers through. We checked in online. Did not make any difference still had to line up to drop our luggage. We pay high price for tickets and on top for extra luggage and this is their service. Staff are confused and running around like headless chickens. Our line at 11.20 have not move an inch yet. We don’t think Air Canada is our option for next time travelling. We are meaning well to support Canadian but we are not getting proper services.

### "never give them my money again"
Not Verified | San Diego to Vancouver. Worse than the DMV. Lousy service on a dirty airplane. they managed to lose my bag on a non-stop flight, took three days to get it to me and refused to reimburse any expenses. unresponsive at every level of management. they make it clear that they just don't give a damn about their passengers. I'll never give them my money again and have banned my employees from flying them in the future.

### "repeatedly continued to drop the ball"
After canceling two different flights at the last minute, giving me less in vouchers than anything on the menu was worth at the hotel they put me up in, and failing to return my bag with $4,000 USD worth of professional supplies to me, Air Canada has repeatedly continued to drop the ball. Not only did they lie to my face about when my delayed baggage would be returned, but every time I call them it takes over an hour to get through to a call center that will drop my call within three minutes, the website they send me to doesn't actually track anything form Air Canada, I missed half a day of work due, and they still haven't given me my stuff back. Unless you're particularly a glutton for punishment, I cannot recommend you ever consider flying with them.

### "I will never fly with them again"
I would just like to say Air Canada is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. First they lost one of our cases. Then our connecting flight to Philadelphia was delayed by 6 hours. I will never fly with them again.

### "so thoroughly disappointed"
I’ve been flying for the majority of my life. As an Atlanta native, Delta has normally been the go to airline. However, this year as a part of a graduation trip I booked my trip and accompanying flights through a travel company. They chose Air Canada. I have never been so thoroughly disappointed with an airline experience. Staff was friendly and apologetic; however, the scheduling was consistently not met and ill communicated. Of course delays happen due to weather and other unforeseen circumstances; however, the lack of communication through Air Canada’s app and their insistence on a physical paper boarding pass were relics of a bygone era. Poor scheduling and communication make Air Canada a disastrous choice for anyone hoping to complete their journey in an efficient manner much less enjoy it.

### "The food was a huge hit or miss"
I took 3 connections and one international flight each way. Air planes for connections are old, the only nice ones are international planes. If you have checked bags, don’t even dream of changing your original flight itinerary because they will not make an exception. The food was a huge hit or miss.

### "All in all a good experience"
Not Verified |  Rather old airplane, Seats a bit worn but okay. Large screens, a lot of space next to the seat. Much better than Lufthansa. Service efficient, food not so good but okay, went to the Signature Lounge before - that was amazing! Flight smooth and on time, fast baggage delivery. All in all a good experience, not overwhelming but very robust.

### "value vs price was disproportionate"
Not Verified |  Montreal to Frankfurt on Air Canada. Checked in online and skipped the counter. Boarding was slow and departure was delayed by a full hour. Explanation from the cockpit provided only minutes ahead of pushback. The hard product was good with comfortable, lie-flat seats with duvet and large pillow. Pre-departure drinks were not provided but I am assuming this has been dropped since the onset of COVID 19. Pre-dinner drinks were offered promptly after take off. Main course was tasty but the appetizer was small and tasteless. Good selection of beverages were offered and although a light breakfast was served prior to landing I opted for coffee only which was barely warm. IFE had a decent selection of movies. FA serving my side of the aisle was attentive and very professional. Washrooms were kept clean throughout the flight. It was an OK experience but value vs price was disproportionate.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Booked a flight with 2 adults, 2 children ages 3 and 1. They booked us separate seats on the plane, when calling them to sort this out the first agent hung up on me, the second agent provided no solutions. Their suggestion was to ask other customers on the flight to switch seats, ultimately having me fix their mistake - while this may be an efficient business practice (having customers resolve issues created by the airline), it has resulted in frustration and conveyed a clear lack of empathy and compassion on behalf of the airline.

### "OK experience but value vs price was low"
Not Verified |  Montreal to Frankfurt on Air Canada. Checked in on line and skipped the counter. Boarding was slow and departure was delayed by a full hour. Explanation from the cockpit provided only minutes ahead of pushback. The hard product was good with comfortable, lie-flat seats with duvet and large pillow. Pre-departure drinks were not provided but I am assuming this has been dropped since the onset of COVID 19. Pre-dinner drinks were offered promptly after take off. Main course was tasty but the appetizer was small and tasteless. Good selection of beverages were offered and although a light breakfast was served prior to landing I opted for coffee only which was barely warm. IFE had a decent selection of movies. FA serving my side of the aisle was attentive and very professional. Washrooms were kept clean throughout the flight. It was an OK experience but value vs price was low.

### "a successful and uplifting experience"
In error I booked online a roundtrip flight from Vancouver to Edmonton for June 3d to the 9th instead of June 9 to the 16th, I booked cheap flights that were advertised as "restricted " due to financial constraints. I understood the limitations, but felt it necessary. It was also necessary to make the trip to support my daughter during a medical procedure. The error was devastating, I thought I had lost the total payment of the ticket and would have to rebook and repay the full amount. Apart from the loss of dollars, I felt silly making such a careless mistake. I called the ticketing agents and after an almost two hour wait, I spoke to "L" at approximately 4pm Saturday May 28/22. She was so patient and understanding and assured me she could help. Further, she comforted me by commenting there were those that had made far sillier mistakes than mine. She re booked the tickets for the correct days, assigned seats and sent a refund voucher for $20.00. The whole encounter was a successful and uplifting experience in a world where that happens infrequently. It is my sincere hope she has the opportunity to be praised and congratulated by her superiors and understands the sincerity of my appreciation.

### "selling flights, can't staff them"
Toronto to Minneapolis. They are over selling flights and can't staff them. Checked bag tagging machines didn't work. When at the gate we were lied to as to why there was a delay. Then flight was cancelled. After removing the passengers from the gate area we were given poor instructions on next steps. Air Canada kept my checked bag for the night. When I got to a ticket agent I was assigned a new ticket for the next day and then essentially kicked out of the airport. Because I was starting my travel that day from Toronto it was there policy not to provide hotel, transportation, or food, even though I live in the US and had no place to go. That sucked. Fast forward the next day. More delays at the gate. Finally got on the plane. Sat on the plane for over an hour waiting to get pushed off. We are at least three hours late and I'm currently still in the plane waiting to get pushed off as I'm writing this review. Air Canada = bad

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
Not Verified |  Dirty seats, in flight monitor broken, ridiculous connection times, plane flies around for an hour because it can't land (weather and Toronto are the excuses - the weather was fine), no gate crew available when we finally land. This isn't even the worst experience I have had with them. Not sure why I thought they could be capable of improving after three years of not flying Air Canada. If only this site would allow a review of 0/10. Avoid this airline if you can.

### "Customer representatives are definitely not there to help you"
I have flown many times over the years with different airlines. Air Canada is the worst airline I've ever seen. First of all, what I didn't realize before buying the ticket is that the website is quite amateur and has many shortcomings. Sometimes you may not be able to access your flight information even if you want to. You may have to wait a few hours. Sometimes, when you are looking for a new ticket, you may not be able to make the search you want. Sometimes you even have to wait a bit to log in to your account. Things get worse when it comes to customer service. If you're in a hurry, you definitely can't get your work done via email. It takes at least 2 days to get a response, sometimes even longer. If you want to call by phone, you have to deal with customer representatives who are unaware of their work. You get conflicting information with each phone call. Customer representatives are definitely not there to help you. They just give you simple information that you can also access from their website. I wouldn't recommend calling them for help when you have a problem. It would be more convenient to cancel the ticket directly. I was going to travel to Turkey via Canada. I could not find even the slightest information on the website that said I needed a visa to make a transit flight from Canada, so I was not allowed on my flight. At least 3 different Air Canada employees told me that the online visa would be finalized in 2 days. So I started to consider buying a new ticket for 5 days later. However, if you are going to buy a new ticket, you cannot buy a ticket from the standard category, they force you to buy it from the flex category. But the greatest injustice begins here. When you look at the advantages of the flex category on the website, it appears to be fully refundable. But in the phone call I made with customer service, they said that there was no such thing and I could not get a refund. At that time I claimed on the website that we had been lied to and the only answer I got was no. Despite what I saw with my own eyes, no explanation was given, denying that we are not lying. In a different phone call, I was told that they sold my new ticket in the flex category, but I could not benefit from the advantages of flex since the first ticket I bought was in the standard category. Now they say I can get a refund of $800 for my flight that I paid $1800 in total. Or as a travel voucher, I could get the entire amount back. But to use the travel voucher, I need to fly somewhere through Canada because this airline operates all flights through Canada to save money for the Canadian government and its own airlines. There are no flights within the US, so it's almost impossible for me to use that travel voucher. Because of this, I bought a new ticket from United Airlines and paid another $1850. Even calculating my financial loss is quite difficult, but I know that I have lost a lot. I don't even want to think about the psychological damage, I spent 2 days on the phone dealing with all this nonsense because it can take you over an hour to reach someone due to the lack of customer service staff. In short, I would not recommend anyone to use this airline. It will be more profitable for you to pay $100-$200 more and fly with higher quality airlines.

### "Stranded in Toronto without my belongings"
Flew with them in May 2022, we landed in Toronto and were stuck sitting at the gate for 3 hours not allowed to depart the plane because they could not locate an air Canada personnel to unlock the gate door for us to disembark. Missed my connection and again stranded in the airport with no accommodation or meal. Service desk said it’s because the flight was labeled “delayed due to weather”. It was not. We sat for 3 hours outside the gate waiting for the door of the terminal to be unlocked. Air Canada service desk reply “not our fault”. Told me if I choose to get my own hotel I could pick up my bag at baggage claim and come back in the morning. Exited airport to baggage claim, went to the air Canada desk to get my bag, reply “your bag is checked for your flight you cant get it back until you get to your destination”. Stranded in Toronto without my belongings overnight again. Air Canada's response “not our fault”. Horrible experience every time I've used them they refuse to provide any assistance to passengers stuck because of their own incompetence.

### "it is okay for the airline to be late"
Everything is not organized, delay on departure. Arriving late and has to stay on the runway for 20-30 min to find an assigned gate. If a passenger is late, he or she will miss the flight, but it is okay for the airline to be late.

### "never experienced such incompetence"
Trying to talk to someone at the gate takes forever. There were only 4 people in front of me, but I waited 15 minutes and decided to leave because the gate agents appear to be incompetent. They kept telling the people in front of me to wait, and they had to keep checking with each other about what to do. I've never experienced such incompetence in my life.

### "automated baggage system that never works"
Not Verified |  I printed out the check-in baggage sticker for my suitcase in Toronto. There is no live person where you drop off the baggage. The automated system had broken down. It stopped working, and there were no staff to manually check in the suitcases. The plane left late because of this, and I missed my connecting flight, as did many other passengers. If Air Canada wants an automated baggage system that never works, it should have staff there to check in the baggage.

### "Zero accountability and customer support"
Air Canada is an awful airline, literally the worst customer service. It is clear that making money is more important than offering quality service. Because we left late and it took an hour for them to let us out of the plane, I missed my connection. Not a single Air Canada employee (flight attendants, customer service reps at the gates or in customer support, the phone-based customer support included) had any idea of what to do to support the people that missed their connection. The best we got was a person handing out a card with the various phone numbers to call to try to get help. I was on hold waiting to be helped for over an hour on 4 different occasions. During two of the calls, the customer service rep hung up on me because they didn’t know the answer to the question I asked. I was also told they didn’t know exactly where my luggage could be or how I could pick it up. In person, the customer service person was rude and only directed me to the phone numbers on the card. Zero accountability and customer support.

### "Something needs to be done because this is getting ridiculous"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is hands down the worst airline I have ever taken. I fly a lot, and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a singular airline. They always delay or cancel flights (with usually terrible excuses) and rebook you on worst next day flights without respecting your time. When you attempt to change the flight by calling their customer service, they typically have very long wait times. If you then choose to talk to a representative in the airport, they are very very rude in person, saying it isn’t their fault either, and are generally very unhelpful. They often delay your baggage too, something I have experienced multiple times. They are becoming worse as an airline by the year, its getting ridiculous. I believe this is a case of lack of competition in Canada. WestJet and Air Canada basically owning a monopoly on flights in Canada means us Canadians are forced to book with them and put with their terrible terrible airline without many other options. Something needs to be done because this is getting ridiculous. Air Canada, please sort out your terrible airline. We are all sick of not being able to have a normal flight experience.

### "the worst experience"
Air Canada is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. They have no system in place for other clients who miss their flights and always resort to pick and choose who to let fly. On connection from Sudbury to Toronto my plane was delayed 4hrs leaving Sudbury. On arrival in Toronto after missing my connection when I asked a lady at a desk she told me go to a long line customer service to rebook because the flight is full. When I asked another lady shortly after she gave me a boarding pass and I boarded a nearly half empty plane. This is just my experience in 2022. Almost every flight on my 2022 trip was delayed.

### "The worst airline experience"
My flight to Ottawa from Montreal got canceled twice. The first canceled flight made me stay over night in the airport. No compensation given, no meal coupons, no stay option, no alternative commutation option. The worst airline experience I have ever been through. Not recommended at all.

### "would not fly Air Canada again"
Not Verified |  Our flight was canceled, and the attendants left the gate an hour before we received an email about it. No announcement, no direction on where to go next. Air Canada left multiple elderly people in the middle of the airport that was closing. Absolutely awful. We went to the first service desk and no one was there. Went back to departures and gave us a flight the next morning, no hotel and no support finding a place to sleep. They provided vouchers for food, which we realized was not useable during our wait in the airport. Insanely terrible, would not fly Air Canada again.

### "Flight was cancelled"
Flight was 11:05am Mon. May 15th. Pearson to La Guardia. We arrive 3 hrs before. Told we cannot join security line until our flight is called. It was too busy at the F Gates. Sent to Aisle 15 to wait. People are getting called with about an hour to spare before departure time. They clear the backlog sort of. I get super lucky and have 2.5 hrs. Security line is very long. Get through that and immediately I'm in the US Customs line. Takes over an hour to just go through the US Customs line. People are telling Pearson employees they are gonna miss their flight. I get through customs and to my gate. Air Canada flight  is delayed by an hr and a half to 2hrs. Maintenance issues. Then after that it delayed for another hour. We get on board after 2:30pm. Pilot comes on. La Guardia has issued a 2 hr ground stop due to bad weather in the New York air space. US Customs will not allow us off the plane to sit at the gate. 25 min later I get a phone notification. Flight was cancelled. Pilot comes on 5 min later to confirm. US Customs makes us wait. Then tells us we must exit through Canadian Customs. Get in that massive line after going no where. Get to to kiosk, there's no cancelled flight option. Get to the guard. He didn't even really seem to know what to do. He wanted to see all my vax stuff. I never went anywhere. At baggage claim we ask at the Air Canada desk where our bags will go. He said not there because its a cancelled flight. We must go to the connections desk. Connections guy says we were supposed to pick it up at an international carrousel. That's not what the last guy said. Given a blue form. Told to leave our carry ons at the connection desk (Cad Customs won't let them through). Go to a blue clock and wait to be escorted. We wait 2 hours. Someone comes. They can take 10 people at a time as per Cad Customs. 10 leave and come back 2 min later. Our bags are are going to Domestic Carrousel. We fight to get our carry ons back. It's past a security checkpoint. We go to domestic 1. We wait 4 hours. Nothing from our flight comes through. People get fed up and go with an Air Canada employee. Our bags never were taken off our cancelled flight. We are told our bags will automatically transfer over to our auto rebooked flight the next morning. We have to trust the airport to do their job.

### "There is no sense of customer service and politeness"
The worst airline I have ever flown with. Let's start at the check-in counter at Toronto airport, the counter attendant didn’t know what she was doing, she messed up my existing boarding pass and tried to re-issue my new seats and a boring pass (which she didn’t know how to do and then she has to ask someone else for help). She then wanted me to repay for additional luggage charges, which I had already paid before. I asked her to get her manager so I can explain the situation she didn’t want to call the manager, but after insisting her and demanding to see the manager she finally called the manager. I asked the manager to provide me with his and her details so I can complain/send my feedback. The manager refused to provide any details about the counter officer and replies "sorry due to confidentiality I cant provide you with her name". I went back to the counter and asked for her name, she gave me only her last name and then walked off. Next is the In-flight experience which was worst as well, flight attendants are rude and ill-mannered. There is no sense of customer service and politeness. The attendant didn’t care if you called them for help, they just walk off and turn the assistance bell off. The meals were half-frozen. Limited in-service of water and any other drinks. Flight attendants were rude and grumpy. I travel a lot due to work and other commitments and have flown with many airlines, but Air Canada is the worst of the worst. People don’t waste your time and money flying with this airline.

### "absolute worst experience"
Not Verified |  The absolute worst experience of my life. My five friends and I booked a trip to Toronto using Air Canada. Our flight was at 6am, we arrived four hours before departure only to see that our flight was delayed 4 times and we were placed on two separate flights, one with a two hour layover and one without. The first delay occurred at 9am, 10.40am, 12.15pm then approximately 2.55 until it was officially cancelled. We completely understand the unfortunate event of delay, malfunction or simply weather conditions, however we expected at least kind customer service from the staff of this 'business'. The 'supervisor' on duty rolled her eyes at our simple questions and left everyone in a panic. She even uttered the words 'I don't care, that's not my problem'. She is the definition of what not to do when representing a business or team. We were left needing to book a hotel on our own expense and did not receive any compensation for anything whatsoever. One of my friends was in need of a wheelchair as well so I called an employee for assistance, she seemed bothered by this since she was forced to get up from her chair and pause her social hour with another coworker. She sighed and proceeded to lecture me about how it was our fault that he did not have any assistance.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
This is my first time flying with them though it wasn't by choice as it was a code share with ANA. The experience with ANA and Air Canada was night and day (ANA being day). I was told at the check-in counter in Bangkok that my baggage will be checked though Toronto but need to go through the immigration in Vancouver. OK. I've almost missed my flight to Toronto as the immigration and security process at YVR took so long and confusing. There was an Air Canada staff at the security line but didn't do anything to help when asked. It was 10 mins pass boarding time and I was still on the security line. All I had for the answer that, you will need to ask others in the line yourself! Luckily, there were about 6 of us on the same flight in that line so we worked together to get through. When arrived in Toronto, I was waiting for my baggage for 20 minutes, saw nothing, and next flight baggage were about to arrive. I turned to the ground baggage desk for help informing that I've been waiting for 20 mins for my baggage. She said sometimes you need to wait for 45 mins without asking any further information from me! I was not stupid! Next flight baggage were coming and mine didn't show up. There must be something wrong! I had to talk to her colleague to file a report of mishandled baggage which took another 15 mins! Nightmare! They said 'I don't see your baggage on the flight. 24 hours, you should have your baggage delivered to your hotel! OK - 24 hours! Turned out, I needed to wait for almost 72 hours for my baggage to arrive and had to follow up with them everyday. No email update on status. When I filed for the claim, they took 3 weeks to respond my email. Another 1 week to update me that they have received my banking details. And I need to wait for another 3-4 weeks so the request is issued! Why do I have to wait for my own money that I didn't need to spend in the first place because of Air Canada's fault? The whole process is just too long and inefficient. No service-mind and proper customer-handling protocol. By far, Air Canada is the worst airline I've ever flown. And don't get me start with my Toronto-Vancouver experience. What a nightmare!

### "no hello when scanning boarding pass"
2+ hours delay, with the a 15min increment added every 15 mins. Rude CSAs yelling at people in the cramped gate area. No smile, no hello when scanning boarding pass. Nearly a universal experience when flying Air Canada

### "Disappointing Business Class service"
Disappointing Business Class service between Toronto and London considering the price paid. Nice dinner menu but by the time they got to the back of the business cabin there was hardly any choice left. The only option available to my son was a mushroom ravioli - and he hates mushrooms with a passion. The male cabin crew clearly wanted to be anywhere else - a friendly attempt at conversation by asking which wine he would recommend was met with a grumpy "we don't drink it, we just serve it". It's as if they've got aircraft with business seats so they need to fill them but then try to get away with offering a semblance of a business class service. To cap it all, when we arrived at Heathrow, it turned out all our bags were still in Toronto. Will have to seriously consider other options before flying business with Air Canada again.

### "never accepted to refund the seat price"
Paid for selected seats for me and my brother to then learn you can choose it for free 24h hours before departure. Twenty minutes before departure, I received a text from Air Canada telling me my seats had changed. I told the flight attendant I only wanted to be seated aside a window since it was my first flight. I walk in the plane to realize they sat us aside the door and they never accepted to refund the seat price.

### "I don't see myself ever flying with Air Canada again"
Not Verified |  I normally don't write complaints, but I had to this time around. I was flying from Ankara, Turkey to Las Vegas with stops in Istanbul, Munich and Toronto. After disembarking from my plane in Toronto, I was told that my baggage was not transferred to my final flight, but I was reassured by the help desk that my luggage would be on the next flight the following morning to Las Vegas. Upon arrival, I went to customer support to file a delayed bag. I made it to my home in Washington, Utah, exhausted from traveling over 30 hours. I waited and waited, but my bag was not scheduled to arrive in Las Vegas until the 14th, four days after I had already arrived home. I finally got my bag just now on the 15th and I am disappointed that it took this long. How hard is it to put my luggage on the next flight? I can understand a wait of up to 48 hrs, but 5 days, come on. I had a trip planned with my roommate that I hadn't seen in over two years and I had to cancel because I had zero clue as to when my luggage would arrive. Also, this has happened before to my sister and mom with Lufthansa, flying into New York, and they had their luggage delivered to them the next day. I just want to know why it took so long. I have nothing against the airline workers, they were all kind and helpful to me, but I don't see myself ever flying with Air Canada again. Sorry, but a five day wait time is unacceptable. I'm tired of wearing the same clothes and having to cancel events because of your slow service.

### "We weren’t aware of needing an ETA"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever encountered. My mother and I paid a lot of money for business class seats. The staff at the check-in for our luggage were unhelpful and not understanding at all. We weren’t aware of needing an ETA to hop flights at Toronto. When we asked what we were supposed to do they just said you need an Eta, please stop blocking the line. A line that didn’t exist as we were the only people in the queue. Just terrible.

### "removing the hot coffee option"
I'd noticed our flight out to Toronto had the seat belts illuminated conveniently after our meal, thereby removing the hot coffee option. The same thing happened at breakfast on May 9th as we were approaching Heathrow. No coffee was part of the most disgusting breakfast I think I've been served - a yogurt and a cold croissant. Now the croissant was the highlight, no butter/spread of any description, no jam, not even coffee to dip it in.

### "my bags were not loaded onto the flight"
Not Verified |  This airline is disorganized and deceiving. My first mishap was my trip from Newark to Toronto in Jan. 2022. It took nearly 4 days for my bags to arrive but during those 4 days I was lied to about where my bags were being told once that my bags were in Toronto and then next that they have not left the Newark airport. After that situation I gave Air Canada another chance for my trip from Toronto to Dallas. Because of a delay which would cause me to miss my connecting flight I was redirected to a direct flight. I received a text that my bag would be delayed and would land with the next flight which landed at 8:33 pm that evening (5/11). I call that evening and they say my bags are in Dallas and should arrive the next morning by 11 am. The next morning at 8 am I call to inquire about the status of the bags just to find out my bags were not loaded onto the flight that was supposed to land at 8:33 pm and they were still in Toronto. So not only was my bag delayed but I was lied to by this airline. I am currently typing this on 5/12 at 11:50 pm and they said I would receive the bag this evening but I have not yet received it. This is now the second time this airline has deceived me like this and I am dealing with this confusion and my trip in Dallas is barely 3 days.

### "this trip each way was an absolute disaster"
Not Verified |  I have flown this route multiple times with other airlines without a problem, but this trip with Air Canada each way was an absolute disaster. I typically try to find the good in situations, but this was horrendous all the way around. Our first plane sat on the tarmac for an extra 1.5 hours. We weren't allowed to board, to the point the flight attendants were questioning what was going on and the gate agent wouldn't answer them, causing the flight to be delayed. When we arrived in Canada late, half of our flight had to full on sprint to our connecting flight. On the connecting flight, I was charged for full-flight WiFi access (this was fine as I expected it), but then when 12.01am hit my WiFi discontinued and I needed to purchase it again. My return flights were somehow worse. When I boarded my first flight there was an individual sitting in my seat who outright refused to get up. When I asked an attendant for assistance in moving them (literally part of their job description), he looked me in the eyes and then walked away to pack bags to make it look as if he were busy. As a broad person standing 6'2" who purchased an aisle seat 2 months prior to this flight, it is fair to say I was upset to then be jammed into a middle seat that wasn't mine. Towards the end of the flight when breakfast was being served they told us "we decided not to make coffee". This is typically fine, but considering how awful my experience had been to this point combined with the fact they didn't give an explanation when I asked just dug the knife deeper. I had 3.5 hours before my connecting flight home (this was no issue as I knew it when I booked my trip) and Air Canada, in that time, was somehow only able to get one of my bags to my next flight. Again, 3.5 hours to move a bag across the airport to a flight only 40% full. They returned my second bag the next day at 6am waking my entire house. I can not stress enough how I will never again use this airline and make sure that no one I know flies with that garbage airline. They are the Spirit Airlines of international travel.

### "clearly not enjoying their jobs"
I fly this route often, usually on British Airways. Today I remembered why I avoid Air Canada. The high density Boeing 777 is not a pleasant aircraft to fly on but the real problem are the Air Canada in flight crew. Surly, unsmiling and clearly not enjoying their jobs. The crew today were obviously doing you a favour in appearing in the cabins. Once lunch service was over, the crew disappeared until service of the snack (Air Canada has been serving the same tastefulness pastry for years) an hour prior to landing.

### "losing so much luggage"
San Francisco to Copenhagen via Toronto. They are so unorganized and inefficient! I have no video of how they are capable of losing so much luggage, each bag with its own tracking number and sticker! So many people on our flight arrived in Copenhagen with no bags and the airline could not track them. It has been 48 hours since our flight and they still have no idea where the bags are, which makes no sense. Customer service sucks. They are so inefficient and the level of English was so poor that I could not understand them and my native language is English. We are stuck after two days, still no luggage or sign of it. I felt horrible because a nice lady on our flight was vacationing with her mom on a 7-day cruise and her bags disappeared as well. She had to leave on her ship the day our flight arrived with nothing but her carry on bag…they told her (and us) to file a form and check back online after a couple of days - seriously? How do companies like this make it out there? There were so many angry passengers on our flight. On top of that, our flight was delayed for over an hour. Now that I won’t even complain about but losing our bags, with no way of tracking them and telling us to leave the airport and get on a website to file a form is totally unacceptable! Do not fly them ever! If you do, be careful when you check your bag!

### "excellent cabin crew"
My first time flying Air Canada, business class from Lax to Toronto. The business class product is on par with other good airlines (Qantas, Singapore, Cathay). The flight had wifi and a large range of entertainment options. Catering was good. The most memorable part of the flight was the excellent cabin crew. Allison and Naomi were friendly, efficient and attentive.

### "Staff were supportive and patient"
Not Verified |  The flight from Fort St John went well considering the tiny plane was fully packed. We arrived at Vancouver Airport and spent 20 minutes unable to deplane because no agent was available. Flight from Vancouver to Toronto was a dream. Can't beat those Boeing 787s for comfort! Not as fast as the 747s but after the Q400 the flights was great. Staff were supportive and patient.

### Air Canada customer review
This flight with Air Canada was the first time food / drink was only served in the first and last hour of the route. A lunch was offered about 30 minutes after takeoff and no other food or beverage was offered until 7.5 hours later. Water was not offered mid-flight. A disgusting tomato / chicken paste hot pocket was offered as a snack before landing. When I requested a coffee to accompany the snack, the attendants explained that no hot drinks were offered "due to COVID". How much longer are airline attendants going to hide behind this excuse? How does offering tea or coffee compromise the health and safety of passengers? Because the 2nd meal service was offered less than 30 minutes before touchdown in Toronto, attendants were scrambling to collect garbage and prepare the cabin for landing. Besides the food, there was an incident involving a bathroom and smoke alarm. In the middle of the flight, a gentleman appeared to have set off the alarm in the bathroom and flight attendants only checked on the incident after 1 minute.

### "my recent return trip will be my last"
Recently took an Air Canada flight from YYZ - LHR an evening flight . I have flown with AC for the past 5 years to Toronto and I think my recent return trip will be my last. I am fed up with being spoken to like a naughty boy by flight crew. Good manners in what at times must be a stressful role should always be adhered to. Last weeks flight was the final straw. The rude and abrupt tone that they all seem to use when requesting the most simplest of instructions leaves you feeling rubbish and not like a customer at all. Mid flight asked for some water and had to ask another crew member 30 mins later for the same bottle of water. Food is poor and the only smiles I saw from them was when they were kicking us off at LHR. Will be looking for another airline for these from trips from now on .

### "draconian and unreasonable"
I departed Lisbon at 8:15 p.m. on 4/23/2022 I had a COVID test done in Lisbon the day before @10:40 a.m, so my test results should suffice to let me complete the trip. The AC ground agent and her supervisor at Heathrow airport refused to issue a paper boarding pass because they said that my test results had expired!!! They wanted me to take a new test, but there was not enough time to go through British immigration and customs to go landside in taking a new test and to go through security again, so they relented in giving me a boarding pass, but I would not have a pass in Vancouver until I have a new test done in Vancouver. I exited the plane @11:05 a.m. in Vancouver asking different people how to get a Covid test because the flight crew and the ground crew meeting at the door did not know. My connecting flight would be at 1:10 p.m. I had to go through Canadian immigration and customs before reaching the check-in counters where the Covid test stations were located. The test in Lisbon only took 10 minutes to get the results while in Vancouver, the test took 30 minutes to get the results. By the time I received the results in my email, which I checked every 30 seconds, it was 12:15 p.m. Air Canada check-in counter clerk had to call the gate crew to see if it was Ok to issue a boarding pass. Air Canada agents are not empowered to think logically. My origination flight was at Lisbon with a valid Covid test result which should allow me to complete my trip without this extra step. Air Canada agents took this draconian and unreasonable measure as if the US will sanction their airline by breaking the 24-hour rule. The Aeroplan app is also not working most of the time I need it. I do have an international data plan from T-Mobile. I do not need wifi to access the app.

### "staff at the airport was unhelpful and arrogant"
Not Verified |  Booked seats via expedia and my partner and I were sat on a separate row for both depart and return trips. The staff at the airport was unhelpful and arrogant. Also why was I asked to verify proof of vaccine again when I've done it before via online. Waste of time. Flight attendants are just ok and service people are actual amateurs who have idea about customer service. Air Canada employee at LAX needs to be fired.

### "recommend this airline with reservation"
I have flown this 9am route twice this year and both times the flight is delayed 30 to 60 minutes. I purchased a lunch and it was the most disgusting food. The check-in this morning was confusing and congested. I completed the pre-check requirements uploading my proof of vaccination and my negative covid test result. And then I had to get into a line-up to show it again. I printed my baggage ticket at the kiosk and then had to still get into a lineup for it to be verified. I lined up in the longest line and then realized that there was a much shorter line. I went to it not sure of which line I was supposed to be in. Movie selection is dismal. I would recommend this airline with reservation. This flight is a very convenient flight and I would hate to stop flying Air Canada because of the terrible service it provides.

### "business class certainly not up to par with other airlines"
Terrible service from start to finish. Old unfriendly and unhelpful staff, business class certainly not up to par with other airlines and not organized for family travel. Kids meals were soggy cold fish fingers and nothing worked on the airplane. Our seats were rearranged last minute to the last business class row, so 0 sleep possible. No hot water as well, so no coffee, tea or any noodles we took ourselves for the kids (we try and pre-empt these thieves!) Airline lost my wife's suitcase and after 14 weeks, no one has even reached out to me to be helpful or comforting. They make you chase them whilst on holidays, being on the phone and waiting in long queues to receive help, which never comes. Not one competent person has assisted me in the numerous phone calls I had. Hundreds of Euros spent on these overseas calls and no one to even provide 1 normal answer even now after 14 full weeks, the person on the phone has no idea what is going on and is relying on old information. Systems are totally broken (they use a SITA world travel tool which looks like it was built in 1990) and does not deliver any of my 5 messages to anyone. Holiday ruined, never again with this outdated and terrible airline.

### "revise the connections they offer"
It’s important for Air Canada to revise the connections they offer for long distance flights as there is not enough time to arrive and go through all the stages (customs, baggage security check and walking on a reasonable pace to reach the terminal gate you will be flying from) without feeling stressed that you will miss the connection. I arrived in Montreal at 6:05am and my boarding time was 6:55am to Vancouver. There is always some delay after the landing and all the passengers being able to get their carryons and leave the plane. Before customs we were blocked by this very rude lady that was demanding the “ArriveCAN” receipt and people were having hard time to find while she was screaming that we didn’t have it, but we would not be allowed to board if we didn’t show it to the Air Canada attendant in Sao Paulo. After that you need to pass by the borders and it always take some time. It's never fast. Documents checked you need to head to a different area of the airport to pass security to connect flights. It’s better walk fast, or run with all your luggage otherwise you won’t have a chance. Once I got at the security, there was this huge line that I knew I would not make it if I didn’t talk to someone that I had a flight departing in less than 10 minutes. I approached this lady that seemed to be working at the security department and her first reaction was, very rudely, telling me that I was supposed to be in the Airport 3 hours earlier, and there was nothing she could do…that was my fault. When I tried to explain that I had just arrived from Sao Paulo and it was not me that decided the connections she put me on a different line (a little shorter). Security took longer. After running with my bags half opened trying to find the gate of my flight, my only thoughts were that us customers pay a very expensive price and shouldn’t to go through this experience ever. I understand that, Air Canada has no responsibility on the rudeness of some of the airport workers in Montreal but the company needs to assure their customers have time to make to their seats on the plane. Next time I’ll be aware about the time between flights and I will certainly avoid any connection in Montreal.

### "I had an amazing experience"
I traveled November 29 2021 from Barbados to Toronto, before I got to the Airport I received notification that the flight would be an hour delay, I appreciate the heads up so I wouldn't have to waste time getting to the airport to early. From checking my bags great customer service, nice and polite and check my bag with no issues. On board the flight I had the whole row to myself, the crew was so nice making sure I was ok got offered drinks and food often. The crew was the best part They did They jobs very well and it was an amazing flight back to Toronto. When I landed in toronto after customs whent to get my bags they were there waiting for me no damage and no issues. I had an amazing experience flying with Air Canada

### "experience was very unpleasant"
I arrived to the airport in Frankfurt on Friday, April 1st at 11 am to board the flight at 1:05 pm going to Toronto (Canada). They had us wait for an hour until one person started checking people in. At 12:05 the lady at the counter said they could not find my ticket in the system and sent me to Lufthansa. The lady at Lufthansa called customer service and asked about my reservation with Air Canada. She said they were able to find it, but they changed the ticket from Air Canada to Lufthansa. After boarding flight LH 0470 all passengers had to wait almost 2 hours inside the plane since they were bringing in the food (catering). Because the flight was delayed I missed my connection in Toronto going to San Francisco. When I arrived in Toronto it was a mess; all of those who lost connections were told to go to different places, some were told to go to Air Canada Customer service, others were asked to go through security and then to the information booth. I spoke to a lady who said that Air Canada was understaffed and there was supposed to be someone helping those who lost connections after we left the plane. There was nobody helping and all the staff members seemed clueless as to what to do. At least 13 passengers were in the same situation as me. We had lost our connections and since we arrived at 7pm instead of 5pm and there were no other flights to our destinations. All of us who lost connections went through security and had to enter Canada to be able to get to the information booth at the entrance of the airport as they had told us to go. When trying to explain our situation to staff there, they would send us somewhere else or tell us to call customer service. I have traveled many times and this is the most disorganized experience I have had. We decided to wait next to the information booth and not move until someone came to help us. They tried to send us away and have us call customer service, but we did not have anywhere to go so we stayed there until someone came. We waited at the information booth and started calling the operator to get staff from Air Canada to help us. We needed to book new flights and we needed a place to stay for that night. We were in the airport for over 3 hours, until a group of people came to help and told us they were sending us to the Marriott hotel for that night. They gave us one voucher for dinner and one for breakfast and sent us away. We were at the airport from 7pm to 10pm then got sent to the hotel. I booked my new flight for noon the next day and asked if I needed to take a new covid test. Nobody had that information. Finally I decided to go to sleep at midnight and figure it out the next morning. In the morning I found that there was a Covid testing site at the airport and went to take the test. They charged me $60 Canadian dollars and I had the result in about an hour. After this I was able to board the flight and get to San Francisco. This experience was very unpleasant.

### "compensation far exceeded my expectations"
Not Verified |  Damage discovered to my wife’s walker upon arrival upon arrival in Edmonton. Submitted a claim to the AC baggage office. Secured replacement parts for $25 and submitted claim. Within 2 days Air Canada paid $50 via e-transfer and provided a voucher for 20% for up to 4 people, good for 3 years (easily worth $500 to $600). Compensation far exceeded my expectations!

### "Victimizing clients with no alternative"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew to Whitehorse for the purpose of assisting a family member. We were scheduled to return to NS on March 26th. It’s still cold and icy in the Yukon and my wife had the misfortune of literally slipping on the ice resulting in 3 fractures to her tibia and fibula. Surgery is/was necessary along with an added week post surgery as recommended by the surgeon. Flight change was necessary. I called Air Canada on the 25th knowing it was late but very little choice. Explained the situation and medical emergency. The kind gentleman at Air Canada rebooked us a week later. The added cost to us was $1838.79. For the two one way tickets. Just looking at money alone my feeling toward Air Canada in this specific incident is that they are deplorable. We have been the victim of an unfortunate accident, however Air Canada has by far caused the greatest grief. We will incur additional cost just staying the required week but being unable to simply exchange a ticket given these very specific circumstances is atrocious. Some years ago my wife and I had bags stolen with our passports in Spain. We had to stay extra days to acquire new passports, US Air was our carrier and when we explained our plight, waived the change charge. I have had mediocre experiences flying with Air Canada but this on takes the cake. If this is their hard line policy with no room to look at case by case circumstance then your policy sucks. Victimizing clients with no alternative. I did once all arrangements were made, without being personnel or berating, voice the view above. I felt compelled to write a review. Something I rarely do.

### "gave us 3 totally separate seats"
Bought 3 tickets for my parents and I 3 months before the travel, and at the check they gave us 3 totally separate seats, and asking $50 for each person to let us seat next to each other. What do you call this? And on top of that we had worst experience ever on the plane regarding flight quality.

### "don't care about customers"
The flights weren't on time. Missed connection. Slept in Montreal airport on the floor. Offered a hotel voucher that wasn't honored. Got to Vancouver with all 9 of our bags missing. They didn't arrive for 4 days. We were stranded in Whistler with just the clothes on our backs. Customer service is non existent. No calls returned when they say they will. When you finally do get to talk to someone that person has no answers and can't connect you with someone that does. They don't care about customers at all.

### "unbelievably kind and thoughtful"
Recently my daughter and I flew to Shanghai from Toronto on Air Canada. When we arrived in Shanghai, there was a problem with my daughter's visa and we were sent back to Toronto. It was such a difficult thing for us! Painful! But the staff on both the flight from Shanghai to Seoul and then from Seoul to Shanghai were unbelievably kind and thoughtful. They immediately offered words of encouragement, a listening ear, and comfort. I was so impressed at how a little kindness (a lot of kindness, in this case) can make such a difference when one is in distress! Either your teams are well-trained for situations like this, or they are just intuitive. I don't know. But hats off to Don and his crew! I wish I knew all of your names! We will certainly remember Air Canada and choose you again!

### "One of my worst airline experiences ever"
First the LAX ticket counter didn't open until 6am, we had a 7am flight. They wouldn't allow people to enter the correct space to check in and instead caused a line thru the terminal. Same thing at YVR. One of my worst airline experiences ever. Ticket counter staff all rude and unprofessional.

### "Very bad experience"
We had to go back from starting track to the gate because of technical reasons. Almost 3 hours in the airplane at ground, but nobody served water or drinks. Very bad experience.

### "poor planning is now my issue"
First start off my trip with my first flight delayed 2 hours making me miss my connecting flight. I pick my seats in advance and both times i was moved to the back of the plane with no explanation and when I ask to have my seat back they say it’s out of their control or say they were putting people together. So these people poor planning is now my issue? Awful staff not helpful at all. I could’ve drove to my destination with all the delays and problems.

### "booked a flight through flighthub"
I booked a flight through flighthub and due to Covid had to cancel, first they wanted to give a voucher and then the government ordered the refund after a year. I have been back and forth with Air Canada and Flighthub both saying the other should issue the refund. It takes forever to get anyone on the phone and last time I got someone in November 2021 that was to get back to me within a week and no response came. My credit card been out $1550 + since over 2 years accruing interest. =

### "Don't pay for internet you wont be able to stream anything"
Not Verified |  4 hours flight from Vancouver to Toronto started with a delay, then entertainment system did not work even though they tried to reset it, asked if could switch to another seat but the no, asked if they could offer me a pass for the internet access they said they could not, end up paying $20 for a wifi access that was just as bad as the rest of the experience with Air Canada. Don't pay for internet you wont be able to stream anything.

### "we are stranded in the airport"
Not Verified |  Flight to Toronto delayed over 5 hours resulting in missed connect and waited over an hour on the phone only for them to disconnect the line. Arrive in Toronto at 0050 and they say we aren't helping you we're closed and that they understand. What a joke, you understand as you go home and we are stranded in the airport. Not the first time this has happened. Last time coming home from Costa Rica only i didn't have the energy to fight for my refund or any kind of compensation.

### "I was treated with unbelievable hostility"
I purchased an all inclusive package with Air Canada Vacations. My flight was to be from Ottawa to Montreal to Cayo Coco. My first flight kept getting delayed, but I was assured that my connection in Montreal would wait because it was a charter. I arrived in Montreal and was told my connecting flight had left and there was nothing they could do. I was treated with unbelievable hostility. I arrived at Ottawa airport at 07.20 and returned the next morning at 03.00. Air Canada vacations takes no responsibility that my flight left late, missing my connection, and refuse to refund my package, but did offer me a 25% discount on my next travel purchase. I wouldn’t travel with this airline again. They basically took over $1200 from my pocket and refuse to return it. I did eventually get to Cayo Coco, but chose Sunwing instead.

### "will avoid booking with Air Canada because of this lack of service"
Not Verified |  I cancelled my family of four's Air Canada flights for Dec 2021 because of Omicron/COVID and Canada's desire to limit travel. Other flights I had booked for this same trip with American Airlines and Southwest I was immediately able to get credits to use for the future. But Air Canada made me fill out an online case report in order to request a credit. However they have not responded to my cases, they provide no email or phone assistance (waited for 40min to find that out) and the online chat bot only tells me the cases are 'closed' with no explanation. I will avoid booking with Air Canada because of this lack of service.

### "try to avoid them for my next travel"
I had an 8 hour of flight from Brussel to Montreal. We were served with lunch and a snack. No refreshments were served in between. I asked for baby food and flight attendant said I had to request it in advance. Extremely disappointed with this airline. They are charging so much for the tickets but the service in return is absolutely zero. Flight attendants were rude to me. I will try to avoid them for my next travel.

### "Dreadful service from miserable staff"
Dreadful service from miserable staff. All the decent host staff have cleared out over Covid, leaving only cranky and jaded people who should really find another way to make a living. It is particularly disappointing given the delightful experiences I have had with this airline in the past.

### "very little notice as to what was going on"
Boarded the flight and was sitting on the tarmac in the plane for 6.5hrs, did not even properly feed us as we were all hungry, apparently they were having an issue with the auto brake function. Instead of turning back to gate, we sat still on the tarmac for 6.5hrs, very little notice as to what was going on. Then they deplaned us and all they created was a bunch of angry mob at the gate, wasn't even organized with compensation as they seemed like idiots at the gate. They were more concerned in taking our duty free purchase than anything else, had to come back the next night and then even the flight was delayed by another 2 hrs. Lost a prepaid hotel day which they never compensated for, apparently I can't even file a claim with Air Canada because they say it's due to mechanical issue which I think should have been check before passengers were boarding. Overall they acted like this was a budget airline. Even though I was travelling Business Class, they food was still horrible. You would think they would serve better food in Business class, the best was the cold croissant. Who eats cold croissants?

### "horrible customer service"
Absolutely horrible customer service. Flight was canceled and had to fight with employees for 4 hours to retrieve our bags. Every employee that we dealt with was extremely rude and arrogant. Absolutely unacceptable.

### "how difficult is it to grab someone a coffee"
For our most recent trip to India we chose Air Canada again as they offer a direct flight. My parents for the first time wanted to upgrade our experience from economy to premium and naturally our hopes were quite up and the excitement of what this experience will have to offer gave us a lot to look forward to. The flight itinerary made the level of comfort, service and meal quality sound like it was worth the money we were paying yet that was not case. Firstly they served the dinner within 2 hours of the flight taking off, leaving the passengers for the remaining 12 hours depending on snacks. When I politely asked for some coffee from a hostess she gave me the most dirty look and claimed “the cart just came 5 minutes ago”. I was sleeping and even if I wasn’t how difficult is it to grab someone a coffee. I do not plan to travel with Air Canada again. Do not waste your money please.

### "excellent service in business class"
Air Canada continues to deliver excellent service in business class on their overseas routes. The seats are very comfortable and I enjoyed a good sleep on this 8.5 hour evening flight. The food service is very good with a choice of 4 entrees and a complete selection of wines and other beverages. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Flight left and arrived right on time such that I could make my tight connection. Complete selection of movies available, both American and foreign.

### "one of the worst experiences"
We had a 6am flight to Montreal connecting to New York and we boarded the 6am flight only for them to turn the power off and on again to realize the plane had technical issues. We had to get off the plane and could not be rebooked to be in New York the same day. We flew to Montreal at 2:30pm the same day and once we got to Montreal our bag had also been lost, we had to wait in a 2 hour line to find out where the bag was. We were booked on a flight to New York at 9am the next day and when we got to the airport it had been cancelled and the Air Canada agents refused to help us re book or book a flight back home. This has been one of the worst experiences of my life with travelling. We were given 2 $10 food vouchers for my mom and I to cover meals for the whole day.

### "24 hour delay which was not acceptable"
Flight from Sydney to Montreal cancelled on 05 February, automatically rebooked on the next day flight. A 24 hour delay which was not acceptable to me - only seat available on the 06 February flight from Sydney to Toronto and then Vancouver and Smithers was business class when I went online to book .. so I paid $3,900 for a flight which is normally less than a $1,000 eco and $2,000 business but I needed to be in Smithers on 06 February. I arrived in Toronto 15 min late with a 45 min connection I received a text message saying I had been rebooked to the 15:20 flight meaning I then had an 18 hour stopover in Vancouver and arrived in Smithers on 07 February. I go to the gate of my original flight and people still boarding .. they say I have been rebooked as my baggage would not make it and nothing they could do I needed to go back to the service desk - on the way back to the service desk I get a text message saying my original flight was going to be leaving 20 min late, so back to the original 45 min on which the ticket was sold - service desks gets me a seat on the 9am from Toronto to Vancouver in economy as no business seats. Flight from Toronto to Vancouver is now 60 min late due to late servicing of the plane and we are all boarded and sat waiting.

### "Worst airline ever"
Air Canada’s website booked me with another airline’s flight to connect to their airline’s flight. The flight prior to my Air Canada flight was canceled for holiday, so I got into contact with that airline and they said since I booked through Air Canada, they would not be able to resolve the issue. I talked to Air Canada (via messenger because no one answered the phone) and was told it was the responsibility of the other airline to get me to my final destination, even though I was booked through Air Canada. There are no human customer service representatives at Narita Airport today, on top of that. At this point I cannot even get a refund on a $1000 ticket. Worst airline ever, I will not make this mistake again.

### "the staff had no power to act"
I had booked business class for my mother and for me I had booked economy. I wanted to upgrade my reservation for business. With the covid it was necessary to pass a test before leaving 48 hours before departure. While the possibility of raising the category of the seat was open up to 48 hours before departure. So I had the trouble of doing this upgrade, because the possibility was closed on the website, at the airport in Beirut, with my agency in Montreal, etc. I arrive on the gate at London airport after a stopover. they tell me that now it's too late to do the enhancement. The seats in the business section were almost empty and the staff had no power to act, all they tell you is company policy. I asked to pay for the upgrade, or to accommodate myself with an upgrade because my mother is an elderly person and she does not speak the language. They said they will take good care of my mother, something they did well but my mother did not feel comfortable because of the language barrier and they did not want to disturb the business section while during the 7.5 hour flight I was able to go see my mother 4 times only for 1 min only, so as not to disturb. I find that Air Canada does not give any power to act to its employees and it should have put a travel manager who listens to passengers and that we have the tools so that they can do the impossible to satisfy its clientele. J'avais réservé business class pour ma mère et pour moi j'avais réservé économie. je voulais rehaussé ma réservation pour business. Avec le covid il fallait passé un test avant de partir 48 heure avant le départ. Alors que la possibilité de rehaussé la catégorie du siège était ouvert jusqu'à 48 heure avant le départ. Alors j'ai eu la misère de faire ce rehaussement, car la possibilité était fermé sur le site web, à l'aéroport de beirut, avec mon agence de Montréal etc. j'arrive sur le gate à l'aéroport de londre après un escale. ils me disent que maintenant c'est trop tard de faire le rehaussement. Les sièges de la section business était presque vide et le personnel n'ont aucun pouvoir d'agir. tout ce qu'il te disent que c'est la politique de la cie. j'ai demandé de payer le rehaussement, ou de m'accomoder avec un rehaussement car ma mère est une personne âgée et elle ne maîtrise pas la langue. ils ont fit qu'ils vont bien s'occuper de ma mère, une chose qu'ils ont bien fait mais ma mère ne se sentait pas confortables à cause de la barrière langue et ils ne voulait pas déranger la section business alors que pendant le vol de 7.5 heure j'ai pu aller voir ma mère 4 fois seulement pendant 1 min seulement, pour ne pas déranger. je trouve que air Canada ne donne aucun pouvoir d'agir à ses employés et il aurait dû mettre un chef de voyage qui soit à l'écoute des passagers et qu'on l'outil pour qu'il puissent faire l'impossible pour satisfaite sa clientèle.

### "Absolutely the worst airline"
Not Verified | Houston to Prince George. They cancelled my flight from Houston to Prince George over 5 times (I lost count) due to Covid and gave me a travel credit that was emailed back to me. I have tried to redeem the credit. I have called 5 times to "customer service", I use that term with hesitation, hung up on 4 times, put back on hold because the travel credit code that they emailed me does not match any records. 45 minutes later, they tell me my flight credits are about to expire and are under another credit code and I have to change those flight credits into a flight voucher but that will take 2 months to get my travel voucher. How does a company in 2022 take 2 Months to give you your flight credits that you paid for? I can return something on my Chase Credit Card and get instant credit but it takes 2 months to transfer credit internally at Air Canada. (The only think I can figure is that this is a technique that the Air Canada uses to take your flight credit or make you wait until the ticket prices go up and charge you more money.) Absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with in my life of travel.

### "I was not reimbursed for charges"
Air Canada cancelled my flights twice so I had to pay additional charges to change my flight for last part of my trip with United twice. I had to stay in airport hotel in Chicago. I was not reimbursed for charges related to cancelled flights by Air Canada and the staff at Chicago airport were very unhelpful when I asked for help regarding the process for refund. I will not fly with Air Canada and do not recommend it.

### "on flight they ran out of meals"
During a snow storm we sat on plane at gate for 3 hours, then deicing another 1.5 hrs, but this was not their fault. Then for the meal on flight they ran out of meals. Absolutely poor planning as they had 3 hours to figure this out.

### "the corners they cut in customer service on the plane is ludicrous"
The seats were comfy, the staff were nice, the airplane of decent quality, the entertainment system was brilliant and so on. However, where it all goes wrong is the policies of Air Canada. Under no circumstances will they provide you with anything more than a glass of water on your journey. Its a 4 hour journey, how about some chips or crackers? Want to experience their brilliant entertainment system? Better purchase some headphones at a ridiculous price. Its rather ridiculous when you consider Air Canada maintains prices that are 3 times higher than cheap budget airlines with Flair. - you get marginally better customer service off the plane, and a carry-on, but not much else. This flight was delayed by an hour. WiFi is significantly worse than Qatar Airways at a much worse price.

### "practically a monopoly"
Montreal to Los Angeles. Air Canada always go the extra mile to make your life miserable as a passenger. One example, when I have a 6:30 layover in Montréal while the airport is empty and most businesses closed I am unable to pay for lounge access, I am told you need to book ahead. Of course, I never seen any mentions of that before and no other airline do this kind of thing. I could see their lounge is mostly empty. They absolutely don't care about the passengers. If the company was not practically a monopoly and continually sponsored by my taxes and those of all Canadians, I wouldn't be so angry about it. But the truth is, as a Canadian, you are despised by your national transporter but you have no choice to fly AC and sponsor the airline with your taxes. Oh Canada

### "cabin crew was rude to me"
The flight time was changed at least 3 times before the flight. On the flight, most of the cabin crew was rude to me, yelling at me for trivial matters (like changing your seat) even though their colleague said it was ok. If you ask for a snack or a drink on a 14 hour flight, expect a dry and short response. For me, the flight experience was uncomfortable. Forget about ever reaching them if you try calling customer service internationally. Impossible. If you try calling them from within Canada, expect to wait on the line for 1-2 hours.

### "Frustrating to say the least"
Frustrating to say the least, I had to pack my patience. Went to visit my in-laws for the holiday as they are getting older and my mother-in-law really wanted us to visit. My husband and I got the the family together to travel we flew out of Orlando on Christmas day which was reasonable enough I give a pass to the attitude of the staff because it is Christmas day but the horrible part is returning home. We got all of our COVID test done on New Years Eve as we were traveling on New Year's Day, got to the airport in plenty of time(t3 hours ahead) and the incompetence was just mind boggling but we got through and told our bags would be checked all the way through to Orlando as we would pre-clear customs in Montreal and then head to Orlando. Well this is where it went batshit crazy. Our flight out of Vancouver was delayed by an hour we got into Montreal and Air Canada lost one of our bags so we were held up in US immigration because we couldn't clear customs without that one bag (which was mine) of course my family didn't leave me we all were stuck. At the last minute the agent filed a missing bag for to allow us to go through he then called the flight attendant on the plane we were scheduled to leave on and she was so rude and refused to hold the plane for five minutes so my family and I could run the 100m dash to the gate. We got through finally and yes they left us even though it was their fault we missed the connection. Had to trek down to the baggage department with absolutely do direction or help from Air Canada. We finally got back to the departures in Montreal after collecting our remaining bags and a bit of luck we ended up with an agent that was actually concerned and nice for the first time in this whole ordeal. She booked us on a flight in the morning and she arranged to put us up at a near by Marriott and $80 in meal vouchers she was amazing, it gave me hope. Got back to the hotel in Montreal only to get an email that the flight she booked us on in the morning was cancelled and we are now being bumped on to a Delta Flight through Atlanta into Orlando. We never arrived in Orlando until January 3 at midnight. If it hand not being for Air Canada incompetence, the selfish, inconsiderate flight attendant and the laid back agent at customs this could have been avoided. I am back home and still don't have my bag and they are trying to get out it.

### "baggage was delayed when connecting in Toronto"
I have rarely had a connecting flight through Toronto Pearson Airport without my baggage being delayed. My flight from Las Vegas to Toronto was delayed twice and, even if I originally had a 3-hour layover to make it to my final flight, I had to run through customs, vaccination checkpoints and through security to make it to my connecting flight. I was told that my baggage was checked all the way to my final destination, but apparently it was not. I barely made it to my gate while the last passengers were boarding and in the end the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. At my final destination, half of the passengers had to line up at Customer Services because their baggage was delayed when connecting in Toronto. I was told that my baggage would be delivered at my address the following day, but it still has not been delivered. I spent one hour trying to contact a Representative on the phone to know if my baggage was on route (at 9.30pm) or at least if they could give me an idea of when I should expect it. However, when the person finally picked up, they could not tell me if it would be delivered on the following hours or the next morning. From now on I will avoid any connecting flights at Toronto Pearson Airport and, if possible, travelling with Air Canada.

### "I have never flown Air Canada and not had a problem"
I have never flown Air Canada and not had a problem. Their flights never leave on time, I have never made a connection with them before and getting a new ticket is impossible because their customer service is no good. You would think the biggest airline in the country can afford to hire enough reps so there is not a 3 hour wait to talk to someone. I will never ever ever fly AC again. Also the only airline I’ve ever flown that doesn’t give complimentary drinks or snacks they squeeze every last penny they can. Such a joke. They’ve managed to ruin all my vacations in the last 3 years.

### "cancelled, delayed, or changed"
Toronto to Quebec City. Every flight I purchase using Air Canada, it is either cancelled, delayed, or changed for a much more inconvenient flight. Impossible to receive a refund or rebate as there is a maze of red tape to navigate through in order to retrieve monies lost.

### "terrible customer service"
Canceled the flight 30 min after the boarding would have started, no rebooking, basically just said “you’re on your own, call this number and try to rebook your flight on this busy week”. I did manage to get to Vancouver on the next day, and then when I had a return trip they forgot my baggage at Vancouver. The baggage should’ve arrived like 4 hours ago, but unfortunately no one in the airport from Air Canada can be bothered to check so I’m celebrating new year without any clothes and 5% on my phone. Terrible company with terrible customer service.

### "one had no pilot and the other no fuel"
Not Verified |  Pilot showed up 20 minutes late to an already delayed flight. Crew provides drink and meal service and disappears, never to be seen again until the end of the flight. As if these aren’t bad enough, after boarding my connecting flight (also delayed - by over an hour) we are notified via PA that the plane isn’t fuelled. Reflecting on my flights this day, one had no pilot and the other no fuel. I don’t have to explain how unprofessional and frankly pathetic this service is. The problem is we Canadians don’t have any other choice for an airline, so we pay a premium for inferior planes, services, and routes. In the future my family will fly US airlines to avoid this headache.

### "Don’t use this airline - terribly inconsiderate"
Absolutely awful experience! First, they cancel our flight and book us on a flight leaving 2 hours later. Then, they make us sit on the plane waiting for multiple hours, telling us every 35 minutes that we have to wait another 35 minutes because a few people were late! Had to cancel my plans. Don’t use this airline - terribly inconsiderate.

### "Save yourselves the headache"
Worst flight experience of my life. I had to switch my flight to a connecting flight which was delayed. The airline automatically rebooked my connecting flight because they were unable to transfer my bags in time, even though we made it to our gate with an hour to spare. Resulted in unnecessary travel costs of more than $200 because the new flight landed after the rental kiosk closed. Had to drive over an hour out of the city via Uber then taxi back to the airport. Ended up traveling for 10 hours more than I needed to. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this airline at all costs. Oh, and not to mention COVID restrictions make it much much worse. Save yourselves the headache friends and look elsewhere!

### "The worst business class flight in my life"
The worst business class flight in my life. Someone at Air Canada decided to assign me a gluten free meal which is beyond depressing. The food looked as if it came from economy class. Since I did not request gluten free I was generously offered to pick from the menu from “what is left”. Plastic plates and paper tray with plastic utensils = Air Canada business class.

### "last time to use Air Canada"
Los Angeles to Incheon via Vancouver. I am still waiting for the flight. This flight was supposed to be departed at 12:55pm at the gate D69 but then all of sudden they changed the gate without any announcement. I saw the different gate (gate D72) and went to the gate. I saw all passengers did same thing I did. In addition, they announced after 1pm the delay of the flight departing at 1440. So I was expecting that boarding would start at 1400 but nothing happened and then I went to the crew asking what is going on. Then the crew said she was just waiting for the plane to arrive at the gate and did not give me the time window with so rude attitude. After that one crew announce that they were just waiting for more information at 1400. Also another announcement stated that they were just waiting for the plane at 1430 without any apology. This will be my last time to use Air Canada.

### "never experienced such good customer service"
I brought some collapsible hiking poles in my carry-on luggage from Washington DC through Toronto to Calgary on my outbound trip, and then from Calgary to Toronto on my return trip, with no issues from security. But then during a separate pre-US arrival security screening from Toronto to Washington DC, I was told by security that I could not travel with them in my carry-on luggage and my only choices were to abandon them or try to speak to an Air Canada representative to put them in an additional checked bag. After deciding on the latter because of the value of the items, the Air Canada rep I spoke to, went out of his way to shepherd my sister and I all the way out through customs and back in again through security, getting us to the front of the line when he could and when it was appropriate, so that we could make our connecting flight on time. I have never experienced such good customer service with an airline like that before (despite the original issue with my carry-on item). Aside from that, all Air Canada staff we encountered were very friendly and we had no issues on our flights, despite a brief mechanical delay at one point, which is pretty typical nowadays. The economy seats on our flights, for all legs, also seemed a bit roomier than many US airlines.

### "They have good customer-facing people"
When everything goes smoothly, Air Canada is a good airline to fly with. The major problem with them is experiencing how they handle unexpected issues along the way. We were bumped off our flight from Vancouver to Tokyo because we wouldn't make our connection there and at the time, Japan didn't allow stay-overs in the country bacause of strict Covid restrictions. The way the passengers affected were treated from the time we got off the aircraft to the time we were re-booked on another flight the following day was horrible. They have good customer-facing people who are doing their best to deal with such situations, but as a major organization, their leadership never gives them the tools or budget to deal with it appropriately. They need to make major improvements in dealing with crisis situations as they occur. Increased authority at a mid-level management would certainly be a good first step. The managers appear to be doing their best to accomodate the stressful transitioning of customers throughout the airport, but they clearly lack discretionary budgets to keep customers comfortable during the process. No food, drink or emergency staff increases to deal with any of it. Every customer is treated like cattle, running through the loops on their own, not knowing where to go in the terminal to address the next steps, etc. I am rating Air Canada on a corporate level, not on an individual customer-facing staff level.

### "the result that of wrong judgement"
They do not know to keep time. They delayed our flight for a reason that could be avoided. And on top of that they assumed the authority to cancel our connecting flight without communicating to us their decision, leaving us for hours, at the Heathrow airport. The decision to cancel our flight was the result that of wrong judgement. Because the flight from Toronto delayed for 15 minutes they took the decision to cancel our connection flight, but do not have the courtesy to inform us of their decision.

### "poor organization and all out chaos"
Flight was scheduled to leave at 7:50am and was delayed in departure by 3 hours because of poor organization and all out chaos. If there were other viable options I would never use this company to fly again.

### "Good food, great service and smooth flight"
Not Verified |  Good food, great service and smooth flight. All 4 flights were on time and comfortable. Staff friendly and gave excellent service. Will gladly fly with them again.

### "Their customer service is brutal"
Not Verified |  I have traveled with AC for over 20 years, mainly due to them being the preferred airline of the company I work. They are an over priced under service airline at best. Their customer service is brutal. Recently I needed to speak to someone live in customer service. I have been on hold for over 5 hours. What company that values even the slightest customer satisfaction offers this poor a service? It is an absolute shame Canadian does not have another national airline. As sad as it is I will no longer fly AC and opt for a US carrier instead. Shame on AC senior management. A leadership overall is long overdue and I hope tax payers money is better spent then keeping this poor preforming company afloat.

### "my diabetic meal did not make it on board"
I am a diabetic. On my flight from Toronto to Vienna, in Sept 2021 I was informed that my diabetic meal did not make it on board. I was not offered any alternative, just the comment: Sorry, we didn't load your meal. Flight 1 -hungry! On my flight back on Oct 12, I was offered a "diabetic meal", containing pasta (main course), bread etc. I need to inform AC that pasta is not recommended for diabetics, maybe consult a dietician for advise. Flight 2 -hungry! On top of that they lost one piece of luggage on our arrival in Toronto. We were told: "The luggage made it to Toronto (it was unloaded) but we cannot find it". It was delivered after 10 days at 5.30am with no advanced notice. Anyway, at least they found it! We filed two formal complaints for the meal and the luggage. $100 dollars off for the meal and 20% off the next booking for the luggage. Measly. When we booked out next trip we found out that the two discounts we re not recognized by the booking website.

### "I really enjoyed this flight"
I really enjoyed this flight. The flight attendants offered excellent service. There was a good selection of wines. The dinner was good but I would have appreciate a third option for the main course. I particularly enjoyed watching the films, documentaries and TV shows. When I am flying longer routes I always try to book on a plane with Signature Service. It's nice to see they've brought that back. I also enjoyed the AC lounge and have a bite to eat and a glass of wine and some water before my flight. The seats are really comfortable and with the seat facing the window, it feels nicely private. I also appreciated the health protocols followed by the AC staff. I look forward to flying with AC soon again.

### "no one take responsibility about this"
My flight delayed in Edmonton and the agent rebooked my flight to go Fort Lauderdale in Florida via Toronto and then stay one night in Fort Lauderdale and flight to Orlando the next day! So I canceled my hotel in Orlando with penalty fee of US 98.10 because Air Canada said that they will provide hotel in Fort Lauderdale! When I arrived in Toronto, Air Canada rebooked again to the next flight to Montreal and Orlando.. everything was delayed and in a hurry and super stressful! Now I don't have place to stay in Orlando tonight because I canceled the hotel. Seems like no one take responsibility about this.

### "have been on hold for 1 hour 27 minutes"
My review relates to the customer service in the booking of flights and changes to reservations. Air Canada has the worst customer service I have experienced. As I write this, I am on hold with Air Canada and have been on hold for 1 hour 27 minutes and counting, and this is my second call to confirm an upgrade which was accepted on line but without final confirmation. For reasons unknown, Air Canada does not make extensive (or any) use of chat bots or chat lines and it clearly is seriously understaffed. I may never fly Air Canada again.

### "the company doesn’t value you the customers"
Not Verified |  This airline has the worst customer service. I needed assistance on a short notice change in my flight and needed to meet the COVID requirements. I wasn’t looking to violate rules I was looking for assistance. The staff with Air Canada weren’t just rude they are completely uncaring! You could tell that the company doesn’t value you the customers nor does it value the customer experience. Specialize in saying “No, we don’t know how to assist.” I understood I needed to meet testing requirements and follow whatever policy stated but when I had follow up questions — I was dismissed and even told to talk to United! IAH Airport staff for Air Canada just want a check, they don’t want to help you. Again, they do care about your experience! No company integrity. No company value. Luckily United did indeed step up and completely changed my experience. Horrible time with Air Canada and I believe any competitors could easily out shine them if your staff smiles alone! Unkind and don’t recommend.

### "disgusted with the way the flight attendants are on the flight"
I am absolutely disgusted with the way the flight attendants are on the flight. Very rude. My concern is the following. 1) Empty plane - meaning all business class and first class had very minimal seats taken. I have Multiple Sclerosis and have zero feeling in my right leg (needs to stay straight or else I will cramp). I had spoken to Air Canada on the phone and they said to me to speak to the attendants when the plane is fully boarded and if there is any space they will move you up. They said. No Sir. You did not pay for any upgrades so we cannot move you up to the empty seats. What a joke.

### "They are delayed every flight"
Not Verified |  I have been on multiple flights with Air Canada in the last 3 months. They are delayed every flight. Either I’m the most unlikely passenger in the history of air travel or this is symptomatic of a poorly run organization.

### "Most of the staff are rude"
My flight was canceled numerous times after purchase. Last change was made while I was in the air, coming from Los Angeles to Toronto. By the time we landed in Toronto, we were told flight to Halifax had left. We had to search and pay for overnight lodging which was not easy as most hotels were already booked. Next morning we went back to airport and finally made it to Halifax where we missed the wedding we were here to attend. Upon arriving Halifax airport, our luggage was missing; taken by another passenger even though the airline stated our luggage would have been secured. Most of the staff are rude, has no regard for other people's feelings or properties. Worst and most expensive trip ever.

### "ruined by unhelpful onboard crew"
Very good product ruined by unhelpful onboard crew. Excellent website, clear flight info and updates, OK checkin, good boarding, excellent newly refurbished aircraft with very comfortable premium economy seating, good cabin ambience, minimum but informative announcements from the cockpit, nice meal and nicely presented on the tray with proper cutlery etc. and large clear personal TV with OK selection of media. The Montreal based onboard crew were ruined by the behaviour of some of the crew even when addressed in fluent first language French. Service on a 8 hour gate to gate flight amounted to 2 very brief per functional pass throughs with zero regular cabin checks. Crew were mostly in front and back galleys conversing in “non-Covid” close proximity. What really stood out was how aggressive the crew was. Tons of Corona related announcements and edicts. Bring your own drinks and snack even when in Premium Economy.

### "I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline"
I am a fairly frequent solo traveler (3-5 flights per year at a minimum) and this was the most disgusting experience I have had with an airline from the cancelation 7 hours before my flight in the middle of the night to the 24 hours delayed arrival to my destination. I had a flight booked for Sunday, August 29th, 2021 scheduled to depart at 7.00 am. I was in town for a wedding and this flight was a one-way direct flight from Halifax, NS to Toronto, ON. At 11.00 pm I received an email from the airline notifying me my flight was canceled "Due to weather". I called Air Canada to rebook my flight and after waiting on hold for 2 hours I got through to an agent who would only rebook my flight if I paid an additional fare. He advised me if I wanted another flight for the next day I could get on an 11.00 am flight for an additional $600 or a 7.00 pm flight for an additional $300. This is in addition to the $400 I paid for the initial flight. After much back and forth I requested a supervisor at which point he transfers me through, the supervisor introduces himself, and as I begin speaking he proceeds to hang up on me. I was infuriated as it was late at night and I had nowhere to go and no flight for the next morning. The next day, I call the airline back in the morning (attempting to get someone who would put me on the 11.00 am flight without charging double the amount of the original ticket). I was transferred several times, and on the phone for a total of 5 hours before securing a flight that evening at 7.00 pm and was required to pay the amount of the original flight and they said they would refund the initial ticket (total paid before a refund is not $800 for the flight that was $400 when purchased 2 months before the flight). However, my flight was now scheduled to go to Newfoundland overnight and then in the morning depart to Montreal then Toronto for my final destination. The agent on the phone advised me that when I arrived in NFLD they would be able to help with the hotel situation. I ended up having to pay for the hotel out of pocket ($150 for the hotel + the $800 for the flight = $950 trip so far) when I arrived at the airport because the agents had no idea what I was talking about. Finally, the next morning at 9 am (26 hours after my regional flight and $950 dollars later) I arrive in Toronto. When I get here, not surprisingly, my bags did not make it. They were delivered to my location a day and a half later. I wanted to leave this review to share my experience with Air Canada. I was truly disgusted with the service from the airline, the fact that it is incredibly challenging to speak to anyone, the fact that Air Canada treats its clients as numbers, and the fact that this conglomerate is a company solely focused on making money and has little care about the people affected on their flights. Things may seem okay with this airline when nothing goes wrong (which is seldom) but when it does go wrong, expect your trip to cost more and to spend hours online trying to talk to someone.

### "Overall good flights and service"
An early morning departure from Penticton, BC, check in staff very good and checked in quickly. Flight good and onboard staff pleasant, short flight so not much service offered or expected. The Q400 was an all economy flight but seated in row 2. Vancouver layover good, the lounge not back to pre-covid offerings yet, staff pleasant. Flight from Vancouver on the 787 Signature Class, the boarding was a bit delayed with no explanations given, boarding ok. Service onboard very good and the breakfast done very well and no complaints. Staff efficient. IFE worked well, pleanty of choice for the length of flight. Seat comfortable. As it was a daytime flight I did not use the flat bed but bedding was provided. Layover in Toronto 4 hours in the lounge, again not back to pre-covid as far a food options go. This lounge could use a make over as it is getting a bit tired. Last flight 737 Max, staff very good, food and beverage service good IFE worked well. Overall good flights and service from Air Canada on this trip.

### "This is the worst experience!"
Air Canada customer service is the worst I have ever seen. I have a flight back to the USA for October 2. They changed it from 12.30 am to 12.25 am and asked me to confirm. When I go the the link to confirm it says call Air Canada, when I call them it says I should wait two hours to talk with an agent. I tried several times and could not talk to an agent to only confirm the 5 min change in my flight! I tried their website and there is no way to confirm! This is the worst experience! I am worried if I could not confirm I encounter a problem to go back to the USA.

### "service on the flight was abysmal"
I flew from Frankfurt to Vancouver and then Vancouver to Kelowna. The Vancouver to Kelowna flight turned around and went back to YVR. The people waiting for me were not informed of the turnaround until I was back in YVR. I was put in an OK hotel and given $20 for food. I am told by the people waiting for me that AC service in Kelowna were rude to my hosts and provided no information. Besides that the service on the flight was abysmal. If there is an alternative, take it.

### "My flights were delayed 4 times!"
My flights were delayed 4 times! All of my trips! On the way to Canada my both flights got delayed for 30 and 40 minutes and again AC7557 from Halifax to Montreal had a 35 minutes delay. I had transfer in Montreal to Chicago, AC 7597 and again 1 hour delay! I will never fly with this airline again!

### "baggage is lost since Aug 20"
The worst customer service ever since I booked the tickets until now, one of my baggage is lost since Aug 20 until now I spent my whole stay without my baggage and came back to the states and every time I try to reach out to customer service either their phone number has a voice message to call back later due to lack of customer service person or I have to stay on hold for over 90 minutes and the customer service are not qualified to resolve the issue, I was promised to get a call from a supervisor within 24 hours since Thursday 09/09/2021 and looks like they do not have supervisors to resolve my issue.

### "service offered was excellent"
I would like to post an extremely positive comment for the head purser of flight AC860 from Vancouver to London on Tuesday 14th September 2021 departing at 18:15pm. His mannerisms and the service offered was excellent, which is very refreshing in this day and age.

### "slightly above-average"
Flying with Air Canada can be best described as slightly above-average. Not at all great, but most certainly not bad. The check-in agent in Portland who reviewed my flight and pandemic paperwork (to satisfy Canada's requirements) was very serious but also pleasant and helpful. The departure gate was relatively new, as well as secluded and quiet. The Portland gate agent was also courteous. The flight attendants were very serious and not much into pleasantries, but still pleasant when I needed to interact with them. The plane was a bit old, could have been slightly cleaner, but wasn't like a pigsty. The ticket was also a bit pricey considering that this was basically a 1-hour regional flight on a commuter jet (then again, I guess having to pay federal fees to the US and Canada for this flight might explain the price). Again, the experience was slightly above-average, I'd probably still choose them over American or Southwest in the US if I needed to fly to certain places outside of North America.

### "poor customer service"
Very disappointed. I used 110,000 aeroplan miles plus $1,500 Cdn. for return premium economy Toronto - Vanouver. They switched the seats so one of us got tossed back in coach then switched the return date to the next day without explanation. I waited on hold 1.5 hours and the only suggestion was to cancel which I did. The same flight was later booked on Westjet, premium economy both ways, almost same time, seats together for $950 CDN. no airmiles needed. Air Canada too expensive, poor customer service, erratic untrustworthy booking and aeroplan points appear to actually increase, not decrease costs. Never again.

### "waiting for 45 min"
The ground crew can’t be found to load the aircraft or to guide the aircraft to the gate. Here we are waiting for 45 min and counting for ground crew to be appear to load this Dash-8.

### "reached the gate I was 3-4 mins late"
Not Verified |  I have bought Business flight passes from Air Canada. The purpose of buying flight passes is to save time and fly as and when required. I booked my flight for 4th Sep 2021 to attend a business meeting in Edmonton. Today I reached airport almost on time and by the time I reached the gate I was 3-4 mins late. I requested the crew and told them to accommodate me in the same flight instead of understanding the situation they preferred to argue. They would have easily accommodate us in the same flight as it was hardly any delay but they moved us to other flight.

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline if you can. They are always late, their flights are cancelled or there are mechanical problems. The staff are not very helpful. We got a 10 cad $ voucher for a whole day delay. Good luck if you are trying to catch a connection or arrive on time somewhere.

### "Totally, unpleasant flight"
The flight 1421 Varadero-Toronto was delayed an hour. After we boarded the plane, the captain came on to say that we expect to be further delayed because of the paper problems with Cubans where supposedly they might return some of the passengers that he brought on his earlier flight form Toronto, which added almost another hour. Quite unusual, but well. During that hour of waiting aboard the plane, the crew kept reminding passengers via PA and directly to keep the masks on or face fines. Then they made an announcement saying they know we are getting hot and we are hungry and thirsty, but to be patient and once again keep masks on. The next announcement asked people sitting next to the windows to put the shades down so we would not be that hot. Each announcement was given in English, French and Spanish , so talking never stopped. Once we were up in the air, they could not get the safety demonstration video to play properly, so they told us in 3 languages again to read subtitles. The food service was then further delayed because they said there was a medical emergency. Finally, the cart with the food/drinks shows up. Yes, it is Covid, so told us the director of service, as she "cannot pick up trash while offering food for purchase because she is not supposed to mix clean and dirty". But the staff was supposed to use paper menu that every passenger touched, and was collected and passed to the next row. Totally, unpleasant flight.

### "no apologies were offered for the inconvenience"
Not Verified |  With over 15 years of travel experience I can definitely say this was the worst I experience. I have not flown on Air Canada for a while and will not be doing so in the near future. This was horrible from the clerk at the baggage drop-off to the boarding hostesses - rude and complete incompetence. It first started at the Air Canada luggage drop off point. The clerk pointed out that my carry-on was too big and requested I paid 115$ for the extra bag. So, I transferred everything to a small bag I had inside and to my other bags. When she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). She requested I remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. I managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. To my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because I failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. I was shocked, I tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way I made it through the security without paying. The hostess flat out told me I was lying and that there was no way for them to know I was telling the truth. They made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that I was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. I was finally allowed to board. Please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. As I was walking to the airplane to board, I started to experience some cramps in my hips since I was standing for a long time. I had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. To add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! I explained that I am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. The lady repeated herself saying that I needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. When she saw I ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - "that’s it, I am removing your name from the flight".. I was really shocked I have never had in one encounter so many unkind people. This was a night flight and I imagine everyone was exhausted but the treatment I received was beyond unimaginable. The humiliation over and over again. I am so disappointed and really hope this company starts holding their employees accountable for the way they treat their customers.

### "absolutely no service for stranded passengers"
Not Verified |  Air Canada has no class. They cancelled my return flight and left me stranded in Morocco. They would not allow my travel agent to exchange my ticket with another airline. At the last hour flight prices on other airlines had doubled. Air Canada offered a partial refund which did not cover half the fair to get home. Big loss for me and absolutely no service for stranded passengers. The head steward on my flight was a mask Nazi. I was very aware and cooperative. But it is very awkward putting on a mask every time they pass you while eating or drinking. No common sense at all. As the walk towards you while eating you have to put a mask on. There should be some balance there.

### "Fly with anyone else"
Not Verified |  This airline is disgusting. They canceled a flight and moved to the next day, not offering accommodation for sleeping. Ok fine. Was told the PCR covid test will be extended to the next day. The flight was from Toronto to San Diego with a layover in Vancouver. They allowed the flight to Vancouver and then was not allowed to continue to San Diego and told we were lying about the test extension. They lost the luggage, and stranded us here in Vancouver with absolutely no reconciliation. I will not be letting this go. Fly with anyone else, literally anyone.

### "never been so disappointed"
I booked a domestic flight (In the same province) originally on July 30th for 1:20pm. I showed up at Vancouver Airport at 12:00pm. It was my mistake this day for showing up too close to the time and I had to cancel because I missed the flight. Went back home All good I booked the flight through Expedia, got a refund and my expedia account was re-issued the credits again. Booked through Expedia for another flight for the next day to the same location. Flight was scheduled for 8:05am. Ok I decided to show up 2 and a half hours before the flight just to be safe. Get to the airport at roughly 5:30am, standing in line to check in and the lineup doesn't look too long. But They only have 3 people working the computers and the line moves incredibly slow. After almost an hour and twenty minutes of waiting in line I start to panic because I have only made it a little over halfway through this lineup. I start flagging down Air Canada staff to alert them that I may miss my flight if things don't speed up. Alerted one girl and she said : "ok sir, someone will be over to assist you. 15 minutes goes by with no assistance and I alert another girl. She gives me the same line as the other girl. And the same exact outcome. Nobody comes to assist me. After 15 more minutes I hop over the rope to the counter and beg them to please have someone come over and help me, or I will miss my flight. Again the girl tries to re-assure me they will help me and tells me to get back in line. Well after 2+ hours in line, and not one Air Canada staff coming over to help After I had asked. I'm one person away from being helped at the front counter. And just feel defeated. I step up to the front and talk to the girl and she tells me immediately that I have missed my flight. I can't describe my frustration, I even left well before my flight just to be able to make the flight in time. Two and a half hours before my flight and I still missed it. And this was a domestic flight. I have never in my life had to give myself so much time to make a flight, let alone a hour and a half flight. And still miss the flight. Air Canada offered no compensation and also did not appear to have any sympathy for my situation. I still had to fly up that day to go up for work, so I was desperate to get on a flight. Luckily a Westjet flight to the same destination was available. I walked over to the Westjet lineup, which was the same size as the Air Canada lineup. Managed to get through the line, book my flight and check on my bag within 15 minutes. Yes, within 15 minutes I did all of that. To top it all off, I canceled my flight through Expedia. Got the credit for Air Canada flights on my expedia account. Decided to try and book another flight with my available credit, but the expedia representative told me he couldn't book it because Air Canada had suspended my ticket, and I needed to call Air Canada to open it. Try to call Air Canada and they said they aren't taking any calls at the moment. Anyways I'm stuck with a 900$ balance for Air Canada that I now can't use until they get back to me. And will probably have to book through westjet to get back home which means even more money I will have to shell out due to Air Canada. I have never been so disappointed with a service in my life.

### "did put me on another flight"
I use to travel with Air Canada for many years and never had any issues. Since the past 3 years I've encountered several problem that I am now doubting Air Canada. On my way from BC to California the entire way was pretty smooth and the pilot was friendly along with the staff. The problem was coming back from California to BC. Unfortunately my flight got delayed by 25 minutes when I landed in BC I had a connecting flight. I had to undergo the entire PCR, boarder security check. When I spoke to Air Canada I told them I have a connecting flight and with the looks of it I may not make it. I was told its okay we have time and my check-in was done so they will hold the flight for me. I got to security screening and long line up, I than again told the Air Canada person I have a connecting flight I need to go my flight will leave AT 5:20 which means boarding must've ended at 5:05 and I was at security till 5:10. I than rushed so fast to get to the gate and my flight took off! Air Canada did put me on another flight that took off at 8:45PM. I do not understand why Air Canada couldn't just tell me from the start that they will put me on another flight and shouldn't my name be called when someone is running late or is behind?

### "over four months to get a refund"
Still not sure why it is taking over four months to get a refund from covid tickets bought last September. Originally forced to get aeroplan points, then we could get refund via original form of payment. In April the refund site would at least tell you what date of originally purchased tickets refund they were working on. Then May 26th they stopped reporting any dates at all also basically said don’t call customer service, they can’t give you information. I have a diary of all the times I’ve reached out and never have I heard of a major company being so distant to the consumer. Yesterday (8/24) I finally took on the 1hr hold thru customer service just trying to get information. I was told that she has talked to other people who have been waiting nine months (is this supposed to make me feel better?) she will send up my information and “they” should let me know something shortly.

### "I did file for reimbursement"
Flight in Chicago had a 4 hour delay so we were delayed, almost missed our connection Air Canada let everyone off the plane instead of just the people with the imminent connections. Being on the back of the plane, things didn't look good Following that the agents barely listened to our questions on how to get to connections in time; instead directed us to customs and immigration. After 30 minutes in line, got to the customs agent, he says, "why are you here? I'll walk you to connections. Of course we missed the plane. Then the air Canada customer support agent in Toronto was useless. He let it slip that just the 4 of us missed our flight. And that it was our problem. We couldn't leave the airport and gave us one hotel room for 4 people. Went to CBP and again, they say "why weren't you escorted"? We weren't supposed to walk where the Air Canada agents sent us alone. I did file for reimbursement, but judging by the job Air Canada's done so far, that won't happen. They proceeded to lose our luggage and return it to us on our 9th and last day of our trip. Followed by not letting part of our party board because our recovery letter didn't said "recovered from covid" xx date signed by a doctor but missed the words "for travel.

### "total lack of guidance"
Not Verified |  Will try to never fly with Air Canada again after our experience. Minutes before we were to board the final leg of a return flight from Rome, Italy - the Toronto to IAD Washington leg - AC7708, that flight was cancelled by Air Canada. All the passengers on what we were told was a full flight were directed to the AC customer services desk elsewhere in the airport. When we arrived there we learned another AC flight to Pittsburgh had also been cancelled. The Washington bound group joined at the back of this line of what was probably 300+ people. Over the next three+ hours no announcements to all the people in line were offered by AC customer service staff. At various times when Canadian citizen passengers, who were given vouchers on the spot and escorted past us out of the terminal by AC customer service staff, different AC staff gave incomplete and varying information in response to questions from non-Canadian citizen passengers. We were told we could not leave that area of the terminal due to Covid restrictions. We were told it would be days for us to find flights to final destinations - especially if there were multiple passengers on one booking etc. The total lack of guidance by AC staff to passengers led many to search for options. Also the customer service line was not moving as they were short staffed and having major computer rebooking issues. With 10pm approaching, no movement in the rebooking line, horror stories from other US passengers closer to the AC desk hearing rebooked flights for Thursday soonest etc., we felt we had to act. We began hearing also that Airport Security would not let us remain in the airport overnight. We secured a one-way car rental and drove 9 hours back to DC. At no time was a hotel stay offered by Air Canada or any talk of a voucher due to the cancellation. It was a total failure by them to communicate guidance for a situation that they - not the weather or other forces beyond their control - had caused. We are being told now by the Air Canada website that it will be 60 days for a reply to refund request due to a flight cancellation.

### "will not get any compensation"
I was travelling from Los Angeles to Montreal by Air Canada along with my family yesterday. The plane we supposed to board got delayed for two and half hours at Los Angeles airport, we received food voucher there by an Air Canada agent. After landing at Toronto we got stuck on the plane for another one hour because of the traffic. Because of the covid situation we had to do our immigration and baggage claim in the Toronto airport. We were told by the Air Canada we will get hotel vouchers as we missed our connected flight because of the delay. We were directed to aisle number 7 and 8 of Air Canada for the hotels voucher. After waiting for about 3 hours in the queue when we got a chance to see the rep at the counter we were told that we are not eligible for the hotel voucher. And the representative didn’t want to help us and constantly misbehaving with us. Later the manager explained it was not the airlines fault as we got delayed by the customs at Los Angeles airport. But we didn’t do our custom at Los Angeles. And he also added we will not get hotel voucher and will not get any compensation. Such a bad customer service.

### "Air Canada has not compensated me"
I booked my flight from Toronto to Kamloops via Vancouver using reward points in June 2021. I booked my seat at the time of booking the flight - choosing 2A. A couple of days later I received a notification that my seat had been changed to 3A - not a big deal. On the 14th of August, I checked in online for my flight. A minute or two after checking in I received a notification that my seat was being changed to 28D - economy class, and minute or so after that another notification that my seat was changed again to 19D (may have been premium economy). I went into my bookings on the Air Canada website and my seat still showed as 3A. Next morning just to be sure I phoned Air Canada and after 1 hour 22 minutes, the agent confirmed I was in 3A from what she could see. I went to the airport and checked in at the counter and the agent printed me a boarding card for 19D. Told him this was not acceptable and explained what had taken place the day before. He then found an open seat in business class - seat 1D and gave me a new boarding card with my baggage tag attached. While going through security my phone alerted me to a message indicated my seat had changed and I was now in 27J (economy), and a few minutes later a new seat change to 21D, and then another change to 12D (Premium economy). Asked the agents in the lounge and they said I should go to the gate and check as it is a involuntary downgrade. The agent at the gate had my new boarding card for 12D. He said however I should wait until the entire plane boarded in case someone was a no show in business class. I ended up in 12D. There was absolutely no explanation as to why any of this happened, and how a person who has paid for business class (even if it was with points) can have their seat changed after they have checked in for the flight. It is now five days later and Air Canada has not compensated me. On top of this my connecting flight to Kamloops was cancelled due to weather and when I went to collect my bag and could not find it I realized that the agent did not transfer my baggage tag on my original boarding card to the new one printed. My take on this is that someone who was paying cash/credit for business class was given my seat as I was deemed dispensable because I purchased mine with my Aeroplan points. To not be offered an explanation or compensation is disgusting. Especially as I have been a loyal Air Canada client for many years and have flown business many, many times.

### "saying that I am late for check in"
I booked my flight from Toronto to Winnipeg for August 16, 2021. I reached at check in line at about 19.15 and i told one of the lady employee standing there that i have a flight at 20.30 and she told me to wait in line that you still have a time. When i reached to the counter it was about 19.50 and the lady denied me to board the flight saying that I am late for check in. Even when i asked what i can do now as i know nobody in Toronto she said she cant do anything in it and she just gave me option that i have to get another ticket from her different day flight. So i asked her option and she gave me two option one on 18th from Toronto to Winnipeg via Calgary and other one on 19th from Toronto to direct Winnipeg. She just print of the ticket without waiting for my answer and said that this is the ticket for you and you can call in customer care to cancel or rebook. I tried calling customer care late at night waited for about 3 hours but no answer and suddenly my call gets cut automatically.

### "forgot to pack our luggage on our flight"
My wife and I paid for business class Toronto to Montreal. For some bizarre reason they forgot to pack our luggage on our flight. After waiting 1 hour for them to tell us this, we were told to go to our hotel and the luggage would be there within 2 hours. It is now Midnight (10 hours later ) and they never brought the luggage. They also haven't answered the customer service line after we waiting 1 hour 24 minutes before hanging up. I will never fly Air Canada again.

### "third time delaying our flight"
Not Verified |  My flight was delayed then they let us board the plane. After one hour in the plane they told us to leave plane until they fix a tire. After 90 minutes they told us that the flight is canceled until tomorrow at 15:00. We came early and spent two hours checking again. They are for the third time delaying our flight. I lost a hope that we would be leaving today. I lost important meetings today. My wife and I lost work days. For all of this ordeal we were compensated with $10 food voucher. This my last time using Air Canada.

### "flight kept getting pushed back"
vOur flight was supposed to take off at 6:30, at 6:50 there was not a flight attendant or any announcement about delays. Passengers tried asking Air Canada attendants from nearby gates as to why no one had come to even say anything. Only to be told they have no idea, can't call anyone, or provide any information. The flight was shown as on time well past departure time. We were told to trek to a service desk across the airport to ask. Eventually the time of the flight kept getting pushed back and back, with no announcements or even a person coming to explain what happened. We missed our next layover because of it.

### "not resolving problems professionally"
They couldn’t have screwed things up any worse than they already have. Took me 12h to fly 1,000km, with one connecting flight. it would have been faster, easier, and cheaper to drive. I couldn’t afford any screw-ups so I booked the day’s earliest flight, 3 weeks in advance. I showed up 2h early. My flight was delayed 1h, not a huge deal, I should still make my connecting flight. Only to learn upon landing in Toronto that my flight was cancelled in less than 2h from departure time - my cancelled flight was re-booked for the day’s last flight - there were many earlier flights available, which customer service would not give me because they would have to locate my bag. This turned a 1h layover into a 9h layover, and I was already stranded in another city at this point, I couldn’t very well cancel my ticket. 33 people in line, ONE customer service representative. Took me 1.5h to move my way to the front of the cue. I was quickly dismissed, told there was nothing they could do because they couldn’t be bothered with locating the bag and he was on to the next person. This person was not resolving problems professionally.

### "I'm still without my luggage"
Not Verified |  They lost my luggage. They couldn't help me out at all in Toronto, I was sent from one person to another but nobody could help me out, all very disorganised and chaotic. Finally, I reported it at the airport in Montreal where they told me it will arrive the next day at my home. Neither arrived the next day nor the following day. Every day I'm calling the number for lost luggage and I wait one hour in the waiting line without getting connected! Horrible service! I arrived on the 4 August, today is the 8th August and I'm still without my luggage.

### "escorted off the aircraft"
Not Verified |  While awaiting a connecting flight in Montreal,there was delay because of a problem with the AC. Minutes after boarding the AC stopped working and being claustrophobic I went to a stewardess to explain my discomfort with breathing. Her response was that there was Zero tolerance for violence on an aircraft and proceeded to call security and had me escorted off the aircraft. I was permitted to fly out with them the following morning.

### "business class had one cold dinner option"
The Signature Class check-in experience in Toronto was pathetic. There were only 4 us in the designated Signature Class check in hall but it still took almost 30 min. The agents seem confused. The lounge is a bare bones version of the domestic lounge (not Signature Class). So if you are flying from the gates you have to leave the lounge way in advance of your flight. An overnight, trans-Atlantic flight in business class had one cold dinner option consisting of a pea falafel. The mid flight snack was a basket of kit kats and nuts. Very limited drinks service. I woke up early and asked for breakfast. The flight attendant said I can't give it to you now because others will see and ask for it. Breakfast was even more pathetic: the menu said it was a croissant but it came in a plastic wrap with some fruit, etc. Given the state of breakfast, she could have easily served it to me when requested. I've flown other airlines as part of this trip and somehow they were able to serve hot meals with multiple choices in business and economy; and have functioning lounges.

### "seat didn't recline in an overstuffed aircraft"
Despite arriving at the airport two hours before my flight, I got a seat that didn't recline in an overstuffed aircraft during a pandemic, I waited for over an hour for my baggage upon arrival (the flight was a single leg and less than an hour!). It never showed up. I waited 48 hours to have it returned. At no point did anybody tell me anything; they just left me hanging while they fiddled with my bag. And for this, they charged me an extra 30 bucks.

### "experience this week was awful"
I've flown with Air Canada more than any other airline in the past 5 years, and I've always ignored small unpleasant comments from ground and flight staff as well as poor organization and flight problems because flying Air Canada was often the only option available (or at least slightly more affordable) and I accepted it as a means to an end. However, my experience this week was awful. It started with a 3.5 to 4-hour line  to the check-in counter. We were told that self check-in isn't available so everyone had to wait in a single line. Most people ended up missing their flights. The airline only had four counters available and would not offer any communication to anyone who was worried about their flight. At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space. After about 45 minutes of waiting, a new staff member asked us why we were standing there and told us our line doesn't lead anywhere. She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served. When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there, the ground staff responded that it wasn't true and that there was no way we've been waiting for 3 hours so far. Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration. Once I finally made it to the check-in counter, I was told that all the other flights to Boston that day were full so my only option was to be placed on stand-by for all the flights in hopes that one of them would have extra space. I was told to wait at each gate one hour before a flight departs to see if my name was called. Luckily, I was able to board a flight that day and made it to Boston in the evening. When I arrived, my luggage was nowhere to be found. I went to the luggage service desk to inquire about it and was told that my luggage was not put on my flight because there was too much weight on the flight and it was better to take all the passengers to their destination than load all the luggage. If I knew this would have been the case, I would have much preferred to not board my flight and keep my personal items than arrive in a different country without my belongings. I was told the luggage would arrive on another flight and could be delivered to the place I was staying on the next day. I left all my contact information and had to hope for the best. The next day, I checked the online status of my luggage and it said that it had been loaded onto a delivery truck at 2pm. I waited and waited for it to arrive, but nothing came. I called Air Canada and they told me that the luggage will arrive anytime before 11:30pm. I didn't want to miss the delivery so I spent the first day of my trip just waiting. By midnight, no one had arrived. It is now the next day and I'm still waiting. Air Canada is unable to reach the delivery company.

### "update their policies regarding transit visas"
Supposed to be my original flight was July 31st YWG to YVR then YVR to NRT via Air Canada and layover of 24h 20m HND to MNL via Philippine Airlines. My flight schedule was changed several times by another booking agency. The time I was about to check-in in Winnipeg, Air Canada didn’t give me my boarding pass and didn’t allow me to board my plane because according to them, my layover in Japan should only be less than 24 hours in order for me not to avail a transit visa. I researched a couple of times before my flight and I found out that a passenger is allowed to transit to Japan without a visa up to 72 hours with a confirmed ticket and if there are no available flights on the said date of arrival. Air Canada told me to call my booking agency and to adjust my layover time. But there are no longer available flights possible for that day. I was forced to book a new plane ticket amounting to $2937.46 including taxes on an economy ticket for the next day. Air Canada was so useless and I felt so disappointed because I have to travel back home again for an hour travel time and my brother who fetched me to the airport was already gone back home. I found the airline very inconsiderate and I hope they will update their policies regarding transit visas.

### "connecting flight to Edmonton was gone"
This is not the first time i got delayed by this Air Canada. They are very inconsiderate and do no care about their passengers. They give lame excuses as if they care yet they plan ahead. They mention that there is a technical issue of the plane. We had to wait and wait and by the time we got to Montreal, the connecting flight to Edmonton was gone. We were bungled up and were taken to a hotel where we were turned back because there were no room! Its so frustrating. Air Canada needs to improve their services and customer care.

### "phone operator was phenomonal"
Not Verified |  The service I received from a phone operator for Air Canada was phenomonal. His name was Aaron and he was so compassionate as I dealing with a step Dad and Poppy to my kids getting ready to pass away. I very much need to be there for my Mom and he understood that and helped make changing my flights so much easier. Thank you Aaron, you are my angel today and the stress that has been lifted off of me feels so good. I will pay it forward for sure.

### "Covid test I had taken was unacceptable"
Not Verified |  I recently made reservations for a flight from Toronto to Newark on June 30th. My original reservation was for 230pm and arriving in Newark at 401pm. My flight was cancelled while sitting on the plane waiting for it to takeoff. The reason for the cancellation was "a tornado warning. Meanwhile in Newark it was 98 degrees and sunny. Everyone from that flight was made to stand on a long line while waiting on ONE customer service representative to attend to the 100 plus people from my flight and trying to assist an additional 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations. Needless to say the 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations were attended to while myself and the passengers that had been deplaned were told after an hour to come back tomorrow because our flight had been postponed to 8am the following day (July 1st). We had made reservations to drive from Newark to Ocean City MD for a two night stay but due to Air Canada we did not make it and we were only able to enjoy half a day and a one night stay and due to it being the Fourth of July no extensions were being offered. So we basically payed $400 for a room and extra for a flight with no compensations. On July 6th at 8am I boarded a United flight from Philadelphia to Washington with and hour and half stop over in Washington where I was boarding an Air Canada flight at 1030am to Toronto. When I went to check in for my flight to Toronto I was told that the Covid test that I had taken was unacceptable and I was required to have a PCR test in order to board any flight to Canada. So I missed the 1030am flight, and went downstairs to get a rapid PCR test done. $250 USD later I received a negative PCR test and made my way back to the Air Canada counter to see if I was able to get on a later flight. When I approached the Air Canada counter the gentleman rudely tried to give me a card with Air Canada's Customer service number (that I have been trying to call for days to find out information regarding Covid testing) I told him "please don't try to give me that number you know  that no one answers that phone. He went to the back to supposedly speak to someone and then quickly came back to me and stated "We have another flight at 430pm but we are fully booked so we cannot help you. Anyways you should try United because it is their fault for allowing you on that flight this morning with the wrong test. Long story short, I went over to the United counter and the gentleman who I believe was the supervisor,  stated to me that he would "try his best to put me on a flight to Toronto. He got me on the United flight from Washington to Toronto at 545pm, which I am grateful for.

### "Seats are uncomfortable"
Please avoid Boing 787-9 for long flights. Seats are uncomfortable and plane is really crowded. You get bumped by trollies due to narrow aisles. Staff is ok but my food lacked taste and freshness.

### "agents did not pay attention to detail"
I flew business class on Air Canada from Newark to Doha via Toronto. I was connecting to my favorite airline, Qatar. I was looking forward to the service. However, AC was terrible. Check in at EWR was hectic. The agents did not pay attention to detail and gave me boarding passes belonging to someone else. Not a huge deal. My flight arrived to Toronto late and I arrived at the gate just as they were calling for final boarding. I went to the agent and gave her all of the documentation she asked for without comment as I was catching my breath. At the end of it all, she said, "you could be nicer you know" I asked what her problem was and that I had given her everything that she asked for and that she was not particularly nice either. The flight was terrible for business class. They had one menu with no options. The dinner was good, but breakfast was inedible. The seat was very comfortable and the flight attendants friendly. However, Air Canada has taken cost cutting in business class to a low. I connect to Qatar on a five hour flight. They had numerous menu options and better good. It is interesting how North Americans want to complain about the Middle Eastern carriers and their subsidies. However, the North American carriers get subsidies as well. Where they can't compete is service. If I am spending over $3000 on a business class ticket, and my choices are Air Canada or a Middle Eastern carrier, I would be a fool to spend my money on Air Canada. I wrote Air Canada and almost 4 weeks later have been given the courtesy of a response.

### "by far the worst airline in the world"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is by far the worst airline in the world. They sold multiple passengers seats on flights they don’t exist and left multiple passengers stranded in Toronto. I don’t understand how they can be in business when they defraud all their passengers.

### "in-flight crew were both attentive and professional"
Booked on-line a same day/one-way flight from Ottawa to Toronto on Easter Sunday. On-line booking and seat selection was normal although when the booking was made (just after lunch), there was only one flight for the remainder of the day. Booked a seat in Economy class and upgraded to Business Class on check-in at the airport. Security was moderately busy but once again, CATSA screening staff at Ottawa Airport were disinterested and not helpful (showed my boarding pass and was motioned to join the long economy queue, asked if that was the business line and then was motioned to join mid-way rather than being directed to the priority queue). After security, walked to the gate (Maple Leaf lounge at Ottawa is currently closed) and boarding was just commencing. Boarded quickly onto the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft and found my upgraded seat (4A) without issue. Flight departed on schedule. In-flight service consisted of a box lunch/snack along with a small water bottle, bag of pretzels, ear buds, promotional flyer about cleanliness protocols and sanitizing wipes. Seat was comfortable and in-flight crew were both attentive and professional. Flight arrived early and taxi in to the gate was quick. Disembarkation was efficient and I was able to exit the terminal to meet my ride without issue.

### "My experience with Air Canada has been horrible"
Not Verified |  My experience with Air Canada has been horrible. Very rude customer representatives on the phone and at the airport. On the flights is a different story. This morning of April 2021, I called to get information on how to change my flights due to the changes Covid has made. I was told to contact the airline Qatar Airways to make the changes. Furthermore he said, “the changes made is not Air Canada’s problem, it’s your problem”. I will never again fly with Air Canada. WestJet, I’d rather take their service for my future travels.

### "refuses to refund my money"
Upon arrival at Heathrow I requested an upgrade to business class as I had tripped on the escalator and hurt my back. I paid for my upgrade. In the business class cabin there was NO social distancing even though it was only one third full. The passengers behind me refused to wear their masks. The flight attendant requested they do so, at least 3 times. The electronics at my seat were not in working order and I kept drawing this to the attention of the attendant. I paid a lot of money for this upgrade and Air Canada refuses to refund my money. The people that refused to wear their masks were moved to a 2nd business class cabin and they had it all to themselves. They wouldn't even move me to a working seat.

### "Air Canada is truly a despicable airline"
Not Verified |  Air Canada is truly a despicable airline. The reviews of the Customer Support Team are incredibly low, and unfortunately, I have to agree with them. The support members are rude with an attitude, and the entire experience with the airline has been putrid from start to finish. Due to multiple flight cancellations, it has taken Air Canada over 3 months to process flight refunds (which are still not received) despite being offered the refund ticket months ago. And with the support team, there are a myriad of excuses as to why the funds have not been processed. No one on the support team is capable of assisting, response time is despicable, and even the booking process is a mess. I am uncertain if this is the case for international flights only, but the experience has been extremely disappointing.

### "every time I fly with Air Canada I land irate"
Not Verified |  Just spending my time waiting on my (yet again) delayed Air Canada flight writing negative reviews. Don’t have a lot of choice of airlines where I’m from and every time I fly with Air Canada I land irate. Cancelled flights, delayed flights (all the time), lost luggage, delayed luggage. Had it all. I also don’t understand how every other entity in Canada is mandated to “stay 6 feet apart” except flights. How does that make any sense?

### "Very bad service and customer support"
Not Verified |  Very bad service and customer support. They changed my flight once, so I changed it, understanding that there is a pandemic going on which is causing flights to change. Then they changed it again into one that is not convenient at all. Customer service was not helpful at all in solving the issue. The wait to reach a representative is bad enough, let alone the fact that they don't offer any practical or reasonable support. I do not recommend that anyone books with Air Canada.

### "please refund me my money"
I am messaging with an ardent request to refund my money 2660 cnd as the Air Canada flights (back and forth) that I had booked for 22 Jan 2021 have been cancelled (Attaching the itinerary as well). After waiting for 1 full hour to get through the call, I got an agent and I could not even complete my statement and the call was disconnected. It is not my fault that the flights are cancelled. Why should a Customer bear the expense? I am a single working woman working hard to sustain a decent life. Covid times have severely affected us as well and every penny matters! I request you to please refund me my money.

### "The main problem crops up with the IFE in the old cabin"
From a service perspective, Air Canada is great, both on ground, on telephone and in the air. Their staff are polite, professional, practical and very accommodating. The pilots are well trained and provide sufficient information to the passengers along the route. The aircrafts are properly maintained and cabins are sufficiently clean. The main problem crops up with the IFE in the old cabin. I have flown Air Canada domestic, transcontinental and international multiple times to be able to say that the IFEs on their old and new cabins are chalk and cheese. On the most recent flight(s), I flew on the old cabin(s). The IFEs in the old cabins are slow, unresponsive and have a rather strange choice of music and programs. The headphones don't always work in old cabins either, but given that the most interesting thing on the old IFE could be the flight map, you might not need them at all. The IFEs in new cabins, however, are far better. It's overall a good and safe full-service airline with a good network and value for money. Due to COVID restrictions, we did not have a full meal service, but pretzels and biscuits were provided.

### "this airline is absolutely shameful"
We returned from St-Lucia yesterday night, December 19th. It’s been 3 years now since we have flown with Air Canada. Due to our last few very bad experiences, we tried to avoid them at all costs. This time, we had no other choice than Air Canada to fly to Saint-Lucia. Three days before our return to Ottawa via Toronto, we notice on the AC application that our return flight will be delayed 2 hours, thus missing our connection in Toronto for Ottawa. They changed our flight to another time that was still impossible to catch. Arriving in Toronto late on Saturday night, the Air Canada employee was immediately firm about telling us they are not providing a hotel and meal voucher as they pretend it is "out of their control", they seem to have all the freedom to lie about what’s in or out of their control. To be honest we saw it coming, having experienced their completely non-existent customer relations in the past and after talking with some of their former employees (management level), it was our fear that we would face their abuse once more. Any other airline in the world would have treated this issue fairly (from experience). I am sure all Canadians would love to feel pride in our main airline and feel appreciated and be respected by a company that carries our flag around the globe. In reality, this airline is absolutely shameful, it abuses its customers every single day, and by the looks of it none of their employees are proud to represent this company either. As a Canadian that travelled around the world, the lack of service, appreciation and fairness from Air Canada is very obvious when comparing to any other airline. We strongly recommend to everyone to seek any other options possible prior to resulting in flying with this miserable company.

### "Air Canada came through"
Not Verified |  My wife and I booked flights through Flight Network but chose Air Canada as the carrier. We had to cancel our flight due to COVID-19 back in June. We went back and forth with Flight Network to try and get our Air Canada travel voucher (we were owed). Even Air Canada customer relations told us we had to go through the 3rd party provider to collect the voucher that Air Canada had already sent to them. We made a final plea with Air Canada to please cancel the travel voucher they sent to Flight Network and send directly to us. Air Canada came through. The customer service agent was very understanding and really came through for us. No more booking through Flight Network. We will book directly through Air Canada now. It really comes down to how Air Canada treated us. And although they've sometimes received bad reviews in the past, we really think they're turning a corner. Post COVID-19 when everyone in the world wants to travel like crazy, look out for Air Canada. Their planes will be full with customer service like we received.

### "declined our request for a full refund"
Air Canada cancelled our flights just two days after our booking citing COVID reasons, saying the route would no longer be flown, and then charged us over $USD800 in non-refundable cancellation fees. They cited the small print in their contract, but this flight was advertised as offering 'new flexibility' for passengers due to the uncertainty of COVID. They should not have sold tickets if they had not confirmed their capacity to fly to Australia and they are making money of passengers stranded in unfortunate circumstances due to the pandemic. Their in-house customer advocate reviewed the claim and declined our request for a full refund.

### "by far the worst airline I’ve ever dealt with"
This is by far the worst airline I’ve ever dealt with aside from Spirit. Their service at the airport moves at a glacial pace, they do absolutely nothing over the phone. And they don’t provide refunds on flights they’ve canceled! This company is an absolute joke. I’ve spoken to dozens of reps over the past ten months trying to get a refund and they simply don’t care. Please never fly with this horrendous airline.

### "Shame on you all"
A warning to those thinking of purchasing a ticket with Air Canada. They are in the practice of refusing to refund the purchase price even after they choose to cancel the flight. In these Covid days flights are frequently cancelled through lack of passenger capacity. Air Canada would have been aware of this before they posted the flight. They claim that this practice is consistent with other airlines policies. This is totally untrue. They also claim that the cancellation is due to uncontrollable circumstances. This is also totally untrue. Air Canada chose to cancel the flight. In any civilised country an action like this would be considered fraud but apparently not in Canada. Shame on you all.

### "Most unbelievable customer service"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight through Air Canada for our honeymoon for 10/26. We received a flight change email from Air Canada that they changed our flight to 10/24, our wedding date! So of course we could not make this change. They then emailed us and told us they completely cancelled the flight. We tried calling them multiple times to address this and kept getting a busy tone. Due to time constraints and not missing our honeymoon, we booked through another airline. We finally got a hold of customer support and they said that they can’t refund us because it was a “schedule change”. They cancelled the whole flight! That is not a schedule change that’s a cancellation. We are now almost $2k in the hole because Air Canada robbed us. Most unbelievable customer service I have ever experienced. Customers do not come first in their business model.

### "Seats are so cramped"
The Boeing 787 seat pitch and size of seats are miserable. Seats are so cramped, passengers have no place to stretch. Some of the seats are close to lavatories that passengers are uncomfortably close.

### "It's disgraceful and unfair"
I have 3 flights booked with Air Canada for Oct 2020. Because of the Pandemic I'm not aloud to leave my country. I had a 5 month trip planned starting 1st Aug that included 21 flights. Air Canada are the only airline not refunding my money back and are profiting from me during the 2020 Pandemic. It's disgraceful and unfair. Singapore Airlines, Finnair, Icelandair, Swiss, United, Hawaiian Air, Alaska Air, Delta and American Airlines are refunding back in full. Air Canada are deciding to profit from their customers instead.

### "staff went beyond and above"
Not Verified |  Montreal to Vancouver with Air Canada. I was very pleased by the amount of care I received from the staff. I needed assistance and the staff went beyond and above for caring. The food was good and there was lots of attention to hygiene and cleanliness.

### "told the money is coming""
Had booked a flight for mid April to fly to Ecuador. The flight was from Vancouver to Toronto, Toronto to Quito. COVID happened so they cancelled our flight from Toronto to Quito and back, There was no refund. We cancelled the new flight (we didn't want to go to Toronto for two weeks) and never got our money back. We took a $500 hit for cancelling but were still owed $900- we have a receipt saying this money would be sent to us. This was at the end of March. It is now the end of September. I have multiple times spent the 2+ hours on hold with them only to be told "the money is coming" and being given random numbers like "in 51 business days" or some other such nonsense. I get COVID happened and airlines had a whole bunch of people to reroute and refund and deal with but it has been 6 months. No emails have been answered and no phone calls have led to clear answers.

### "your safety is not their number one priority"
Man beside me refused to wear his mask properly the entire flight. He would simply slip it back on whenever the stewardess was looking. Eventually he fell asleep and I managed to point out that he was not properly wearing it (or even remaining in his own seat) and the stewardess said “he’s sleeping so..” then shrugged and walked away. So I got to spend my flight with a mask-less man invading my space and taking a full open mouth nap. Just know if you fly with Air Canada, your safety is not their number one priority. In my case, the safety of myself and other people on my flight was less important than one mans nap.

### "professional, helpful, attentive and friendly"
First long haul flight since Covid impacted travel. Check in smooth at T2 at Heathrow. Service on board to Vancouver was outstanding. The crew were professional, helpful, attentive and friendly throughout the journey. I was very impressed. Food satisfactory given the circumstances. Air Canada's IFE could be better with an improved selection of movies. However, overall, a very pleasant flight with an excellent in-flight crew.

### "luggage was not taken off the flight"
Not Verified | My luggage was not taken off the flight while I was stuck in immigration. I was not notified until 6 hours after my flight had left that my luggage was flown to Edmonton airport. I was not given an incident report to fill out, immigration at Toronto took my boarding passes from me! I am home 3 days now and am getting absolutely no information about my luggage. I know it is at Edmonton International airport! This is the second time my luggage has gone missing with Air Canada.

### "it was cancelled again"
I booked my flight out of China after COVID-19 hit. China had already officially announced to the public a one-flight-a-week per country per airline policy, but when Air Canada continued listing daily flights out, I believed that Canada must have been an exception. I called to ask questions, but apparently I didn't ask the right ones. My flight was cancelled, then I rebooked, then it was cancelled again. Air Canada wasn't able to fly even once weekly until mid August, after many other airlines had resumed doing so. I eventually had to book a flight out on a Chinese airline, and had to frantically rehome my kitty as a result of Air Canada's false promises. The company is refusing to issue me refunds even for these flights that they never could have expected to take off. I used to feel confident about flying Air Canada. Now I don't intend to ever do so again.

### "delays without compensation"
I've flown HKG-YVR-YEG multiple times and this is my first time flying out of Shanghai. The flights are never on time. Delays after delays without compensation, and whenever I go to the kiosk to ask them to put me on a different connecting flight, they are always reluctant and would tell me to contact Ctrip directly (where I originally booked my ticket). Once I specifically asked about my tagged bags when they put me on a different flight, and after they explained to me that bags are attached to the barcode of my new boarding pass and that I have nothing to worry about, I went home without my bags for two days. My entertainment system also didn't work for three hours.

### "They lost our bags"
Not Verified | They lost our bags and 4 days later nothing. Their call center is useless. The audio connection is frustratingly bad. Even when you can hear someone they can't provide any additional information other than what's online, which in my case was always incorrect. No way to contact actually baggage counters. The Air Canada rep told me it would be faster for me to drive 40min each way to the airport vs try to use the 1-800 number. The flight itself was delayed l, and in a 5hour flight we were given  water and pretzels. Never flying with them again.

### "credit of $350 only good for $43 dollars"
Air Canada changed the flight itinerary for a Toronto-Seattle flight, and I could no longer make the flight due to this change. They offered to convert the value of my flight ($350) into a credit that I could use at a later date. I thought this was great, and proceeded to apply the credit to a different flight (Toronto-Dublin) which costs $590 on the AirCanada website, taxes included (Image attached). I would've expected that my $350 credit would be applied to the new $590 flight, and I'd just have to pay the remaining balance of $240. This is not what happened. The credit of $350 was only good for $43 dollars on this new flight, and the rest of the credit vanished ($307), and I'm now at a net expense of $853 because I was charged an additional $546 "tax charge" for the new Dublin flight booking (on top of the remaining $307 credit value that couldn't be applied and doesn't exist anymore). I was not informed that it would have been better to use my credit for the same Toronto-Seattle route, instead of applying the credit to a new destination where the taxes aren't transferable. So after realizing this on my own, I then tried to cancel that new booking to Dublin and receive a refund for the $546, as it was still within 24 hours of the booking confirmation. This way I could keep my original $350 credit to save for a later date to use for Seattle specifically, and get full use of the credit value, and just book the Dublin flight separately on my own. However, they said this was also not possible, as a new booking made with a credit isn't the same as a regular booking, so the 24 hour rule doesn't apply, and I'm left short $307 in credit value that doesn't exist. I've contacted their customer relations department, and they've responded saying they cannot assist me. I've had multiple trip cancellations with other airlines, where my credits were kept and applied for the full value of the ticket. I don't understand how $350 dollars in credit only becomes $43 in usable valuable, while the rest goes down the drain. Don't advertise increased flexibility with credits and vouchers, when in fact they are imaginary and will leave you short hundreds of dollars. I hope this helps with other people who aren't sure what to do about a flight credit/ voucher with Air Canada.

### "compassion and professionalism"
Not Verified | I had flown back to Toronto for a family emergency and did not book a return flight. While attempting to book a flight home there were some issues and I ended up being billed for a ticket I did not need. After some back and forth and confusion I spoke with a woman named Betty from the Montreal office. She was extremely helpful, and very patient with me as this was a somewhat confusing issue. Adding the stress of this extra charge on top of my family emergency was obviously upsetting. She placed me on hold and when she returned had informed me everything was taken care of and I would be getting a refund. Thank you so much for your compassion and professionalism!

### "a regular average service"
Flown to Vancouver in the morning. onboard was very limited service due to covid-19 so I was fine with that. Great entertainment system- I meant many variety of choices to choose from so that was nice. During 5 hr flight, I watched some movies and it was great, no technical issues whatsoever. Airplane almost half full due to seating covid-19 restricting so didn't mind that as the middle seat next to me was empty. From the moment of checking in , boarding, enroute and to arrival, my overall personal impression was a regular average service.

### "turning me into a customer for life"
Not Verified |  I Booked a Ticket Through +1 855-948-3661 , I recently had a horrible experience with my luggage on a Air Canada flight but it was corrected right immediately. After coming home from a work trip, the weather wasn't great and I was in a hurry to get home to my fur baby. I got my luggage and it was soaked and I assumed it was from the rain ... but I was wrong. I smelled something a little funny but didn't think much of it since there was a lot of people around. I threw my luggage in my car and while driving I started getting bursts of fishy odor. I got home and opened my trunk and almost fell over by the scent of fish. I took my luggage out and opened it and everything inside was covered in a gray liquid. My stuff was ruined. I came right back to the airport and Sherry and Luis helped me out. It was really embarrassing walking through the airport smelling like fish but they were so kind. The scent was so strong we had to cover our noses and hold our breath as we went through what items needed to be reimbursed. Luis took me to get a new suitcase since mine needed to be thrown away and Sherry gave me a nice Air Canada duffel bag to help transfer over some shoes and purses I wanted to try and clean. While it was a big inconvenience after a long and tiring day, I was happy with the outcome of the situation. Thank you Sherry and Luis for helping me that day and turning me into a customer for life.

### "my flights kept on changing"
I booked a flight 5 months in advance, from the booking date to two weeks before departure my flights kept on changing until i had 8 flights overlapping. There was no contact from Air Canada about the flight changes, I thought it was a technical issue with the app but when the problem was not resolved I contacted customer service and was told I would have to stay over night at my own expense at connecting airports on both directions. So my flight I paid extra for, to be as short as possible, was originally 6 hours there and back became 28 and 22 hours with no other option. It took 3 days of contacting customer support to get a reasonable flight rebooked. They wanted an extra 1200$ per ticket to change which would be triple of my original ticket and would take more than double the travel time. At multiple airports the counter staff tried moving me and my wife to opposite sides of the plane and called me selfish for not agreeing to their terms. Saying "you are so me me me" on top of the poor customer service the policy for free seat selection during 24 hour checkin changed and I had to pay an extra 98$ to sit next to my wife again! The Only positive experience was the plane it was quite nice and on board crew were very polite.

### "trying to book with this credit"
Not Verified |  My flight from Edmonton to Las Vegas in May was cancelled due to Covid-19 and when I asked for a refund they refused, and all i could do was accept it and take the future credit. Now that I am trying to book with this credit of 407$ i cant book a 404$ flight due to some stupid flight / tax that they couldn't explain. They wanted another 103$ from me to book the flight totaling 510$. The agent put me on hold several times to try to get me an answer how 407$ credit cant book flights for 404$ and why i have to pay more when i had enough credit. He couldnt. I cant believe they can take your money and then not let you spend it how you like on another flight. Air Canada Flight from Edmonton to Las Vegas October 2 to 6 right now is 404$ for a flex flight on the way and a standard flight on the way back. They want me to pay 510$! I escalated the case 2 days ago and was told 24hrs and usually sooner for a call back, its now 48 hours.

### "We were offered credit"
Due to Covid-19, we were not permitted to go to Canada from the USA to take our flight from Toronto to Vancouver. We were offered credit. We are all high risk for Covid and simply wanted a refund since it may be years or possibly never before we travel. We were denied. A law was passed in the USA that required US airlines to give a refund. Canada has chosen not to recognize this.

### "They would only give me credits"
I was supposed to fly Beirut to Boston via London and Toronto with Middle east Airlines and Air Canada. I did not receive an email that the flight was cancelled. I had to call and they would not refund the money. They would only give me credits. I asked her to send me an email saying the flight was cancelled instead she sent me an email giving me credits back. The funny part is a ticket from Boston to Lebanon cost is like 1/10 of the cost and the rest is tax. So technically you get only credits for the ticket and the tax is dependent. I have filed for a claim and will no longer fly nor do I advise anyone to fly with them.

### "will only give us a credit"
We booked a family vacation from Indianapolis to Montego Bay via Toronto on Air Canada. The airline cancelled our upcoming flight and will only give us a credit to use for each of our 6 people to use in the next 18 months. I have requested a refund.

### "Air Canada will not refund airfares"
Air Canada will not refund airfares despite change of flight and entitled refund as per their policy. I like many other families are struggling to seek out refunds and Air Canada is no exception. In fact their customer service is by far the worst with them declining several requests to provide us a refund. This is despite Air Canada changing our flights which was booked for 23rd June 2020 to an evening flight making it more than 3hrs different from our original 1.30pm flight. Air Canada and their policy states that a refund is entitled if delays are longer than 3hrs. Expect lots of cut and paste responses from their website along with them considering the matter closed despite repeated requests to consider current hardship circumstances.

### "your flight got cancelled"
My recent flight with Air Canada on March 17th, 2020. I was returning from Nadi via Los Angeles to Vancouver. When I arrived in Los Angeles tried checking in at the kiosk machine would not work so got help with Air Canada personnel standing at the kiosk. He also could not do it so send me to the check in counter. The lady at the counter after sometime on the computer said so your flight got cancelled a month ago and email was sent to all the passengers and told me to contact my travel agent in Vancouver. I tried Calling my travel agent left 3 messages no answer she was so rude and untruly. I went back to the same lady on the counter and said our bags are already checked in she told us to go to terminal 5 to talk to the Air Canada agents to get our bags. On the way to terminal 5 I started thinking, I did not book my tickets a month ago and I did not receive any emails from air Canada. At terminal 5 the agent said we have to go back to terminal 6 they would be responsible for our luggage. On the way back to terminal 6 I asked my son who also was travelling with me lets take a look at the reader board with all the flight information, that’s when I saw that our flight got cancelled and also had our flight number. I went back to the check in counter at demanded to speak with a supervisor and first she refused after arguing with load voices she agreed to get the supervisor. I waited for almost 25 minutes before a supervisor approached. I was so upset told the supervisor please pay our accommodation, transportation cost and meals if you want us to stay in Los Angles. The supervisor said wait and after doing some work on the computer she told me that we can get a flight at 11.00 pm same day our original flight was at 3 pm with no food allowance. Air Canada should have told the trued that due to covid-19 our flight got cancelled and we are working to get you on board another flight as seats come available. The 11 pm flight to Vancouver was not full had lots of empty seats available. This is my second experience in LA please train your staff how to talk to customers this is a service industry.

### "I missed the boarding call"
In December 2019 Air Canada cancelled my return ticket home while I was in Colombia. The return ticket included one domestic leg (Cartagena to Bogota) then two more legs, first to Toronto and then Vancouver. I missed the boarding call for the third leg of my incoming ticket so Air Canada, without even contacting me, cancelled all three of my flights home. After I missed my final short flight from Bogota to Medellin, I purchased another ticket from Latam Airlines, the local carrier for my last flight. I spent six days using international minutes trying to reach Air Canada from Medellin. I tried everything under the sun to get a human voice on the line. Finally a friend of mine in Canada reached them, and after two and a half hours, got my flights home (the ones I’d already paid for) reinstated for $150. The money is the least of my concerns. The fact that Air Canada was unreachable is unprofessional. Air Canada also left my luggage in Toronto and took their sweet time getting it to me.

### "give me a credit voucher only"
Air Canada cancelled my original booked flight return August 16th ticket and suggested I fly out 4 hours drive away as they have cancelled my flight. I asked for a refund and they refuse. Said will give me a credit voucher only. They changed my flight and will not return my funds as there offer is not reasonable. I will be out of pocket to get a hotel in London England, and train tickets to get down to that London airport. I am in Northern England for a wedding the later part of my trip before returning home. It’s the customer service and lack of empathy from the customer service and the company. Calls keep getting disconnected after waiting for hours on hold. There customer relations returns your emails with the most generic email. Along with not answering private messages on FB.

### "credit for future use"
Air Canada refuses to provide refunds even though they cancelled my flights. I have no option other than them giving me a credit for future use. I don't recall agreeing to this and am disputing with my credit card company.

### "unprepared for Covid-19"
Horrible customer service and completely unprepared for Covid-19 crisis. Instead of setting up an easy online portal to deal with Covid-19 related requests like other airlines, Air Canada decided to make it's customers jump through hoops to get a refund or a credit towards another flight. Although I've cancelled my flight for May and have received confirmation that my cancellation request has been received, I was emailed a copy of my tickets because the airline thought I was still going. Now I have no idea what the status of my refund/credit is because it may take up to 120 days before I hear back from customer service.

### "staff were great and very pleasant"
Not Verified |  Departed Toronto to London on December 12, 2019 morning flight and returned London to Toronto on January 1, 2020 AC 857. I have to say check in, boarding process, in flight on all flights were well organized and quick, all staff were attentive when needed but left you when needed. All staff were great and very pleasant. We fly Air Canada regularly and sometimes things go wrong these are usually out of control of the staff and our experience is they are always professional and friendly. Air Canada you know your business keep doing what you do as you are good at it!

### "Ida’s care and hard work"
Not Verified |  I am writing a review about a agent at the ticket counter. Her name is Ida. My ticket didn’t go through the night before when I purchased it on line and the next morning westjet has told me unfortunately had no more flights available. I went to Air Canada counter and Ida worked for a very long time to get me to Winnipeg that day. You see my dad was not doing well and was given only 48 or more hours. Because of Ida’s care and hard work I was able to get to Winnipeg then drive up to Swan River and made it to see my dad that evening. He then passed away during the middle of the night. So I am so grateful and thank full and if anyone knows Ida from Kelowna airport Air Canada please let her know.

### "Avoid Air Canada because you can’t trust them"
Not Verified |  Air Canada refuses to refund cost of the ticket for which they canceled both legs. Outbound flight was canceled and inbound flight was rerouted and delayed. Air Canada refuses to refund the cost of the ticket and wants to issue a credit with the airlines. With very limited flights, costly fees, and such terrible customer service I refuse to accept the credit and will dispute the charge with the credit card company since I feel Air Canada is not honoring the ticket which was purchased in November. I had also purchased a ticket for my son on the same flight out but with a different airline, and that airline issued a refund with no hassle. Avoid Air Canada because you can’t trust them.

### "I cannot get a refund"
My flight in October 2019 from Toronto to London was cancelled at the last moment and I had to pay 80 dollars for a bus back to London. I have been trying to get compensation and a refund since then and got a email saying I cannot get a refund.

### "the seats were comfortable"
Not Verified |  We had westjet cancel our flights so we booked on Air Canada. Kahului airport is old and needs renovations, we waited an hour to drop our bags off. The staff were very kind though. Seriously Air Canada one queue for two fully loaded aircraft. We got through the nightmare that is security but that’s not air canada. The plane had a brand new livery on it but the interior had not been renovated, but the seats were comfortable and had leg room. There was no service due to covid-19 but we expected that. Air Canada’s IFE is top notch though for selection. We got there though and it was not terrible definitely a decent option.

### "flight does not count as canceled"
Not Verified |  My wife and I were going to have our honeymoon in St. Lucia. Flights into St. Lucia were canceled due to the COVID-19 scare. Our travel involved Air Canada, American Airlines, and Airbnb. American Airlines and Airbnb gave full refunds without any questions and no hassle. Air Canada was a completely different story. Air Canada was willing to work with me to receive a refund for a flight that no longer exists. According to the employee I spoke with, the flight does not count as canceled because it was canceled more than 48 hours in advance. So the flight that I bought the ticket for no longer exists, but according to Air Canada, the flight was not canceled. This was a very eye-opening experience.

### "will not give us our money back"
Not Verified |  We booked a ticket from Edmonton to Rome for May 2020 that we saved 2 years to be able to go, now Air Canada as cancelled the tickets and they will not give us our money back only a credit. We are both in our 60’s and not working right now due to this virus, we need that money to live. But unfortunately, Air Canada does not care and as no compassion and will not do a refund. This is my money I should have the legal right to decide if and when I want to travel. Air Canada I always thought you were the best, but I will do nothing but bad mouth from this day forward in any way I can.

### "thanked for their efforts"
Not Verified |  Air Canada flew an empty plane to Cancun last week to provide passage home to a number of people, including my wife and me, stranded in Mexico. The flight from Cancun to Toronto was only half full. While AC did not make any money on this flight, they are certainly to be thanked for their efforts on our behalf. Well done to our national airline. We were certainly grateful that you came, got us and delivered us safely back to Canada. Thank you, Merci beaucoup!

### "I did not get my luggage"
Toronto to Philadelphia. I had to go on a business trip on March 19, 2020. when I got my boarding pass in Toronto, they told me that I would receive my bag in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, when I arrive there I did not get my luggage, I had my laptop, iPad and other necessary stuff in it. I was in the airport the whole day, and even the next day my bag was not there. They were very rude, and I had to cancel my trip and come back to Toronto since I was not able to continue my trip without my belongings. I received my bags after six days with my lock broken and belongings were mixed ups. I am very disappointed in the customer service and service provided by Air Canada.

### "Self serving policies"
Not Verified | Toronto to Vienna. I am Super Elite with Air Canada. I fly over 100,000 miles a year each year. Air Canada cancelled half of my flight (from Toronto to Vienna) but not the return flight. I called Super Elite desk to address the issue. The person on the phone just kept reading their new policies they put in place and giving me regular answers, I've asked to speak to the manager. Manager called me within and hour. I have explained my situation to the manager and it was silent. I thought may be call got disconnected. I have asked if anyone is still here to what manager was very rude, unprofessional. The manager replied: "I was waiting till you will be finally done talking". I was shocked. I didn't say anything. He didn't say nothing for over a minute. I then told him that I am taping his silence, waste of time and horrible treatment of other people. He screamed so loudly how dare I to tape him. Called me names and hung up. It is perfectly legal in Canada for me to tape a call. It is also helpful because when I called back Air Canada they said they will not give me even the name of who I spoke to. I paid money for service. It wasn't delivered. Why should they get to keep my money during this time. A big company keeps money of people who need it now more than ever. What a horrible company. Self serving policies.

### "they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together"
Vancouver to Hong Kong. First things first, I flew business class after Covid-19 measures were implemented, so I came in expecting reduced cabin service, and that was what I got. That being said, even with all the precautionary measures, I was surprised that they were still able to put a somewhat decent service together. Air Canada uses the B/E Aerospace (Now Collins Aerospace) Super Diamond seats, which arrange passengers in a reverse herringbone configuration. It's a pretty standard product, though I must say I really like the colour scheme that Air Canada uses. It just looks really clean and the colours contrast nicely. Due COVID-19, I requested the upgrade to business as a precautionary measure, and I wasn't disappointed. Even with reduced cabin services, it was still a nice experience. Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you. It was still business quality (veal from Hawksworth), but they simply didn't give you that picture perfect plating that is so greatly appreciated. Despite the lack of a pillow, the seats were still quite comfortable, though it could still do with more lumbar support, and the lack of a pillow made the sleeping position a tad awkward because my head was dipped backwards even with the power adjustable headrest. Service could admittedly be a bit more polished, though to be fair, part of this definitely has to do with the COVID-19 precautions. I should probably try upgrading again when this blows over. I do appreciate how quiet the cabin was, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the food quality was not compromised as a result of their infection control measures.

### "Air Canada were pretty good"
Not Verified |  We flew out Heathrow - Calgary return, Calgary - Kelowna and Castlegar - Calgary. Air Canada were pretty good (apart from dealing with my wife's lactose intolerence Business Class). Having used their On My Assistance this worked really well when we were stuck an extra night in Castlegar and promised an overnight food allowance. So having paid in UK pounds and Canadian Dollars why pay this compensation by a US Dollar cheque. This will cost a lot to cash here in England.

### "not good enough"
Not Verified | Toronto to Palm Springs. Due to what is happening in the world at the moment (COVID 19), Air Canada cancels the flight and refuses to give a full refund. Other airlines are doing it, this nonsense "oh you will have a credit" is not good enough! People cannot afford their bills, no one needs to be having credit with your company during a pandemic! How selfish of this company, they are holding onto our money like little kids. Have some respect for everyone during this time of need and do the right thing! I will never fly with them ever again, how disgusting! !

### "Air Canada would not refund our tickets"
Due to what is happening in the world at the moment (COVID 19), we had to cancel our flight as Canada's borders were closed to non residents. Air Canada would not refund our tickets. The only option given to us was a credit which had to be used by 31st December 2020 (return flight completed by this date). We had friends who were travelling to Canada on different airlines at the same time. They all received a full refund (from Qantas, Air New Zealand, Virgin and Hawaiian). They either received a full refund or a credit to be used up to 12 months from cancellation.

### "service was limited due to the outbreak"
Vancouver to Brisbane. Our Skiing holiday in Canada our holiday was cut short by the start of the Corona Virus outbreak. We boarded the flight to be told the service was to be limited due to the outbreak. No drinks were offered and when dinner was served and a drink offered the choices were boxed apple or orange juice or water. I asked for a glass of wine  to be told that hadn’t I heard the announcement. Next I asked for a tea or coffee same response no because of the corona virus I inquired what the virus had to do with this and was not answered. There was no choice of meal and the food served to me was disgusting. Eventually the meal was removed so I  asked if I could have a blanket to be told again no and hadn’t I heard the announcement.

### "we really do appreciate doing this"
Munich to Toronto. We were in Europe (Germany) on vacation and due to the situation had to cut our trip short. We were not able to leave Germany as borders closed around us and we felt we needed to go back to Canada. We did have to pay $400 per person extra (family of 5) and that was unfortunate. A huge thank you to all the staff at check in and on the plane. You helped us get home safe and treated us very well even though the circumstances were not great. We want you to know that we really do appreciate doing this. Please don’t get knocked down by all the negative comments, no one knew this would happen and we are in this together. Thank you again from the Linde family especially to the staff on AC 847 from Munich to Toronto March 20!! !

### "see $ before true loyalty"
I booked a flight from Amsterdam to Toronto for my mother to travel on March 22 2020. I requested to cancel the flight due to the virus situation, but as my ticket was not cancelable I was informed that I would lose the value of the ticket. It is sad that they see $ before true loyalty. After been on hold for 2 Hours customer service been very rude to me .. they hang up on me.

### "shameless and predatory business"
Not Verified | Buenos Aires to Toronto. The Govt. of Canada issues a travel advisory at the mist of the Coronavirus and asking people to get back to Canada asap. On Air Canada website they are so humane, offering a one-time flight rescheduling at no extra cost. Nice, I would say until I call, to find out that on an $850 already paid ticket they want an extra $389! By going home earlier! Last year they also wanted to charge for a rescheduled ticket originally $960 an extra $650! By cancelling and buying a new ticket actually was cheaper! This is an immoral, bottom of food chain aggressively shameless and predatory business practice low life exploiting company (or maybe just the CEO?) and they shouldn't even exist!

### "not reimburse you when you cancel"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. Do not take a vacation package with Air Canada they give Credit and they do not reimburse you when you cancel. Even if you have cancelation insurance. I would never book another package with them.

### "couldn't have been more helpful"
Dusseldorf to Saskatoon via Frankfurt. I wanted to change my flight back to Germany in order to be able to fly directly to Frankfurt, rather than via London. The support at Air Canada Saskatoon couldn't have been more helpful. They changed my flights, booked my seats and din't charge me anything. Thank you, Air Canada!

### "I can't make change online"
Not Verified |  On February 14 I bought a ticket to Bradley from Halifax, but because of coronavirus emergency, I have to rebook my ticket. I tried to re-book my ticket (bought before March 04th, and trip before April 30). Air Canada is not able to serve customers by phone, and I can't make change online because KAYAK was selling my ticket. KAYAK is not contactable, or Air Canada. I have two choices: lose money or go to air port and try there.

### "level of service remains very good"
Flew from Vancouver to Hong Kong and back with AC in business class. AC's level of service on international flights remains very good. Both flights left on time. Seats are of the pod style and convert into beds which allows for comfortable sleeping on this long flight. Food is excellent. Good selection of beverages. IFE offer broad selection of Hollywood and international films and HBO television. A couple of suggestions for improvement. While the attention from the flight attendants was good, they didn't offer to assist with making up the bed as the staff on many airlines do. for example, Turkish and most Asian carriers. Second, on the return flight no announcement was made with respect to claiming luggage in Vancouver if one is travelling on The requirements vary - on flights from Europe or Narita, the baggage is sent on to one's final destination, whereas on flights from HKG one has to collect the luggage. I spoke to the senior flight attendant about this and he showed me the manual they had on-board which advises them as to the protocol, but still no announcement was made. It would be a simple thing to do and would help to avoid confusion for passengers.

### "ticket was not cancelable"
I booked a flight from Montreal to London at the end of April 2020. I requested to cancel the flight due to the virus situation, but as my ticket was not cancelable I was informed that I would lose the value of the ticket. It is sad that they see $ before true loyalty,

### "Service was poor"
Toronto to Delhi in January 2020. Seats were very tight for i am a slim man 145 lbs. Service was poor I tried to call an attendant 3-4 times nobody showed up.

### "cancellation was beyond their control"
Washington to Quebec City via Montreal. We boarded the flight, but while we were awaiting takeoff we had to evacuate the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting a couple of hours for counter assistance, we were rebooked for another flight. We were advised that we could not continue on to Quebec that night, but would be rebooked for a flight the next day. Unfortunately, the flight was also delayed again and we arrived quite late When we arrived in Montreal the counter agents deliberated over whether we qualified for lodging as we had been promised, and we received a lecture on Air Canada’s cancelation policies. We were eventually provided hotel and meal vouchers, given directions to the shuttle, and confirmed our reservations for the flight for the next day. Our flight was cancelled the next morning due to weather, and we received an email notification that we were rescheduled for a flight two days later. We called Customer Service to see if we could get an earlier flight; the representative informed us we were scheduled for the earliest flight he could get us on to Quebec City. Since we would not have had any time 8n Quebec we decided to cancel our vacation and requested return flights Our return flight was delayed due to “Crew Availability Issues”. This delay would cause us to miss connecting flight in Ottawa. We immediately contacted the Air Canada agent at the boarding desk, who rescheduled us onto a direct flight to our home. Our Air Canada experience can be summarized as such: two flight cancellations, one for mechanical issues and one weather related; three delays, causing us to miss connections; cancellation of our Quebec Winter Carnival vacation plans; computer issues, and a stressful experience for my wife and me I think you can agree our experience with Air Canada was not universally positive. I think it is important to emphasize that if our original flight had not been cancelled for mechanical issues we would have arrived in Québec City before the snowstorm and enjoyed our vacation. We filed a claim with Air Canada for our (first) cancelled flight based on your policy of recompense for cancelled and delayed flights. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 15% discount on our next Air Canada flight. We have requested reimbursement for the Montreal to Quebec and return leg of our trip that we could not take. Their official response was to claim the flight cancellation was beyond their control, but offered us a 25% discount on our next Air Canada flight.

### "had a bad experience"
Not Verified | Denver to Casablanca via Montreal. I am not the only one who traveled on Air Canada and had a bad experience, my family and friends also been travel with them and they had such an awful experience. Do you know that they never answer their customer service phone calls? Yes never! I have been trying for 3 months now but still no answer. I sent emails and also still no answers. There are no ways to communicate with them. They take your money and they let you figure things out!! Please do not travel with them!

### "no winter clothes and baggage"
Before we left for our trip at the beginning of February flights were cancelled due to avoiding China, which is understandable but we were unable to call anyone from Air Canada due to their higher than normal call volume and were unable to put-on hold, just completely hung up on. We lost all of our selected seating that we had picked and ended up with not the seats we had selected. My food was garbage. On the way home our last of 3 flights was cancelled and we were stranded in Toronto for two days. We were unable to speak to anyone regarding our baggage and how to re book flights. I have a hard time believing this as we are in Canada and there are storms all the time. The was completely unacceptable. Returning to the airport the next morning to hopefully retrieve our baggage we found out that our bags had been forwarded to Winnipeg. So we have no winter clothes and baggage for the remainder of the 2 days in Toronto in February. Still one week later and you are unable to contact anyone from Air Canada by phone with not even being able to be on hold. They redirect you to their website which also gives you the run around. You need to increase your staff to deal with all the problems that you incur.

### "I left a laptop at my gate"
Tokyo Narita to Vancouver. I left a laptop at my gate in Japan. I called Japanese customs, they found it and were holding it with a 4 digit reference number. I called different Air Canada customer service and lost and found numbers numerous times, filled out lost item forms, and went to the airport to speak with them in person. They were unable to do anything to get it back to me. My only option was to fly back to Japan and get it myself. They wouldn't help me with a discounted flight. Mediocre comfort for a cheap flight. I had decent flight attendants on the flights. Adjustable darkness window tint was a nice feature

### "I asked for a food voucher"
Montreal to Toronto. After boarding we were asked to deboard the plane as the weather conditions in Toronto were bad. All flights to Billy Bishop Toronto were cancelled. I was automatically rescheduled for a flight at 6 in the morning for the next day. On the reassurance of a customer service agent from Air Canada that seats might be available for an earlier flight to Toronto Pearson, I stood in line for 1.5 hours trying to get on an plane back home. I was put on standby for a 5 PM flight at 4:30 PM and asked to run to the gate. I obviously was not put into that flight. Then they put me on standby for a 6 PM flight at 5:15. No food or water was offered to me. 4 hours of running around and not until I got mad was I even heard. When I asked for a food voucher my request was not heard. Thank you nothing Air Canada.

### "I was told that it was too late"
We weren’t allowed off the connecting plane for an hour. My connecting flight was delayed, but I made it to the gate. I was told that it was too late. Then I found out that plane was delayed even more! But it was too late for me to get on it. All the other flights are full for the evening. Customer service didn’t care and didn’t help.

### "The service was good"
Delhi to Vancouver. The aircraft was very new, there was a little mess on the floor of my seat, which i alerted to the flight attendant. Unfortunately, they could not completely remove this and i was to take this seat or move to another seat (no window). The food was awesome and  really tasty. The service was good and they didnt really do anything wrong. However, the flight attendants did not seem to smile much. Not sure why the entertainmement system was not available till a while into the flight. Otherwise, it was a good flight.

### "we were relatively surprised"
Not Verified |  I have to say that we were relatively surprised on a recent return trip from Sydney to Vancouver and back. The departures were within 10 minutes of planned take-off times, and arrivals were either on-time or early. Check-in at both airports was very straight-forward and special thanks to the lovely ground staff lady at Vancouver who helped with our self check-in / bag drop at the airport. The crew did their job but lack the polish and personal attention to detail that you receive with the likes of Emirates and Qatar (which is one of the reasons why they are among the worlds best airlines, and Air Canada isn't). We flew Premium Economy and I'm glad we did as I felt sorry for any passengers flying in economy in a full plane on the return flight. The food service in PE was poor with rubbery, burnt omelette, rock hard bread rolls and tasteless chicken on the return route - not helped by being offered only one small glass of wine. While the entertainment system was very good and extremely easy to navigate, the earphones offered in PE were next to useless. The provision of toilets on the aircraft was rather disproportionate with 5 lavatories for 260 economy / premium economy passengers against 3 for 40 business passengers. We chose these flights because we booked 7 months in advance and got a very good deal plus the flights were direct.

### "Staff incredibly rude"
Toronto to Chicago. Staff was incredibly rude. I had my bag measured earlier in security and they said it was ok. The gate agent, however, wouldn’t let me carry it on, saying I could have had the tag that says it was measured on my bag for awhile. So she effectively called me a liar when I tried to say it was given to me today. The flight also left about 1.5 hours late. They didn’t give info as far as what was going on. I will try not to fly Air Canada again if I am able.

### "take care of their customers"
San Francisco to Toronto. I was flying with Air Canada and checked in my hand luggage at San Francisco Airport as requested by the Airline staff at the boarding time. When I got home, I realized my tiny little Osmo Pocket camcorder was missing. I reported the Air Canada lost/found department as soon as I realized that I have lost my camcorder. The Airline took every attempt to check for the lost item and finally they reimbursed the full cost of the camcorder even though there was no proof that I lost it. This indicates how well they take care of their customers.

### "impossible to contact them"
Whitehorse to Munich via Vancouver / Toronto. Flight attendants were rude and inattentive to me. It is impossible to contact them. For the last three months I have been trying to call them and each time the message says you cannot leave a message and call back later. Unfortunately I have 2 more international flights booked with them and need to contact them, however this is impossible.

### "a refund of these fees"
Vancouver to Brisbane. Exit row ticket was purchased for travel for my very tall son and myself for the long haul flight to find that when ticketed, my son was seated behind me not in the exit row. The plane was  full so there was no way to accommodate him anywhere - they requires you to pay extra for these seats which had been done almost six months prior to the flight and then not honoured. Upon return I have been emailing customer service for a refund of these fees for a seat that was not provided and a month later am yet to receive any correspondence (let alone any refund).

### "Good flights overall"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Vancouver. My experience with Air Canada was pleasurable. I flew out on the 3rd Feb 2020 to Vancouver and I was made very comfortable once the attendants were made aware of my situation. I would not consider the staff to be overly friendly other than that. My flight coming back on the 13th Feb 2020 was horrific due to me becoming ill whilst in the air. The flight attendant that took care of me was Isabelle and she is a credit to your airline. She was very attentive towards me and kept checking on me regularly. Good flights overall.

### "poor customer service"
Air Canada cancelled my flight just because of less demand on that particular flight. No compensation was given or rescheduling was made. It was even impossible to contact Air Canada customer service. No one ever picked up phone after holding for over an hour. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to fly with Air Canada’s. Extremely poor customer service and not cheap anyways. Luckily I was able to purchase another ticket with Cathay Pacific!

### "crew very polite and attentive"
New Delhi to Vancouver. This flight was very impressive, the kind of flight where you would love to fly AC again. We were warmly greeted and directed to our seats. The biz class seats are much nicer from when we last flew them 6 years ago. There is more room and more storage space and a mattress pad as well. We both managed too get comfortable sleep at the beginning of this 14.5 hr. flight. The food was very good and plentiful. I slept through breakfast so th FA'S whipped up a snack of cheeses, chicken Tikka and a nice Cognac to go with it. Our lunch was amazing. I had lamb chops, salad, and mashed with a nice chilled Molson and then there was desert, a fluffy butterscotch torte, cheeses and ice cream, and a Couvasier Cognac to follo and Lavazza coffee. The IFE system was very easy to use and had a lot of options for movies, TV, music, etc. too many to list and the hand held device was easy to use. The flight crew were very polite and attentive too and I had a chance to speak with them during a slow moment they had and they were so nice. We have flown other top rated carries such as ANA, Thai, Asiana, Emirates, Turkish and Cathay Dragon but this one AC flight tops them all. Bravo! Well done!

### "made us wait almost 4 hours"
My last experience was a flight from Toronto to Mumbai. They made us wait almost 4 hours in the plane before taking off. They gave us mini oatmeal bars to help us wait, and half glass of water. They blame external circumstances (last time was: not enough employees to defrost the plane). Even for very simple flights like Montreal - NYC or Montreal - Miami they are late. Last time I went to Miami, flight delayed of 6 hours. Last time I went to NYC (1 hour flight), flight delayed of 2 hours. Don’t bother bringing a carry on: they never have space for them. They’ll ask you to check in your bag anyway and you’ll have to wait for it at the airport tray. Only positive thing I would say is that employees are generally very affable. It’s truly not their fault.

### "our seats were changed"
Not Verified | Toronto to Rome via London. Air Canada treats Aeroplan members as second class citizens I am posting this warning to all those you fly with Air Canada and who use air miles to book flights. Air Canada clearly discriminates amongst its passengers. This is now my second experience and hence definitive confirmation of these discriminatory practices. I recently booked a flight to Europe from Toronto using my aeroplan miles. Upon booking my 2 flights I went through the seat selection process, selected seats and paid $125 each for that privilege. The payment was processed by Air Canada and written confirmation received of those specific seat allocations via email. Weeks later I received an “Air Canada – SEAT CHANGE” notification, arbitrarily moving our seats from Row 18 (seats bought and paid for – for extra legroom due to a leg issue I have) to Row 33. and then said I would be refunded the seat selection fees. Completely arbitrary and not honoring the initial seat purchase! Since this was the second time this has happened to me, (the first time being much worse, which I will explain later on in this message) I had to speak out. I immediately emailed Air Canada after trying to get a hold of their customer service Dept – advised by an automated call that the wait time was more than 1.5 hrs - really? Maybe this is a factor of the significant quantum of customer complaint volume. I then received the token automated response to my submission form Air Canada “we will address your concern within 30 days”. Hence my public action here! As noted this is the second time this has happened. In 2018, on flights to/from Miami for attending a family wedding, I had booked 4 seats using Aeroplan miles and paid full fare for one seat (full-fare seat for my disabled father) in upgraded seating. We booked almost 8 months in advance, with the express purpose of early booking, being getting our seats assigned together so as to assist my disabled father on/off the plan and supporting him during the flights. Eight months early! All our seat selections were confirmed in writing to us by Air Canada at that time. Again, just before the flight (a week before) we get a notification that our seats were changed. Let me clarify this point - only our Aeroplan booked seats were changed! Not my father’s full-fare seat! I called to complain, they said it just happens. It was too close to the flight to seek any other remedy. In the end, it left us sitting in the back of the plane and my father sitting alone with strangers and without support to deal with his disability! Unbelievable! After our return, I complained through proper AC channels to ascertain the genesis of the change notice, highlighting the blatant fact that only the seats booked with air miles were changed and not full-fare seat. The AC response again was, it happens! The offered me a 25% discount coupon for a future flight. I don’t want coupons! I want honest, fair and non-discriminatory service from a Canadian company. Disgraceful! Now this has happened again and cannot stay silent as it is now clear beyond any doubt that Air Canada discriminates against its passengers. There is one level of service for full-fare passengers and another for Aeroplan members who use air miles to book flights. I encourage all others who have experienced this type of discriminatory treat to rise up and make Air Canada take notice and correct their business practices.

### "Poor customer service"
Toronto to Edmonton. Our flight is delayed for more than 3 hours now, and my husband and I spoke to customer rep separately and 1 answered because of weather condition and gates are full. The other one told me it’s because gates are full. She didn’t blame the weather condition when I informed her that our other family member already left for Edmonton via WestJet. The refused to give us compensation for food/meal as it’s not their fault “ it’s the airport's fault”. So, I called the airport’s customer support and told me there’s no such thing as “gates are full”. Poor customer service Air Canada and Toronto Pearson airport. Where do we turn to now?

### "Mexico City staff is short-tempered"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Winnipeg via Toronto. Purchased ticket in November. Checked in at Mexico City at 12:00. No seat assigned in final leg. After 4 hours on airport was finally assigned last row middle seat. Wouldn’t change it to a different seat, even thigh when I hit in the plane there were multiple seats available further forward in the plane. The entire Mexico City staff is short-tempered, overworked, stressed out, angry and blames the customer for their shortfalls, as in “you should have come to the gate earlier” - as noted, 4 hours in the airport.

### "problem with missing extra luggage"
Frankfurt to Calgary. Cabin crew and inflight services were quite decent. I did have some problem with my missing extra luggage. The claims department did not handle the claim fairly. They did pay a claim of $500 which is half the cost of the item i had in the missing luggage. The first sector flight was with Lufthansa from Port Harcourt to Frankfurt.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Not Verified | Saskatoon to Frankfurt via Calgary. Not the first time and won't be the last time. Air Canada is by far one of the worst airlines that sometimes I have no choice but to fly with. Poor food, customer service, delays, lost luggage all are daily routine with this carrier. If you have any option other than Air Canada to fly anywhere, take it. I do the same!

### "poor hospitality"
Not Verified | Dubai to Toronto. Poor Service, on a 14.5-hour-long journey they hardly asked for drinks twice. I kept calling the staff using the button which was getting switched off again and again without any show. Finally, I had to go to them for water. Their staff don't take their job seriously - poor hospitality. One time when I asked for water, she said that they are working very hard to deliver food and drinks to the passengers, however, I got the drink and food after 1.5 hours of wait.

### "delayed by another 4 hours"
Toronto to Delhi. I wonder how this airline with poor standard and worst customer service get to the top rate in North America. Their website systems are getting upgraded for several months and customer calls reach nowhere. On top of all, in my recent international flight, the airline didn't load any baggage of economy class passengers and none of them notified in a 14 hrs flight that got delayed by another 4 hours. Upon arrival, passengers were shocked to know their baggage didn't get loaded at all. How this airline is expecting them to plan their stay or arrange onward travel without baggage? One among 100s of stranded passengers.

### "regret trying to use Air Canada"
Not Verified | Kelowna to Calgary. I had a family emergency and looked into booking a flight to Kelowna as soon as possible. I very rarely fly with Air Canada and am a proud frequent flyer with WestJet. I regret trying to use Air Canada as it always disappoints and their prices never match their service. Not only did I get downgraded upon boarding my flight from Calgary to Kelowna, but the flight attendants also had no idea what they were talking about and couldn’t organize their thoughts one bit. For a $600 flight, I would expect the staff to at least know how to tell me the safety instructions properly. Now boarding my flight home from Kelowna to Calgary, sure enough, the flight is delayed over an hour. And not only that! The Vancouver flight with Air Canada just announced that they “oversold” the flight and need volunteers to re-book! That is so bad! Highlights of this travel experience: Nothing.

### "jettison your plastic options"
Not Verified | Calgary to Sydney via Vancouver. The outbound was ok because the flight was empty and the check-in crew was kind enough to provide us with a row each. This was quickly offset by the fact that they didn’t pack the vegetarian food and made little effort to provide a reasonable set of meal options. Late leaving and late to arrive so missed the connecting flight but this can happen so no biggie there I guess. Did well to find a practical solution to this and didn’t lose our baggage which was very much appreciated. CIgnored by staff when the assistance light was on. Staff were very poorly committed to providing a good flying experience. The flight home! Sardine-like conditions but poor food. Chickpea on rice, then in a bun followed by the piece de resistance, avec hash browns. Air Canada - you have a great opportunity to jettison your plastic options and go with bamboo and paper. It’s a disgrace that you have shown no leadership on this basic environmental consideration. 2

### "cancelled due to weather"
Chicago to Montreal. My flight was cancelled due to weather without an update. Employees are unreachable, you can only talk to an automated message. They do not reply to their emails. Their website's flight status doesn't even work. It was showing my flight as on time for the whole day. They are a costly mess

### "seat changed to center seat"
Toronto to Los Angeles. Reserved an aisle seat changed to center seat. Apparently they changed our aircraft. I had a carefully selected aisle seat reserved. We arrived at the airport I discovered the Seat change. At the gate I checked with the lone, over-worked gate agent. She kept having to re-ask my name. In the end, the airline switched the type of plane and the forced me into center seat without apology, for a 4-5 hour flight.

### "Fare was costly"
New York to Kingston via Toronto. The check in was smooth. Despite bad weather flight departed on time. They just served coke/glass of water. Wifi was there but not free. Fare was costly particularly the Toronto-Kingston sector. The flight operated in Toronto-Kingston sector needs restoration.

### "AC have lost my bag"
Toronto to New York LGA return. The majority of flights on this route are currently operated by Sky Regional on E175s under the Air Canada Express banner. This morning, waiting at the gate, we got the preboard announcement, followed a minute later by a PA stating the flight was now cancelled due to the aircraft going tech. (followed by a text from AC) Rebooking is automatic and took 15 mins. I found myself (probably due to a low fare class) albeit 50K elite, on a flight at 1320 – some 4.15 hours after my original flight time. A paltry 10 bucks for refreshments was offered (try buying something to eat and drink at Pearson for ten bucks!!) Prior to boarding my new flight, the gate staff confirmed my bag was on the tarmac ready to be loaded. Two handlers at the bottom of the jetty confirmed that 15 bags had been loaded from an earlier flight. Despite these reassurances, having waited at the baggage reclaim – no bag. A queue to report it, an incorrectly filed report by the AC agent, the online system reported my bag would land at 2100 but no bag arrived that evening. On chasing AC the following morning by phone, it turns out my bag had iust been delivered to hotel reception – some 18 hours after I had landed and 11 hours since the bag arrived in New York. (the online report was not updated) I am losing count of the times AC have lost my bag. This is also my third flight cancelled on this route though at least this time the rebooked flight was the same day (unlike the last time). For a company who claim to be the best in North America, I find their continued inability and incompetence to operate their schedule and carry PAX and their bags on the same flight to be getting worse.

### "they have never disappointed me"
Calgary to Quebec City via Montreal. Excellent. The service on this brand new Airbus 220 was flawless. Always appreciate the professional and polite service on Air Canada. Meal was great, entertainment selections plentiful. I will continue to enjoy flying with Air Canada, have been loyal for over 20 years, never a bad experience to record. Some people are impossible to please, even by a company that obviously cares as much about the passenger experience as Air Canada does. This last flight is one of literally hundreds with Air Canada over the years, they have never disappointed me in my travels. Thank you Air Canada.

### "has been a bit missing"
Frankfurt to Calgary, B777-300ER economy class. Having flown to and from Europe to and from YYC on Air Canada several times and exclusively since September, I was hoping for a standardized product in economy class. Each time, something has been a bit missing: poor French skills, inaudible captain PA's, etc. The food, entertainment, and cabin cleanliness was relatively standard, including this time. The attendants this time were especially bad. In particular the one who served me, who handed the food to the passenger on the aisle, and have him figure out the portion and pass it to each of us. The announcements were impossible for me to hear because of so much feedback on the PA. Sometimes, French announcements were absent.

### "Any option is better than Air Canada"
My wife and I booked tickets to fly Toronto to Saskatoon in Nov, well in advance of our trip in Jan to attend a wedding. After many AC initiated changes to our booking, I.e. flights, times, seating, for fees and over 7 hours of discussions and holding on AC’s service line we finally made the flight. We have just learned our sons who are flying Air Canada to meet us today had their flight canceled several hours before departure and rebooked on a later flight. Air Canada’s performance apprears to reflect a mantra of ‘We are not happy until you are not happy.’ Any option is better than Air Canada!

### "still haven’t got my luggage"
Calgary to Kelowna. I will never fly Air Canada again. Despite checking in more than two hours before my flight, my luggage was offloaded for some reason and missed the flight from Calgary to Kelowna (along with a number of other passengers). I have had to ring and ring to ever get an update, was told it would arrive when it didn’t and have ended up missing a significant part of my ski holiday. And I still haven’t got my luggage.

### "cabin was horribly hot and service was non-existent"
Toronto to Seattle. Horrible airline, horrible service. Flight was deplaned after late boarding due to mechanical issue, then +3 hour delay and gate change with no meal voucher or reimbursement. Once on a new plane and in flight, cabin was horribly hot and service was non-existent. After landing at SEA, no gate was provided – we had to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal, and then had to walk the full length of the SEA terminal to leave. Tried to receive compensation from customer support but they have no phone service for customer support (wild) and refused over email after many attempts. Will never fly Air Canada again.

### "Fantastic experience"
Toronto to London. Fantastic experience. Valet service took me from connecting domestic flight straight to the gate. Excellent service, food and comfort throughout the trip, both before and during the flight.

### "there was no service whatsoever"
Not Verified |  Flew into Tokyo from Bangkok on ANA, Nippon on a 787, economy class. We were offered water within 30 minutes of takeoff, a full elaborate and delicious dinner after an hour, then another drink service half an hour after that. We were offered a snak and drink again before landing. All of this on a 4.5 hour flight. The seats were a comfortable width with good leg room. This was a great flight experience. We were connecting on Air Canada Flight 2 to Toronto, connection time was 55 minutes, we were at the gate in about 25 minutes, boarding had not started, we boarded and lifted off about 45 minutes late, something about baggage loading problems. We paid extra for a preferred seat were in row 18 at the bulkhead, seat location was good, seat itself was very narrow and uncomfortable. (extra seating probably means extra luggage and with the allowance of 2 checked bags per person might explain luggage loading problems.) Three hours after takeoff there was no service whatsoever, not even water. Then there was an announcement that Air Canada was implementing a new service, they were offering a hot towel service and the availability of both hot chocolate and sparkling in Economy Lass. A special representative was on board to explain this innovation and to hand out a 20 question survey on this startling innovation. Water and a meal service followed. The main was horrible, a tiny salad, a tiny bun and a Twinkie like desert. After a discussion with their service people water was offered more frequently. An attempt to order duty free on board failed, an attendant tried to help but was not able to place the order. The duty free cart came by when I was asleep so no success there. This 11.5 hour flight was a very poor and uncomfortable esperiance. In the last two years we have travelled on KLM, Lufthansa, Air France,West Jet, Bangkok Air. All of these airlines provided better service and a much higher quality food service. Shame on you Air Canada. I will not use you again if I can help it.

### "a serious customer service problem"
Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. I am a million mile flyer so I have a lot of experience with traveling. I fail to understand why the baggage retrieval at Pearson Airport is consistently the worst I have experienced. Comparing Toronto with Paris, London, Zurich, Hong Kong, Vancouver, New York etc. etc. Typically, baggage at Toronto takes 30 to 50 minutes after having passed through customs and immigration. One wonders why the bags are not waiting for the passengers when they emerge from customs and immigration. At most other airports I have my baggage in no more that 20 minutes. In London, my bags are always on the carousel before I arrive. This continues to be an issue at Pearson (Air Canada) Terminal 1. I primarily fly Air Canada so my experience is with them. Frankly, I don’t care whether Air Canada blames Pearson management or whether Pearson blames Air Canada baggage handlers. This is a serious customer service problem that should be rectified. It is an embarrassment to Pearson and Air Canada both. Particularly since other international airports don’t seem to seem to have this problem.

### "Our flight was delayed"
Our flight Vancouver to Honolulu was delayed and almost didn't make it to our scheduled tour. I thought maybe just this one time only. Then when when we go back home, our flight were cancelled. Hotels and taxis were compensated , we ended up stranded in a hotel. Never again we will fly with Air Canada. The delays and cancellation is not worth the money you spend. I won't recommend.

### "not a Comfort Class seat"
Biggest Air Canada fan waning after A220 inaugural Flight Experience. I purchased a Comfort Class ticket on the Air Canada inaugural A200-300 flight on January 16th between Montreal and Calgary. When I reached my seat, boarding in Zone 5 I found that my aisle seat was already being encroached on by a Plus Sized passenger who had moved the arm rests up as he could not fit the confines of his seat. This was certainly not a Comfort Class seat experience from my perspective, although probably an Air Canada bargain at just over $500. I thought Air Canada would put their topnotch flight attendants on this flight as it was an inaugural flight of a new aircraft type! Instead the economy cabin was blessed with 2 lack lustre crew members. I went to use the washroom at the back of the airplane and two service carts were blocking the access to the lav that was open while the 2 flight attendants were busy snacking and socializing. The male flight attendant later manned the Bistro Cart in the aisle offered the menu to me and I had to ask him if he had my prepaid voucher recorded on his manifest. He looked at a sheet of paper on his cart, then looked above at my seat row and number then offered the meal item and snack item. I chose for a meal item the mac n cheese which was one of the few hot items available. The flight attendant warned me that it would be at least 30 minutes because he would have to heat it up first. This, while the plane was over northern Ontario. I decided by the time we were flying over Saskatchewan, I would check on that 30 minute Mac and Cheese. I went to the rear galley and found a  female flight attendant freshening up her makeup and I asked her if she knew anything about the 30 minute Mac N Cheese I had ordered off the Bistro Cart and she opened the oven and found the cardboard box with the Mac N Cheese which was probably cooking for and hour and a half. She admitted that the Male flight attendant could not remember who ordered the item.

### "delayed out of Calgary"
Not Verified | Calgary to Frankfurt via Mumbai. The flight was delayed out of Calgary due mostly waiting for deicing as the weather was not horrible. Upon departure with almost 1.5 hours initial delay, the plane finally made it to Frankfurt with just 1 hour delay. However, they could not make sure that the passengers that were connecting to a Lufthansa flight to Mumbai with just 1.5 hrs connecting time could at least make it to their flight. They have code-share and it is their responsibility. Lufthansa left without a single minute delay leaving passengers stranded at the airport for an indefinite time. There were many plans that have to be completely revised and rebooked with much loss of money and time. Absolutely horrible service by Air Canada, not only this time but most of the time. This is one of the worst airlines in the world.

### "We used to trust Air Canada"
Zurich to Montreal. You have to be careful now with Air Canada. They started playing with their fares to make it as confusing as possible to get as much money as possible from the customer. At the time of booking, we chose a standard economy ticket as opposed to an Economy Light ticket to be sure to get our luggage included in the price and not have to care about it later. We got a booking confirmation also stating that we had in fact paid the Standard Economy fare and that our luggage was included. When we showed up at the airport however, with four pieces of luggage for the whole family, we had to pay 240 CHF additional per way. We were told that since our flight was a codeshare, the rules of the other company applied. We got no help from the Air Canada counter and we could not reach anyone on the phone after an hour of waiting. We wrote an Email to customer service which replied three weeks later stating that it was all our fault for not paying attention, even though their booking confirmation stated false information. That means that we paid more for a fare that did not give us what we expected of it. We used to trust Air Canada but we won't be flying with them anymore if we can't trust the information they present us.

### "operated by Omni Air"
Flew from Vancouver to Kahului January 2 2020 , the flight was operated by Omni Air International due to the Boeing Max 8 issue. I upgraded to Business when doing online check in to give my wife and myself a treat. Entering the plane the first thing we noticed was the horrible condition of the interior. Once we had sat down it only got worse, the seats had an electric reclining system that were so worn out my seat couldn’t even go to the take off position. I could tell how embarrassed the flight attendant was. My wife’s entertainment screen which is located between our seats was held down with white tape and was unusable my screen was so floppy that it had to be held in place by the tray table with a blanket. What a joke. The service was okay but not great. The only thing that was nice was the leg room.

### "My seat was given away"
I am a frequent flyer with Air Canada and I have had terrible flights from Kona and Maui due to the abysmal ground crew there. Staff from other airlines manage the check in and gates. They’re rude and ignore amy airline status. I needed a printed boarding pass and waited in line for an hour. My seat was given away and I was given a seat at a window towards the back instead of at an aisle with my family towards the front. I proved my seat was changed and they responded that they can’t inconvenience the passenger who has your seat now.

### "not being flying with AC again"
Vancouver to Winnipeg departing at 8.15pm. If I try and contact airline via phone I get a voice recording that essentially says  we’re not able to put you on hold and we won’t be able to call you back. Sky lounge only serves drinks during certain hours. Sky lounge doesn’t serve any food other than pieces of bread and hummus after 8pm. Seats have no pillows or blankets etc. You’re required to pay to use their in-flight Wi-Fi service for anything other than looking at a map of your flight. There are too many letdowns when it comes to flying domestic business class with Air Canada. I will not being flying with AC again.

### "Seats cushions are thin"
Air Canada's Boeing 777-300ER with high density seating, is an appalling aircraft to fly. The seating is cramped and the aisles so narrow. Seats cushions are thin and most uncomfortable. The food and service on board were dreadful. The flight attendants had an indifferent attitude, miserable expression and lack of common courtesy to me. The cabin was excessively hot and despite requests, nothing appeared to be done to alleviate the discomfort. Music selections were poor and the choice of movies.

### "strongly recommend avoiding this airline"
On our way down to New Zealand, they lost our bags for 3 days but little did I know that the flight down would be the better flight. This is because on the way back to Vancouver my seat would be paper thin allowing me to feel any movement to the tray table or seat back behind me, the flight would be 30 minutes late and our bags would be late to get to customs, and then after we missed our flight their counter staff wouldn’t help us and say things like “not our problem.” We would still be stuck in Vancouver if Alaska Airlines hadn’t stepped up and rebooked us when the Air Canada customer service called them for help. If you have any other options whether it be a different airline, car, train, your favorite horse, hot air ballon, or even a hydrogen filled zeppelin I would strongly recommend avoiding this airline.

### "cancelled due to weather"
Not Verified |  A colleague and I were set to fly out of Toronto to Edmonton on the 5th of January. Flight got cancelled due to weather Customer was completely overwhelmed. Our flight got rescheduled to the next morning and for some reason we got a connecting flight in Calgary. We went early to the airport and tried to change our to another AC flight that was direct to Edmonton scheduled 15min after the Calgary one. The agent told us that flight was delayed an hour so we decided to bite the bullet and just transfer in Calgary. We also didn't want to further complicate our checked baggage finding its way home. Flight to Calgary left on time and went fine. As soon as we arrive in Calgary our flight to Edmonton gets delayed a couple times and eventually cancelled for mechanical issues. Flight rescheduled for the next morning. Colleague and I decided we're better off just renting a car at this point because we can't afford to miss another day of work. Customer service is brutal and dismissive of anyone's problems.

### "contrast between two flights was enormous"
Before we departed, we discovered our return flight was changed by a day only  when we rang Air Canada to upgrade ... just per chance we had booked a connecting flight with Air Canada. Had we booked the connection with a different airline  we would have had to pay for the alteration to our flight. Also, we had to change plans and add another night to our New York accommodation. We had not been informed of the change, goodness know if and when Air Canada might have decided to inform us. The service from Melbourne to Vancouver was appalling. Food and drinks offered were the  minimum for what was a long flight. Alternatively staff on the flight from Vancouver to Montreal were exceptional. They went out of their way to assist, offer snacks, smile and just offer exceptional service. The contrast between the two flights was enormous, unfortunately we received bad service on the long flight. We are yet to make the return flight and it's not looking good. We have attempted on 3 occasions to telephone Air Canada and on each occasion, the wait time is 1 hour!

### "absolute waste of a day"
Not Verified |  We are currently sitting on the plane from Montreal to Calgary. We have been at the airport since 6.45am for a flight scheduled to leave at 8.25. It is now 1.15 pm. We have missed our bus connection to Banff. This has been an absolute waste of a day. There has been one delay after another and to be honest I think this airline is a joke. I have lost count of the number of texts sent for each delay. We won’t get to see Banff now And it is such a long way from Australia to get here.

### "cancelled due to weather"
Connecting flight from Toronto to Halifax cancelled due to weather, ok understandable. Rebooked on flight later that night, which I got bumped from. One customer service agent at the desk provided really bad service too, I get that you're tired of dealing with customers but the lady was acting as if her flight got cancelled. She even complained to her colleague about having to hold with Air Canada when phoning to get help with the situation. So I'm put on the 10:00 flight for 06 Jan 2020, I even get checked in and get a boarding pass. An hour later I get an email saying I'm now bumped from this flight and on the 18:30 flight. This cannot be due to weather as the 10:00 flight is not cancelled. Now I've been on hold for over an hour waiting to speak with someone. They really need to hire more customer service agents for the call center considering how much the company is messing up lately. They also told everyone that hotels will not be provided because it was due to weather, stranding a bunch of people. I'm thinking of just getting a full refund and booking with WestJet to get out of here earlier tomorrow.

### "little legroom and elbow room"
Edmonton to Brisbane via Vancouver. I could not believe how small my seat was and how little legroom and elbow room I had. I bought a carry on specifically so it would fit under my seat so I wouldn’t have to bother with the overhead storage and could access my case when needed without bothering other passengers, however, it wouldn’t fit under the seat. I’m 5’2 and weigh 117 lbs. I could barely move my arms without invading the space of the person sitting next to me. I became sick and had to get up to go to the washroom, but the other two passengers had to get up and out first. I asked the flight attendant for aspirin, he said yes but continued cleaning food trays and made me wait ten minutes.

### "No compensation whatsoever"
My return flight from Kelowna to Edmonton just got cancelled due to fog. Ok that's fine, it's a 1 hour flight. Air Canada personnel on the plane said "go to the Air Canada" desk when you get inside. We all go inside and no one shows up there and it's only 8pm. We all wait there and wait there. Nothing. Then I get an email that I will fly to Vancouver 2 days later and then a lay over and then fly to Edmonton. That is unbelievable. Other passengers got a flight the next day and others 2 days later in the evening. No compensation whatsoever. I will never fly Air Canada again!

### "flight to Vancouver was cancelled"
My flight to Vancouver was cancelled and I was notified of the cancellation the day before, with a note that a follow up email on the rescheduled flight would be sent. However, I did not get an email. I tried calling in for hours on end with no one to assist and also wrote in requesting for help. Nothing happened. I went down the next day to realise that there was a rescheduled flight that I was not notified of, even through I was booked into it. The staff at the airport did not offer to help and asked us to get back on the phone to get through to the billing, but again did not get through. I did not manage to get on the later flight that day and had to purchase another ticket with United Airlines the next day. This was a terrible and frustrating experience that left me at a loss of words about Air Canada’s service standards. An airline like Air Canada to have not only missed out communication, have such poor customer service response times and incompetent and dismissive service staff is a triple whammy to one of North America’s best airlines. I am very disappointed and displeased.

### "I now have 8 hours to burn"
Winnipeg to Grande Prairie via Edmonton. Here I sit at Edmonton Airport. I now have 8 hours to burn since my connecting flight was cancelled. Cancelled due to mechanical issues, I totally understand and accept the delay. However, due to the first flight out of Winnipeg that departed at 5 am, I haven't slept yet and a shower would have made the delay so much more bearable. Instead, after pleading with the airline, all they could do is a 10.00 voucher for a coffee and a muffin and "we're sorry for the inconvenience".

### "baggage did not leave Montreal"
I traveled to Paris from Ottawa via Montreal on 12/28/2019 along with my 2 kids ( 4 years and 7 years old). I had checked in Ottawa 3 baggage and 1 stroller. Upon arriving in Paris it came to my surprise that none of the checked-in baggage has arrived. Upon checking with the ground staff in Paris I was informed that ground staff in Montreal didn't have enough time to transfer my baggage to the second flight going to Paris. My trip was booked through air Canada website including the transit. I followed up with Baggage services who confirmed that baggage did not leave Montreal and will be send on a different flight. Following arrival it will be scheduled for delivery in Paris. This process could take up to 5 days. I am shocked with the poor level of service Air Canada.

### "Not good customer service"
Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Ottawa. When a companies cabin crew apologises for their in-flight entertainment being really bad and in not a good working order for many passengers because the systems are so old, you would think an over haul would have been done: But you would have been mistaken! After three starts and reboots of the system followed by a discussion with ground staff as to how to fix the fact the entertainment system didn't work, the company resorted to 'vouchers' which required a passenger to log into Air Canada's website to be reimbursed! But oh no, don't think you will get anything back, you are.offered 15% off your next flight cost but you must fly within the year. So my question is, what about all those customers who, like me won't be flying again within the year as we saved for this holiday. Not good customer service and most definitely let's Air Canada off the hook as a good 80% probably won't be flying within the year. Well done Air Canada you try to look as if you care but have clearly not put your passengers first.

### "Delayed by 75 mins"
Toronto to Quebec. Delayed by 75 mins because of crew unavailability. How are you not able to have enough crew members for a flight? Unacceptable. Then extra delays because the plane was not ready to fly.

### "The worst experience"
Toronto to Portland. The worst experience with Air Canada. Who changes their systems during the holiday season? I spent two months trying to buy my seat upgrade but their system wouldn’t take it. And their customer care message just said “sorry, we can’t help you!”. I just ran through the Vancouver airport to make an earlier flight to Portland. They were still boarding passengers and completely refused to help. Had no empathy for the next flight being a four-hour wait. She was not helping and yelled at me for asking more than once. I understand the rules and regulations. I would have been fine with an “I am so sorry, the rules won’t let me add you to this flight”. But she was rude.

### "landed in Rome 70 minutes late"
Toronto to Rome. Flight landed in Rome 70 minutes late. In order to catch the connection flight to Rome, we were effectively run by an Air Canada agent thru Fiumicino airport. Luckily Lufthansa crew were waiting for us for the next flight to Munich. On the flight half of the lavatories I checked were out of order during the flight. My continental breakfast was sugar coated bread.

### "2 mins late from the check in timeline"
Toronto to Bogota. Prior to departure, I tried to call air Canada to upgrade my flight several times, each time the wait duration was more than one hour. Finally after several attempts, when I got through to an agent after 60 mind waiting, they told me I have to do the upgrade in the airport. The system doesn’t allow them to do it over the phone, However, when I got to the airport, the ground service people told me I have to do it online it or on the phone, the system doesn’t allow them to do it at the airport, it’s very frustrating that it’s already wasted 2 hours of my life just to get to speak to someone over the phone. No one could help me with my request. After I got to the airport, I was 2 mins late from the check in timeline, I found out that they took my seats away and told me I had to rebook a flight. I had no choice but to go to ticketing booth, after waiting there for almost 2 hours at ticketing booth, the staff had trouble getting through their system after 15 mins of trying, told me because I used Aeroplan miles for my ticket, there is nothing they can do, I have to contact Aeroplan to get a new ticket. It would be more considerate if they let me know that ticketing booth doesn’t help anyone with aeroplane reward ticket before sending me there, so I don’t waste another 2 hours waiting there pointlessly. This experience is very very disappointing,.

### "Delayed 4 hours"
Toronto to Zurich. Delayed 4 hours, this is the second time happen. The fare was too expensive and compensation was only $20, really unfair. Even the airline is not sure if I will get a connecting flight and at what time. Prefer not to travel by Air Canada again

### "cabin crew very friendly"
Hong Kong to Toronto. The cabin crew are very friendly but my food was not great. A problem is the toilet I used was dirty before we've taken off. Need more attention inside the cabin, special the chairs and washroom.

### "will avoid at all costs"
Not Verified | Regina to Montreal via Toronto. What is described below is not a one-time occurrence, it has a rather disturbing high frequency on my travels. Paid for a more expensive flight to arrive earlier as I had an event. Wasted my money due to the delays. The departing flight (AC1114 from Regina to Toronto) was delayed due to "additional flight preparation time". The flight was then delayed two more times, to the point of missing my connection. To top it off, when consulting the departing gate to change the missed connection, was instructed to do so in Toronto. I made the big mistake of being nice to them and checked my carry on to assist them with space for other passengers. Big mistake as the whole Air Canada Toronto personnel that I consulted seemed to be trained to purposely do nothing to change a flight if baggage is checked. When requesting for an earlier flight, one of the people asked if I wanted to go on the next flight, to what I answer "Yes! to then tell me he couldn't do it because of the checked luggage and telling me that he needed 1h and 15min for changing. Asked then for a flight apart 1.5 hrs, to what they say "cannot do with checked luggage". Do you notice the change of tone there? If this was a single occurrence, I would have said "one time thing" but this is the third time out of four flights I've got. Due to the frequency, I will avoid at all cost. I hope you do the same. And I travel frequently, with different airlines. Have not been as deceived as with AC.

### "service was not amazing"
Toronto to Frankfurt. Onboard service was not amazing, the staff looked overworked. The flight was full and there was no prior assessment of hand luggage storage. The flight took off nearly an hour late as the staff were rearranging hand luggage in the cabin as a result we landed in Frankfurt 30 minutes late. I missed my connecting flight and have to wait over 5 hours for my rescheduled flight. The Lufthansa staff at Frankfurt are not helpful at all, my flight was originally booked with Lufthansa and they have not shown any empathy or given assistance! !

### "delayed for 4 hours"
Toronto to Tokyo. Flight is delayed for 4 hours. The worst part is their customer service it wait at least 30min before answering my call, and the operator said they cannot help.

### "flight went fairly well"
Not Verified |  The flight from Montreal to Paris went fairly well. The dinner for the flight was okay but breakfast was an insult. The light continental breakfast consisted of one slice of moist ginger bread and the usual hot or cold beverage.

### "I like the onboard crew"
Frankfurt to Toronto with Air Canada. What I like about Air Canada is the onboard crew and that they were continuously serving water throughout the flight. Seats and entertainment are average - do big see a big difference to other North American Airlines. What I don’t like is 63 minutes waiting time to call their reservations department. I am not too impressed by their onboard catering in regard to quantity and quality. The lounge I used in Toronto is underwhelming.

### "seats that are far too small"
Frankfurt to Toronto with Air Canada. Crammed into seats that are far too small for normal sized people, you are separated from travel companions and loved ones. It’s not just Air Canada, it’s all airlines. They have found a way to make us pay ridiculously high fees while still providing worse and worse services.

### "best in class service"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver. Upon boarding at Toronto Pearson airport at gate 38 on December 18 2019 the Air Canada crew noticed that although I have super elite status my seat was way at the back. When inquiring about it I told Annette that it was a last minute booking and no other better seat was available. Without asking for any change Annette asked me if I didn’t mind to wait for a second to check if there was a better seat for me. Within few seconds she came back with a new boarding pass and a better seat. That is the best service when you really don’t expect it. Thank you Annette And Air Canada for a best in class service!

### "totally unacceptable"
Boston to Tokyo via Toronto. My first flight on Air Canada this morning was delayed due to weather. When I arrived in Toronto I had missed the connection and they handed new boarding passes which get me to my destination two days after I was supposed to arrive. I was taking this flight because it was nonstop and paid for premium economy. They’ve provided me with a hotel for one night but I end up now going through Korea and have to spend a night in the airport without a hotel. I have been on hold on their help phone for over one hour. I have also been at the customer ticketing booth and took a number which was number 243 3: 207 PM today and after an hour and 15 minutes, they had only served 40 people. I Was on hold for over one hour when someone finally answered. After explaining the situation and indicating I would be willing to go to a different airport in Tokyo the woman said to please hold and after about 15 minutes I was disconnected. I am now starting over and I’m now on hold to speak to someone again. I’ve tried calling them myself on my cell phone however if you listen to the recording it literally says that they will not take your call because of their new reservation system. Please see photos showing how they have rebooked me with three additional flights going through another country and ending up at my destination two days later. This is totally unacceptable and I can’t even speak to someone to see if there are any alternatives which is why I am posting this review as I stay on hold. In addition, I went to three lines at the airport to try to get help and each person sent me somewhere else. I will never ever fly this airline again. It’s one thing to offer me a hotel in Toronto this evening but then to expect me to arrive in Korea and spend the night on a chair waiting for a flight is also unacceptable aside from all these time issues. Thank goodness I sent my family from New York on United Airlines. They are not even aware of my problem since they are flying to Tokyo and I am not.

### "new app never works for me"
Montreal to Toronto. Their new app never works for me nor it is up to date. Is that difficult to update to provide accurate information that is critical for passengers? The entertainment device was scratched, broken and/or defective. Some planes have defective seats and non-working electric outlets. If you complain, they offer you $50-$100 as if that would solve the problem or if that was a fair compensation.

### "booking reference no longer existed"
I’ve spent the last month attempting to organize my itinerary. I waited a total of 6 hrs on hold for their customer service line. Each time they hung up on me (before I could speak) or an answering machine informed me they couldn't even put me on hold or take my call. I had to make multiple trips to the airport to ask questions that should be cleared online or over the phone, though they failed to give such options which were available in the past. I understand they're reworking their "system" but this is insane. I don't appreciate the website telling me to see an Air Canada employee in person, only to go to a local airport (London, Ontario) to find the lady refusing to help me after I found out for no reason explained to me that my booking reference no longer existed the day before I'm supposed to leave. She kept saying “I don’t know. Can’t help you” even though she has the tools to look up my booking to see if there’s any issues on my end or hers. I had to ask her work colleague for help. It turned out the problem was a very simple one, and my time and theirs would’ve been saved if she had been happy to do her job and help me the moment I asked her.

### "we had to switch planes"
Calgary to Toronto. After boarding the plane we were told that we might have to switch planes due to that one needing repairs, so we had to wait another 15 minutes to find out, then the captain announced that we had to switch planes and that the next one would be there at 10:45. So I went to my next gate and the plane didn’t arrive until about 11:30. The captain and crew assured us that they were taking care of the connection issues, which may have been true for some people but not for me. My in flight entertainment didn’t work and the charging ports didn’t work. I ended up just sleeping the whole flight anyway since I have flu. When we landed in Toronto and I could use my phone again I had a notification saying they rebooked my next flight which was to Timmins but I was flying on the 14th and they rebooked me for the 16th even though there was a flight that night to Timmins with room on it. I had to pay over $300 for a ticket onto that flight because of their mistake. I had to wait another 3 hours in the Toronto airport for my next flight. I was supposed to have been in Timmins by 6:30 that night but didn’t make it there till almost 12 in the morning.

### "satisfied and surprised"
Not Verified |  Flew with Air Canada long haul business class from Toronto to Munich. I was satisfied and surprised. I flew to Toronto from Edmonton. When arrived in Pearson Terminal 3, an air Canada agent was waiting for me holding a plate with my name. She offered me a chauffeur service with a nice BMW 7 series to the terminal 1, from where my flight to Munich will depart. I was astonished as i am not a frequent flyer of Air Canada but just a star alliance gold member. The signature lounge of air Canada was amazing. Dining a la carte at the restaurant brilliant. Service on board was great. the seats in business class were very spacious. you can really spread out. I did not like the seat in flat mode though. Somehow the seat was quite hard.

### "hire agents who actually care about helping passengers"
Not Verified |  The flight from Taipei to Vancouver was decent. But it was hard to get comfortable in the seats in order to catch some sleep on the 10 hour journey. What made us most angry was our treatment at Vancouver airport while trying to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto. We had less than 2 hours to go through customs, get our baggage, then recheck baggage before boarding. Of course going through security was slow and on top of that, baggage claim had mechanical issues so we were delayed another 10 minutes. By the time we reached baggage drop off, the agent simply told us too late and that we missed our flight. No explanation or any effort whatsoever to reach out to the agents boarding for our flight. We got redirected to a check in area where we were then booked as standby for the next flight with the agent telling us that we would most likely get on. Now we understand seats are not guaranteed but at least have the agents be a little empathetic about our situation that was not our fault. Cue boarding time for the standby flight: the agent was rude and bluntly told all standbys that we were not getting on. Naturally people were upset and wanted answers. But this particular agent was so rude and yelled back at everyone to shut up as there was nothing she can do on her end. Funny, I thought these agents are supposed to provide customer service? Didn't know being yelled at and made to feel like missing our original flight was part of their job description. I can understand feeling attacked when you have angry customers all come at you, but that's part of your job to be able to keep your cool in these situations! After a bit of yelling back and forth, she rebooked us all as standbys for the last flight of the night with a small chance of boarding as this was yet another full flight. She couldn't or wouldn't tell us what our other options are if we were to be denied this last flight as well. So here we are waiting for the last flight hoping to get on while we're all upset with how we were just treated. Long story short, the flight crew was lovely but ground staff? Please hire agents who actually care about helping passengers who are stuck here. It's not like we all voluntarily decided to skip our original flights in favour of playing chance with the later flights. Worst customer service experience we've ever experienced. Would highly recommend avoid flying with Air Canada if you can. I love my country, but this airline's ground staff is a joke.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
On Sat 30 November 2019, I was due to fly from London to Chicago, via Toronto. I successfully completed the London to Toronto leg of my journey. All of my problems began with the Toronto to Chicago leg of this journey (UA 7673 on 30 November 2019). I boarded the plane, but was then told that there was a fault with the plane. All passengers were told to disembark the plane. I expected to be booked on to another flight for that day, but was informed by Air Canada Staff at the gate that there would be no further flights that day. I was told to collect my luggage and leave the airport. I was given the Air Canada customer support phone number and was told to contact them to arrange an alternative flight. I tried calling this number continuously for the next 12 hours. I was unable to get through to a customer support agent, despite holding for up to 4 hours! I kept getting a message saying that I could not be placed on hold, with a request to call back later. The message did not change for the whole time I was ringing! When I checked my booking online, I could see that my YYZ to ORD had been rescheduled for 4 days later (Wednesday 3 December 2019). This was despite the fact that there were numerous seats available on Air Canada flights between Toronto and Chicago on the 1st and 2nd of December. As I was unable to contact Air Canada customer support to arrange an alternative flight, I had no choice but to make my own arrangements for travel to Chicago. I proceeded to book a flight from Buffalo NY to Toronto for Sunday morning 1 December 2019 at 7.15 am. I am extremely disappointed by Air Canada. I understand that planes can occasionally develop a fault, leading to a cancellation. However, the failure of Air Canada to answer the phone is absolutely disgraceful.

### "entertainment system did not work"
Not Verified |  My husband and I travel at least 4-5 times per year via Air Canada. Ninety percent of the time we fly business class. This trip to Atlanta and back has been one of the worst we’ve experienced. The flight FYI Toronto to Atlanta was over 3 hours late. Although weather was a factor, the messages to passengers were very misleading. The return flight was 35 minutes delayed, with no explanation. My entertainment system did not work, after informing the attendant, he provided a discount claim card, which lead us to believe this was a known issue. I wouldn’t have been so put off, but overheard other passengers in business class saying they were given complimentary upgrades. Their entertainment systems worked fine, while mine, which was a fully paid Bus Class ticket did not. I can only hope they read this and perhaps understand where they might try to make some customer service advancements.

### "waiting 35 minutes on hold"
Most recently I booked a flight from Windsor to Timmins for January 2020. Air Canada cancelled the Windsor to Toronto portion and re-booked such that I would have a 6 hour layover in Toronto. I am unable to re-schedule on line and was left waiting 35 minutes on hold before I hung up. This was on a priority number for frequent flyers. So, you can't do business online and you can't do business on the phone.

### Air Canada customer review
Fort McMurray to St Johns. The last time my fiance flew she had an encounter with customer service in Calgary airport. She had a question and they were rude and condescending. We have an upcoming trip in January and  I have received a new itinerary. The latest one has my out going flight leaving 4 hours early causing me to have to leave work early to catch it and the return they decided to add an 8hr stop over right in the middle. The 8 hour stop over also causes me to get in late at night. I paid for the flights I booked because they work for the time off i booked. I didnt pay to have my itinerary changed for the worse. I dont feel like air canada has any respect for their customers. Their call centers are currently not even taking calls. I have been a loyal customer for many years but the way they treat customers is getting ridiculous.

### "so many bad experiences"
Toronto to San Francisco. I stopped flying Air Canada last year after so many bad experiences. But unfortunately WestJet doesn't do direct flights to San Francisco, so I was stuck on Air Canada again this month. And as always the experience was terrible. It is a total joke that they say they are the highest rated North American airline. They are the worst airline that I have flown on. The staff are completely unfriendly and not helpful. The flights are almost always late. I am waiting on my flight back and felt the need to write this review since my inbound flight is late so not really surprized. I would give negative 10 as an overall rating if I could.

### "avoid using Aeroplan in the future"
I used Air Canada's reward system Aeroplan to book a flight and could only get a seat on a United flight. It went through the system including assigning a seat. However, it said it was unticketed. I waited 24 hours to see if the ticket was issued - and then spent hours trying to get through to both Air Canada and Aeroplan after United told me that I should contact them to put a priority on issuing the ticket ASAP because they would cancel the reservation if it is not issued soon. Both contact centres talk about changes to the reservation system and it is causing lots of problems - but this has been going on for weeks based on comments on various forums. And they point the blame on each other - despite one being bought out by the other. The lack of effort to add more staff and to extend Aeroplans hours is disgraceful and and both parties should be ashamed by their lack of acceptance that customer are paying the consequences of an ill planned change. After spending hours dialing to just get into the queue to talk to Air Canada or Aeroplan [I had two phones going at the same time]. I finally spoke to a human at Air Canada who refused to acknowledge any connection to Aeroplan tickets and basically said keep trying to connect. Honestly I spent over 5 hours continuously redialing the Aeroplan number which stopped working at midnight. I have less that 36 hours before I am suppose to fly and no ticket. I would donate my points to charity as I plan to avoid using Aeroplan in the future, but it would be such a mean gesture to give something that could never be used.

### "trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage"
Frankfurt to Nashville via Toronto. Our Frankfurt to Toronto leg was perfect. Staff was friendly, plane was comfortable, and flight was great. Once landing in Toronto, the chaos ensued. Our Nashville leg was cancelled due to weather (freezing rain and snow). Totally understandable. However, what wasn't understandable was the sheer incompetence of the Air Canada agents that helped customers. Once we arrived at the connections gate for the US flights, there was 1 Air Canada agent helping over 200 people that needed a flight rebooked. On top of that, they apparently had a new rebooking system, so she couldn't actually rebook anyone without having to wait on the phone with another department to see if anything was available. The first person in line took 2 hours to get resolved. I was fourth in line. Finally my husband and I received a hotel voucher after about 2.5 hours of waiting in the line. They stopped trying to rebook anyone and just immediately gave us a hotel. Then they told us we need to call their reservations hotline to get rebooked. No one would rebook us without calling this number and the hold times for that number were over 2 hours and longer with frequent disconnects. We were told to exit customs and go downstairs to baggage claim to collect our stuff and head to the hotel. We waited 8 hours for our baggage and it never came. We spoke to baggage agents 7 times and had them call our specific bag tag numerous times over with no luck. One agent even showed us a picture of our baggage scanned into the warehouse and knew the exact cage number it was stored in, but no one would retrieve it for us. Baggage agents instead walked around telling people to wait for carousel 10 to have their bags (which was futile) or openly started arguing with customers. Have you seen the weather? It's out of our control! There are many people here waiting, you need to wait! I asked one agent if he could radio for a manager and he said he couldn't, that there was no way for him to get a manager, and that he could not help. The customer service was atrocious. We all knew that weather was not something they could not control, but the baggage operations are within their control and it was a complete and utter failure. After being awake for over 24 hours and trying endlessly to retrieve our baggage, we had to give up. The next morning we ended up hiring a limo service to take us to Buffalo in order to rent a car to get to Nashville. We were never able to contact the rebooking department for help and no one in the airport could help us. My husband has filed a baggage claim for them to send it to us, if they ever get around to getting it. After this, my husband and I have decided to avoid Air Canada at all costs.

### "did not offer any compensation"
London to Los Angeles via Toronto. Online check-in not possible, as ticked issued by United under a code-share flight number, thus stuck in a middle seat for the first leg. London to  Toronto uneventful, plane clean, crew indifferent, service average. Transfer in Toronto - a disorganized disaster. Premium security lane for US bound flights was an insult. Nobody in the airport seemed to be at work, or willing to do anything. Flight was originally delayed by 45 due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft and moved to a new gate. At the new gate, another hour delay was announced. 10 minutes prior to new boarding time, a further 2 hour delay and new change of gate was announced. No attempt from staff to provide water or vouchers. 20 minutes after moving to the new gate (at the opposite end of the terminal), a new announcement came through that the aircraft was now ready to board at the original gate. Following a sprint back to the old new gate on the opposite end of the terminal, finally boarded. Left gate 2 hours after the originally scheduled time and lined up for de-icing, which lasted for another hour or so. Cabin crew did not offer anything during that time except for headphones. Finally airborne, three and a half hours after the originally scheduled time, an apology from the purser for the delay and the generous offering of free headphones to compensate for the inconvenience. Meal for purchase and drinks service began almost 2 hours after take-off, due to sporadic turbulence. First went the cart with the meals for purchase. Water was offered to me for the first time 4 hours after I boarded the plane. Air Canada did not offer any compensation for the four hour delay.

### "worst ground staff"
Took flights from Melbourne to Newark airport via Vancouver. All services up to arriving at Newark was good. However, after 2 hours of waiting for baggage, we have learned that my suit did not come with the aircraft I took from Vancouver. This happened to all people flew from Melbourne. No staff informed any of us the issue until one of us approached the Air Canada service desk. Even after founding out that baggage were misplaced and not arriving the airport on the same date, none of the Air Canada staff were supportive, helpful nor agile ('it is not my fault that baggage did not arrive' quote from an Air Canada ground staff). All reactive with reluctance and very slow process. We had about 20 to 25 people facing the same issue after almost 25 hours of travelling from Melbourne including several very small kids. This is not about missing luggage but about extremely poor services provided to their customers on this occasion. I flew on business class and left the airport without my suitcase after 3.5 hours of arrival due to the extremely inattentive and slow process. This is the worst ground staff service I ever received. Yet, they cannot guarantee if the luggage will be delivered to the assigned address nor could confirm the compensation value they would cover to suffice the minimum required supplies customers need until the luggage/s are returned.

### "Relatively clean airplane"
Quebec to Seoul via Toronto. Relatively clean airplane. No delays. Luggage arrived in good condition and on time. My food was horrible, below average service for me. On this flight i had to get the trash from my tray 3 hours after my meal, walk to the back of the plane. Then I asked the hostess do you have a trashbin please, can i have water please and can i have a snack please? 10 minutes later, they came down the aisle to offer water to the passengers.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  My flight from Penticton to Vancouver in the morning was canceled so we had to take the one in the evening. The flight we had to take from Vancouver to Montreal was now the red eye flight leaving at 23.00. We were now a day late for our hotel reservation and no excuses from Air Canada. On top of that, now we are trying to call Air Canada from Portugal to cancel our flight from Paris to Montreal but cannot get to the customer services due to what they call their new customer service operating computorized system. Very disappointed.

### "configuration is the worst"
London to Calgary. This Boeing 787 configuration is the worst I’ve flown. Waiting at the carousel for 40 minutes after most of the other passengers bags being already claimed with no representatives from AC to explain to the many waiting for bags that they were delayed in London? I’m back to avoiding Air Canada.

### "connecting flight left early"
Toronto to Vancouver. Flight was delayed 1 hr, we asked flight attendants to make it known that our connecting flight (also Air Canada) would be tight for a turnaround time. We were assured time would be made up in the air and our connecting flight was in the gate beside where we were arriving. They were right about the location, but we were denied boarding because that connecting flight left early. Air Canada proposed sending us to Sydney first and then to Brisbane as a workaround. An extra 8 hrs lost before reaching our final destination

### "nice planes and decent service"
Vancouver to London. Check in at the airport was OK, however, Air Canada had just switched over to a new system. Therefore, they were unable to confirm my seats for my onward flight from LHR. The aircraft boarded without any issues and it was a very new looking plane. Quite clean and sparkling actually. The main area that let me down was the food. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian meal and it was very average in quality and quantity. Nothing to impress in this regard. The service was OK otherwise. The plane took off and landed on time. Air Canada - you have nice planes and decent service on board. Please improve your food and I might fly with you more often.

### "service was not business class level"
We had purchased business class or signature class, as Air Canada calls the service with flat beds, tickets. Air Canada changed the aircraft, which had only premium economy and economy class. This A330 is an old SIA / TAP plane with old SIA interior. The service was not business class level, only premium economy. No bread, just butter! Afterwards we wanted to have compensation as we over paid for the service. Cabin service director on that flight, Air Canada website and our own eyes confirmed, layout was premium economy. Ever since then Air Canada has refused to compensate us. ...Requesting a refund for the downgrade from Signature Class to PY. On our end, it shows this passenger was ticketed in Business flew in Business and no downgrade refund is due. Please note, there is nothing further we can respond. Thank you for the final opportunity to review your request. Air Canada has a very primitive way of communication, and they simply do not care if they have made a mistake, and fraudulently "stolen" your money. Stay away, absolutely bad service by hostile personnel.

### "a major disappointment"
Fly between Vancouver and London Heathrow frequently and decided to fly in Air Canada Premium Economy in November. The experience was a major disappointment - the Air Canada premium product is far below the standard offered by other major carriers, including British Airways on the same route. Dinner was marginally better than economy class but wines were exactly the same as offered in economy. Breakfast was appalling - a slice of cake, a small yogurt and one cup of weak coffee. The food on BA is considerably better and they provide a hot breakfast. While the seat was more comfortable than in economy, it came with a flimsy pillow and a useless acrylic sheet that passed for a blanket. BA provides a quilted blanket. Service was generally mediocre; none of the FAs seemed interested in their jobs. Overall, Air Canada’s Premium Economy product and service is disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty additional cost.

### "delayed due to security malfunction"
Some of the worst customer service I have experienced. We were delayed due to a security malfunction in the screening area. We arrived at the gate at 7:06am and were denied entrance for our 7:00am flight. Many people were paged over the intercom about their flights giving them warnings and we were not. The lady at customer service then had the audacity to say “if you were paged, would you have made it?” As if it’s not their responsibility to do so regardless. Also the same lady said there was a flight at 8:00am but she couldn’t book us in because of the time. I was furious at this point as they sent us back out to the ticketing booth where there were about 15 employees behind the desk and only 3 at the computer. We waited over and hour to be attended to. At this point I just wanted to get on the next flight when I was told that a one way ticket would be $700 - more then our original round trip. An absolute scam if you ask me, but of course with everything already booked we really had no choice.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Sudbury via Toronto. Don't trust anything there agents tell you on the phone or in-person about there cancellation policies, no matter what type of ticket you buy you will get screwed out of money! They lie and change their policy to keep your money if you cancel or change flights. Terrible customer service, I wish WestJet would step up and take the reins as Canada's top airlines to stop the kind of things that Air Canada gets away with.

### "no apology from Air Canada"
Booked the flight, Vancouver to San Diego return, because of the departure times. Sometime later the return flight was changed from 12.35 to 17.00 and now arriving into Vancouver at around 20.00 instead of around 15.39 but by now this was too late to get an alternative carrier. At San Diego airport time of departure was listed as on time but a little later was changed to 18.00 then 18.16. It was not until 18.45 we actually took off as we had to wait for the incoming flight which actually arrived at 18.05 to off-load and be cleaned, etc. We finally arrive in Vancouver at 21.50 with no apology from Air Canada. At check-in at San Diego I was told that I had to put my carry-on under the seat (it is smaller than the 55cm x 23cm x 40cm allowed), this did not happen for the Vancouver to San Diego part. So now I was sitting for over 3 hours with my feet on top of a 20cm bag and could not lower the tray as my knees were too high.

### "Very limited food options"
Extremely expensive domestic flights. $764 for one way economy from Vancouver (YVR) to Toronto (YYZ). Booking confirmation says the ticket is fare class H which is supposed to accumulate 100% Aeroplan miles and PQM but when checked in, fare class changes to basic economy and only 25% miles and PQM are given. Priority bags do not come out first. Very limited food options in Maple Leaf Lounge.

### "Terrible seat space"
Edmonton to Las Vegas with Air Canada. Terrible seat space. If you are over 6 foot you will want to upgrade or better yet book Westjet. I fly economy with them at 6'4 and never have an issue. Staff are decent.

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Not Verified |  Excellent staff. I hope someone from Air Canada reads this review. I flew on Monday 11th, November with AC859 from London to Toronto. All the cabin crew were friendly, supportive and looked like they love their job. Most of Air Canada's crews are like that but last night it was beyond good. Although the weather conditions were bad and we landed with delays the captains are awesome sharing with the news and extra smooth take of and landing .They never lost their mood and kept on serving us. Thank you very much.

### "no regard for their customers"
Not Verified |  Worst experience with an airline. We flew from Montego Bay to Toronto Canada as a layover. As we boarded the plane the Captain advised that it was snowing in Canada, but we will be on time. As we arrived to the Toronto airport we spent a hour and a half on the runway. Due to traffic and the airline plowing. You would think they would of plowed ahead of time or at least prepped for snow. So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway. Well we were wrong not only didn’t they let people with connecting flights exit off plane first but the staff and the website lied about the delay. (The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out. So at 11am the next day we received a phone call that we have to check out. Our flight wasn’t due to arrive until 920pm. What were we supposed to do from 11am to at least 7 pm. With no winter clothes because we are coming from Jamaica and we didn’t have our clothes due to the checked bag being on the previous plane. We called several Air Canada customer service lines and we met with excuses. I will never fly Air Canada or will recommend this airline. We were warned but decided to try them out anyway. Lastly, my wife checked for flights and they had a flight leaving Toronto at 11am the next day but Air Canada boomed is on the last flight leaving because it was more convenient for them. Absolutely no regard for their customers.

### "the ticket was pending payment"
Toronto to Providenciales. This is the second time within a year that I have shown up to the airport in Toronto to check in for my flight to discover that the ticket I had booked through their app did not get paid. Last time I missed my flight entirely and Air Canada did nothing to rectify the situation telling me it was an issue with my bank. I ended up flying American. This time I once again arrived at the airport to check in, to discover I had to go to ticketing and purchase the ticket. At no point in either of these situations did I receive a notification that the ticket was pending payment, rather I received a reference number and 24 hours prior to my flight I began receiving check in notifications. This was the similar experience I had last flight. This time when I booked the flight I had my bank on the phone to ensure it wasn’t on their end. They confirmed it was not. Both times due to their issue I was inconvenienced and stressed about not being able to return home to my family in time. Air Canada charged me for my baggage and only offered up that it must be an issue with my bank. Unacceptable service and poor communication. Thankfully I was able to get on my flight this time.

### "an embargo on flying pets"
Whitehorse to Vancouver via Toronto, Air Canada turned me away at the airport. Never try to fly with your pets in the cargo hold. After booking my ticket, I called to book my 2 cats in the cargo hold. I was moving across the country. Everything was fine and I booked my pets. On the day of the flight, I arrived at the airport only to be turned away due to an embargo on flying pets. They did nothing to rectify this and left me stranded. I ended up having to fly with Air North and Westjet who were great.

### "knees touch front seat"
Quebec to Toronto. The seats space between seat are too narrow for me, my knees touch front seat. You Can not assign your seat  until 24h before, calling to airline, waiting time 20-30 min Except tant you paying $150 extra. Good Staff.

### "I enjoyed the cabin feel"
Not Verified |  London to Toronto. I found this trip on Air Canada's B777-300ER pretty overwhelming. I enjoyed the cabin feel and the colours. The IFE was not going to be activated till after takeoff, and that meant that there would be no WiFi until the IFE was on. Then came a cockpit PA 'Attention passengers, this is your captain speaking. We will be delayed by 1 hour due to an accident on the apron. That accident was a pushback truck that broke down, and they needed to move it. They couldn't turn on the IFE until at least one engine was on. One hour later we pushed back, and the IFE came on. I decided to check out the entertainment selection. As this was a 1:30 PM flight, lunch was served shortly after takeoff. My cheesy pasta was sufficient. After the meal, I checked the WiFi, and the prices were pretty reasonable. $29.78 for full flight of WiFi (that's 5 hours from LHR-YYZ). Later in the flight, we were served some kind of pie/wrap thing with chicken in it.

### "pleasant, comfortable trip"
Brisbane to Vancouver. My trip on 4 Sept 19, was a very pleasant, comfortable trip. Staff and food were great. My baggage was damaged on arrival, reported it, got claim no, they did offer immediate repair on wheel if i was to be there for 3 days, however I was on a tour, elected to do it on my return home. Within a week of coming home on 4 Oct 19, I did online claim, easy enough for an girl, response with in 24 hrs, claim settled within 2 weeks. Cant beat that, thanks Air Canada.

### "need to improve their game"
Montreal to Tokyo. The welcoming staff at Montreal airport was unbelievably rude. The check-in machines were not working and there was only one desk open for the check-ins. One desk for the largest company in one of the most important airports in Canada, unbelievable. After 20 minutes of waiting without any improvement, people started asking the staff what was happening and we were just told; "20 minutes is nothing, if you're still in line in 6 hours you can come talk to me again but before that, it's not my problem, get over it". The rest of the check-in and management staff on the ground though were all very nice and accommodating after I have to say. The flight was a 13,5 hours to Tokyo in a Boeing 787. Plane was nice enough and all the cabin crew staff were very good and welcoming. I was not expecting much for the food but this went beyond anything I had. The chicken was white and dry and had a blend tomato sauce with it...I actually felt sick and disgusted after eating it. I don't know what the breakfast was supposed to be but I could not finish it. For an airline that considers itself the best in North America, they really really need to improve their game.

### "tells them to charge the change fee"
Atlanta to Toronto on an Embraer 175. Check-staff were not welcoming to me and did their basic duties without much enthusiasm. My ticket terms stated that I was eligible for same-day standby on an earlier flight, but they insisted on charging me for the change, and could not offer any explanation except "the computer says so". I showed them my ticket and again, they said the computer tells them to charge the change fee. This despite the fact that I had called the airline and the customer service agent on the phone told me to show up early at the airport to make the change free of charge. The flight was rather uneventful. The plane was old, and seats cramped in Economy. The crew were similarly very disinterested and unenthusiastic to me. At the end of the flight, the chief purser stood by the door texting on his phone, and barely acknowledged the passenger disembarking - the crew on the outbound flight three days earlier was a remarkable contrast. Half way through the flight, the entertainment system broke down. The crew said they would reset the system, but they could not.

### "I cannot thank him enough"
Sydney to Vancouver  in February 2020. I actually want to highly commend an Air Canada ticketing agent.! I received incredible service from Gonzalo who went out of his way to assist me in purchasing a B-class economy fare and then upgrading to business using points. He initially could not find any availability for me and I hung up, very disappointed, after thanking him. Gonzalo then did something which NO other Air Canada agent has done and  called me back! He then proceeded to assist me with exactly what I needed. I cannot thank him enough! I think he should receive some commendation from Air Canada for his outstanding and beyond helpful service to travellers flying with Air Canada.

### "Air Canada flights were great"
Not Verified |  We spend several months traveling this Summer and flew with a number of airlines, and Air Canada was the best, head and shoulders above others. They were efficient in getting people on and off their flights, the crew and staff were friendly and genuinely helpful. We didn't expect food on our flights. Not only was there food, but it was good. They have a stopover program, which allowed us to stopover in Toronto for no extra charge. The flight attendants, between them, spoke 7 languages. Where there were lines, the moved people with soon to be departing flight to the front of the line. Here is an example of how great the Air Canada people are. On our flight from London to Toronto there was a man who had taken his 3 children to London (by himself) for a holiday and they were returning home. His 3 children sat together behind us and he sat in an aisle seat across from them. Not long into the flight an exhausted dad fell asleep and the flight attendants took over. Mind you the children were delightful, but the flight attendants were amazing with the children. The flight staff made that flight pleasant for everyone. That was the daytime.flight from London to Toronto on October 15th and the flight staff really should be commended. While that flight was remarkable, all our Air Canada flights were great. I will fly Air Canada every chance I get.

### "completely unhelpful"
Sudbury to Calgary via Toronto. When I booked my ticket, from Sudbury to Calgary the Air Canada website did not show any available options. I had to book Sudbury to Toronto and Toronto to Calgary separately in order to get from Sudbury to Calgary - the website did not do this automatically. The only Toronto-Calgary flight showing was 6h later than preferred (even though this is a frequently travelled route). Thinking that was the only option, I booked it. When I checked again, a few days before my departure, it turns out there were a number of earlier flights available. When I asked to change flights as a result of the website malfunction, the Air Canada employee was completely unhelpful and refused to change my flight notwithstanding my flights were booked at a time during which the Air Canada website was obviously not working properly. Air Canada's failings were many: inability to book a connecting flight on the Air Canada website, failing to show other available flights, and failing to be of any help whatsoever. I am forced to give them a poor rating. I've escalated my claim and will revise my rating if a supervisor ends up being more helpful than the employee who took my call.

### "What a joke"
Not Verified | Fort McMurray to Bathurst via Montreal. Paid $905 dollar for a flight that got cancel in Montreal. I can only get a flight in 24h. Gave me $20 dollars to eat and no hotel to stay at just a number to call for a discount. I wait on the line for 15 min to be told they don't have any more rooms with a discount call back later. What a joke.

### "service was professional"
London to Vancouver. Pre-boarding and on board service all quite good. The service was professional and attentive all through the flight. Food could have been better; Air Canada do not appear to have changed their menu on this route for over a year. IFE quite good though BA offer a  wider choice on this route. Boeing 777-300ER with Air Canada's high density seating configuration is extremely uncomfortable. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable, aisles very narrow and leg room very limited (I'm 5' 9"" tall). For a day time flight, this aircraft is tolerable but I would avoid it if at all possible for an overnight flight.

### "luggage was left at my departure"
Toronto to Vancouver. I fly with this airline weekly for work. On Board the bigger the plane, the tighter the space, very uncomfortable. There have been a few times where attendants have skipped over me on flight. When I ring for service I am again ignored . Today my luggage was left at my departure. So disappointed.

### "Too frustrating"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. Highly unorganized. Never ever going to travel again with this one. Rude staff at the boarding. We were traveling from Montreal to Toronto and they didn't give us any seat though we paid the full amount to buy the tickets. And when we approached the person on the gate - he was too rude to listen to us. And on our flight from Toronto to Montreal - this one was 3hrs late. Too frustrating.

### "What an improvement"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Montreal. What an improvement over my last flight. This time, the food made all the difference. The vegetarian meal was excellent: full of flavour, quality ingredients and was an appropriate size. Red wine on board was delicious as well. I had decided to abandon Air Canada for international flights until I took this flight. It seems, based on my conversation with a crew member, that the airport of origin matters, although I hope it doesn't! Crew was very kind and accommodating, nothing could have been better about this flight given the amount I paid for this portion of my trip. They have an ample selection on their in-flight entertainment system; although I do not judge an airline's quality based on that nor the availability of Wi-Fi; but rather treat them as bonuses.

### "seat was comfortable"
Not Verified | London to Toronto. This was a smooth flight, and the landing was not good, food was not good, flight attendants were ok, it was a clean plane, and the seat was comfortable.

### "stewardess was great"
Toronto to Munich. The stewardess I spoke to about making sure my Border Collie was on the plane was great! She took my seat number and name and got back to me saying she spoke directly to the gentleman who put her on the plane. Although I panicked because she didn’t get back to me right away and I asked another stewardess who was not quite so friendly, telling me ”how would I know if your dog is on the plane?” I explained she could ask the captain at which point she asked me for proof that I had a dog, I gave it to her and she went off to ask, coming back with a yes.

### "most garbage experience"
Montreal to Seattle. It all started with them making check my vest because it had studs and spikes. Then my flight was delayed a ton and they didn’t think it’d be an issue with me landing 5 minutes after boarding started on my connection. I brought this up to customer service multiple times and they just shrugged and dismissed it without any investigation or consideration. Once I arrived they canceled my connecting flight because they couldn’t transfer the luggage that I was forced to check on time. They scheduled me for a flight literally 24 hours later. I refused and asked for an alternate so they sent me to Vancouver and say they’ll have a hotel for me on arrival. I arrive at 11:30 and they have no clue about any hotel. I’m dealing with them for another hour before they get management to book a room. I don’t get to it till nearly 1:30 am. I leave wake up at 5:30 to get ready and catch my morning connection. While in immigration and customs line I get a text saying they canceled my connection and pushed me back to another flight 2 hours later. I called customer service and they just gave the same dismissive attitude. At this point, I’m running off of 4 hours of sleep and have missed all my work meetings for the day. They show no sense of remorse or need to remedy it. I called to demand some sort of refund but they just said to send them an email. Not worth the price they charge by a long shot and by far the most garbage experience I’ve ever had with an airline.

### "wonderful staff and captain"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Toronto with Air Canada. 7+ hour flight. Boarded and took off quickly. Really wonderful staff and captain. Very proud of what they do. Multiple announcements to keep us in the know throughout the flight. Actually great food.

### "unpleasant and unprofessional"
Not Verified |  I have been flying Air Canada - Toronto-Delhi-Toronto for the last 3 years (Premium Economy and Business), at least once a year. The service has been good and bad i.e. not really consistent but nothing so bad that it would motivate me to take time out to write a review. However, this time when I was flying direct to New Delhi from Toronto on Oct 8th, AC042, 22.10 departure, I had some experiences worth noting. Once we settled in the air hostess came to take our dinner order (choice between veg and non-veg). Coincidentally, my husband and I were the last 2 people she got to in a section of 22 passengers. Her words were: Unfortunately you will have to get the vegetarian option as that’s the only option left. We got a little irritated by her choice of words as we have paid the same fare as every other passenger in that section. So if every other passenger has been given a choice, why shouldn’t we be. And we expressed this with the air hostess. She said: “I will bring someone else to talk to you about it.” She then comes back after having a chat with her colleagues and said they’ll see what they can do about the meal. I am vegetarian so I would have chosen that option anyway. But just the way she said it was quite unprofessional. Over the span of the rest of the 13 hour flight, she was quite unpleasant and unprofessional whenever she would be serving us. She came to our seats to get our meal trays back but no thank you or a smile. Courtesies like these are basic tenats of any customer-facing industry, let alone airlines or hospitality which is quite a competitive market. Additionally, I rang the call bell once during my entire flight, and it took the staff 20 minutes and multiple times switching off and on to grab one of their attention. Even though they were walking up and down the aisle a couple of time. Maybe Air Canada needs to invest in training their staff on how to provide the best customer service that they claim in their advertising. Overall, it was quite disappointing for the fare prices we paid.

### "hosts seem frustrated"
Osaka to Vancouver. Air hosts seem frustrated and made us feel as if they were doing us a favour by having us on board. I’m not going to complain about seats and food because yes when you pay for economy you’re not expecting luxury. Even just making way on the aisle and the simple requests were not pleasant exchanges. The air conditioning was leaking on my seat and tissue had been stuffed into the vent to prevent this. After take off it stopped but when notifying the cabin crew there was an issue they just said we can’t do anything about it. I didn’t ask for anything but just to notify them there was tissue shoved in the vent. Don’t really expect much from North American Airlines. The east and Middle East do a much better job in all classes.

### "So disappointed with them"
Not Verified | I have no idea how Air Canada has won any awards. I fly with them monthly and have nothing but issues with this airline. Last flight from Chicago to Vancouver I get a text that there is an issue with the entertainment system and the plane didn't even have screens on a flight over 4 hours. My flight home to Edmonton we were given 3 seats to myself and not one of the headphone jacks worked. So disappointed with them.

### "went above and beyond"
Toronto to London. This review is only for Check-In desk staff. My kid and parents were travelling, and their seats were not together. The staff were humble and helpful and went above and beyond to get their seats together. I really appreciate her efforts as my kid was just 21 months old. I'm really thankful to that lady.

### "this crew went above and beyond"
This past Thursday we were on our way back to Vancouver from DC through Montreal with Air Canada. On the second leg of the trip, we were seated in the 15th row (preferred seating) in front of the exit row and discovered our seats didn’t recline. We asked the flight director if we could move and before take off he remembered our request and moved us to two vacant bulkhead seats. The rest of the flight crew were just as professional and attentive. We felt it was important to acknowledge that this crew went above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable!

### "not one crew member came to my assistance"
Not Verified |  Toronto to New Delhi. I waited to purchase duty-free and was told that the it was impossible to do so as there are less than 2 hours left in the flight. I originally pushed the service button 1.5 hours prior to the duty-free closing and not one crew member came to my assistance. I then went and flagged down a crew member explaining the fact that I've been waiting for 1.5 hours to have someone bring me duty free. She then left and said that she would return in 15 mins. 15 mins later she came back notifying me that the flight had passed the 2-hour marker and was unable to provide duty-free. So, because it wasn't my fault and yet the crew members for not entertaining to the service call, I have realized how bad Air Canada is and as a Canadian disappointed at the service we offer. Will never be using Air Canada again. Would rather fly with an airline that cares about the travellers.

### "had a bad experience"
Dubai to Toronto. I was travelling with 3 kids and my husband. My 2nd daughter got a bug bite. It is very common for her to get that. It was itchy and she was crying. The lady behind us told the flight attendant that she was hurt. The flight attendant called nurse on board and one nurse came and assisted her. Everything was okay. She didn’t get any medications and slept good. Before reaching Toronto airport, I asked the flight attendant, do we have any procedures to do because of the bug bite? She said, just give your address and she was the one who was doing everything. But, when we went to the gate for boarding to Regina, they said, we are not allowed to travel until we get approval from med- assistant. They send us to the customer service. It was very hard for us because I had to travel with 3 kids and walk all the way to customer service. They all were tired of 2 days of travel. I didn’t get good experience from the person at the customer service. We missed our flight to Regina. We called med- assistant. The med-assistant said, my daughter has to be consulted by on call doctor in air canada. Otherwise, I have to take my kid to a clinic and fill out a 6 page form! But without doing this all, they sent us to Winnipeg. So we had a bad experience in our travel.

### "don't recommend Air Canada"
Not Verified | Montreal to Dubai via Toronto. I would like to express my disappointment with Air Canada customer service. I had a flight delay in Montreal, causing me to miss my flight from Toronto to Dubai. Customer service failed to book an alternative flight and they are not responding to my communications through emails, and no one is answering when I am calling on the phone. In Montreal, me and some other passengers were promised a booking for a direct flight from Toronto to Dubai. When we reached Toronto airport, we were surprised that they booked us on British Airways via London with no consideration to the class of booking we had or visa restrictions some might have which was clearly explained by me to their staff in Montreal. The only option was Emirates. Air Canada staff couldn't book us on Emirates with an excuse of no seats available. I booked on Emirates myself, and since then I am sending emails for refunds, and to express my disappointment, with no response and no care for my needs as a customer. I really don't recommend Air Canada, because if you got stuck with the customer service, you will never receive good service, neither help.

### "very happy with the service"
✅ Trip Verified |  . I was very happy with the service in this flight. At Rome airport, Air Canada provides access for business class passengers travelling to the Casa Italia (Air Italia) lounge which was a memorable experience with all the Italian flair one experiences in Italy with food wine and hospitality. The plane left on time and the pilot strolled through the cabin before we left and advised us we would arrive in Montreal half an hour early. This was excellent news as I was making a connection at Trudeau Airport for another flight to my home. The food and wine were excellent on the flight and the staff were friendly and provided service when needed. I also really liked the selection of films on the IFE as I am travelling on quite a few Air Canada flights this fall and I appreciated that there are still more films I look forward to seeing. I'm a tall guy and was in the air on this and a subsequent flight for 13 hours so I really appreciated the big comfortable seat/bed, pillow, blanket and service. I highly recommend their business class service if you are travelling to or from Europe.

### "One of the most bland meals"
Ottawa to London. I had ordered the Jain meal, just to see what it was about. It came on a tiny tray with a small container of a few slices of cucumber and tomato, a container of pieces of fruit and a hot container with steamed basmati rice, steamed broccoli and a portion of chick peas. One of the most bland meals I have had. The second round of food was a dry rice cake and fruit. The seats are not very comfortable; they should consider to replace them with the type of seat where the bottom slides forward and the inside of the back changes angle. How does this airline maintain its 4 stars when supposedly inferior airlines offer better food and seats in economy? Had the meal been better, the rating would have been a 7/10 or 8/10. I will seriously consider connecting in Montreal to access European airlines and avoid Air Canada.

### "not interested in their clients"
Had a serious delay at the Canadian Border, so tried to call Customer Services to inform them that I might be late in check in. Was on hold for +15 minutes twice. No operator or consultant available. Arrived at the airport 15 minutes before gate closed, informed client manager at the checkin line. Was told to wait my turn. Obviously then missed the flight. The ticketing office offered me a ticket at 3x the original price. For my luggage refund I have to apply online  but that could take weeks. Customer service at the ticketing counter was callous and not interested in their clients. I was in the line there for another 20 minutes. As a consumer I will vote with my wallet. Air Canada will never have the pleasure of my clientele ever again.

### "competing to get worse"
Toronto to Vancouver. This airline is getting more and more ridiculous by the day. They keep eliminating staff and replacing them with machines. Remaining staff are getting more and more useless. Now they have started charging for one single luggage unless you pay their high fares. If you want to check in your small carry on bag they charge you $30. Limited food options in domestic/North American flights are outrageous for what they are for such low quality and the food in international routes are hardly digestible. In the world that most airlines are competing to get worse Air Canada is one of the top contenders.

### "Very disappointed"
Vancouver to Yellowknife. The flight itself is fine, flight crew are nice, but the customer service on the phone is horrible. My bag got lost on the way to Yellowknife. I am here for work on a tv show and have speciality clothing and other things I need to go to work with and they cannot tell me where my bag is. The call centre seems like it is in another country and they have no idea what they’re talking about. Very disappointed with this customer service and I still have not received my bag.

### "pleasantly surprised by the leg room"
Brisbane to Vancouver. From the moment we were greeted by the cabin crew, we knew we were in for a good flight. We were very pleasantly surprised by the leg room and general space of the aircraft. The food options were suitable for the journey and the cabin was well lit to reduce jet lag.

### "always the same garbage"
Not Verified |  Punta Cana to Toronto. Air Canada just get worse and worse by the minute. This company should be shut down. There is always an issue of some sort. My son arrived at YYZ at 6:45 pm. It is now almost 8 pm and in still waiting outside for him. Not to mention I just received another update from him saying they would be another 45 minutes. This is an absolute disgrace. It's always the same garbage.

### "enjoyable experience all round"
Toronto to Vancouver. Flight left on time, cabin crew extremely friendly and attentive. Two servings for tea/coffee etc and one for water plus the meal service. Tried the Bistro Menu for the first time - not great but fine if you are hungry and the price reasonable. Greeted by attendants and Captain upon leaving the aircraft. An enjoyable experience all round.

### "made our check in so smooth and easy"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Vancouver. Employee who works for Air Canada at the counter LAX by the name of Gloria was so accommodating and lovely when we arrived. She made our check in so smooth and easy.

### "flight was late"
La Guardia to Toronto. The day I started my journey from Toronto Pearson airport the flight was late by one and half hours and today I am returning to Canada by the same airline and the flight time was at 5:45pm but after reaching to LaGuardia airport suddenly they have change flight departure time to 7pm. And again after one hour, they have changed departure time to 7:30 pm. It is really frustrating and boring. It seems to be the service of this airline is very bad. Above all, I need to pick my car from the park n fly zone. No doubt I am going to lose money due to this delay. My question is who will take this responsibility for my financial loss and stress which is going to hurt my health.

### "forced us to check carry-on bags"
San Francisco to Toronto. Just got on a flight in which the staff at the check in counter was extremely rude and forced us to check our legally sized carry-on bags. We were part of boarding group 3 and they claimed that the overhead storage was already full. When boarding the plane, we realized that the storage compartments nearly wide open. The remaining 3 groups continued to bring carry-on bags much larger than ours into the main cabin overheads. The flight attendant was appalled that the checking agent forced us to check our bags and she did everything that she could to get our bags up to the main cabin (she was the only competent person that we encountered and deserves a raise). The fact that the checking agents decided to single us out was absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. Air Canada, you have every opportunity to make the boarding experience pleasant and fair, there is absolutely no excuse for this kind of incompetence.

### Air Canada customer review
Vancouver to Paris. Very poor experience with Air Canada. Very hard seat, because space optimization has gone too far. Very bad food (vegan like pasta with no taste at all, awful salad and cheap chocolate muffin). Worst entertainment system, you must watch 5 minutes of ads before doing any of your choice (films, musique or game) you have access  to music compilations with no possibility of selecting a precise artiste or soundtrack. This company has a service level more similar to low cost.

### "Great flight with Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Melbourne. This flight was the largest flight of my trip and my second last flight of my 5 flight trip and my first time on Air Canada. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and how chatty they where, they wanted to know how my time was in Canada which i thought was nice considering i was flying only in economy class. The seats where very comfy compared to Lufthansa and the in flight entertainment was much better than Lufthansa. Overall the flight went quick because of the great service, food, entertainment and comfort! I recommend Air Canada for long haul flights to and from Canada, but i will stick to Singapore Airlines for the rest of the world only because of their reward system is amazing! Great flight with Air Canada.

### "seat was quite uncomfortable"
Vancouver to Osaka. Check in and boarding we’re fine for AC039. The seat was quite uncomfortable and seemed smaller than what I remember on other 787s. The meals were just pathetic,  served in plastic containers and virtually tasteless for me. Choice of pasta or chicken with rice. We had to struggle to tear off the sealed  lid. No drink before the meal. Only plastic bottles of wine or beer on offer with the meal and only one was permitted for me. I was disappointed as I was looking forward to the flight. I hadn’t flown AC internationally for a long time (I live in Bangkok) and usually fly CX. I remember AC international inflight service as being pretty good. What happened?

### " bags would not make the transfer"
Toronto to Philadelphia. I flew business class via Air Canada. Due to some unknown delay (this was not mentioned during the flight, prior to, nor after landing) they determined that my bags would not make the transfer between gates, (landed at 17:10, with a flight departure of 18:10, that did not depart until 18:22). 60 minutes between, based on the scheduled departure time, 72 minutes, actual time. I was able to get to the gate on time, but ran to be sure. I arrived at the gate, F34, which was still boarding Zone 2, at 18:04. Upon attempting to board, I was informed that I had been moved. The Gate agent was rude and offered exactly no consolation other than the new ticket, which was scheduled to not leave until 21:20; 3 hours later. The immediate prior time flying with Air Canada, also to Malpensa, we were delayed for 24 hours, causing us to miss out on our Lake Como part of our Milan trip. I will not book Air Canada again.

### "experience was very frustrating"
Today's experience with Air Canada was very frustrating. I got up at 4.30 am to catch a flight to Ottawa. The flight was cancelled due to mechanical failures. I was re-directed on another flight and was reassured both in my destinations of departure and arrival that my luggage would follow shortly. It is now two hours past the arrival of my luggage and I am being told it will arrive at my hotel before midnight. Will it? I am exhausted and have my most important meeting tomorrow. This is not good.

### "refund for the change in class"
When Air Canada canceled the Boston to Montreal flight for no good reason we missed our Montreal connection to Lyon and ended moving from business class to coach on TAP Airlines through Lisbon. We barely made it to Lyon and the first Women's World Cup we were going to watch with our two grandchildren.. On return I asked for a refund for the change in class where the difference in fare was over $800. They offered $72. I am still fighting them.

### "Air Canada offered no courtesy"
Second time flying with Air Canada. First was last August, Boston - Kelowna via Toronto. Due to delayed flight, missed connection, Air Canada offered no courtesy and we had to sleep on the floor of Toronto as it was delayed by 8 hours overnight. This time, flight delayed from Kelowna to Calgary, missed connection in Calgary to London. Air Canada offered nothing other than a rebook on the next flight. I lost a whole day in the UK. Not okay! Lady at airport was lovely but outcome was still insanely disappointing. Couldn’t forget the feeling they were basically ‘sucks for you, how about you pay for an upgrade and we’ll get you there on time!’ Terrible. Never flying again after this trip.

### "special meal was cold"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Tokyo. My special meal which was prebooked was given to me cold. The pasta dish was still cold and the quinoa salad on the side was frozen. When kindly mentioning this to one of the flight attendants, she told me that there was nothing she could do about the frozen salad, but she could heat up my pasta meal a bit more. No apologies or effort to get me another salad that was not frozen. Despite reheating my meal, it was still slightly cold when returned to me. Nobody went above and beyond to make up for the poorly served meal. I will be making sure to avoid booking with Air Canada again in the future.

### "keep my inbound flight"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Calgary. I had called air Canada because I needed to change my flight. I ran into so many problems when calling in, I had asked to change my flight to a different day, when they said that this was not possible I asked to cancel my outbound flight but keep my inbound flight. To which they said this could not be done. I asked my and the representative told me that it just couldn’t. When trying to check into my inbound flight they would not allow me, saying I had forfeited both flights. They gave me a huge run around when trying to figure out what was happening.

### "experience that she will never forget"
Toronto to Hong Kong in Premium Economy for the first time. Although it is significantly more expensive than economy, it is also significantly better. 10 across in Economy is painful. The reason I am writing this review and would give Air Canada top marks is the experience that they (and one particular person) gave to my daughter. She was running down the aisles multiple times in the middle of the 15.5 hour flight and got the attention of one of the flight attendants, Joyce. After getting our ok, she spent the next hour showing my daughter how the whole back of the plane service worked and gave my daughter an experience that she will never forget. She was amazing and Air Canada is lucky to have her.

### "my flight there and back has been changed"
Booked airline tickets in April 2019 with Air Canada from Vancouver, Canada to Cancun Mexico on their regular airline. And once again, received notice this August, my flight there and back has been changed to Air Canada Rouge (new flight numbers, different aircraft, changed time departures). I have phoned Air Canada and asked to speak to a supervisor and requested to be seated in "preferred seating" at no addition cost as compensation for being "downgraded" but they refused my request. I will try again after Dec 15, 2019 when the new Air Passenger regulations come into effect. I hope the new regulations will put an end to Air Canada rescheduling their flights from regular aircraft to their low-cost carrier, Rouge without compensation to the Air Canada clients. Seat comfort is terrible on Rouge.

### "missed the Air Canada flight"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Ottawa. I flew with a different airline from Dublin to Toronto and I missed the Air Canada flight as it took hours to get through immigration control so I went to the Air Canada desk to ask. The man serving me did not seem to know what to do, as all flights for the night were full which I was fine with but when he told me I was rebooked onto the one the next morning he did not print me a boarding pass and sent me to call the help line on the phones in the airport. After half an hour of trying to get through I went to speak to someone else who did print my boarding pass, thankfully not with the rebooking charge I was previously told as missing my flight was through no fault of my own. Then when I had my next flight the following morning it was delayed.

### "cancelled connecting flight"
We were traveling from Beijing to Philadelphia and making a transfer at Toronto. Air Canada cancelled our connecting flight at the last minute. Since we traveled with a 10-month-old infant, we asked the airline staff to please help us book the next available flight, but no one was willing to help. All the staff in the airport are so indifferent. Overall, the experience with Air Canada and Toronto airport was terrible.

### "wait for a week for my bag"
wait for a week for my bagI travelled to Toronto on the 12th August to find that my bag didn't arrive when I landed in Toronto. The desk staff "assured" me that my bag will be delivered the next day however I had to wait for a week for my bag to be given to me. Furthermore, my bag wasn't even delivered to me, I had to make a 3hr trip to the airport to retrieve it on the 19th August paying over $30 for parking. Air Canada assured me that my bag will be delivered to my address in Toronto but they never bothered to send my bag over from Dublin which meant that Aer Lingus, who I must say was one of the only reasons my bag was delivered to me, had to send my bag over. Furthermore, Air Canada knew that my bag was in Toronto but didn't bother to collect it from the Aer Lingus desk until we went to the airport to force them to collect it. All the staff at the airport were unfriendly and didn't want to help us until we called for the baggage manager who finally helped us with our case. When I finally received my bag, it was in a terrible state, there were multiple scratches and scuffs and the wheels were broken. I had no clothes, toiletries or anything for the 1st week in Toronto so I had to go out and buy new clothes and toiletries spending over $200. The customer service for delayed baggage at Air Canada is next to useless as the calls were directed to an Indian call centre where the people never helped my cause and never apologized for the bag being delayed. The lack of customer service made the situation worse and made me feel like I was treated like rubbish by the airline. As for the actual plane itself, it was an A330-300 which had terrible legroom and an outdated IFE screen with the USB port on my seat not working.

### "seat leg room is getting smaller"
I've been a frequent traveler of AC for a while now (last 3 years - 50/75/50k) and from my experience flying with AC is getting worse and worse. The seat leg room is getting smaller, the fleet is aging, and the airline has consistent staffing issues. I am not sure if the staffing issue is related to the number of people they staff causing burnout in their ranks or poor training, but as a customer it is definitely felt. In my experience besides the order of boarding and access to the lounge, Altitude status is irrelevant.

### "has never been on time"
I have been flying Air Canada to Calgary from Boston through Toronto for the last five years. Each year the Boston to Toronto leg has been at least three hours late leading due to broken connections. It has never been on time. Avoid. I will be flying Delta through Minneapolis or Salt Lake next year.

### "checked bags were not free"
We were a family of 4 (with young children, one with a freshly broken arm) flying 3 flights from London, ON - Toronto - Vancouver - Terrace, BC. Upon arriving at the airport we discovered that our supposedly 2 free checked bags were not free. We got the TD Aeroplan card  because we were told that the primary card holder gets a free checked bag, so my husband and I got them. No one told us that we only got them free if we booked with aeroplan points, which we didn't this time because we didn't have enough points yet. The Air Canada attendant who told us this information was not very friendly or polite, but I stayed super friendly with the lady the whole way through it all. The lady went and got sheets and pointed out the details. So we had no choice but to pay for the bags. If I had known in advance, we would of left a lot of our stuff at my parents home and only took what fit in our carry on. we would of brought that stuff later when flying home with West Jet where we get 1 free checked bag for myself and everyone else flying with me no matter how we pay for our flights. After paying someone told me that she had the authority to waive the bag fees if she wanted to. After this experience I did not want to fly Air Canada again. But on our last flight from Vancouver to Terrace which was delayed the attendants were amazing, they were full of smiles and super friendly even with all the stress they had of trying to get the plane ready for people who had been waiting a long time. They had great personalities and were great with all the kids on board. Because of them on the last flight, I might decided to fly Air Canada again, but at this point I will book future flights with WestJet where I get free 1st checked bags for myself and anyone flying with me no matter how I pay for my flights. Also I have never had an issue with their service with WestJet. I used to work in customer service and giving super great happy customer services was a big thing for me, so I expect the same when spending my money on service and products. I would of given a 0 rating, but because of our last flight with the super great attendants I wont give it a 0 rating.

### "a much better experience"
London to Toronto and this was a much better experience with Air Canada than the one I enjoyed last Monday and Tuesday, because although my flight back to London in 19th August 2019 was ok the only bad part about the flight was that I sat in the back of the plane and it was the worst place to sit on a plane because of the engines being so loud and felt big turbulence. But, my flight to Toronto on 21st July 2019 was much better because a great part about the flight was that I was originally supposed to sit in 21H aisle seat but they changed it to 21K window seat and it was the best seat I had and the engines were much quieter but on my return flight.

### "No apologies, no explanations"
Not Verified |  MEX-YUL: The flight is operated by Air Canada Rouge. Check In and Boarding Gate staff in MEX is fantastic, polite, courteous and efficient. Legroom is insufficient, I am not tall, and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. No personal entertainment screens, you need to download the app. Food being sold on the plane is mediocre, bring your own snacks. Crew was actually nice and helpful. YUL-YYZ-BOG: Couldn’t check in online or the kiosk, so forced to go to the counters. A very long check in line, 1 agent attending the general line. Since I travelled alone with a small child and quite a lot of baggage, I attempted to use the special assistance line. Immediately confronted by a very rude agent, who barked at me for not standing in the right place. All she had to do was move me 1 meter to the families check in, but in her very rude and arrogant way she sent me to the check in entrance. Was attended by another agent who was very rude and arrogant. Apparently, my flight was cancelled, I had to stay 24 hrs. in Montreal. No apologies, no explanations, just rude and condescending attitude. No effort to accommodate me on another flight. Next day: Again, could not use the kiosk, had to use the check in counters. Ground staff in YUL is rude, slow, inefficient, the agent attending families was taking passengers from the general line. Flight YYZ-BOG: Crew was nice and friendly, but the airplane is old, dirty, worn out seats, no inflight entertainment. Altogether, I would spend my money elsewhere.

### "Seat is extremely hard"
Seoul to Toronto. Photogenic but uncomfortable! Air Canada Business Class is probably the worst of the herringbone configuration designs. Seat is extremely hard and the space between the bed and the table is very limited, almost impossible to turn without hitting the table with your knees when in the sleeping position. AC does not provide pajamas and their amenity kit is so cheap.

### "this used to be a reputable airline"
I used this airline for return flights to Toronto and from Havana to Montreal. Even for 5 hour flights, this airline does not serve food or alcoholic drinks. The seats are narrow and there is not much legroom. Also, the web checkin site (3rd August 2019) did not work for the 24 hours prior to the flight. I then called the customer services and, twice, had to wait for almost an hour before someone took my call before telling me that he could not help me at all. Worst of all, from Toronto, August 3rd 2019, my flight was delayed by more than 2.5 hrs. Air Canada did not inform me, infact, their web page still showed the original time as being 'on time'. A service called tripcase informed me about the delay. At the airport, the check in machines did nit work either. Many years ago this used to be a reputable airline. Not any longer, it seems. There are other choices, fortunately.

### "6 days without my bag"
Madrid to Toronto. My bag is delayed for 6 days now, and the staff in Air Canada is careless. I am without clothes for 6 days and they are careless. I flew from Madrid to Toronto on the 14th August. Before I leave I asked Air Canada about my bag, they told my they have it, but it wont be on the same flight, it will arrive tomorrow. When I arrived to Toronto, I informed Air Canada about it again, they registered it in the system & told me it will be delivered in 24 hours. It didn’t arrive. Now it’s been 6 days without my bag.

### "Air Canada had terminated the Toronto to Delhi route"
On 2/3/19, I purchased a one layover trip with Air Canada to Delhi, India (round trip route: 7/21: DC-Toronto-Delhi 8/5: Delhi-Toronto-DC). However, 10 days before our departure day (7/12), I received an email letting me know that my flight schedule had changed. After speaking with a representative I was informed that Air Canada had terminated the Toronto to Delhi route and that I would have to be placed on different flights in order for me to reach my destination at the dates I had initially selected. After a few back and forths, I was able to be placed on a two layover journey to India, with the following route: 7/21: DC-Montreal-Munich-Delhi, 8/5: Delhi-Vancouver-Toronto-DC. As a result of this change, my initial one layover ~18h trip turned into a two layover ~26h voyage. Additionally, when booking my trip, I was asked to select and pay for my seats, as the seats were not free of charge. Once I had boarded, I realized that I had not been assigned to the seats I purchased. I contacted Air Canada about this but never received a reply. On August 4, 2019 (one day before the return flight), I received a text message from Air Canada letting me know that the AC45 return flight on 8/5 would be departing at 5.55am (although the return flight I had initially been placed on was scheduled to leave at 7.40am). Over the course of my return, the boarding gate for two out of the three flights were changed shortly before boarding, resulting in a delay for one of the flights.

### "the best business class seat"
London to Toronto via Halifax. It's definitely not the old AC business class. No drinks order before take-off,  no champagne offered only mimosa, maybe time of day. Meals delivered automaton by most of the crew (a couple stood out for warmth) but I have to say the London kitchens came through again for vegan with a delicious chick pea curry, mushrooms, steamed spinach and baked tomato. The Toronto AC kitchens should take note as mostly appalling idea of vegan food served from them. I had the croissant, I know not vegan but worth the stray. Other than meal service crew were scarce. 60 minutes after take off and no drink or crew member seen. I had to press the call button after a couple of hours to order some red wine, no top up after the meals at all. Still the best business class seat in North America and though entertainment was pretty mediocre compared to years ago I managed to find something on HBO to keep me hooked the whole flight.

### "mess of a boarding process"
London to Toronto. A 2 hour delay for unexplained scheduling issues (no other delayed flights at LHR). Complete mess of a boarding process meant the whole thing turned into a melee. The policy of 2 carry on bags meant that we wasted 20 minutes trying to find space for everyone’s hand luggage. Also an old plane which hadn’t been fully cleaned.

### "inside left a lot to be desired"
Flew Montreal Dublin on one of their new A330. Brand new paint job on the outside but the inside left a lot to be desired. Faulty recline, old seats, wonky tray tables, very dated and tatty cabin. Entertainment screens failed before they started, crew had no idea what to do. Not a big deal as these things happen and crew handed out coupons. A week later the return flight, same plane and the gate attendants tell us the entertainment systems still not working. What are you playing at air Canada? Why are you sending defective aircraft on transatlantic flights, really not on, you had a week to fix it. The 1 in this rating is for the cabin crew who were good. Looking forward to Aer Lingus doing the route next year.

### "not a sufficient time to transfer"
Not Verified |  I have purchased Air Canada ticket at a higher price in order to get a shorter connection time. Instead I got delayed 1 hr from Milan to Toronto and 2.5 hrs from Toronto to Montreal. When I asked the customer service why I could not make an earlier flight from Toronto to Montreal I was told that 1.5 hrs was not a sufficient time to transfer the baggage. It looks like 1.5 hrs min was enough for baggage transfer when I paid for my initial itinerary, at least thats how it was presented.

### "Seats are too tight"
Toronto to Shanghai. Seat comfort terrible. Air Canada used to be average airline, but now aircraft configuration is such that passenger comfort is least thought. Seats are too tight and so few washrooms with long lines on ultra long flights like mine.

### "Both flights delayed"
Both flights from Toronto to Montreal and Montreal to Toronto delayed. First from Toronto to Montreal because the captain was late then because some of the crew was late. Waited 2h in the plane without moving. Coming back from Montreal to toronto delayed again, over an hour waiting in the plane. Captain makes an announcement apologizing for delay but they are still waiting for passengers supposed to be on the plane. I guess next time I can sleep in and Air Canada will park the plane and wait for me. Never flew aircanada and not had an issue to I would definitely suggest staying away if possible. Book another airline and save yourself the pain.

### "No vegetarian option"
Not Verified |  Toronto to London. Boeing 787, so ok aircraft. Premium economy so bigger seats. Onboard staff don’t know how to smile. Only small glass of orange juice or water in premium econ (compared to virgin where you get Prosecco). Food really odd. A breakfast omelette with fried potatoes and creme freche - on a 7hr flight 9am to 9pm Toronto to LHR. Followed by a turkey and cheese rol. No vegetarian option without booking ahead, and a breakfast followed by snack on a 7hr flight? No lunch. Like being on a bus, but costing nearly £2k a seat.

### "flight was not one of the best"
Toronto to Rome. Excellent Check In process in dedicated area, our Oversize luggage was handled efficiently. Maple Leaf Lounge lacked European Newspapers and was tired. Efficient Boarding process, no welcome drinks or attention prior to take off (The Purser told be she had a late arriving Commissary and was struggling to Board 450 passengers hence no service in Business Class prior to take off). Comfortable Lie Flat Seats, Good selection of Wine & Champagne. Dinner was acceptable but poorly presented. Excellent Breakfast with a freshly cooked Omelette. Service was courteous and efficient but lacked charm and it really seemed that the Cabin Crew were just going through the motions. On Time departure and arrival. We will continue to fly Air Canada Business Class but this flight was not one of the best we have experienced.

### "how I can get my bag back?"
La Guardia to Dublin via Toronto. When I checked in to my flight, I already knew I would miss my connection with them so I asked them to make sure they do not lose my bags (the flight was delayed due to weather). When I reached my gate, I asked the agent to check my connection and she said I came too late to her because there are no more flights to my final destination the next two days. I have been delayed and missed my connection on many airlines but none were as disorganized as this. The first leg of my flight was New York to Toronto. In Toronto, my bag was already lost. I reached there 2 am and the lady did not file a claim when I told her my bag was lost and rather told me to return the next day to find it.The next day I returned to find it 4 hours before my next flight and they still did not find it in time for the bag to make my connection. They told me to file a claim when I reached my final destination but AC was very dismissive here at my final destination of Izmir in Turkey and did not allow me to file a claim with them. When I tried to file a claim online, I needed a incident report number, but since no one ever filed a claim for me, I never received an incident number. On the phone they were very unhelpful and rude. First of all I had to wait 21 minutes to even get an agent and then they told me to just file a "lost and found item". Now I am trying to understand how I can get my bag back?

### "flight was changed to 12.35"
Toronto to San Francisco. This is the worst flight I have had. There was a long overlay in Toronto, my flight was 8.00 that was changed to 12.35. They did not put me on an earlier flight, and put me in a middle seat. Never again.

### "Staff were very friendly"
Flew Air Canada from YVR to NRT and back to YVR and flight was pretty good. Seatback pockets were average. Price was pretty good. They had boarding zones assigned into like 6 lines which were nice. Seat was not very comfortable, would prefer leather seats with more cushioning. Staff were very friendly and spoke multiple languages. IFE had an ok selection. Food was good at times. Recline was average.

### "handled situation very poorly"
Toronto to Philadelphia flight never happened because of bad weather. We flew in from Calgary and should be connected at Toronto-Pearson to Philadelphia. But they changed our gate twice, then announced our flight is cancelled without giving us instruction what going to happen next. Then we asked them they sent us to the Air Canada info desk which the representative stated “there is nothing they can do at the moment bc all flights are going to Philadelphia because of bad weather. They took us to a private hallway and handed us refund info card. And told us our baggage will be at claim 10. Baggage took 1.5 hours to get out. They automatically booked us for the next afternoon flight. Then again, canceled that and rebooked is for two day later flights. Nobody contact us for any help. We were left stranded there and had to find our means to get out to Toronto. Work loss. Time wasted over the phone. Air Canada handled this situation very poorly and irresponsible. The weather in Philadelphia wasn’t bad as they were telling us. Our friends and family in Philadelphia were confused bc the weather was fine. We are never going to fly Air Canada again. It is frustrated and sicking now that I am sitting on a megabus to nyc and then Philadelphia.

### "staff very unhelpful"
Toronto to Montreal. Problems with IT systems and lack of sufficient staff to deal with backlog. Pre paid luggage but not able to check, staff very unhelpful.

### "the passengers were slobs"
Rome to Toronto. Seats were comfortable, Seat belt was really sticky. Service wasn't friendly to me and my entertainment wasn't fully functional. Regarding other passengers on the flight, what a group of slobs before - when I used the bathroom halfway through the flight, there was a cup filled with paper towels, toilet wasn't flushed etc. I can't blame Air Canada for this, but some of the passengers were slobs.

### "had to wait hours in Toronto"
Prague to Toronto where I was supposed to continue on flight to Washington DC at 2pm. With me I only had a carry on luggage which I took with me on board. I was trying to find a place to store my luggage and one steward told me he will take care of it. That was really nice of him. Then he asked me if I had any important stuff in there, so I took my documents I had from school and he left with the luggage again. Then I learned my suitcase was checked in with the rest of the checked suitcases when they gave me the luggage number. So I told them that I’m going all the way to DC and they told me they have no idea if the suitcase is going all the way to DC or not and that I should ask some employees on the airport what is about to happen with the suitcase. I had no idea my suitcase is being checked in the plane storage. So there was nothing I could do about it afterwards. When I got out of the plane in Toronto I have asked about five people and every single one of the told me a different information. Nevertheless later they told me they lost the suitcase and couldn’t find it. And nobody was able to give me a proper information. All I was hearing was “I don’t know” and people there were not actually trying to help me, which is really frustrating when you’re supposed to catch a connecting flight which obviously I did not catch. When they finally found my suitcase I was told I can join the next flight to DC. But since I haven’t had my carry on suitcase with me because it was checked in  I had to wait hours in Toronto for a flight at 8:50pm which was delayed for 90 minutes. So instead of getting to dc at 3:25pm I have arrived at midnight.

### "An excellent flight"
Rome to Toronto. An excellent flight. Welcoming refreshments on boarding, Good Choice of Newspapers. Professional, Courteous and Competent in Flight Staff. Excellent Meal (Better than coming out of Toronto). Good Choice of Wine & Champagne. In Flight Entertainment easy to operate and a good selection of films etc. This is how I expect Air Canada to be. On time departure and arrival. Bags promptly delivered.

### "miss our connection"
London to Toronto flight was delayed first because bathroom sinks were not working which is causing us to miss our time slot for departure, and eventually made us miss our connection.

### "This is not an isolated incident"
Not Verified |  I had an awful experience with Air Canada on my recent trip to Europe. Every single flight on my trip was delayed, but that was the least of my worries. On my way there, my bag was lost. I was unable to contact anyone who could give me any information as to where it was. When I received it nearly 3 days later it was severely damaged. On the way home I had even more troubles. Due to substantial delays, I missed my connecting flight in Montreal and had to stay there for an extra day before I could get another flight home. I was denied any compensation for a hotel room, cab fare, or food while I was stuck unexpectedly in Montreal for an extra day. They gave me a phone number to call to get a hotel room at a "discounted rate". However when I finally got through, I was told there were no more discounted rates left and the best they could offer me was a $300 room at the Marriott. No thanks. I booked my own hotel room for half the price on Expedia instead. When I finally got home the next day do you think my bag made it home too? Of course not! Once again it was delayed and further damaged. I have also been denied my claim for a refund of baggage fees, so I guess I paid $60+ each way for the privilege of having my bag lost and destroyed. It has been impossible to get ahold of an actual person to talk to about this nightmare of a trip, and all of my online claims have been denied. I have received $0 in compensation for any of this, even though I spent hundreds of extra dollars as a result of Air Canada's incompetence. My friends who were also flying Air Canada (different flights) to attend the same wedding all had similar troubles as well. This is not an isolated incident. Air Canada is a joke and treats their customers terribly. I will never recommend them to anyone.

### "arriving in Toronto bags were not there"
Montreal to Toronto. First they cancelled the initial flight (AC407) for supposedly ‘operational reasons’, then they rebooked all of the passengers for a flight they created out of nowhere (departing 2 hours later) AC1999. Then the new flight was 1 hour late. Finally, arriving in Toronto bags were not there, and are being sent on a later flight. Sorry guys, that’s it for me.

### "was an awesome flight"
London Heathrow to Toronto. It was an awesome flight with Air Canada because when I checked in, my seat was originally 21H but the lady at the airport changed my seat to 21K which is the window seat and I sat next to the wing. When I boarded, I went to meet the pilot and they were such gentlemen. It was also been such a long time I took a 777 Flight. Always go for the engine seat on the 777!

### "Zero customer service"
Toronto to LaGuardia. Our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms which is completely out of Air Canada’s control. However, the way they dealt with this situation was terrible. Zero customer service. Sitting on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight cancelled and told to go to level 3 Desk 2. Wait 45 mins in a line, nothing. Told go to Desk 12, then told go to desk 15. 3 hours of additional inconvenience. No hotel voucher, no refund and stranded in Toronto for the night. Air Canada have a high flight cancel rate, so why not have a system in place for these situations? Also, on our flight to Toronto, they did not know who was on the plane. Calling passengers names over intercom on plane before take off to confirm they were in fact on board. If people are on the plane that you are not aware of, they is unacceptable.

### "wait in airport a total of 8 hours"
Connection flight from Victoria to Vancouver rescheduled (delayed 3 three times) so would miss connecting Air Canada flight to SFO. Landed with 10 min to run to gate. Had to go thru customs. Missed the flight at 1.30. They bumped us to a 7.30 pm flight. There were 2 earlier flights for which we asked to be on standby. There were others on our flight who made it onboard an earlier flight. We were never called for boarding pass. Went to gate counter several times. They had seats on the 4.30 flight which 2 hours earlier they said there would not be any problem getting on - lots of seats. So they loaded everyone on and had seats in all categories but would not give us any, including paying for upgrade to first class. They said there just wasn't time to get us our boarding pass. They offered only a $10 food coupon per person. All due to scheduling issues on behalf of Air Canada - which a frequent flyer at the time said (too late) happens all the time. The supervisor would not give us a refund so we could fly another airline to get home before 3.00 am. So had to wait in airport a total of 8 hours because of their repeated scheduling errors.

### "Would not recommend"
Brussels to Calgary via Montreal. On the first flight, from Brussels to Montreal, the screen of my seat was broken, nothing the crew could do about it. The airplane was very old as well. On the second flight, which boarded 1hr late, my screen didnt work. After waiting 30 min on the plane for departure, with broken airconditioning, we had to exit the plane and wait 4 hours for another plane to finally be able to depart. Would not recommend at all.

### "failed to provide meaningful compensation"
We booked and paid the higher prices for a direct flight taking 5.5 hours and departing early afternoon from Heathrow to St Johns, Newfoundland. Air Canada later cancelled the flight (for an appropriate reason), rescheduled us onto an indirect flight via Toronto taking over 13 hours and requiring a 4am departure from home with young children, but have failed to provide any meaningful compensation. E-mails to Customer Services (which have been the only way to contact them) have resulted in rude, unprofessional responses. We want to complain not only about compensation, but also about the attitude of Customer Services. However, they don’t seem to publish their Complaints Procedure anywhere. Therefore, nearly 6 weeks ago, I e-mailed to ask what their complaints procedure is if unhappy with the response from Customer Services – they have not responded. I  thought Air Canada would be a professional, well-run business with competent, trained, efficient staff. In our experience, nothing could be further from the truth.

### "I had an excellent flight"
Toronto to Vancouver. I had an excellent flight with Air Canada last week. The 777-LR with the pods and AC's Signature service is wonderful. The staff were attentive and friendly. I had the beef and the salad, dessert and cheese with a glass of wine were memorable. I flew on their latitude fare (which is full fare economy) and they gave me an up-grade from economy to a seat in the front cabin. My advice is if you fly several times a year fly with the same carrier or alliance because they notice and treat you like gold. One can look for a lower cost fare. However, as a tall guy I really appreciate the service and the big seat and it was very comfy. Also, the IFE was excellent. The AC wide body planes have an excellent number of choices and the front cabin has very large screens. I watched two films and hopefully when I fly AC again I can watch the other half of the third film I was watching. I appreciate that they have 'classic' films because the recent films are not necessarily my first choice.

### "Staff were lovely"
❎ Not Verified | Toronto Pearson to London Heathrow. This airline was amazing. The 777-300ER wasn’t old. Staff were lovely and my flight was on time. From Toronto Pearson to London Heathrow were the best 8 hours on an airline. I would recommend this airline. It’s one of the best airlines money can buy. Food wasn’t shabby as well. When we arrived at London Heathrow baggage reclaim was excellent. No mix-up or any problems. 5 stars.

### "remained unhelpful throughout"
We had a connection flight from Victoria to London that stopped in Vancouver, with only a 1h10min stop over which had been arranged by the airline through the Air Canada website - we are experienced flyers and had we been able to we would have booked ourselves on the 16:00h flight rather than the 18:00h flight that we ended up on. The first flight from Victoria was delayed by half an hour which mean that we had even less time to get between the flights and we knew Vancouver airport was rather large. The flight was then delayed again meaning that even though it was supposed to take off at 18:30 actually took off at 20:05, which was 5 mins before our next flight was supposed to take off. There were 16 other people on the same flight with us that were also told that they were going to try and get Vancouver to hold the flight for us as there were already many delays in Vancouver. However, the flight was not held for us and did in fact take off earlier than it was supposed to at 20:05. We missed the flight and expected some compensation as it meant that our entire journey had been delayed by a full day as the only flight they could get us on was for the evening after, and Air Canada did not even provide any hotels for us, despite them being the cause of a 24h delay. As well as this, we had paid money to be put in the preferred seating with extra legroom and when we brought this up while they were booking us on the next flight they were unable to do anything to help us. We understand that other people would have booked the same seats we did and they would be unable to change this, but even after several conversations with the customer "service" for the airline asking if they could possibly upgrade us to premium economy as we had paid for more room which we were now not getting, and been delayed by their incompetence, but they remained unhelpful throughout the whole process. Overall, although the individual employees were trying their best to help us, the airline as a whole was awful at helping us and made the journey very difficult as it was in fact them selling us the tickets with only an hour in between that lead to the problems we face.

### "still not on my way home"
Toronto to Montreal. I have a 75k status, been at the airport since 11:00 am, it is now 6:30 and I am still not on my way home to Montreal. Now the 6:00 pm flight will not leave before 7:00 pm, the toilets are not flushing, so the pilot tells us we can go at the airport. The staff at the gate will not let us go.

### "This flight was amazing"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Montreal. This flight was amazing. The only problem we had was the long 4 hour delay but that was due to the very poor weather in Chicago. When we boarded everything was clean. We were met by an AMAZING flight attendant, sadly I forgot her name. When we sat down we noticed that there were IFE screens, on a regional jet. The only problem with those was that they were a bit unresponsive. When we got up in the air there was only a drink service but if you wanted you could have purchased a voucher for the buy on board menu or you could have just bought it from the menu. Card only! There was a limited selection due to there being no ovens on the Embraer aircraft but I opted for the chicken noodle soup. Sadly they had run out so I had oatmeal instead. Other than that it was a smooth flight. The bags were on the carousel when we got there and we were gone.

### "no communication at all"
Montreal to Vancouver . There was a lighting storm that stopped most flight on the day, and it was a public holiday, jazz festival and a Sunday that can't be helped and meant all could not be put up in a motel. The problem was that there was no communication at all to tired and stressed travellers. They were able to organise security to subdue travellers, when official announcements and communications should have been priority. This came 3 hours after, too late and baggage was not delivered until 5 hours after so nobody could really leave anyhow. Cabin staff were short and rude on the eventual flight after anyhow, when many had been sleeping at the airport for 28 hours.

### "complicated to have some sort of a refund"
Montreal to Grenada. We had a connecting flight in Toronto, however the plane had technical issues in Montreal and, as consequence, we missed our connecting flight. We lost 2 days at the Sandals resort and it is so complicated to have some sort of a refund from Air Canada, too many document requirements, complex process & hard to reach.

### "The plane was old "
Montreal to Paris. 4hrs+ flight delay and they didn't apologize at the boarding gate. The plane was old and uncomfortable, with the IFE remote control located in the armrest of my seat . Catering was the worst I had.

### "lost our luggage"
We flew Dubai to Montreal and then Montreal to Porto with Air Canada rouge. Air Canada lost our luggage on both flights ways and couldn't tell when it would be delivered. I fly regularly for business 20-30 times year and have had my luggage lost once in the last five years. There always seem to be problems on AC last time we flew they cancelled a flight and we were stuck in Toronto. Canada deserves better.

### "vowed I would never fly with Air Canada again"
OK so I’m getting senile. Back in 1972 I vowed I would never fly with Air Canada again but, stupidly, this year I decided to use them on a short sector. I received, shortly before I left for the airport, a text message telling me not to forget my flight, to Halifax, so I went to the airport. When I went to check in, and before the woman who was handling the desk I was going to use, could say anything, her next-door colleague announced in a loud voice that the flight had been cancelled. As the aircraft was to come from Halifax, some 2 hours away, someone should have told the computer to send me a message telling me that. This is where Air Canada customer handling came to the fore – come back at 20.30 and we will get you on that flight. I explained I had 3 more connections that day. Whilst one of the two check-in staff made an effort to sort out the problem the other indicated she could not care less about our problem. Due to that I had to pay full fare on WestJet for both my wife and self. It should be said the contrast could not have been greater the check-in lady to whom I spoke bent over backwards to help us – Thank you WestJet! I have told my wife if I even think of Air Canada again to have me certified.

### "Well done again AC"
My flight from Montreal to Vienna was delayed and wasn't going to be leaving until the following morning. This caused me to miss my bus from Vienna to Munich which cost over 100 euros. I spent 9 hours in the airport waiting. They didn't do anything but give me a coupon to use with Air Canada. I'm never going to use it as I never want to fly Air Canada again. I'm now on my way home from Vienna and my flights been delayed an hour and a half causing me to miss another ride so I will have to get a hotel for the night in Vancouver as I live 2 hours drive from the airport. Well done again AC.

### "flight was cancelled"
Barcelona to Vancouver via Montreal. My dad was supposed to be home yesterday but his flight was cancelled and he had to spend the night at the airport. The phone lines had very long holds of over and 90 minutes if you could actually get through. After waiting an hour and a half on hold my mom was disconnected. Rather than teaching staff how to deal with tired and frustrated people waiting they simply sent in armed security guard and threatened to arrest anyone who was rude to Air Canada staff. I just want my dad to be home. I am still waiting for him.

### "left my laptop in compartment"
Rome to Toronto. Flight delay for 4 hours and I miss connecting flight to Milwaukee. When landed, I was in a rush to check my next connecting flight and approach the ground staff and I was given a Next day flight, and staff said that they cannot do anything and direct me to counter F to check for optional flight to Chicagon. I have no choice, but take the only option to fly out next day at 8.30am. After immigration than I realise that I left my laptop in the magazine compartment. I go to the lost and found but they cannot locate it, the lost and found staff have send message twice to check the flight but still no sign?

### "delayed 7 hours in total"
I used them twice - from Chicago to Toronto and back. I will never use it again. We were delayed 7 hours in total. Once it was because of ‘weather’ but the next was delayed 3h 45min because they were trying to get overbooked clients to cancel their flight. It was terrible and because of the delay I couldn’t get my luggage to my final destination.

### "only check baggage two hours prior"
Dallas to Vancouver. A horrible experience. They will only check baggage two hours prior to the time for boarding. My family and I arrived 2.5 hours ahead of time to check in. A woman was sent out to tell us to get out of line. Their disorganization should not become our problem. We will chose a different airline next time.

### "fighting to get my $ refunded"
Ft Lauderdale to Toronto. The wait to speak with a customer service rep is about an hour or more. I called a week before my flight because I just got my citizenship and took away my green card. So I called to verify if I could fly with my naturalization certificate and I was told by a customer service supervisor that I could. When I got to airport they said I couldn’t. Long story short, fighting to get my $ refunded. Don’t give out the wrong information to people if you know the answer.

### "disgrace of a company"
Our flight was delayed for 6 hours, waited on the runway for over 1 hour. They booked me and my husband on different flights for the connecting flight from Calgary. They booked mine for 10 PM while I was still on the flight from La Guardia yo YYZ. Ridiculous! Our bag was lost or sent with a different flight we don’t know yet. They booked us into a hotel but gave us the address of another one and we had to find a way to get to the correct address at 2 AM! The customer service rolled their eyes at us, hang up the phone, told us no one will do anything at this point and they were more interested in going home then assisting. No one responded to our concerns or offered any assistance! It’s a disgrace of a company!

### "Our baggage was not delivered"
Victoria to Boston via Montreal. Very poor interpersonal experience. Aircraft, facility etc are reasonable. It is the behaviour of staff that cause concerns. In food delivery service, the hostess decided to skip several rows, and when called for a drink, she pointed to the fact that we should have asked when they were delivering drinks! Our baggage was not delivered, The agent linked to US customs looked it up and found that it was delivered to another airport. He advised that we should contact the Baggage agent. The comment we received from the baggage agent were disturbing "are you sure it was not delivered?". I urge Air Canada to address these attitudes on part of its staff members.

### "The seats are cramped"
Vancouver to Toronto. The seats are cramped, the planes often dirty with garbage in pockets. Customer service is rude and unhelpful. Every time I book a flight I get pre assigned a middle seat and zone 6 for last to board. There was no overhead luggage space because everyone carries huge rolling luggage pieces. I book and pay for extra leg room only to have them move someone into seat beside me who didn’t pay at all. The only positive I can give for them is that their flight attendants are always nice and kind.

### "seats were amazing"
Not Verified | London to Toronto. I recently had a flight with Air Canada. The staff were very kind and helpful. The lounge was the best I've seen! The seats were amazing and so was the food!

### "seatbelts don’t work with car seats"
Los Angeles to Toronto. We booked 4 Business Class Seats on their Boeing 787 for a red eye flight. The tickets were for me, my wife, our 13-month daughter and our 14-year old niece. Air Canada booking showed the age of our daughter, as we gave them her info and said we wanted a seat for her. After we boarded, and put her in her car seat, she fell right asleep as people were still boarding. At this point the crew said the car seat needed to be checked as their seatbelts don’t work with car seats, and I had to hold her. They also said there were no seats in coach for her and that they need me to get her now so that they could take off. They were polite, but I was stunned by what I was being told. We complied with their instructions, as required. Air Canada responded to my email offering me a $100 e-gift card. All of us were exhausted after the flight. I’m insulted by their offer of $100 and simply can’t believe any airline would act in such a manner.

### "could not be happier"
Frankfurt to Toronto. My first time flying with Air Canada and could not be happier. The aircraft was very nice - who doesn't love a toilet with a window!? - the staff were very nice, the food was delicious and the entertainment system was au point! No delays, but would benefit from allowing boarding passes on the iphone wallet.

### "Shameful performance"
CMN-DCA via YUL in business class. The CMN-YUL flight was an hour late departing which made the connection tight in YUL for the short segment to DCA. Crew on board the long over-the-water sector was excellent. Very friendly and attentive. Food was very good. AC uses the old herringbone 1-2-1 business class configuration. It is private, but does not allow you to look out the window. While transiting in Montreal, I could see that my bag cleared US Customs. However, it did not make it onto the aircraft for the short flight to Washington Reagan. Upon arrival, I filed a missing baggage claim with AC. This is done at their check-in counter and, as a result, took a long time as a large family checking in had a problem with their tickets and there was only one agent on duty. I finally was able to file a claim. My bag arrived on the same flight a day later, even though there was six flights between Montreal and Washington (either DCA or IAD) in the interim. After arriving in Washington, my bag took another 24 hours to get to me. Shameful performance on the part of AC's baggage tracing and contracted courier delivery service. Marred an otherwise good trip with AC.

### "wasn't happy with entertainment"
Sydney to Vancouver. I am a first time traveller by Air Canada. I chose Air Canada for my trip in order for me have a feel & get the real experience of it. In General ok. For me when it comes to long haul flight more than 10+ flying hours, I wasn't happy with the selection of entertainment system.

### "hoping to get the bag back in time"
San Francisco to Delhi via Vancouver. I booked my tickets through Expedia. Air Canada made changes to my itinerary three times without explanation. The first time around I called Air Canada directly but was told I needed to contact Expedia. Expedia was helpful but had no explanation for the changes. I had to make changes to my other connecting flights every time Air Canada made a change. On the day of travel, during check-in the agent did not understand e-visas to India and asked for clarifications from me. I found the onboard food choices and quality below par. They lost one of our bags when we landed in Delhi and the agents there did not have a clue as to what happened. We are keeping our fingers crossed, and are hoping to get the bag back in time for the wedding I came to India for.

### "Air India charged extra fees"
Toronto to Delhi with Air Canada, Delhi to Kochi with Air India. Though their baggage limits are limited i have paid for an extra baggage and confirmed with the representative that the baggage fee is applicable until the final destination. When they reach Delhi for transfer for their Air India flight charged extra fees for the baggage. On top of it though it is an international transfer they are considering as a domestic trip. They even consider even laptop bag and Baby's diaper bag as Carry-on luggags. There is no proper communication between Air Canada and Air India. Air Canada have different language entertainment in their flight but they dont have tamil language.

### "No food was served"
Vancouver to Toronto. My flight was rescheduled without any information to me and found out, when I checked my itinerary on line. No food was served in business class (only light breakfast before landing). Overall impression and service was not near to EVA Air and Singapore Airlines I traveled before this flight.

### "delayed for nearly two hours"
Vancouver to Toronto. Today we were delayed on the plane for nearly two hours. I missed my connecting flight, and need to wait at the airport all night for a rebooked one. But Air Canada offered me a $10 meal voucher so that makes it all better! They dont give you any snacks on their flights, its for purchase.

### "I will fly with them again"
Vancouver to Brisbane. An excellent lounge. My seat on the plane was not the most comfortable, but being tall was not bad. The cabin staff were very good. I couldn't eat or drink very much and staff helped me in every way possible. They were all caring, I will fly with them again.

### "flight was very comfortable"
Not Verified |  Shanghai to Toronto. This Air Canada flight was very comfortable, along with nice food services ( a cup noodle, bread, and the main dish) served in three times and definitely lessens the pressure during the 12h long haul in Economy. The cabin crew was very comforting when I threw up shamefully. The in-flight entertainment was lovely, equipped with films from the world, songs and tvs. The headphones were great. Had a sound sleep.

### "was the most uncomfortable"
London to Vancouver. Air Canada have only one Boeing 777 seat configuration for short haul and long haul - 3-4-3. Most of my travel is, and has been, long haul with many airlines. This at 9 hrs was the most uncomfortable in Economy of any of my previous Economy flights. The constant brushing of shoulders with fellow passengers and crew - seated next to one and as they travel along the aisles (I was seated in an aisle seat) leads to surly crew and intolerant passengers - not a pleasant flight. I flew this flight because of the cost savings against the alternatives - but after the flight can only state that the savings (perhaps $100 each way) were not worth the bad experience for 9 hours.

### "no meal included"
Montreal to Los Angeles. Five hours in a single aisle plane with no meal included. This is Air Canada proper, on a full fare, flying international. There was a bistro cart for paying customers and I got a packet of fruit slices, cheese and crackers: the fruit was turning soft and the moisture frorm the fruit made the cheese soggy. There was nothing in the booking process or ticket that signalled that a meal was not included, otherwise I would have brought my own. I was only flying this leg to get to LAX and switch to another carrier for the rest of my journey.

### "said I couldn’t hear the speaker"
I usually don’t have to show a passport after security and they had apparently been saying it over the speaker to have it ready. I didn’t have it ready and she said “you should have been listening, will the next customer with a passport ready step up?” in the time she took to show horrible customer service, I had provided the passports and said “I couldn’t hear the speaker, it’s loud out here” she handed me my passport back and said “I’m not going to argue with you”. I took my passport mistakenly thinking I was done and began to walk onto the plane. She took off running and saying I hadn’t been checked yet and “what do you think you’re doing?! You can’t just walk on the plane!” Everyone thinks she was overreacting to try make a scene. Then after everyone is sitting we had to get off the airplane for mechanical issues.

### "improve on is their meals"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Hawaii. It's a very good airline to travel with. Excellent cabin staff. But the one thing they really have to improve on is their meals. There is no food or snacks, you have to purchase their food. That's crazy for a flight so long. I'm very disappointed.

### "seldom had a more attentive crew"
Zurich to Toronto. This was the penultimate leg of a business class odyssey through Asia. It was the most impressive of six segments. Air Canada configures their 787 business class cabin 1-2-1, which is considerably more comfortable than United's 2-2-2. The downside to AC's arrangement is that you have to stretch and contort in order to see out the window. The flight was about 95% full, with the business class cabin at 100%. I have seldom, if ever, had a more attentive crew. Between meal services, there was always at least one attendant patroling the cabin eager to serve. The Thai chicken curry was excellent - and I had just spent four days in Bangkok. I hope Air Canada management reads these reviews, because they can be quite pleased with all aspects of this long-haul service.

### "flight from hell"
❎ Not Verified | Calgary to Belize City via Toronto. I had a flight from hell. It started from Calgary when a storm hit which I can understand when flights are canceled it can’t be helped. But then I couldn’t get another flight cause there was no one working and thousands of people trying to rebook. Finally, at around 3 am I got someone after waiting in line for hours to rebook. But when I went to check in I was told there was no such flight or booking under that number. So then they wanted to send me to Toronto then El Salvador for the night, I wasn’t happy with that so they sent me to Miami then Belize. So instead of me getting to Belize on the 28th I finally got there on the 30th. Up until getting to Miami, I hadn’t slept for some 30+ hours. After finding a gentleman, the only one, with Air Canada he finally got me a room for the night. Now I’m on my way home and in Houston for a 12-hour layover before I board for Calgary.

### "improved their long haul product"
Vancouver to Hong Kong. A trip riddled with personal hiccups, but Air Canada managed to make it feel better. I was running a little late for my flight and in the heat of it all, left one of my carry-ons at a security checkpoint for domestic departures. While I wasn’t able to get the item back the ground staff and cabin crew went above and beyond their fall of duty in helping me get it back. It didn’t work out in the end, but I appreciate the effort from contact numbers to the flight attendant that literally stepped off the plane to help me look. They really didn’t have to, but I am very thankful for their efforts. As for the premium economy cabin itself, it’s very small, comprising of 3 rows, totalling 24 seats. They’re significantly wider than economy seats and closely resemble the regional business class product. The seats were comfortable and I managed to catch 6 hours of sleep on a 14 hour flight, but they a cosmetic refresh may be due, with slightly warped armrests and scratched glossy plastic seatbacks negatively impacting the aesthetics. IFE was touchscreen and remote controlled, though the touchscreen functions were somewhat unwieldy compared to economy class TVs. Food was above average, with a premium (though not business class worthy) first meal with proper porcelain and metal cutlery, followed by what seemed to be a standard economy class meal (I believe Cathay Pacific also does the same thing). They also have a chicken pesto ciabatta as a snack prior to landing and that was good too, chicken was tender and well seasoned. I would also note that typical of a North American airline, Air Canada does offer good coffee (Lavazza) even in regular economy, so that’s a plus. Overall, Air Canada has drastically improved their long haul product over the years, while maintaining fairly reasonable fares for international flights. As a full service airline, flying to Hong Kong, their most comparable competitor for the route is Cathay Pacific, of whom I have referenced regularly. Given a choice between the two, I would pick Air Canada for value, and surprisingly, food as well- they’re generally much cheaper and there seems to be better attention to detail with regards to food and beverage. On the other hand Cathay is still able to offer more convenient time slots and premium economy in their flights includes 3 checked bags, though typically at a significantly higher price, so who you do fly with definitely depends on your needs, but Air Canada is definitely a viable option to get you there.

### "not at all disappointed"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Toronto. This was my first domestic travel after coming to Canada. Was excited, so the overall journey round trip from Vancouver to Toronto was good. As I did not have any luggage, the process was faster. The ground staff and on air staff were friendly and helpful. Flown international as well with Air Canada till now not at all disappointed.

### "expectations were set low"
It was a typical Air Canada flight and expectations were set low, accordingly. Priority boarding was a mess. The flight had only a few people, and the extra seats were appreciated. Half-way through the flight, the entertainment system froze when I tried to look at the map. I could freeze the other two systems next to me by trying to look at the map. There were random announcements on the PA system of the results of some ongoing basketball game, which was the last thing I was interested in.

### "internet connection didn't work"
Toronto to Beijing. The food was horrible and flight crew were not helpful. My seat was  not clean and bathroom I used was filthy. My flight was delayed and I was about to miss my connecting flight to Bangkok. My luggage was not sent to Thailand and I had to wait 2 days to receive my luggage. I paid 21 bucks for in flight internet connection but it didn't work.

### "flight was pretty decent"
Toronto to Munich. The flight was pretty decent. Clean cabin and washrooms, excellent crew. I could sleep well due to a decent amount of legroom. Only thing is the food could improve. The meal service is not that generous compared to other full service carriers. I ordered an Asian Vegetarian meal which is ideally Indian and they gave some Aloo gobi (an Indian dish of cooked potatoes and cauliflower) and rice, which is not really a good combination. On top of that it was with sweet potato make it taste even worse. The light snack service of a muffin was filling before landing. IFE was decent. It would be better if they could at least provide eye shades so that passengers can at least sleep well. They keep the cabin lights on for a very long time.

### "Worst experience with airline ever"
Worst experience with airline ever: spent extra on business to get some sleep on Dreamliner red eye flight. They replaced Dreamliner with A321 with poor “business class”, uncomfortable seats. To top it all, aircraft has a problem and we most likely will miss connection! Just recalled a few years ago, my Air Canada flight from Toronto to Frankfurt returned back from almost Mid-Atlantic to Halifax due to an issue with the aircraft. Never again Air Canada.

### "missed my connecting flight"
Toronto to San Francisco. The plane was 3 hrs late. I missed my connecting flight from San Francisco to Singapore which they rebooked and booked a hotel accommodation. I also missed my flight from Singapore to Manila on another airline. I raised this concern to Air Canada but they won't offer me anything because it's a different airline. Fine, but it won't happen if not because of Air Canada.

### "3 hours early for my flight"
Boston to Toronto. There are several flights per day between Toronto and Boston. It's Saturday and I'm at Boston airport 3 hours early for my 12:20 flight. There's an AC flight at 10:20 am open. I ask at the AC counter if i can get a seat on this early flight. They say no way unless I pay an additional US$150. I refuse. I have no choice most of the time but to use this airline. Air Canada do not care about their loyal customers. Just think about how they will treat new ones. After this experience, I will go out of my way to choose any airline other than Air Canada.

### "will be forever thankful"
Not Verified |  Prince-George to Toronto. Thank you Air Canada for making my trip so memorable, I ran in to some problems when I booked my flight in October with another company (expedia) but flying with you, two days before my trip I was told there was no seat available for me on the April 30th (return date) so I called your company to see if they could help me, the young man mentioned that they're not suppose to do that, but after I explained to him what happened to me with the company I booked with and why I was taking the trip, he gladly helped me, to get that seat back for the 30th. I will be forever thankful for his help, because I see my beautiful daughter only once/year and way to go Air Canada thank you for your excellent service and free meals. See you again in June.

### "unexpected upgrade to business"
Montreal to Tokyo-Narita with one of it's most recent aircraft, the Boeing 787. The staff at the boarding gate was proactive by checking bigger carry-ons in order to have enough space on board to accomodate the passengers who had carry-ons that complied with the sizes. The boarding was effective and the flight left on time and arrived in advance. Initially I had a seat in Premium Economy but I got an unexpected upgrade to business class at the end of the boarding which made my flight more enjoyable. The crew and the service was good. Some flight attendants were awesome and funny. The business class seat was a lie flat bed which was amazing and comfortable. The inflight entertainment worked fine and had a good choice of recent movies from many countries. The return leg was from Shanghai and again it was in business class. The service was and crew was once again good. I ended up sleeping during most the flight. Overall Air Canada has a great business class product for the long haul flights.

### "We had a terrible day"
Our flight was a replacement flight for a previous day canceled flight. We had a terrible day before after 7 hours back and forth in a plane in Calgary. Eventually canceled. Air Canada cannot be reached by phone. The agents in the airport could not help, because they say that you have to call. Eventually we were rebooked the following day. You would expect the saga stops but it does not. Air Canada agents seem immune to complaints about delays. Again 3 hours delay for no obvious reasonable reason. They say the airplane is here but it has to be towed from the hangar. Which they suppose to do prior and to be ready. I fly around four times a year. 50% of my flights with Air Canada were delayed beyond 30 minutes.

### "had an excellent experience"
I had an excellent experience flying with Air Canada from Newark to Vancouver. Check In at the airport was well organized and I enjoyed spending several hours in the Air Canada lounge. The food and wine was excellent and I got a fair amount of work done and enjoyed doing some reading. The Boeng 787is a beautiful plane. The business class seating is generous and comfortable. I particularly like the large screen and the choices with AC's IFE. The staff were friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the food (chose the beef and enjoyed the smoked salmon), dessert and appreciated the choice in wines. I recognize one of the attendants from a flight to Mexico and we had several nice chats. Also, the Chief Flight Attendant took time to speak with the passengers in the cabin. I've decided to go for another trip to New York City. It's just wonderful to be able to fly there non-stop in a beautiful plane like the Boeing 787.

### "could not change my aisle seat"
Shanghai to Toronto. I could not change my aisle seat where staff may ram the trolley into my knee. There was some equipment under the seat in front of me that took up leg space, and seemed to be falling apart. My dietary preferences were ignored.

### "Absolutely terrible"
Newark to Toronto with Air Canada. Absolutely terrible. The flight was only 1 hour but then it got delayed by 45 minutes. Because of that we missed our next flight by like 1 minute. The man that was at the front of the gate said, “It’s no ones fault that you’re late”. Excuse me, it is your fault. There were no other flights to my final destination so I had to wait till the next day.

### "didn't allow me to board"
Milan to Toronto, I and my wife filled the eTA at the airport as they recommended (the permit you need to travel through Canada). They checked in my wife and stopped me and said your approval has not arrived yet. I had the approval on my phone and in my email and I showed it to the agent there. She refused and made a phone call. They separated me and my wife and didn't allow me to board. I tried to contact them by phone and via customer service but they told me I have to buy another ticket for myself (which I ended up doing).

### "stuck in the airport since 11 am"
Flight delayed 4 times. Had connecting flights through Montreal and been stuck in the airport since 11 am. It’s now 6 pm and still getting notifications that the flight is delayed. Customer service sucks. No help at all. Was refused any compensation.

### "flight was late 4 hours"
I booked Qatar airways to India. My connection was Edmonton to Montreal before flying Qatar Airways to Doha and Amritsar. Air Canada flight from Edmonton to Montreal was late 4 hours. I missed my all next flights.

### "Very bad experience"
London to Toronto. My mom recently visited me and I booked a wheelchair for her. She never had been any issues until she reached Toronto. An employee behaved rude and unprofessional to us. Very bad experience.

### "downgrade the lowest fares"
Toronto to Paris. Unvoluntary downgrated from business class to economy, after I made a claim, Air Canada generously gave me a $300 coupon as a compensation while I paid $1,700 for that leg of the flight. The rule is, if there is not enough seats in business to accommodate all passengers, they will downgrade the lowest fares.

### "plane returned to the gate"
Vancouver to Toronto. After half an hour waiting, the plane returned to the gate to get checked. Is it not supposed to happen before boarding? Last year the flight from Vancouver to London was delayed, and we missed our connection and one day of vacation. They didn't do anything to help us to get our connecting flight - on the contrary. They made us wait and we lost 30 minutes that might have helped. I will never fly Air Canada again.

### "failure to address my emails"
Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto. It started with the grounding of the 737 Max 8 which lead to the first cancellation of my flights on March 15. This is understandable. I went online and changed all of my flights and my wife's flights and lost a day of travel but had everything sorted. I was now due to depart on the 16th. I got a call on the 15th from an agent saying my new flight was cancelled due to a schedule change. I questioned the reason "schedule change" as the agent didn't realize my wife was on the same plane and my wife's ticket was still good. Everything got rebooked to have us routed through Vancouver and then overnighting now in Toronto and arriving the following day in Charlotte. When I arrived in Vancouver I got a text that my plane to Toronto was cancelled and I wasn't departing Vancouver until 11:55pm to Toronto with a 1 hour gap between my arrival and the flight to Charlotte. This was a problem as my luggage was all tagged to Toronto as I was supposed to be getting off and collecting my bags. I went to luggage services and arranged for the bags to all be redirected to Charlotte. I was assured this happened. When I arrived in Toronto I was met with the news that 2 out of 3 of my bags were not located. They almost did not let me board to the US with missing luggage but we finally got through with 4 minutes to spare and a very long run across the airport. I had to purchase new clothes as my bags were missing for three days. I finally got my bags but had to keep calling them to check on them and had to report the issue three different times as they failed to file a proper file number. I was never given the file number and I am now struggling to claim these charges. Due to the three flight cancellations I incurred charges for two missed hotel stays that couldn't be cancelled. We had a great time in Charlotte and on the last day I checked in online for my flight and it said to arrive at the airport 3 hours early for the international flight so we did. When we arrived at the airport there is only one Air Canada counter and there were no staff present to check our bags. We waited for 45 minutes after having the airport page them for someone to show up. When the agent finally showed up and we questioned why we have to be here three hours before our flight but she wasn't here, her response was "My schedule says I start at 9 take it up with my boss". There is a sign on the counter that says an agent will only be present 3 hours before flight departure times which clearly was not the case. I emailed air Canada customer service twice regarding these issues and the first response was a generic canned response addressing the grounding of the Max 8 737, which did not address my concerns. I noticed through my trip, no matter the issue they were using that as the reason for everything. I originally asked for someone to call me which has still not happened and I have written a reply to their email which they have not responded to. There were multiple opportunities available for the airline to step up and do something such as hotel vouchers during layovers etc. but they did nothing and the failure to address my emails with a legitimate response is disgraceful.

### " did not load hot food"
Toronto to Vancouver. Second time this has happened, they did not load hot food for sale on a 5+ hour flight. All that was offered for sale were some humuus, Twizzlers and Pringles. Such little respect for the customer. Why don't they let passengers know before boarding. I know AC focus is Business Class but a brand is only as good as it's weakest link.

### "flight had been cancelled"
Delhi to Toronto. My husband's and I were supposed to come back from India on February 27, 2019. When we arrived at the airport we were told our flight had been cancelled. Nobody new why. At the counter there was only one representative of Air Canada. She just kept on saying for information call this number. That number was never answered by anybody. 24 hours went by and nowhere to be in contact with Air Canada personnel. We opted to buy tickets with another airline so we could come back home. After a month of trying to talk with somebody from Air Canada I receive an email just says sorry for the inconvenience this incident caused. I had to buy new tickets and Air Canada say they are not responsible?

### "none of our luggages were loaded"
Vancouver to Delhi. Our flight departed from Vancouver on time (12:13 am on March 14, 2019) but arrived roughly 2 hours late in Delhi ( on March 15, 2019). To our horror, we were later disclosed that none of our luggages were loaded on the flight! As our trip (me and my mother in law) was to attend my brother's wedding, this costed us a lot. Apart from the hundreds of phone calls i made in vain to the number provided to collect luggage when it reaches India, i had to  buy everything for my stay in India. Finally, i received our luggage less than two days before my return flight.

### "incompetent in every aspect"
Regina to Toronto. Air Canada is awful. So incompetent in every aspect. They messed up my boarding pass so I couldn’t get past security without going back to an air Canada agent. Flight late, poor service. Nothing but incompetence each time I fly with them.

### "an exceptional employee"
Kahului to Vancouver. I woke on an overnight flight to a very warm cabin and felt a bit claustrophobic. I went to the back of the plane where a Flight Attendant was very kind to offer me water, a damp cloth and distraction. He was lovely chatting and after a while I was able to go back to my seat and finish the flight. This was a unique experience for me but Damion made it seem as though this sort of thing happens all the time. I was very appreciative of his kind attitude and the fact his coworkers allowed him the time to be with me. Thank you, Damion. You have an exceptional employee here, Air Canada.

### "48 hours in  Canadian airports"
Toronto to Samana. After booking my honeymoon at a 5 star resort through air Canada vacations we proceeded to spend 48 hours in different Canadian airports with zero support, compensation or even apologies from the airline. Not only were we stranded on the first night of our marriage but when we were told in Edmonton that we would be taken care of for room and board in Montreal, where we were to wait until the following evening to fly, we were informed after landing that they hadn't arranged for enough rooms. As a result, my wife and I had to spend an additional 280$ on the only room left anywhere near the airport. As it was already very late at night we were only able to sleep for 5 hrs before we had to catch another plane backtracking to Toronto where we would continue our layover for another 10 hrs. The trip started at 7am on a Saturday and we ended up arriving in Dominican monday morning. After many attempts to talk to phone representatives, as suggested by all the management at the airports, we were able to convince them to leave us with 30$ food vouchers for 2 people and 48 hrs of travel! Anyone you talk to in this company has their hands tied and is very willing to hand you off to another person or direct you to another phone number where you wait on hold, once for 2.5 hrs, only to be redirected elsewhere so on and so forth. At least we weren't fully out of pocket for our days spent at the airport, having paid with a WestJet credit card of all things. One way or another our incredibly expensive honeymoon was cut down from 6 days in heaven to 4 and we were exhausted and deflated by the time we arrived

### "The food was not so good"
The plane was really nice and new with big windows. The thing I notice with Air Canada is, on the long routes like the one we were on (Hong Kong to Vancouver) all the cabin staff are older ladies that are extremely unpleasant. I don’t expect to be pampered and cradled but they look so unhappy to be working. Every one one of the the 3 or 4 that we consistently saw in our area were all the same, miserable looking. The food was not so good. Salad was still partly frozen and the Saran wrapped sandwich was soggy and nasty.

### "Avoid for long flights"
Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver. Air Canada reconfigured these 777 planes in 3x4x3 layout which resulted in narrow and really uncomfortable seats. The aisle width is less than normal and you continuously get bumped by trolleys or passengers. The quality of food served was not good and sandwich was just cold. Avoid Air Canada for long flights.

### "accommodated us well"
Not Verified |  My family and I had arrived late and we were frantically scrambling for a flight to Hawaii, because we had pre-paid for our hotels and activities. WestJet and other airlines were less than helpful, but Ivy with Air Canada accommodated us well, despite the fact that our original flight wasn’t with their airline.

### "had to cancel a flight"
I had to cancel a flight worth $550 from Halifax to Toronto, I cancelled the flight after 3 days of booking it, and 3 months before the booked flight. I got a voucher. When I called to use this voucher on another flight I had to call and wait 45 minutes to get help. Then, when they applied the "voucher" to my flight (which originally without the voucher was $250), it ended up costing me more to use the voucher (the cost after applying the voucher was $300. How is this possible? I paid $550 for a flight and now its costing me more money to use my voucher! I decided not to use my voucher and booked with another airline, hoping I would need to fly again soon and could try to use my voucher again. Tried to book a flight and use the voucher again, and supposedly it "expired" even though it hasn't been a year since that original cancelled flight.

### "a compassionate heart"
Calgary to Dallas via Vancouver. I need to say how incredible Haroon at the air Canada desk was. A pragmatic problem solver and a compassionate heart. Thank you for all your help.

### "can’t complain to much"
Winnipeg to Toronto. Air Canada is the standard in Canada for reliable service. I purchased a Basic Economy ticket but purchased a preferred seat in the front rows of Economy. The only downside of this is that you remain in boarding Zone 6, meaning there is less space for bags overhead. The flight from Winnipeg is standard, short taxi and typically a short taxi to the terminal in Toronto if landing on the North runways. Overall the staff onboard are friendly, however they only come around 1 or 2 times so use that call button. Overall, compared to a lot of US airlines, can’t complain to much about AC.

### "daughter's stroller was broken"
I flew with my wife and my 4 months old daughter to Vancouver. First of all, they couldn't find a seat for my daughter so gave her a separate seat. We paid more money for seat selection and obviously that was not saved in the system. It took them an hour to sort the seat for my daughter. Then, when we got off the plane, my daughter's stroller was broken. They didn't even say sorry and gave me a card with some numbers to call. I called them and reported stroller damage, and now they are asking me to go fix the stroller and send them a bill.

### "Air Canada is a terrible airline"
New York City to Toronto. Number of flights traveled with AC: 30+. Air Canada is a terrible airline. Don’t get me wrong, there are worse out there but AC isn’t much better. The long haul international flights are slightly better. In general, many of staff are rude (unionized) and unprofessional. The Westjet staff are generally much better. They at least try to joke around or look like they don’t despise their jobs.

### "flight to Montreal cancelled today"
Los Angeles to Montreal. Our flight to Montreal was cancelled today. We went to the counter to get on another flight, and they told all passengers that they would get on tomorrow’s non-stop flight at the same time. We went to an agent and she told us we were on that flight. She took our passports and entered all of our information. When we didn’t get a check-in e-mail, I was concerned. We went online and saw that we had in fact not been put on that flight. I called and they said they had no record of the agent doing this. They said all that have left is a connecting flight through Toronto, overnight tomorrow. This is extremely unprofessional and not right. We paid for a direct flight leaving in the morning and we’re guaranteed to have the same flight the following day. The refused to pay for hotel accommodations and meals. We are out a lot of extra money, and we’re on a cheaper flight home than we paid for. We will not be flying with this airline again.

### "great experience I had"
Halifax to Ottawa. My main reason for the review is the great experience I had checking into my Air Canada flight from Halifax to Ottawa on March 8th, 2019. The Customer Service Rep Alan made the check in process very smooth. He was a great help and very pleasant, thank you Alan

### "seats are uncomfortable"
Toronto to London. In the past 6 months, I've had 12 flights with different airlines and fail Air Canada has had a delay on 4 out of the 12. The cost of their flight is high, seats are uncomfortable and if you have a tight connection, the probably of missing your connection is high. The loyalty program (Aeroplan at this point) is an absolute joke.

### "Seats are uncomfortable"
Delhi to Toronto. With a seat pitch of 31 inches this plane is not suitable for long flights. Seats are uncomfortable due to width and minimal recline. Flight was delay many times. Service was average what equipment was not suitable for long journey.

### "my legs did not fit"
Mexico City to Toronto. Service was standard and crew was nice and friendly. No entertainment. Seat space smallest i tried, Im 6'6 (198cm) and my legs did not fit. I am tall but really felt it here. They wanted to charge me USD104 for exit rows. I'm SA gold. Wifi did not work.

### "did not leave on time"
Air Canada flight did not leave on time, nor did they care to assist when trying to catch a connecting flight. When our flight left late, and we only had 10 minutes after landing to get to our next flight on the other side of Toronto international we were told by flight crew that even though 25 people on our flight were trying to catch the same flight they would not assist us in getting off our the plane quickly. They did offer to have carts ready to take us to our next gate, and when we got off the plane the ground crew told us to run! When we asked about the carts they told us "we never do that for people". What kind of communication is this?

### "lacks organization"
Columbus to Keflavik via Toronto. I've flown with Air Canada on this route twice. Once in 2017, and one scheduled for June 2019. The 2017 experience left me sour on Air Canada but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt because, hey, stuff happens. I haven't even taken my flight yet in 2019 and I can tell you my 2017 experience was no fluke. Everything that has happened thus far points to a company that lacks organization and is terrible under crisis and doesn't know how to deal with anything that may not go exactly according to plan. I booked my flight in January 2019 and I've had 6 e-mails already about my flight being rescheduled and there being itinerary changes. I have never in my life experienced this much dysfunction when dealing with an airline. If everything goes smoothly, I'm sure you'll have a fine flight, but it's when things go awry that you hope an airline would know what they're doing, and in my experience, Air Canada just doesn't. There are other airlines that will charge $100 more for the same flight. It's worth it, if for no other reason than the peace of mind to know that if something goes wrong, things will have some modicum of organization and a plan.

### "delayed passengers baggage"
Vancouver to Washington via Toronto. This is my first time to take Air Canada. On my flight from Vancouver to Toronto, Air Canada sent other flight’s baggage to us and delayed many this flight passengers baggage. Their customer service is terrible, misleading wrong information to passengers, taking weather condition as excuse. If you don’t want to waste your time or have bad mood, never try Air Canada.

### "Take any other airline"
Terrible! Take any other airline. I fly anywhere between 8-12 time’s per year, and when I fly Air Canada I consistently regret booking my flight with their airline. Firstly, their email and real-time updating on multiple of my flights has been inefficient. Our return flight was delayed by 2 hours and they sent an email to update on this information an hour before the flight departure. By this time we are already in line to go through security. We discovered that the cause for delay was because the flight crew had a mandatory rest time of 8hrs (and their previous flight had been late the night before) this means that the information on the flight delay had been known by Air Canada for at least 8 hours prior to the scheduled flight and they informed passengers only one hour before flight departure. In addition, our first flight to our vacation destination was also delayed and we received no updates on this until siting at the gate wondering why our flight hadn’t started boarding yet. To make matters worse, they did not prove to meet their revised departure time. We actually took off even later than the revised departure time. In both circumstances the email to update was not sent at a time that would allow us to make other plans to accommodate their lack of integrity. Secondly, I was not happy with the service on the aircraft. The stewardesses seem to have a lack of communication between their fellow employees. As they collected garbage I handed the stewardess a disposable coffee cup that had been used as a make shift garbage bin (full of banana peel and other garbage) she took the cup from me, then instead of throwing it away she proceeded to hand the cup back to me and said I will come back for liquids, and turned before I could explain there was no liquid in the cup. I felt uncomfortable because I was in the middle seat and this whole scenario happened while passing garbage back and forth in front of the passenger next to me (a stranger). To add further frustration, the stewardess did not return to take the garbage. When a different stuardess passed by I asked her to please take my garbage she responded in a rude tone “we already collected garbage”, I explained that the previous stewardess said she would return and had not, her reply was “I’ll come back then” She did end up coming back for the garbage, greeting me with “your garbage?” And then aggressively snatched the cup from my hand and stormed away. I felt humiliated and disrespected. This disappointing service has been consistent on multiple Air Canada flights, so often that I have come to expect this kind of service when I fly Air Canada. I have finally learned that flying Air Canada is not worth the frustration, confusion, and disrespect I encounter and will no longer consider flying with Air Canada in the future. I believe that there are much more details and events that Air Canada should be aware of if they are serious about improving their service.

### "offer good value and service"
Air Canada is really two airlines, a domestic one and an international one. On their international flights, they offer good value and service. The aircraft are new and well maintained and the service is very good. Notably, they have improved their food offerings over the past few years. The flight left HKG pretty much on time and I made my connection to Calgary. Inflight entertainment leaves something to be desired. The premium economy cabin is small, only three rows, and quite comfortable. Only one problem on the flight. We were not advised that passengers with connecting flights should claim their luggage. I recently flew through YVR from Paris and the bags went through to Calgary. However, there is a different policy with respect to flights from Asia, luggage is not automatically sent on to the final destination. It has been over a year since my last flight to Asia and so I had forgotten about this. It would have been helpful if a simple announcement had been made by the crew.

### "incredibly efficient and friendly"
Brisbane to Vancouver. Great aircraft for long-haul flights. Everything went seamlessly from check in to boarding, right through to in -flight service. I'm not a small person; however, had plenty of room . The seats were quite comfortable throughout the long flight. The service stands out. The service was incredibly efficient and friendly without being obtrusive. The food and drinks were pretty good and plentiful. The cabin crew provided water on a regular basis throughout the flight. The only suggestion I have is there is a lot of plastic in service and therefore a lot of wastage . The entertainment system is responsive but limited as to choices.

### "helpful, friendly and efficient"
I have taken AC527 between Boston and Toronto many times. The boarding area is very cramped especially between 5 and 8PM where four flights arrive and depart. The choice of food is from a single vendor namely Cosi and there is nothing to write home about. With Terminal B under renovation - there is nothing much outside either. Having said that I am however very happy with the performance of both the ground staff, inflight entertainment and the inflight crew. The ground staff are helpful, friendly and efficient. They keep a cool demeanor in this pressure cooker like environment - believe me when I say it gets hot in here. The flight was on time even though it was predicted to be delayed and the journey was painless. After a busy week of work this little trip of two hours was made painless by the effort of the professionals at Air Canada.

### "waste of time and money"
Not Verified |  Complete waste of time and money. My Husband and I planned a surprise getaway for our son for his birthday. Due to weather our departing flight was cancelled (understandably). The customer service from that point on was by far the worst experience we have witnessed. We were told that our flights would be rescheduled within an hour and they would notify us by email. The email link they sent was vague and we ended up calling and being left on hold for over an hour. when we finally reached an agent they advised that we could be re booked within 7 days! As we had car, hotel and attractions pre paid we requested an insurance claim but were told we had to deal with another department for this item. Eventually we were re booked the following morning but were flown out on 2 separate flights. My wife and son were flown to catch a connecting flight to our final destination while I was left on standby with a strong possibility of catching an afternoon flight. In total our 3 hr flights originally booked turned out to be a total of 30 hrs in travel time. While re booking I suggested other flights with air canada that were still posted as available on their website but they refused to allow us on these flights as they were a premium flight and not covered in their rebooking policy. All in all we missed our car rental (another long story) accrued extra hotel costs, additional car rental fees, and pretty much destroyed our holiday plans. To top everything off they lost our luggage on our return trip which thankfully arrived 2 days after we got home. To be clear, I dont blame the employees of this company as they are simply following the airlines rules. I blame a very poor business plan and management structure that is obviously designed to capitalize on any change of plan. We have had to submit a claim to our third party insurance company as neither the booking agency or air Canada's "insurance" will cover any of our additional costs.

### "1-3 hours delay"
Seattle to Taipei via Vancouver, one flight canceled until the next day. The rest of the flights with 1-3 hours delay. One flight attendant on the way from YVR to TPE on 02/03/2019 was great. She tried to help us with the infant and make a row of seats for us.

### "cancelled twice"
Halifax to Kingston via Toronto/Ottowa. Connecting flight arriving in Kingston at 2pm cancelled due to plane mechanics and rescheduled for next day (stranded in Toronto). Flight out of Kingston cancelled twice. Had to rent a car and drive 2 hours to final destination on both legs of trip. Air Canada does not have a number to call for refunds or credits and accepts emails only.

### "organization is awful"
Ottawa to Toronto, delayed by 1 hour. Worst airline ever. Not only are there delays, there is no information to passengers and the organization is awful with a lack of any friendliness. I will never be flying air Canada again this was the worst and most stressful experience.

### "tight quarters"
Edmonton to Toronto. This new plane looks all sparkly but it is tight quarters and by far the least leg room and aisle room of any plane I’ve flown. There is barely room to drop the tray to set down a drink. My husband is 6’4” and was curled up like a pretzel. The poor woman beside us was a little larger and couldn’t get in and out of the seat without twisting her body out into the aisle. The bathrooms were too small for some passengers. Staff at the check in counter at the gate were cold and unobliging. It wouldn’t hurt one of you to actually smile at a customer. Our steward was great. That’s the only positive about the flight. At the end they didn’t wait until passengers had disembarked before opening the back doors to service the plane in sub-zero weather. We could see our breathe and were last off the plane. Thank god the flight was on time. That’s the only saving grace.

### "well organized airline"
Toronto to London. The most considerate and well organized airline I have ever flown. Canadian kindness with an aesthetic beauty of the lounge. This was coupled with transport to the connecting gate for business class. .Food, staffing, lounge were above Emirates and the crowded Lufthansa lounge.

### "not forgive Air Canada for this"
I got my Air Canada boarding pass from Toronto to Atlanta and then with Qatar Airways to Doha to Mashad and gave my baggage to Air Canada. After I passed the passport check and went to the last gate half an hour to my flight was noticed by email that my flight was cancelled.I called Pearson information and was told to go to Customer Service desk. I stood in the line for approximately 3.5 hours!! and expecting help to find a way to be in Mashad before Friday. At the counter one lady tried to find other flights to Mashad before Friday but she could not. I was to find a way between cancellation and getting there later than Friday for my father in law funeral).I called my agency and they told me if they send you by another airline to Montreal which flights at 8pm you can get to Mashad. I talked to the lady and was told that it should be Air Canada airline. I cancelled my flights with a broken heart and dissatisfied of this customer service. I missed the funeral. Do not forgive Air Canada for this behavior.

### "what a terrible experience"
Terrible experience flying with Air Canada! We arrived at the airport, having checked in online. We went to the check in counter to drop off our luggage and our get tags for our one-year old's stroller. The girl at the check-in counter was in training and was kind of lost, couldn't find our booking. She finally figured it out and was printing our boarding passes, when her supervisor showed up. He was extremely rude, combative and arrogant. He took our passports, saying he had to check our visas, and disappeared for about one hour, while we were standing with our baby and wondering if we would even make it to the gate. He then came back and just gave us our passports, no explanation, no apology. We asked him to print our boarding passes, and he just walked away! We called him again as he was walking away, he came back, and said, "that's it, I'm getting you off this flight! We explained to him that this is not acceptable, and we would complain. He finally caved in, but what a terrible experience. We couldn't believe this was actually happening. If this guy is a "supervisor" at Air Canada, that says a lot about the company itself. And it's such a shame they carry our country's name. There's nothing Canadian about Air Canada, not anymore.

### "would not pay a hotel"
My flight was from Calgary to Nanaimo via Vancouver. Halfway to the Calgary airport my second flight was cancelled. After a 1.25 hour call wait, my flight was rescheduled. I was told they would not pay a hotel even though I have nobody to stay with in Vancouver. I get not paying for a hotel at the beginning of a trip, but halfway through? This is the last time. Absolutely ridiculous.

### "one of my favourite airlines"
Not Verified |  It was great, the aircraft's in perfect condition, clean and organized, with decent legroom, with new movies and updated software. The in-flight service was really good, respectful and kind flight attendants, willing to speak Portuguese, English or French. Definitely one of my favourite airlines. Thank you Air Canada.

### "service is terrible"
Toronto to Los Angeles. Their customer service is outrageous and treatment of paying customers is appalling. They have no regard for anyone’s time and they think it’s ok to withhold information from flyers. Some planes are extremely old and have broken internal features (air conditioning, tv screens) and economy in the new planes is almost intolerable. The seats are tiny and the service is terrible.

### "sets a new low for customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline sets a new low for customer service. We were to board a connecting flight from Newark to Ottawa around 8:30 am. Upon boarding our first flight at 11 pm the evening before, we were told our comnecting flight had been cancelled. However, no one could tell us why. The new flight was scheduled for after 2 pm. Having arrived at 5 am I now sit in the Newark airport for around 9 hours waiting for my plane. Crazy me I choose air travel as it is quicker than driving. Not so with Air Canada. Plus not even an email to update me on the change. Maybe they need to consult the long island medium to first see why it was cancelled since no one from their company seems to know or care. My advice is run don’t walk from this airline.

### "customer service appalling "
Toronto to Santa Clara. Flight was scheduled for 5.10 pm Jan 31, delayed until 8.30. They let everyone on the plane and sit there for almost 2 hours before advising flight was cancelled. - the attitude from customer service was appalling I tried to ask the manager a question and she literally was ignored. We were provided with a hotel room and shuttle for the night and promised breakfast and lunch but only given $7 voucher for a breakfast buffet being $26, we ended up eating protein bars until we could get to the lounge at the airport. Flight is delayed over an hour again, and we’re given $15 credit on boarding pass for food, good for one sandwich. We only knew about this as another passenger advised us as they got it due to putting up a stink. This is unacceptable customer service. I’m using vacation days to sit at person airport. To add, Air Canada on twitter and Facebook asked us to contact them, messages show as read with no response?

### "Worst experience"
Edmonton to San Diego via Vancouver. Worst experience of my entire life. Because of maintanance issues 1 flight was delayed that made us miss our connection. Then the connection flight was also delayed because of the maintanance reason as well. Then they had way too many people for 1 plane so not everyone was able to board.

### "luggage stuck on the plane"
San Francisco to Vancouver. AC 566 scheduled to depart YVR for SFO on Thursday at 1:45 pm. Pulled back from gate and smelled smoke in cabin. Two hours later back at gate. Re-booked on 5:40p flight. Delayed 90 mins. Arrive in SFO 10 hours late. Return flight on Monday, AC 569. Delayed from 4:50pm to 5:50p. Pulled back again. One engine wouldn’t start normally. Back to gate. Same A320-200. Writing this in SFO with our luggage stuck on the plane and no other options out. How can they keep pressing the same planes back into service.

### "worst flight I have been on"
Toronto to Winnipeg. This is the worst flight I have been on. On the first flight from home to my destination it was delayed 4 hours for an unknown reason. I was just leaving my house when I found this out, it was also not updated on the website. On the way home we boarded the plane on time and it has been now 3.5 hours.

### "nothing wrong with this flight"
Toronto to Amsterdam. Essentially, there was nothing wrong with this flight, but it was not great. If it wasn't for the fact they were offering a terrific deal on a direct flight, I would have paid a bit more to travel with a European based airline. The service on a full flight was stressed. Frazzled is not quite the right word, but slightly chaotic and slow is probably a good description. Flight attendants were there to do their job, nothing more. Food was ok, standard fare, but warm and cooked well. I chose pasta with a tomato-based sauce. The seats felt a bit too cramped for a 7hr+ flight. Not a great recline either. A positive of Air Canada is that the full bar is available in economy class, something that makes a long-haul flight a little more enjoyable. On the ground though, they were really helpful. For this trip, I travelled with my wheelchair bound daughter. Often, we've found, any communication of her special needs onboard is not relayed to the airport staff. In this case, the staff at YYZ were ready to help and made sure she was properly helped on and had all she needed in place. Pre-flight attentiveness makes a lot of difference to us when we travel, and for this, I can recommend Air Canada.

### "cancel my flights or delayed"
Winnipeg to Sault ste. Marie. I fly with these guys every month. I can only fly them because they are the only way I can fly out of where I live. They are unfortunately the only airline. Every time I use them I'm lucky to even board. They always cancel my flights or delayed at least 50 percent of my time. Today I am spending 11.5 hours of total waiting time in only the airports compared to what I scheduled originally 4 hours. And they give me a 10 dollar meal voucher. If only west jet flew to my home airport.

### "Awful service"
Toronto to London. The most horrifying trip of my life! I will never be flying with Air Canada and will tell my friends and family to do the same. My flight was from Toronto to Dhaka via London and Delhi. ; December 29th to January 19th I got my ticket early October with all seats selected and luggage insurance. Ticket was changed last minute with changed awful seats without permission and wouldn't allow to change it. On the day of the flight, it was delayed and I missed my connection. To which, Air Canada re routed me to a much longer flight with long delay. I also missed my domestic connection and even after repeated complaints, nothing was done about that. I was suggested to notify the agent about my luggage the next day, which I did. They still lost my luggage. I received my luggage 3 days later with no apology or refund as the insurance suggested. I was given the last seat in the middle row right beside the washroom (despite allocating the seat and booking it 3 months in advance). This was after I had explained and requested my situation. I boarded the flight from Dubai and right after they declared a delay due to "technical difficulties". I was starving and willing to even pay for some food; there were no flight attendants to be seen in this time. Flight reached delayed by another hour at Toronto and apparently there was no gate arrangement so we waited another half hour to 45 mins in the plane at the airport after landing. The luggage took forever to come: another hour and half! The flight was supposed to land 5:00 am, landed around 8:30 am and by the time I could get out of the airport it was 10:00 am. This is by far the worst flight experience of life and I sincerely request all travelers to reconsider before booking a flight with Air Canada. Awful service!

### "always had some kind of hiccup"
We have flown with Air Canada well over a dozen times in the past two years, every trip always had some kind of hiccup, mostly minor things for the most part, but our recent trip Jan 16th 2019 was the final straw for us.We were departing from Saint Louis flying to Toronto and then getting a connecting flight from there. While at the gate in Saint Louis waiting to depart, the captain announced that the plane is off balance and he needs to do some adjustments, so he makes the announcement that all women must sit at the front of the plane and the men must go to the back of the plane (safety first, no problem). Meanwhile all of this meant that we were 45 min late to depart Saint Louis, later on during the flight the captain announced that he realized that some of us had connecting flights and put our minds at ease by saying that the connecting flights would wait for us. Our flight from Toronto was to departure at 10:10pm, after sprinting through the airport we got to the gate at 10:05pm, the girl at the gate told us that she was told to release the plane. We then complained to customer service and they said 'oh well its not our fault it was the weather', and then he says to us : 'you guys should of had time to get through customs and make it here on time' we're in our 30's and we are in good shape, there was no way that even an Olympic runner wouldn't of made it on time! we continued to argue that the captain wouldn't take off because of the weight issue. Customer service just kept saying "its due to bad weather " therefore, they wouldn't pay for hotel room.

### "the most horrible customer service"
Air Canada is the most horrible airline ever. I usually don’t book with them but I did it this time because I didn’t have any other option. They have the most horrible customer service. The staff are rude and arrogant. My flight was supposed to be at 1:45pm, it’s delayed until 4pm so far so might get further delayed. Every time we get closer to the flight time they send another email delaying it further more in increments of 15 minutes it has been absolutely annoying. I have got 8 emails since this morning about the delayed flight. I had to travel from another City to Montreal to take my flight. I’ve been at the airport since 10 am. Won’t ever book with them again.

### "very upsetting to pay so much money"
My elderly dad is old and has limited mobility. After careful consideration, I decided to pay the extra money to upgrade him and I to premium economy on our return trip from India to Canada. When we checked in our luggage, the Air Canada attendant only marked two of the luggages as priory and not the other two. When we arrived to Canada, we got two of our luggages right away and the other two we waited 1.5 hours for. There are only a few perks for paying so much more money to upgrade to premium economy and having gotten our luggage right away would have been very nice. My father was struggling with the waiting. I complained to Air Canada and they offered me 15% off on my next ticket purchase and this offer expires in a year. I am not going to be doing any travelling for the next year due to having surgery and work commitments. I asked Air Canada for a bigger discount (because I purchased two premium tickets) and a longer expiry date so that I can actually make use of their goodwill gesture. Air Canada came back saying that was the best they can do. Of course they can to better than that. They just chose not to. This speaks volumes to me about how much they actually care about customer service. Needless to say, it is very upsetting to pay so much money and to not get everything you paid for.

### "lost my luggage in Toronto"
Dublin to Toronto. They lost my luggage in Toronto on a 20 hour layover, told me 5 times it was still loading. I had to file a claim, got back to Pittsburgh after my layover (checked online for my baggage tracking and it said it was still loading, nothing would come up) my bags were not in Pittsburgh, so I called someone, they said they’d deliver them to my house later that DAY because they found them in Toronto, Still never got my bags, so I called them the next day, said they’d be out for delivery at 930am, 5pm rolls around and still no bags. No one is answering the phone and everyone we did get to talk to was zero help and they were all rude. I called them about 50 times with no answer, so I waited. They called me at 11pm the next day after I was already suppose to have my bags the day before and said they’d be there later that night. I got my bags 3 days later. Thank you Air Canada for the horrible customer service, I am very understanding, but there was no communication at all.

### "Avoid this particular plane"
London to Toronto. Boeing 789 plane is so poorly configured that passenger comfort is given the least importance. Seat width and seat pitch of 30 inch is too tight for long flight. Long lines at the washrooms. Avoid this particular plane.

### "surprisingly pleasant"
Atlanta to Shanghai via Toronto. 2hr flight to YYZ on the embraer (operated by Sky Regional) was surprisingly pleasant. 15hr from YYZ to PVG in economy was also a pleasant surprise. Comfortable seat with good recline, free pillow and blanket, good entertainment system, friendly multilingual staff (at least 4 languages spoken--English, French, Mandarin, Cantonese--probably Spanish as well). Asian vegetarian meal was OK, could use a little more protein and more flavour for parts of it, but certainly adequate. Free beverages to go around. Only complaint is that the toilets were not very clean -- toilet bowls clearly had not been cleaned adequately for many weeks. This is a maintenance issue and not the fault of cabin crew.

### "Air Canada was wonderful"
First time with Air Canada. Traveled Boston to Dubai return via Toronto. Had trepidations about booking with them based on existing reviews but wanted to avoid having to pay an additional $800 for a non-stop with another carrier. Outgoing packed a medium size carry-on in case checked luggage does not arrive with me. Turns out this precaution was totally not needed. Air Canada was wonderful. Ground staff were friendly, and importantly, were intelligent and understood passengers' questions. On all 4 flight sectors, service was efficient. On all flights but the last, FAs were cheerful and went about their tasks with a smile. Food was mediocre, but, really, who realistically expects fine dining in economy? Plenty of liquids and juices on board. Legroom was okay. Had an aisle seat for sectors 2 and 3, and middle-guy and window-guy could easily slip by without my having to stand up. All flights on time. Thank you, AC. Where have you been all my life? I am your new fan.

### "get rid of their new baggage fees"
I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s! I just wish they would quickly get rid of their new baggage fees for long-haul flights.

### "was an excellent flight"
Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver. This was an excellent flight in a brand new 737Max. Upon boarding staff were cheerful and helpful. The seating was roomy and was in the front row window seat as it is easier to get in and out around the passenger beside me. The IFE has much larger screens and more selections than the other AC narrow body planes. I really appreciated that. The attendant serving us in the front cabin was attentive with the wine and beverage service. As I fly AC a lot I noticed that dinner service had fewer choices and it was not served as courses nor were there 2 linens on the tray. Given this was a flight to a beach destination and I bought the return ticket at a very reasonable price, I can understand you would not get the same level of meal services I experience when traveling to Toronto, Montreal or Europe. One disappointment is the size of the forward rest room...thankfully I am a tall slim person. It would feel very cramped for some others. Also missing was the hand and face lotion that one typically finds in business class. This I missed as the air is so dry. I would appreciate it if AC would add that to the business class rest rooms on the 737Max. Check in was smooth and well organized. There is no lounge at PVR for front cabin passengers. The flight left on time and arrived early. I will be returning to Mexico on the same type of plane in the front cabin and look forward to the trip. I appreciate that AC has scheduled so many flights to Puerto Vallarta.

### "a terrible experience"
Toronto to New York. Currently still waiting on the next flight out back home to NYC. They did not allow me to check in bags when I was 5 minutes late because their kiosk wasn’t working and printing out my bag tag. I wasn’t allowed to get on my flight even though I was there an hour and a half early. I had to pay $100 on top of paying such a hefty price for the flight. The people here made me go back and forth this airport to find where to go. Absolutely a terrible experience.

### "No food provided"
Vancouver to Toronto. No food provided, not even a pretzel! Extra charges for every piece of luggage checked in. All 3 flight during my one week vacation were delayed (4 hours the first one) The planes don't have enough in-cabin space to accommodate traveler's belongings. I had to check in my carry-on in the end. Service was about the worst I have ever experienced. Service was interrupted at one occasion due to turbulence, I asked for a coffee but since they could not serve hot beverages during that moment the flight attendant gave me an empty cup so that I can claim my coffee when the seat belt sign went off. Waited an hour for them to come see me (that little light to call assistance is useless on that flight because they ignore you). Once she came back, took my cup and that was the end of it. Waited for 2 hours for a coffee I never got.

### "absolutely appalling"
St. John's to Boston via Halifax. The original flight out of St John's left 1.5 hours after scheduled departure although the status was not delayed and we boarded reasonably on time. Landed in Halifax and got back onto the same plane to go to Boston after clearing US customs. Got to Boston and my bag had not made it out of Halifax although both of my husband's bags made it. We filed a delayed baggage report with the Air Canada baggage office in Boston on 1 Jan 2019 - same day as our flight. We flew on to Las Vegas and were informed that the bag would be routed to us within 2 days. It is now day 4 on the 4 Jan 2019 and we still have no bag. We have spoken to at least ten different people on the phone number provided for Air Canada delayed baggage. Turns out we are dealing with a call centre where there are no clear lines of communication as we have now been told about five different versions of where my bag is. We decided to get in a cab and go to Las Vegas airport to see if we could find out more information. Air Canada have a shared baggage office managed by a different company. They told us the bag was no in Toronto and most definitely not arrived in Vegas on 3 Jan 2019 when it was supposed to reach us. We called the delayed baggage number again and actually ended up giving the phone to one of the staff at the office because the guy on the phone was adamant our bag arrived in Vegas - turns out he was wrong. We are due to fly home to Australia on 4 Jan 2019 so gave numerous instructions to now get the bag to our home address - we verified that this information was on my file reference on the World Tracer website - great we can see the information on there, my bag might get home! Oh wait we just called Air Canada delayed baggage hotline and have been informed it is now going back to Boston from Toronto and is not scheduled further than that. Now we have already told these people numerous times we don't live in Boston. So after giving clear instructions again for at least the fifth time that the bag needs to now get to Australia, we are still in limbo. It is impossible to actually speak to someone directly at Air Canada because they have made themselves fantastic at being unreachable - no email addresses or phone contact numbers. The delayed baggage call centre cannot communicate accurate information and don't know anything but those are the only people you can speak to. We fly regularly every year and have used many different airlines. Never have I experienced anything like this. The customer service and assistance at Air Canada is absolutely appalling and I am astounded that an airline can operate like this. By the way Air Canada, I am still waiting for my bag.

### "the first option on my list"
Houston to Frankfurt via Montreal. I showed up at the Houston airport without my passport and there was not time to go home to get it and return. The flight had been booked through Priceline so I called them. They said I was out of luck and there was nothing they could do. Then I tried calling Air Canada who the flight was through. The Air Canada lady worked hard to find an alternate route to Tel Aviv the same day since I had a tour starting the next morning. She was able to get an alternate route booked for me later in the day at no extra charge. I loved the plane, the food, and the personnel, not to mention that Air Canada was more affordable for me. They will be the first option on my list for my next flight overseas!

### "we could not make it
We flew to Europe last summer but on our way back to Vancouver from London our flight got moved 3 hours earlier so we could not make it and we had to be put on the next day flight. After exchanging several emails with customer service that we should get a hotel room all we got is a 15% discount in the future. We were lucky we had friends so we stayed with them but that should not have been the case. We had to pay for the luggage storage at the airport plus we both lost 1 day work so it all adds up quite a bit.

### "very special concierge service"
The flight from Toronto to Santiago de Chile started with a great meal at the Toronto Signature Lounge and the usual great comforts in a bus class flight. What was very special this time was the concierge service by on the ground in Santiago. Due to 1/2 hour delay we had to meet our domestic flight within one hour - tight! The concierge  guided us through immigration, luggage pick-up and security in person and with friendly patience. She also managed to secure a lost item.

### "has direct flight to Delhi"
Vancouver to Delhi. One of the clear advantages Air Canada has the direct flight to Delhi. However, there flights whether direct or not is really expensive compared to their competition. The change fees for a flight are enormous and the food wasn't too great. The cabin crew was friendly but I found the seats   a bit too small. The entertainment system compared to Lufthansa and United is not good enough. However, I have found air Canada to be on time and reliable.

### "Dinner was poor for me"
Toronto to Zurich. Air Canada prices were always good. Took it this time to Zurich and regret my decision. No leg room, poor food and 7.5 hour flight I got 1 proper meal and 1 snack. Who gives a slice of bread for breakfast? Dinner was poor for me.

### "staff were accommodating"
Frankfurt to Toronto. The check-in process was quick and easy. I flew with my husband and two small children (nearly 2 years old, and 4 years old). All of the staff were accommodating and professional. My children were given toys and colouring books to entertain them during the flight. Our flight was pretty empty so they were able to spread my family out over a few seats to give us more room, and they checked on me frequently to see if I needed and water or anything, or to play with the children for a moment. The only downside being that children under 2 don't get a meal, but they had some left over and brought me one for my daughter anyway. Our connecting flight boarded much earlier than it was supposed to, so we had to run to the gate and didn't have time to get any snacks or water before boarding our long flight.

### "No meal voucher or apology"
Ottawa to Atlanta via Toronto. Flight from Ottawa to Toronto was delayed by 4 hours and I missed my connection flight. I was rebooked on a 20:40 flight but there were flights scheduled to leave at 1245 and 1635 to Atlanta, so I had to patiently wait for 12 hours. No meal voucher or apology from airline for the inconvenience.

### "is apparently a premium service"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Toronto with Air Canada. Brutal! They actually charged me for my baggage? $30 a bag after overcharging me for tickets. Don’t fly with these idiots. Service sucks and they nickel and dime you worse than Ryanair. The difference is Ryanair is an economy air service and they are prompt and polite. Air Canada is neither of those things and is apparently a premium service. They are not.

### "compensated for our inconvenience"
Not Verified |  Fort St. John to Las Vegas. Can’t say enough good things about the counter staff in Fort St John and customer service staff of Air Canada in general. Missed our plane because of overbooking problems and was completely compensated for our inconvenience.

### "I missed my flight"
Toronto to Edmonton. I missed my flight due to delay in immigration procedure and the staff at immigration mentioned that Air Canada will arrange another flight, but they didn't arrange anything and they told to buy a new ticket.

### "bad compared to Delta"
They were they 1 hour 15 minutes late because previous flight was late leaving gate,  the in-flight staff was rude to the point of combative. No in flight beverages because of nearly non-existent "turbulence". Then when they did serve water, the cup had a hole in bottom and attendant watched as water poured out onto myself and guy next me. The two attendants then started laughing about it. I fly monthly to Toronto from Atlanta for business (usually Delta but sometime AC), and consistently Air Canada is bad compared to Delta. This was the last straw for me.

### "wouldn’t let us board our next flight"
Canceled our connections before we landed and wouldn’t let us board our next flight even though it hadn’t left yet and we were standing at the gate. Very unhelpful staff. Didn’t offer any suitable alternatives, gave us a 22$ food allowance for a full 24h unexpected layover

### "no longer earning loyalty points"
Toronto to Vancouver. Was surprised recently to discover that I am no longer earning any loyalty points for my Air Canada flights. After inquiring with the airline I discovered that they no longer issue points for most flights other than upgraded classes or higher priced fares for same route. I fly often for business but obviously won't charge my company more money for a higher fare just to get points. This is the first airline I can recall not giving even reduced points on base fares.

### "delayed by 6 hrs"
Houston to Dubai via Toronto. Flight from Toronto to Dubai delayed by 6 hrs leading to issues with my onward booking. On top of that my return flight was  cancelled leading me to rebook. Customer services poor when applying for refund. When I called, I was told they are still reviewing requests from October (I called in December) Tells you all you need to know about an airlines that they are processing claims from 2 months ago. I would  pay for a better airline next time.

### "Air Canada has really improved"
Montreal to Vancouver. Air Canada has really improved! I was very loyal previously to the main competition WJ but recently decided to fly AC. I am so impressed with so many things but primarily the staff and the attitudes. Very professional, nice, calm and helpful. No screeching of idiotic bad jokes over the speakers, etc. The seats are comfortable, there is actually inflight entertainment, and the whole experience is like getting an upgrade!! I look forward to AC seat sales!

### "Excellent service"
Newark to Vancouver. Excellent service by the flight crew and flight attendants. We left 1.5 hours after schedule departure and yet arrived only half an hour after scheduled arrival. On top of that, the flight attendant for my row offered whole cans of drinks and served with a smile.

### "delayed on the tarmac for five hours"
We took Air Canada from Calgary to Vancouver during a huge snow storm. We were delayed on the tarmac for five hours for only a one hour flight. The captain said we only had twenty minutes left about six times. We eventually learn our flight was cancelled and head back to the gate. Only to learn that our flight was in fact not cancelled and we had to wait to get the plane de-iced again. We live in Canada so this is expected to have a major snow storm. The people on the plane were tired, cranky and we were all hungry. We were also not offered free food or drinks during our delay. Which by the 4th hour we all really just wanted a beer. But Air Canada gave the flight a e-coupon to everyone that went through that experience which really made an impression that Air Canada cares about their customers and their status. Thanks to them I am able to spend Christmas with my boyfriend this year in Vancouver. Hopefully there is not another snow storm. Or I hope there is.

### "have nothing but good things to say"
This is my fourth or fifth trip with Air Canada and I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences. The terminal used for Canadian domestic flights at Vancouver is quite dated, but plenty of options for eating and drinking while waiting for the flight. Volunteers were requested to check carry-on bags (something I always count on happening, as my carry on tends to be quite heavy, always a treat). Boarding was expeditious considering the size of the aircraft, and we were soon on our way. Food and beverage service was an average pace and quality. Buy on board options were quite pricey, so I abstained. On their newer aircraft, AC's inflight entertainment is some of the best in the industry. Arrival into Toronto was early and the flight time overall was one hour quicker than scheduled! Connection in Toronto is always such a breeze, and USA pre-clearance in Toronto means you arrive into the USA without a need for passport control. Toronto to Boston was a standard North American flight of fine quality. Air Canada's gates in Boston are right next to baggage claim and the exit. Regarding money matters, I paid $173 one-way for this trip, which is quite reasonable for transcontinental journey. Overall another wonderful Air Canada experience.

### "a big disappointment"
Toronto to Delhi. Extremely disappointed with the food. Except for the main meal everything else was cold. The main meal was worst than horrible. Agreed it was going direct to Delhi but there was no other food option than rice and a chicken or veg. Dish. There was 1 bathroom for premier economy but all economy passengers were allowed to use it. There were huge line ups.The bathroom was filthy and staff paid no attention at all to the blue light request. I am proud to be Canadian but sorry Air Canada, you were a big disappointment.

### "Never Air Canada again"
Air Canada re-booked me twice at the airport because it was snowing in Montreal, although there was no storm reported online. They turned a 23-hour flight into a 36-hour flight. Dropped my frequent flyer miles, added a flight — economy class — w one half hour to go through customs and immigration, get my suitcase and make the transfer. Of course I didn’t make the flight (I pointed it out to them when they were booking — they said I might be able to make it if everything went well). I had bought my ticket directly from the airline to avoid any problems. In the end, they refunded me $113. Never Air Canada again.

### "it was a satisfying experience"
Trip YYZ-YYC (return) went smoothly with airplanes full in both directions. Departure from Toronto was delayed due to medical problems of one of the passengers, but we arrived on time to Calgary. The return flight was delayed 50 mins partly due to the deicing procedures in snow covered Calgary. The seats were fine, although had some breadcrumbs on the YYC-YYZ flight, the crew was friendly, IFE available only if you purchase the headphones. Food on this four hours flight was offered only for purchase. On the first leg the stewardess reminded me that I prepaid in advance and so I had a vegetable wrap which was pretty bad. I forgot that I also paid for food on the return flight and thus I missed the meal, but considering its poor quality this did not matter. Otherwise it was a satisfying experience. I presume that the usual long wait for luggage on arrival in Toronto is the fault of the airport services and not the airline.

### "friendly cabin service"
Comfortable seats, friendly cabin service, efficient boarding. Air Canada is certainly the best airline in North America. I also used the Air Canada lounge in both LAX and in Toronto which were ok (although the Air Canada Lounge in Montreal has better food). The only negative point was the check-in at LAX. There was a long queue at the priority check-in counter and the (rude) check in staff refused to give business-class passengers priority through using the other (economy) check-in counters.

### "Seats are narrow"
Seoul Incheon to Vancouver. Seats are narrow and the seat pitch is to a bare minimum. I chose this flight only because the price was right to the level of service they offer on board. They failed to offer the special meal that I had ordered in advance and I was given a meal that was kind of edible. I will fly AC in the future only when it is the last option I have.

### "6 flights, 6 delays"
Toronto to Lyon via Montreal. 6 flights, 6 delays (departures and arrivals), dirty plane, some with payphones (yet free on the way), staff unfriendly and unfamiliar with the procedures. Forgetting on arrival in Canada when coming from Argentina it is mandatory to collect suitcases, even in transit),. Good meal, even if we had a lunch instead of a breakfast. Big baggage problem: delivery and care. Quality and recent entertainment. FR- 6 vols, 6 retards (départs et arrivées), avion sale et glacial, certains avec les écouteurs payants (pourtant gratuit sur l'aller), personnel peu agréable et peu au courant des procédures (oubliant juste qu'à l'arrivée au Canada en venant d'Argentine il est obligatoire de récupérer ces valises, même en transit, un détail...), repas bon, même si nous avons eu un déjeuner au lieu d'un petit-déjeuner. Gros problème de bagages : livraison et soin. Divertissement de qualité et récent.

### "not one of our checks bags arrived"
Toronto to Orlando. Another disastrous trip with Air Canada. Every time I fly with this airline there is always a mishap. Delayed / changed flights and 0 out of 4 bags made it to the destination. We brought the family to have a good Disney world vacation and not one of our checks bags arrived. Terrible support afterword. No answers and no staff to help - “ here full out this form can’t help you” is all we got.

### "food selection was non-existent"
First flight (Quebec-Toronto) was cancelled in advance. I called AC customer service. No good reason for cancellation, poor advice on rescheduling, caused a lot of stress. Toronto to Hong Kong was delayed by an hour. Arrived with 30 minutes to catch a separate flight to KLIA as that flight was delayed as well, but was already disembarked with no choice. AC representative stated we would be given $100-200 meal ticket in compensation, but it turned out to only be HKD75 (C$12.50) The cheapest meal available at the HK airport was HKD90. Onboard my food selection was non-existent. Just handed a tray, and what is the point of requesting a special meal when your meal is given to someone else? I got someone's vegetarian meal, which I did not request.

### "worst traveling experience"
Not Verified |  My husband and I had booked a flight AC85 from Tel Aviv to Toronto, on November 24. We had a connecting flight from Toronto to Newark (flight number AC7654), which was supposed to depart at 18:40 on November 24. The flight from Tel Aviv was delayed by over an hour; however, the pilot did his best to get us to our destination as soon as possible. As a result, we arrived at the Toronto Airport with an hour to spare before our next flight. We arrived at our gate at approximately 18:10, the boarding time. However Air Canada notified us that we weren't permitted to board the plane because our plane was late, and they didn't have enough time to store our luggage. Despite telling her that they could've sent the luggage to us the next day, she persisted that we weren't allowed to board, and gave us a pamphlet, "Interrupted Trip Information", a hotel reservation for the night, $15.00 each for dinner at a restaurant, and tickets to Newark for the next day. Afterwards it was brought to our knowledge that the flight was overbooked, which may be the reason for us giving up our seats on the original flight. We then had to fly to Montreal, and then to Newark. Consequently, instead of arriving at Newark at 20:00 on Saturday, we arrived at Newark at 16:30 on Sunday. This behavior was unprofessional to say the least. This was the worst traveling experience we've ever had.

### "the food is poor"
My Air Canada flight left Hong Kong at 20.00. A meal was served shortly after take off. It was so bad I left almost all of it. If I'd had any idea that would be the case, I would have brought something on board. Talk about stale, you couldn't even get a fork through the dessert cake. Surely someone should be checking the quality of the food. To add to my disappointment, there was only one opportunity for a beverage. I would have dearly enjoyed a second glass of wine, but it was not an option. Clearly, either a tea totalling crew or that's the new limit. There was not an option of a snack or non-alcoholic beverage. Shortly before landing, we were served breakfast. I can't remember exactly what it was, but again, it was not good and the bun was so stale, I couldn't even tear it open with my fingers. Why even serve bread that must be a month old? Doesn't anyone do a quality check? The entertainment options were poor. Most movies were old. I think there might have been only a couple of current films offered. Seating was fine, but given the upcharge to fly premium economy it was not worth it. I've flown long-haul flights with Air Canada before, sometimes business class, sometimes economy. Sometimes the flights were good, but more often than not, the food is poor and the flight attendants seem to act as they would rather be a home. Last time I will fly an Air Canada long haul flight. Next flight to Hong Kong will be on Cathay. I've had it with Air Canada.

### "charged for our bags"
Toronto to Zurich. I have never been so disappointed with an airline. After arguments with the baggage lady, my husband and I were charged for both of our first complimentary bags. Of course, we proceeded to have our bags refunded which were denied despite the fact that our booking confirmation states that our first bags were complimentary. We made sure when we were booking it had the little baggage icon to show baggage was included. Not to mention these were both direct flights we booked. Truly ridiculous.

### "they can't let me board"
St John to Los Angeles via Toronto. The first flight scheduled to depart at 5:00am. However, it was delayed by 30 minutes. The weather was OK. I arrived Toronto around 7:00am local time. My next flight to LAX is at 8am. I ran all the way through security, US border and arrived gate F69 at 7:40am. Then the gate lady told me my bag is not delivered yet and they can't let me board. I then ran to the customer service of Air Canada. I asked them what option I have now and I told them that I have to arrive LA before noon. The two senior ladies were helpful. They were trying to find flights to SF or San Diego. However, the third lady denied each proposal. The flight to SD would be OK for me because I can rent a car and drive up to LA for the appointment. However, they were all denied by the other agent. The senior lady issued a $15 meal voucher to me but I was furious after the agent asked me to go away otherwise she will rip off the voucher. I have to accept the next flight which is 4 hours later. When I booked the ticket, why the itinerary designed for only 1.5 hour transfer if the bag transfer is so inefficient? What about the boarded passengers with transfer flights? Why the bag is even slower than myself? I have to wait to clear the security and US border and I can manage to arrive the gate 20 minutes before departure.

### "get another kind of compensation"
Brussels to Montreal in January 2018. When I arrived in Montreal, my luggage was not there. I had to wait for it 5 days and it was a mess to get the right information. They called me two times, lying me because they actually didn't know where my luggage was. I had to argue with the customer service to be delivered at my place out of work schedule. I filled the form to get a compensation but they suggested me 15% off for 4 tickets. I usually travel alone. I contacted several times the customer service to get another kind of compensation which could fit with my situation but I never got an answer or a call which is what I asked for. When we ask for being called back, the first thing to do is to call back. The worst customer service I've  had to deal with.

### "we were simply too late"
I was scheduled to take a flight from Toronto to Indianapolis with my ticket that was booked through United Airlines. But the plane was operated by Air Canada, and we were told to drop our bags off at the Air Canada counter. We arrived at the counter 45 minutes before the departure, the lady at the counter simply dismissed us saying that we were too late. She simply kept saying she was sorry that we were simply too late. Now I have wasted 4 hours because of a layover and I'm beyond upset for being treated this way. But United was helpful enough to rebook us through this trip and would like to thank United Airlines for its service.

### "made so many mistakes"
My original flight would have taken me from Dallas to Montreal to Vancouver to Melbourne. My problems started when I was not allowed to place my bag into an overhead compartment on my first flight leaving from Dallas because of a lack of available space. After checking my bag at the gate and boarding the plane I observed a flight attendant access her belongings which had been conveniently placed in an overhead compartment inside the passenger area of the aircraft. My next flight leaving Montreal was delayed 90 minutes due to engine problems which forced me to miss my connection in Vancouver. I was then rebooked on a flight to Sydney which was delayed for 60 minutes. When boarding the plane in Vancouver I noticed I had not been placed in a seat with upgraded leg room which I had paid for months before. When I inquired as to why I was not in a seat with more legroom I was told the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done. Upon arriving in Sydney I was met by an employee who advised I would be unable to make my connection flight from Sydney to Melbourne and handed a new ticket for a different flight. While in Sydney I found out that my luggage was still in Vancouver. I did not receive my luggage for 48 hours. After boarding my first flight leaving Melbourne there was a power issue forcing us to be grounded for just over an hour. This caused me to again miss my connection in Vancouver and Air Canada wanted to rebook myself and other passengers on another Air Canada flight. The problem with that was our original flight was from Vancouver to Dallas and they now wanted to rebook us on other non direct flights. After voicing my concerns I was booked onto an American Airlines flight in order to fly directly from Vancouver back to Dallas. Upon returning to Dallas I was again informed that my luggage did not make it to the new plane and was still in Vancouver. I filed a complaint online on November 18th after all the problems arrived getting to Australia. I contacted customer service since customer relations does not have a phone number on November 22 to check on the status of my complaint. I was informed by customer service that there was no way for me to speak with someone over the phone in customer relations and my complaint could take up to 40 days to be investigated. I’m confused as to how this air lines could have made so many mistakes in such a short amount of time on every single one of my flights. Most of the crew was very polite but I am still disappointed and I will not fly this airline again!

### "Staff was very attentive"
Detroit to Rome via Toronto / Montreal. Transatlantic trip made by three segments. All flights pretty much on time, with easy boarding processes. DTW YYZ is a regional jet, hence, other than light refreshments and a squeezed seat, nothing much is to expected. Transit within AC’s T1 at YYZ was easy and smooth. YYZ YUL on 320 with PTVs (although the audio jack was not working at all). First time going through YUL and I expected to be much larger than that, probably on the same scale as YYZ. Easy boarding in Premium Economy (priority lane) makes settling in easy. Premium Economy seating is better than competitors (LH) with larger recline. Overall very satisfied. Good value for the money, as I bought a DTW FCO ticket for $ 560.00 and then paid $ 295.00 each way for the PE upgrade through bidding: I could have paid additional $ 600.00 each way and flown business. Staff was very attentive and offered a good quality of food. Entertainment system was top notch. Still, I would have expected AC to offer wi-fi service on its newer 787s.

### "polite and accomodating"
Not Verified |  Halifax to Toronto. Excellent service, Flight was late but the seating on board was very nice and the new J Class seats have a leg rest now. The 737 was very quite almost like a mini 787. The service was good menu options and they served 2 rounds of pre dinner drinks and the flight attendants were polite and accomodating.

### "seats are really tight"
Their Boeing 787 seats are really tight and uncomfortable. Seat pitch is 31 inches. Washrooms were few and dirty and long line ups. Avoid flying this particular aircraft. Air Canada offer average service but still much better when compared to other North American airlines.

### "mismanaged boarding process"
Vancouver to Toronto. I typically avoid Air Canada when I can but this November I had no alternative so I flew with them again. I was about to miss my flight so I called them to ask about my options. Turns out there is a rule for missing your flight within a certain time. Even though I asked, they told me my only option was changing my ticket for a cost higher than the original. What's worse the agent was trying to sell me an even more expensive fight saying that's the only option available. Luckily I had checked the flights before hand so I made him give me the cheapest option available. Still cost more than the original and I didn't need to pay that. Besides that the service was bad as always, but I was expecting that already. They've also got the most mismanaged boarding process.

### "delayed by almost 3 hours"
I was scheduled to fly Toronto to Las Vegas in the morning at 8:30. First I was informed a few weeks ago that the flight was changed to 10:25 am. I arrived early at the airport today to find out it is delayed again by almost 3 hours.

### "delayed and ultimately cancelled"
Toronto to New York. My flight was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to aground stop issues because of weather concerns. Obviously the weather delays are outside of Air Canada's control; however after waiting on the aircraft for several hours, we finally reached the delayed departure time when the ground stop was lifted and we should have been able to take off. It wasn't until this point that we were informed that the crew would go over their time limit if they continued this trip and that instead of heading to LGA we had to wait for a new crew. This is unexcusable as we had known about the ground stop for hours and Air Canada should have had the foresight to address this issue and switch the crew while we were waiting for the weather delay anyway. While waiting for the crew to switch we miss our window of opportunity as a new weather-related ground stop was issued and the flight was ultimately cancelled (meanwhile other airlines and aircraft had departed and made it to LGA during this time, as we should have). To add insult to injury, when Air Canada rescheduled my itinerary, they placed me on a new flight that was scheduled to depart YYZ on the 17th to make up for my cancelled flight that was supposed to leave on the 15th. However they did not rebook my originally scheduled return flight on the 16th so that my new itinerary scheduled a return flight before I even departed for my destination. When I first contacted Air Canada to correct this obvious problem, I was almost charged a rebooking fee to reschedule my return flight. Every interaction required waiting in long lines just to speak to someone who had no idea what they were doing and would either send me to a different line or ask me to wait longer. I will never be flying with Air Canada again.

### "AC totally nailed it"
Not Verified |  Cleveland to Lisbon via Toronto. I had my flight cancelled due to a snow storm. I purchased my flight to United, but operated by Air Canada. When trying to reschedule, the options from United were just unreasonable (2 days later). Then I called the Air Canada customer service. They were willing to book me on the next possible flight even outside their alliance. This is just amazing and rare to see. You can sense when you have a good CS when problems come up and AC totally nailed it.

### "Onboard experience was simply great"
Excellent return trip from Calgary to Sydney. Check in was flawless and simple. Onboard experience was simply great. No shortage of food / snacks / beverages. I flew Business domestic legs and Economy on the long haul sector. Even in Economy, beer wine and spirits were free and generously offered to the mostly Australian and Canadian passengers. Most passengers in my vicinity were surprised as other airlines charge for this from North America, even long haul. Food was tasty - fish, chicken or beef. Snack mid flight and hot breakfast - chive omlette or maple waffles - prior to landing. Flight crew were professional and friendly, well dressed and attentive. Entertainment full of choices, enough for both directions. Seat confortable with good recline for Economy. No complaints at all, would recommend Air Canada for flights to Australia. Very well done.

### "Terrible customer service"
Kelowna to Vancouver. Terrible customer service. When boarding the plane the agent would not touch our boarding pass or passport she demanded our documents for our entire family were turned to specific pages & refused to be of any service. She was snippy, rude and useless. Terrible customer service and experience. We fly to Hawaii every year with Westjet, this is our first time flying Air Canada. Never Again. You guys are a bunch of rude jerks.

### "Not worth the upgrade"
Pittsburgh to Frankfurt via Montreal. Not worth the upgrade. Premium Economy food horrible. Cold, rubbery chicken-ish thigh meat with stale cold rolls. Broken inflight entertainment at several passengers seats nearby including mine. Flight attendant barred passengers from using a bathroom directly in the cabin due to no apparent reason other than wanting her own privacy in the area between 1st class and premium. She forced passengers to 'go to the back of the plane' where lines and economy passengers were already overwhelming capacity of the available 2 commodes. Transit in Canadas major cities in my back/forth experience added agitation and chaos and was remarkably coldly delivered. Many missed their flights back to the U.S. on the return from Europe due to the lengthy custom points In Montreal and Toronto. There is very poor signage in both Montreal and Toronto airports and crazy long marches to other gates. Canadian airport workers pretend not to speak English and point you to move along and even misdirect passengers to the frequent and cumbersome security checks. Avoid Air Canada and Canadian major cities' airports.

### "Seats are too tight"
Configuration and seat pitch of this aircraft (787)is not suitable at all for ultra long flights. Seats are too tight and not comfortable. Looks like Air Canada tried to put seats whereever they can find some space ignoring passenger needs and comfort. Very few washrooms on this 14 hours and 40 minutes flight were resulting in long line ups. Seat 30 C is only 20 inches away from washroom and avoid this row at all costs. Aisle are too tight and you got bumped by trollies and passengers.

### "plane looks so crowded"
Flew Toronto to London Heathrow with Air Canada. 10 Abreast seating on 777 is terrible. Seating and aisles are so narrow and plane looks so crowded. Service was normal with noting mentionable. Seating padding and comfort was bad for long haul. Few and small washrooms on this aircraft.

### "the flight was perfect"
Excellent flight between Montréal and Tokyo-Narita. Except for the seat comfort and the minimal seat pitch, the flight was perfect. Professional flight attendants who were attentive and friendly, good Inflight Entertainment system and food. Flight was on time.

### "Complete joke"
Flew Air Canada from Edmonton to Ottawa. Complete joke. Flight was delayed by 4 hours because an instrument was broken and apparently discovered at the very last second. Was left on the plane for an hour as they told us they were asking other airlines for a replacement part because why would we want to keep spare parts on hand? Save yourself some time and fly Westjet.

### "water dripping down"
Vancouver to Seoul. I had the worst experience on this flight I took last minute because I had to attend a funeral. The seat I was sitting had water dripping down from the airconditioning for take off and landing. I pressed the button to receive help from the crew since this started and no one came for at least 20 minutes. Finally an attendant passes by. She did not recognize that I had the help button on. I told her of the situation and she said that it was normal. She didn’t try to relieve the situation other than letting me know that it was normal. Worst flight service. In addition to that my entertainment system didn’t work. The touch was off so I couldn’t use it.

### "cabin crew deserve recognition"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to Vancouver. I was on a flight where the cabin staff needed to look after a passenger with limited eyesight and a service dog. I have to say that the crew involved were remarkably helpful and effective in their efforts to keep both the dog and owner and all the passengers around them comfortable and relaxed. I was really impressed that AC had cabin crew of this quality. It is easy to complain when things go wrong but the airline - and especially the cabin crew deserve recognition for their professionalism.

### "service was surly and rude"
Vancouver to Sydney. They split my reservation so my 4 year old child couldn't be checked in online and couldn't be placed next to my seat. They eventually sorted it out at the airport but it's just not good enough. They should have re joined reservations and done. Had an anxious 2 week lead in to the flight not knowing what was going happen with seating. Food on flight was some of the worst airline food I have seen. The service was surly and rude. Unless the price is low I wouldn't choose to fly again with them.

### "professional, helpful, attentive"
I fly this route from London to Vancouver several times a year and have seen the onboard service on Air Canada get better and better and they well surpassed all other carriers on this route. From boarding to deplaning, the inflight crew on this most recent flight were outstanding. Very professional, helpful, attentive and cheerful throughout the flight. I often find that after the meal service and duty free sales, crews are rarely about the cabins until later in a flight. Not so this crew - constantly on hand. I’ve travelled on a few five star carriers over the last few years and non surpass this Air Canada crew for quality of service.

### "listening to every announcement anxiously"
Toronto to Halifax. Our gate was changed with no announcement, causing us to miss our flight. We are obsessively careful travellers, and we were listening to every announcement anxiously, especially leading up to our boarding time. Nothing came, so we asked why we weren't boarding yet. We were then casually told there had been a gate change. We ran as fast as we could to the new gate, but were too late. The attendant at the new gate lied and told us she had announced our gate change and even had announced our names several times. She didn't know we are anxious travelers who listen to every announcement, and insisted on repeating that she had indeed called us. I felt very disrespected, and i couldn't believe how blatantly she lied to me.

### "they lost my luggage"
Chicago to Copenhagen via Toronto. I have traveled with Air Canada for first and last time, they lost my luggage. They delivered my bag 2 days after my Arrival. Air Canada destroyed my bag and they charge me extra over $60 for regular bag. Breakfast was disgusting disgusting. The good experience was the team of Flight attendants who were nice people, hard working.

### "I logged a complaint"
Toronto to London via Havana. It is over 3 months since I logged a complaint about my ripped brand new Osprey rucksack protector that was damaged beyond repair. Put in claim immediately, no response, nothing. Put in another, heard nothing. Horrible desk staff. Flight was delayed by 4 hours, rubbish food, dirty toilets, cramped leg room. Using Iberia this year for Havana.

### "avoid this airline in the future"
Nanaimo to Grand Prarie via Vancouver / Calgary. Terrible customer service and very unclear pet policy. Unclear and poorly formatted website with contradicting info required me to spend an extra $200 and ruined what would have been a happy occasion getting a new pet. Customer service after the incident was very very slow and also rude. Took over 2 months to get a rude email response to my complaint and also phone staff was not sympathetic or helpful. Overall I felt that their customer service policy is “you have to know our arbitrary rules from our unclear website or you have to pay massive flight change fees.” I will avoid this airline in the future when I can. Would only recommend that people who have time to comb through their whole website for each individual page related to a topic fly with them.

### "We had excellent service"
Milan to Toronto. We had excellent service on this flight. The cabin crew were courteous and efficient, the food was good, and my seat was comfortable. The in-flight entertainment was good. I watched two movies and 3 TV episodes. The flight was was a few minutes late leaving, but arrived on time.

### "Poor movie choices"
Sydney to Vancouver. I had heard bad things about this airline but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Finally when the drinks trolley came by I asked for water, tea and wine. The staff said to me if everyone ordered 3 drinks he’d be here all day. Couldn’t believe his rude comment. Later a fellow passenger complained to be about how unfriendly the staff were so I wasn’t alone on that front. Trying to change a flight at the ticketing service desk in Vancouver was ridiculous. They were on hold for ages and didn’t give a damn about me standing there for half an hour to enquire. And that’s all I was trying to do, enquire. I missed one of my flights and because of that all my other flights were forfeited! Do not fly with these guys. Poor movie choices and wine. I highly don’t recommend them.

### "able to do it myself online"
San Jose to Calgary via Vancouver. Air Canada has some of the worst customer service of any airline I have flown on. There are times when I have had to change my flights and needed assistance doings so. I usually sit on the phone for 30 minutes because there are "higher than expected call volumes" before I am answered. On two occasions I have been quoted ridiculous amounts to change my flights on the phone only to find out I can do it for a fraction of the price online. The last time they tried to charge me $450 to change my flight and I was able to do it myself for $240 online - the price of the round trip flight was $500 so paying almost double just made no sense. To avoid flying Air Canada I would have to drive an additional 45 minutes to another airport (SFO) to fly Westjet,I think I will do that because dealing with AC is a horrible experience simply said their customer service hasn't gotten any better.

### "Overall an average experience"
Los Angeles to Frankfurt via Toronto. The day before departure, I wanted to check in at the LAX for the trip. But this was not possible with the machines or the ground staff. According to information only Internet check-in the day before departure would be possible. Boarding in LAX was not very organized. Both aircraft were in good condition and the cabin / toilets clean. The flight from LAX to YTO had to be paid for food. The food to Frankfurt was adequate and the drinks service was sufficient. The entertainment program could have more choice in movies and music. The seats were good, but the seat pitch too low. Overall an average experience.

### "I recommend Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Air Canada, Rome to Toronto 16 September 2018. It was my son's 13th Birthday and I really wants to thanks Pilots for their kindness by trying to celebrate my son birthday on the plane. They really made my son day and he was very happy. I wants to thanks them including the staff for everything it was amazing from all of them. Thank you I recommend Air Canada.

### "rerouted to a direct flight"
Not Verified |  I had a conference to attend in Toronto. I was flying United and my itinerary was to fly from Hong Kong via San Francisco and then Chicago to Toronto. My United Airlines flight from Hong Kong was late to take off for over an hour and I only had an hour 25 minutes transit time. When I cleared the customs, rechecked my luggage, and ran to the gate, it was closed. After working through issues and arrival time, I was rerouted to take a direct flight from San Francisco to Toronto on Air Canada. This was my first experience with Air Canada and didn’t know what to expect. I went to the gate 45 minutes before the flight time, no one was even at the counter. The ground crew showed up around 25 minutes and didn’t start boarding until 10 minutes prior to the departure time. I immediately asked a flight attendant to fill my empty water bottle after boarding. I then found out how smart the move was. First, this 5-hour trans-border flight included no drinks (not bottled water and you had to ask before they would give you water) or food. The flight attendants’ main duty was to sell earbuds, snacks, and drinks to each customer. Thus, it took them 3 hours to reach the last row where I was. Another issue was that they sold some kind of hot snack. One of the flight attendants walked by me numerous times loudly to do heating. They did not go to the next row until the ordered food was given to the paying customer. The interior of this plane was worn with rather uncomfortable seats and entertainment programs were ancient with mostly Canadian shows. The flight attendants could not offer any arrival information, not even the general temperature range at that time of the day, and Toronto was their hometown.

### "seating comfort was good"
Frankfurt to Vancouver. Check in was well organized and done quickly. The flight started on time, was a newer aircraft, clean and in good condition. The seating comfort was good, but the seat distance was a little too narrow. The catering was on average an airline of this price range. Overall, pleasant with some possibilities to improve them, for example, the offer at the on-board entertainment.

### " very good experience"
My wife and I flew back from Paris to Calgary via Vancouver in Air Canada's 787-8. We sat in the first row of this compartment just behind the bulkhead. Seating arrangement is 2-3-2 and we sat in the two seats next to the window. Lots of leg room, but one negative is that you are just behind the bulkhead. Flights all left and arrived on time. Service was good and the meal really quite tasty. I spoke to the FA and she advised me that the food had been provided in Paris. Much better than the outbound meal which of course had been supplied in Vancouver. All in all a very good experience.

### "seat pitch is too tight"
Toronto to Vancouver. So called, Dreamliner's seats are so uncomfortable that it seems being caged. Aircraft is so poorly configured that somebody try to put seat anywhere found empty space, disregarding passenger comfort. So few washrooms and seat pitch is too tight and narrow. Air quality and noise level are little better.

### "bad customer service"
New York to Toronto. Air Canada has astoundingly bad customer service. I was shouted at by the staff upon boarding, and lodging a complaint has been near to impossible. I waited on hold for over an hour just to be told all complaints must go through the website. They are really terrible.

### "skipped serving my row drinks"
Toronto to Hong Kong Premium Economy Class). No separate restroom. Line in coach 6 deep. Inattentive staff. Don't respond to call button. FA skipped serving my row drinks and I had to flag down staff to ask for it. In flight entertainment kept skipping mid movie to star wars and despite asking for it to be reset, it wasn't done. Having flown Asian carriers like EVA from YYZ to Asia, AC doesn't compare when it comes to product and service.

### "will be charged in US funds"
Montreal to Toronto . I copy and paste part of the email add I received. Avoid like plague booking your additional travel plans with Air Canada. Although it says you are booking your Hotel, in our case The Hotel X in Toronto, in the local (Canadian in this case) currency of the hotel, you will be charged in US funds. Air Canada claims there is a microscopic us flag somewhere that lets them get away with this. I have booked a lot of travel and this is the second time I have a problem and again it’s with Air Canada charging in USD. Although a Canadian Company and I’m booking in Canada for travel in Canada they are charging me in US funds. Be careful. Be diligent.

### "Love to fly Air Canada"
Rome to Toronto. One of my best flights. Amazing crew. Food was actually ok and it seemed like we were being fed every few hours. Very comfy. Smooth flight as I get anxiety, this time I had no issues. Thanks again for an amazing and safe flight home. Love to fly Air Canada.

### "I appreciate people like him"
Ottawa to Rouyn via Montreal. I apparently missed the deadline for baggage. I've never had that as an issue as I was an hour ahead, regardless I missed it. The gentleman at the desk (which was even the wrong desk I was at) made a phone call and then walked me to the baggage drop and to the gate. He could've blown me off, but took the time to help me out. I appreciate people like him.

### "used to be much more reliable"
I flew Air Canada from Heathrow to Toronto, arriving only to find that my suitcase did not arrive with me. When I lined up to report that it was missing, I found that other passengers had the same issues, with the same airline, and had come from various other destinations. One woman I spoke with had connected with my flight from Zurich, had sufficient layover / connection time, and yet her luggage also did not arrive. Passengers pay handsomely for flights. We comply with the airline stipulations regarding luggage. Is it so much to ask that our luggage actually gets on the same flight that we are on? In my case, when I was reporting it having not arrived (at @ 9:20 pm Oct 2nd in Toronto), I was told it was still at Heathrow. In this day and age of much improved technologies, systems, communications is it so much to ask for your luggage to be put on the same flight that you are taking so that you are not inconvenienced? It seems to me that Air Canada has increased its arbitrary decision making about whether or not to send luggage on the same flight as passengers. Is it any wonder that passengers are increasingly taking bags stuffed full, and often overstuffed, right onto the plane with them? This practice of not bothering to load luggage onto the same plane as the passenger is on is not acceptable. There is no excuse. Air Canada used to be a much more reliable airline than it is now. Even the meal offerings on board have become substandard. Time for Air Canada to buck up its ideas and improve in areas that it is receiving increased criticisms for.

### "have had no response at all"
Victoria to Milan via Toronto. My flight left really late from Victoria and as a result my bags did not arrive with me in Milan. I was only there for 7 days, and staying at a villa in a really small town on Lake Como. Three of the people on vacation with me did not receive their luggage. The person handling the delivery was rude and would not speak English. One of us had to wait at the villa every day until all the bags arrived, because there was no reception and no one to receive the bags. Our bags arrived on the 3rd, fourth and fifth day of our stay. I have entered a claim, but have not even received a confirmation that the claim was received. On my return, the flight was again delayed in Toronto for over an hour. Many had connecting flights that were missed. We were given a hotel voucher on arrival, and also explicitly told that our bags were being taken off the flight and we were to pick them up and re-check them the next morning. The bags were not taken off and by the time I reached the hotel is was already 12:40 pm When I reached the hotel, I was told that it had been overbooked and that there was no room for me. I had to return to the airport where there was only one poor attendant dealing with all the many issues with Air Canada. Two of us had nowhere to stay. The airline only pays $150 for a hotel room, and there are none at that price near the airport, and they were all full. He finally found us a hotel, but we had to pay for it ourselves and were told to claim the $150 from the airline. My flight the next day left early so I only slept for 4 hours. I have also entered a claim, and written two complaints to the airline, and I have had no response at all, apart from an automated email saying they had received my message it is was 'in good hands'. There is also no way to call the airline. I am disgusted with the way this was handled, and want everyone to know how shoddy their customer care really is. Don't expect to receive any compensation for anything. You are just ignored.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Toronto to Victoria via Calgary. Had to have a layover in Calgary on my way to Victoria from Toronto. We boarded the flight on time, then sat on the plane not leaving the gate for nearly 5 hours. (Keep in mind, the flight from Calgary to Victoria is only an hour and a half). It was hilarious, the captains kept coming on about once an hour saying, "great news, we are next in line and will be taking off in about 5 minutes" I don't know where they were getting this information from or if they just thought it would be funny to mess with the customers. After 4.5 hours, everyone started receiving emails that the flight was cancelled. But the crew continued to say we were about to leave. Then everyone was kicked off the flight and told "you have been rebooked for tomorrow" when asking about hotels and accommodation, Air Canada said they were not going to provide any sort of accommodation resulting in elderly people sleeping on the floor.

### "No one helped us"
Phoenix to Edmonton. We arrived to PHX airport 2.5 Hours in advance, at the time of check in we were not assigned the seats as per the agent words “seats will be selected at the gate”. When arrived to the gate, no one was there, but when the agent showed up, our flight was delayed and we were assigned seats at the very back of the plane. Seats do not recline and we have a dog (which doesn’t allow us to check in online), that’s ok, we will deal with it. My husband has back injury and surgery so he has to stand up to stretch, or so we thought, they didn’t allow that either saying that it is The US law not to stand up in the lavatory area as people as walking back and forth to the washroom and this can be a safety threat. Arrived to Calgary late! At the customs they told us to pick up our bags! Wrong! The bags were going all the way through! We are running late for our connecting flight and at the Air Canada counter the Air Canada lady said “Oh no worries the boarding just started, you have plenty of time, you will be ok if you hurry. Here we go, rushing through security, being late because of their delayed flight, and when we arrived to the gate we hear: “Oh sorry guys, you didn’t make the flight, but we have you on the stand by for the next one”. Our bags are gone and we do not even know if we can get on the next flight. No one helped us. Here we go running around simply embarrassed by the way we have been treated since the moment we came up to the Air Canada counter in PHX.

### "I missed a connection"
One of my flights got delayed for 6 hours, so I missed a connection with another airline. I was okay with it, and I proceeded to look for alternative options with the customer service staff. The rebooking agent at the airport told me she could only rebook on a flight itinerary that would take two days to reach my final destination with connecting time up to 10 hours at two different airports, even though there were a lot more options available when I searched online. There were even seats with Air Canada's star alliance partner, but she would not book me with it. She said I needed to call Air Canada help center for more help. The Air Canada connection staff at LHR were the rudest. I approached British airways desk, and they checked me in for a much better connected flight with connections of only 3 hours. Inflight service was a little better. I though the inflight entertainment is okay with a good selection of movies and TV shows, but incomparable to Middle-Eastern and even, European carriers. However, the seat was really small, and tightly packed. The food was insufficient. I don't know how Air Canada became a 4-star carrier.

### "Very friendly polite crew"
Flew AC 548 from Vancouver to Newark. Flight on time and arrived early. Very friendly polite crew, clean plane, good experience and with no complaints except the entertainment was very limited.

### "the communication was abysmal"
Below Standard. Chose to fly Air Canada to avoid LAX. Had been following the flight for some time, so very aware they are constantly late. Our flight was delayed due to weather, that can’t be helped, however the communication was abysmal. In total it was 5 hours, we were lucky to be in the business lounge. You don’t have to be Einstein to figure out how late a flight will be when it has to divert to Sydney to refuel. The ground staff, although pleasant, have no idea. Now to the flight. We have flown middle eastern airlines many times, so, you would reckon AC would be on a par for the price, well, you would be wrong. The food can only be described as sub standard, the service although pleasant, is what you would get in economy. When you pay big money you expect, well, better. No offer to makeup your bed, no champagne before take off, and using a trolley to deliver food. I’ll only say of the gift bag, pathetic.

### "Disorganized, dishonest, disappointing"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to Geneva via Montreal. This is by far, the worst airline experience I have ever had and I have flown with many airlines. The flight was delayed not due to weather, no reason was given to passengers, no apologies. Once we reached the transfer location, even our next flight has not left. Air Canada told us we cannot get on due to the delay (but we saw the plane was still at the gate), so we had to fly the next day. Again, no apologies, customer service was rude and short. They gave us tickets for next day flight, but, we checked online, our flight did not leave until 30 minutes later! We could have enough time to catch our plane! The only reason I could think of is that they sold our seats to standbys. We were highly disappointed. They gave us dinner vouchers, $10 , but didn't tell us that it was too late for any meal. Disorganized, dishonest, disappointing. Will never use this again. Also, LAX to Montreal, 6 hour flight, no food, beverages only once. Flight attendant did not know how to smile or be nice. Avoid!

### "Excellent airline service"
Edmonton to Vancouver. Excellent airline service, from each and every Air Canada staff member I dealt with. My drivers license expired so I had to wait for my passport to be delivered to the airport. They put me on the next flight without hesitation. I found everyone just so kind and easy to deal with. Smiling and helpful. When I returned home I left my phone on the plane and stopped a random employee who could’ve said if they find it, it will be in the lost in found (or baggage claim) instead he went on the plane to look for it for me. I travelled with Air Canada  a few years ago and found the employees seemed unhappy and unhelpful. I’m happy to see the improvement! I will definitely choose Air Canada first next time I fly.

### "state of their customer service"
Calgary to Ft McMurray. Air Canada in flight services and reliability is typically decent. I fly with them a fair bit. What I am reviewing today is the state of their customer service. Firstly, I should mention that, at the best of time, reaching them to modify a flight requires 20 mins of waiting over the phone unless you have the altitude member number (35K and over I understand). But what I am writing to flag and rant about today is how difficult my last experience trying to obtain a justification of payment has been. The amount that was charged to my card for one of my last flights matches neither the amount I was expecting to pay nor the receipt sent to me. I initially reached the phone line and was sent to www.aircanada.com/en/customercare/ticketreceipt. I explained my request and never received any response other than a no-reply acknowledgment of my request. 6 weeks and 2 additional request (complaints) to the customer service went by. 20 days after my last follow-up, I finally receive a very helpful email that indicates that she is unable to help but that I should contact www.aircanada.com/en/customercare/ticketreceipt. 6 weeks and I am back where I started. Good evidence of a system that means to serve their customers well.

### "chaotic gate experience"
Brussels to Montreal on Air Canada. Our trip originated in Prague with the first leg operated by Brussels Airlines so upon landing in Brussels we proceeded to the lounge. AC uses Brussels Airlines lounge which was very crowded and had very limited food and drink options. We proceeded to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and were met with a long queue for passport verification. When I went up to the counter to inquire if there were a separate line for business class passengers the agent simply responded by saying there was only one line and pointed to the back of it. We had somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 passengers ahead of us and there were only two ground agents performing the checks. After 20 minutes in the line I went up again and asked why they did not have a dedicated line for premium passengers like they do at every other European airport. In a rather sarcastic tone the agent simply said “this is how we do it in Brussels”. We finally got through the line at which time I spotted the AC Concierge and immediately questioned him about the process only to be told that they do have a dedicated line for premium passengers. At this point I was getting quite agitated and asked him why it was not in effect that day. To that he simply said he did not know. We then went into the priority boarding line which was a joke as there had to be 100 people in the line. Finally the agents announced start of boarding but instead called for those in zones 3 and 4 ahead of the priority passengers. At this point the boarding became a free for all and resembled those you would see in third world airports. On board the service was great but the hard product was showing its age. Food was quite tasty but they had no red wine as they simply had not loaded enough on the inbound trip from Montreal. IFE has a reasonable selection and before landing we were served another meal which was also very tasty. Aside from the utterly chaotic gate experience it was a decent experience.

### "no free food"
Edmonton to Montréal. Old bad quality seats. Limited drinks, no free food on a flight of 4 hours. Staff not very friendly. Service is equal to low cost carries and my suitcase took 50 minutes to arrive.

### "baggage has been delayed"
Atlanta to Paris via Toronto. Third time my baggage has been delayed across 2 trips. It must be a systematic problem they must have. I have never experienced baggage delay ever in my many travels. Out of the 3 times, they only announced it once, meaning for two times I waited at baggage claim for 30 mins believing they had my baggage. Only by looking at the status of the baggage claim am I able to know to go to baggage services. Can't they take be proactive all the time and let people know so that they don't wait at baggage claim? I will not be flying with Air Canada again.

### "I will never use again"
Rome to Los Angeles via Toronto. I will never use again after the delays, (7 hour delay in Rome) Missed connections (ended up flying through Amsterdam after 4 hours of waiting to get to Zagreb which was supposed to be direct from Toronto). We were put up in a hotel at 1:30am only to get up at 5:30 for a morning flight, lost luggage to and from Europe, all with 2 little girls in tow. 2 days lost luggage in Zagreb, 5 days lost luggage in LA 6 days for the stroller. If I had known this I would have booked with another cheaper airline to get this service. the reply from customer service was a cut and paste "we'd like to give you 25% off you next flight" -  I don't think so! I have never written a review for bad service or delays, but this was too much.

### "seat I did not fit into"
Toronto to Rome. Flight was delayed and we specifically paid an extra 400 for premium seats and we spoke to the Air Canada Agent in reservations to make sure we had the correct seats on both legs of the journey since I had heart surgery and am a big man who needed the extra leg room and ability to raise the arm rests for more room. I was assigned a seat I did not fit into because the arm rests would not go up on this premium seat. The plane was full and no other seats could be given. My mother also had a seat whose arm rests would not go up but being smaller it was not an issue for her even though these were premium seats. On our return flight from Rome to Toronto we paid 300 for premium seats (total 700 for both legs wife came back on an earlier flight) and when we boarded the plane our seats had been given away and the premium seats we paid for two months earlier were not available. We were in row 45 which was the last row in Zone 3 with very little leg room. I had to take the middle seat since the window was too tight for me and the arm rest in the aisle would not go up. The flight attendant said there was definitely an error on the seats assigned and she made me follow her to the gate agent to see if anything could be done. The agent said all seats were full and there was nothing she could do. The plane was ready to depart so I took my seat and suffered on the 10 hour flight back. At the airport in Toronto there was no one to speak to regarding a refund and our experience with Air Canada as well as my medical issues and my mother being abandoned in Rome on her own in a wheelchair. I was told to call a number which was an office in Calgary that would need a letter mailed to them regarding the issues I experienced. I was also told to google a customer care website where I filled out the online forms for both my medical and my refund for the premium charges. We specifically booked through Air Canada direct so we would be able to avoid any issues with other airlines or agencies and could deal with AC directly but it has been a nightmare trying to have anyone reach out to us or resolve our issues before, during and after the flight. Again today I have once again resubmitted our request for refund and am currently waiting. The customer service agent in reservation (50 min hold) said she cant do anything over the phone and it could take 2 months. She told me to send out a claim again online.

### "we had to wait in standby"
Geneva to Toronto via Montreal. We arrived from Geneva to Montreal at 3:20 and connection flight to Toronto was 4pm. After customs we arrived at gate to board to Toronto at 3:45 only to be told that they gave our seat to someone else because we couldn’t make it for 4 o’clock flight. Agents wouldn’t even answer our inquiries. At 4000 dollars round trip plus upgraded seats we had to wait in standby for the next flight to Toronto plus loose our priority seating. We would think twice before we fly Air Canada again

### "not even an apology"
Vancouver to Edmonton. As I waiting for the flight at the gate, I heard a call for 4 volunteers who are able to take the next flight. The announcement also said those who volunteer will get a $400 cheque. I was the 2nd volunteer who went up to the female attendant at the gate and she dealt with all the paperwork and informed me that I was booked for the midnight flight. So, as per my previous plans I originally arranged for my parents to pick me up at the airport. As I took the next flight and was confirmed by the attendant, I informed about the change in time for my pick up. I was told by the attendant at the gate that I would get the $400 and my boarding pass after all passengers had boarded. After a while when everyone had boarded, I heard my name being called to the gate. I went up and talked to the other male attendant. He quickly asked for my ID and gave me a boarding pass and I was rushed to board the original flight. I was very confused and stressed with the sudden changes to the plan as I thought I was already confirmed and scheduled for the next flight. As I boarded the plane, I was told to quickly load my carry on in the front overhead compartments and I took my seat as per the boarding pass. The plane started to take off as soon as I was seated so I did not have enough time to contact my parents about the changes. When I landed in Edmonton, I tried my best to call my parents again but they had already went to bed in order to wake up at midnight to pick me up as per my previous conversation. I did not have any other options other than waiting at the airport until 2:00 AM when they finally came to pick me up. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with the service and the lack of understanding I received from the attendants. This is also only second time travelling so I was very scared and nervous about the whole situation. I called the customer service today about receiving the $400 cheque that I was originally promised but they told me I was suppose to receive it at the airport. I also emailed Air Canada but got a very generic response about their policy, didn't address my original compliant and also not even an apology.

### "available, friendly and attentive"
Window seats had very good views and aisle access. Although a B787, I had individual controls for blacking out my window and FAs were supportive of my wish to sit in daylight on a day flight. However, those that like to sit in the dark on day flights should be warned. FAs were available, friendly and attentive at all times. Food was good but not of the really high standard you now get on the best Asian carriers. IFE had latest movies but limited range of music. Overall, though, a very high standard.

### "still waiting for my bag"
I have flown Air Canada many times and was generally satisfied with their service, yet my last trip was less than to be desired. My flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by more than 5 hours. The company stated the cargo door was broken when unloading merchandise. When we finally boarded we were not told we were to land first in St John's Canada to have a pilot change. They should have left us in Paris and resume normal schedules hours albeit a day late,  yet to add to this when the flight left St John's to arrive in Toronto, we were met at the Toronto airport by gate agents ready with hotel vouchers and new boarding passes for a flight to LAX the day after. I was told because the flight from Paris into Toronto landed after 9:00 PM there were no more flights into the US (we had landed a little past 10:00 PM). I went to the hotel where the shuttle took over an hour to arrive to pick us up after several calls to the front desk letting them know we were waiting (you would think the airline would have this a little more coordinated). Well by the time I got to the hotel it was midnight and I had to get up by 5:00 AM to catch the flight from Toronto to Los Angeles. Arriving at the airport at 5:45 AM I was told the flight to Los Angeles was delayed by one hour and 45 minutes so instead of leaving at 8:05 AM the flight now left at 9:45 AM. To add to the ordeal there also was a medical emergency on the flight to LAX, they flight had to understandably stay at the gate while paramedics attended to the patient. We finally land at Los Angeles a little before 11:00 AM only to find out my luggage did not make the flight. How can the luggage not make the flight when I was over 4 hours early checking in? (got to the airport 3 hours early for international flight and over 1 hour delayed flight - clearly they had plenty of time to verify and check the luggage). The personnel indicated to go to the Air Canada website to track luggage. Website provides little to no information. Basically has what I told them at the baggage claim at LAX yet does not track where the luggage is at. After calling the agent at LAX, I was told my luggage landed at 5:00 pm.. I was told the delivery company has 24 hours to deliver me my bag. Not only am I jet lagged from being in Europe I am told to stay up to be in receipt of my lost (now found mis-tagged bag). I am still waiting for my bag 12 hours after it supposedly arrived in Los Angeles.

### "flight has been changed"
I booked the flights for later in September 2018 from Denver to Nagoya via Vancouver about 2 months ago. The original plan was making connections at Vancouver and the whole trip was around 18 hours. But a week before the departure day, they sent me an email saying "Your flight has been changed. Check it out. If you have any questions, call us". That was it. They didn't call me and just sent me the rescheduled flights. Like I've said, the original one was only 18 hours flight but the new one takes 3 days. ] Why should I stay in Canada for 2 days? ] Other flight tickets for the date got too expensive for me to afford. I called them right away and asked them to reschedule it and they did. I mean, they did have much better flights but they didn't give them to me from the get go. Now the flight time is around 25 hours which is not bad. But it was worse than the original one. On top of that, with those tickets, I have to make connections 3 times to get to Japan and I only have 45min ~ 1 hour for transit at each airport. I was concerned for the limited time so I called them again and explained everything to the operator. He didn't say anything while I was explaining and after that, he just said "Yes, you have enough time. Any questions? It was so rude. He only said 2 sentences, didn't even name himself and hung up the phone. I told this whole story to my friend who got to talk to their supervisor and he arranged me a perfect ticket which was a direct flight from Denver to Vancouver of United Airline and upgraded all the flights. Why didn't they do this to me to begin with? Keep calling them until you get the best tickets I'll update this review after the flights.

### "Absolutely fabulous service"
Los Angeles to Vancouver. Absolutely fabulous service from Bonnie, She really went the extra mile. Always there but never intrusive. Unfortunately wifi was not available. Catering was good.

### "usually the cheapest"
Paris to Vancouver. The flight itself was OK but the food (chicken wrap) they served before landing was disgusting. Not very dreamy for a Dreamliner when the seats don’t have much padding and the toilet seat cover doesn’t even stay up. The attendants were forgetful (messed up on our drinks twice and forgot where we sat when we asked for headphones and too chit-chatty among themselves. The only reason why we’d fly with Air Canada is because it’s usually the cheapest option. I guess you get what you pay for.

### "very happy flying with them"
Montreal to London. Simply Amazing! I was on the verge of missing my flight as the airport transfer service from city is very poor and runs with severe delays (I was not aware of this). The ground check in staff realizing this whisked me quickly through the check in lane (where there were huge queues). I managed to get onto the flight. The plane was clean and nice. A B777. Fairly new. IFE was quite decent. Upon my request the check in staff very happily gave me a nice window seat as well. Food was decent as well. Cabin staff very courteous and polite. Flight landed almost on time (just few mins of delay which doesn't really matter). Overall very happy flying with them.

### "6 days to get my suitcase"
Toronto to Charlotte. Flight was OK, but Air Canada's competence and caring stops there. I had a checked bag which they never sent to baggage claim. Since it was the last flight of the day (about 1 pm)--all Air Canada employees left the airport. I found that out after running from baggage carousel to baggage carousel and back and forth to the Air Canada desk and calling Air Canada customer service for two hours. They said they would contact the employees the next day and let me know what was up. Long story short--it took them 6 days to get my suitcase to me. I arrived on a Saturday but they didn't ship it out until Monday afternoon--and only because the flight was late and they were still there when the Fed Ex guy came. But it wasn't until Tuesday I knew it had beens ent--customer service knew nothing and I think just made things up. hey told me that the delivery guy didn't show up--and that the bag was going through a 48 hour security check--neither of which was true. And to top it all off--they didn't secure the shipping label properly--so the tag came off and was lost in transit. Did Air Canada customer service help? No--they had no tracking number--no information on the bag (which their website claimed was still missing) and no interest in contacting Fed Ex on my behalf. I had to track it down. I got my bag just in time to end my vacation and fly back home. I spent two to 3 hours everyday call Air Canada Charlotte, Air Canada customer service and Federal Express telling and retelling my story and tracking my bag down. Not a great vacation--and I had to wear the same couple of shirts and pairs of shorts I bought to tide me over for what I thought would be a couple of days without my clothes. Air Canada's compensation? My baggage fee back, payment for what little clothes and other items I had to buy--and a $100 voucher. Come on AIr Canada--in what world does compensation require that you pay more money to the entity compensating you in order to get anything in return?

### "comfortable lie-flat beds"
Toronto to Munich. Great flight in international business (now known as AC Signature Class), which features the comfortable lie-flat beds. Cabin service crew was attentive, courteous, and prompt. The food service in Signature is noticeably better than domestic (narrow-body) business class. Airplane cleanliness was excellent, and the flight was generally very enjoyable.

### "almost missed the flight"
Montreal to Dubai via Toronto. I almost missed the flight as they did not show the flight as boarding, nor late. The lady at the gate said often their flights do not indicate status. Very odd for a modern airport. Last time I came to Canada, I did miss a connection as the staff told everyone to go to the wrong customs clearance after a snow storm delay.

### "Flight was delayed"
Montreal to Toronto. Disappointedwith the disorganization of this flight. Flight was delayed, and once landed had to wait 20 minutes in the aircraft at the airport. TAlso wi-fi wasnt working on this flight. Besides that, great pilots and professional cabin crew.

### "didn't have a Canadian visa"
Yesterday my husband and I were all set to fly to Boston via Montreal. 5 minutes before boarding, they told us that I couldn't fly because I didn't have a Canadian visa. Since I have traveled many times before to countries without needing a visa for transit, this seemed quite peculiar. They told my husband that possibly he can travel alone and then they would find me a later flight via Toronto (which allowed no Canada visa). I agreed and resigned myself to staying the night in the airport overnight 'cause we live so far away (expensive to get there too). Then they said, "no seats available for tomorrow). Fast forward - we decided for my husband to leave without me. There was a wedding we were supposed to attend in Maine and I didn't want him to miss that. He flew and I went home late at night hoping I could carry my luggage back to our 3rd floor apartment. So my husband arrives in Boston and messages me that Montreal told him I didn't need a transit visa. Though the Air Canada ground crew were all very nice to us and apologetic, this could have been prevented if they were more thorough with their checking. It was our wedding anniversary and we had to be apart. Such a big disappointment and stress-inducer. Good thing my husband was calm even though he was so mad inside. But I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Please learn from this very sad experience of ours.

### "clean up their aircraft"
Toronto to Dallas. We fly Air Canada many times and use other airlines also but could Air Canada please start to clean up their aircraft inside. I looked up this time to where the air controls and lights are and was amazed how dirty it was on that panel. Come on Air Canada, clean up your act.

### "international leg went smoothly"
Paris to Newark via Montreal. The check-in process from Paris CDG went smoothly and the flight and service were operated by a courteous and efficient crew on the first leg of my flight (CDG>YUL). Following U.S. Customs & Border Control, there was a delay in flights into New York due to weather. After a small delay, our flight (AC885 @7:55pm) boarded anyway. Following another two delays of about an hour each on the tarmac, the captain announced air traffic control in New York was cancelling all flights for that evening. It was already 10pm, so there were no flights after the weather cleared up until the following morning. The cabin crew was very kind and helpful. They wanted us to get home as soon as possible, but since they couldn't do that were handing us bottles of water and pretzels during the delay and apologized as we de-planed. That said, everything following was a nightmare only exacerbated by the unhelpful staff at the check-in desk of Air Canada in Montreal. Because our plane was canceled due to weather, they handed us each a brochure detailing their policy on inclement weather. While they could not comp a hotel room, they said they would reschedule our flight for the following day. Because I booked through United, however, I was not receiving email notifications on the status of the new flight, and could not see details on the Air Canada website because I could not find the reservation number in the confirmation from United in my email. It was getting closer to midnight at this point and, understandably, the staff is on overtime and wants to go home as much as we did, but they were only grouping about to speak in French (which I understand and speak fluently) about the customers being difficult. I understand their hands were tied with the flight situation, but they were discouraging customers standing in line to rebook their flights with the booking staff because "everything would be processed automatically", but they did not even want to help me navigate the website to find my tracking information. Since my ticket was a United ticket, they figured I was last priority. Finally, in this time waiting, they just brought out a small cart of ginger ale and other sodas. I had to specifically ask one of the staff for water (which there should have been a stock of for situations like this). Overall I would say the international leg of my situation went smoothly, but I would avoid using this airline in the future for how little they seem to want to do about rebooking clients on missed flights. The internal staff seems overworked and tired.

### "flight was very relaxing"
Boston to Frankfurt via Montreal. This is my first time traveling internationally through Montreal. The flight from Boston to Montreal was a short affair on a CRJ100/200 type aircraft. The in cabin service and the flight itself (landing especially) were very commendable. Extremely friendly and efficient. The leg from Montreal to Frankfurt as in a newer 787-800. The flight was very relaxing and the service was efficient and friendly - but not exceptional. Food was good and the seat was very comfortable. The amenity kit however is getting smaller and less useful. Some bar items from the menu were not available and that was not expected.

### "The flight was okay"
Munich to Toronto in Economy Class. The flight was okay. The crew was not especially friendly, they did their service and their work. The seat was okay, but very thin and I think it had less legspace than other u.s. airlines. The first meal after take-off was okay in taste but in my opinion it was not enough. The second meal before landing was worse: it a tiny chicken wrap. Onboard entertainment was okay, no wifi. Air Canada serves free alcohol in economy class.

### "product did not impress me"
Toronto to Munich. I found them okay, but not better than United or Delta. The Lounge in Toronto was disappointing - the Maple leaf Clubs in London an Frankfurt are better in my opinion. Toronto airport is more comfortable than Newark, JFK or Atlanta: it is way smaller. The onboard product did not impress me: food okay, nothing special. Inflight entertainment below expectations. Flight attendants not especially friendly and not attentive. I did love the window in the washroom, though. We arrived in Munich ahead of schedule but had to stay on the plane for 2h30m because part of Munich airport was closed, the flight attendants did not serve water or drinks unless you went to the galley at this time. Eventually the terminal reopened and everybody had to go through immigration which was not well organized by Munich airport. Would I fly them again? Yes, to give them a second chance and if they have a better schedule / are way less expensive than my preferred other carriers.

### "cabin crew were great"
Toronto to Denver return in coach on an E190. Check in, boarding etc all uneventful. I know the E190s are due to be phased out next year, but the interior was tatty, and the USB ports on neither seat worked. (Both pushed inside the seat in front) That said the 2x2 seating and legroom is pretty good! Ok service with two rounds of T&Cs and juice offered by a hard working cabin crew member. On time arrival in Denver. The return however was disappointing. I was at the gate when the flight arrived with both fligh tdeck crew leaving the aircraft. They returned 20 mins later with food. After boarding, we pushed back late due to a fueling issue (suspect they weren't there to order it) We sat on the apron for 15 mins with no announcements. Finally, a PA from the flight deck that the plane had gone tech and would be towed back to the gate. Another 90 mins passed, with two announcements from the flight deck only, Cabin crew were great and present in the cabin passing out snacks and water. We left two hours late arriving in the early hours at Pearson. No arrival announcement or personal goodbye from the flight deck crew (unusual for AC) explained on the jet bridge - they were ahead of most of us customers. Really disappointing and poor customer experience from the pilots both during the delay in Denver though the cabin crew were great and professional

### "flight which was cancelled"
Denver to Toronto. Last week we had a flight which was cancelled due to the weather which was not visible as cancelled on the monitors. The weather is not in the hands of Air Canada, so that was not their fault, however everything after was. After receiving a mail about the cancelled flight and asking the employees of Air Canada at the airport about it, the only thing they would do was let us call a phone number since the refused to help us at the desk. They told us they couldn’t and also wouldn’t contact anyone for us to see if we could get on another flight. After a wait of 1,5 hours on the phone we were told they would put us on a flight the next day at exactly 24 hours later. There were a couple more flights going the next morning but the only thing they told us they could do is put us on a flight 24 hours later than the original flight. We had to pay for a hotel with our own money, which is understandable, since the weather was the fault. But not much help was given and the communication was just bad. A day later the next flight was delayed by 2 hours, but since were already onboard this was communicated by the pilot.

### "A good experience"
Rome to Toronto. Efficient but somewhat slow check in. Air Canada use the Casa Alitalia Lounge which is bright cheerful and basic, short staffed and even the Coffee machine was out of beans. Efficient Boarding process, good inflight service. Excellent Meal. Comfortable lie flat seats. A good experience.

### "very positive and helpful"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Heathrow. I along with my family travelled on Aug 06 2018 in flight AC854 to London. Our agent given our meal preference as Hindu Meal non veg. But we were saved the vegetarian which appears to be a mistake. Staff was superb in her customer service and attitude was very positive and helpful. She politely listened to my concern and assured me that she will try to get the meal of your choice. To my surprise she served us the non veg after she finished serving. That was excellent. I would like put on record the she was excellent in her approach and addressed our concern in a very professional manner.

### "consistently below par"
Ottawa to Seattle via Vancouver. Worst flying experience ever! The staff were uncooperative and near clueless regarding the updated flight status. Flight each way got postponed over 10 times by about 15-20 minutes each time, eventually getting completely cancelled for one leg. The cancellation was communicated via flight's email update, and no service staff at a the airport had the decency to show up and announce to the passengers. The flying experience has been consistently below par.

### "return flights were canceled"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Atlanta via Toronto. Our initial flight was delayed and they could not get us to Dublin for a full day. They ended up putting us on a Delta flight which was delightful. But, consequently they did not enter it properly in the computer and we were listed as a “no show” and our return flights were canceled. We did not receive a notification about this and did not know about anything till we arrived two weeks later for our return flight. We were blamed for the error saying we canceled the flights. When someone finally figured out the error they noted in the file that it was “canceled by agent” agent is what they call their computer system. But the inexperienced and unfriendly desk clerks read this as our travel agent canceling our flight. It took us 50 hours to get home running from gate to gate on standbys . We received 10 $10 meal vouchers for 6 people. But we each had to stand inline for 45 minutes to get them one at a time and each time we had to prove that we deserved them by showing all of our documentation on our canceled flights. Employees attitudes were inflammatory and the crews on the 5 flights we ended up taking seemed overworked and tired.

### "Courteous but brisk inflight service"
Toronto to Frankfurt. Efficient Check in Process in segregated area for Business Class, no line up and no waiting. Excellent Air Canada Altitude Lounge with a warm welcome and good meal served promptly. Poor boarding process with only one air bridge in operation, all 300 passengers walked through the Business Class Cabin which very much destroyed the ambience. The Captain came into the Business Class section and introduced himself and told us he had been flying for Air Canada for over 25 years and said it was his pleasure to welcome us on Board. Courteous but brisk in flight service lacking in charm. Food was good but poorly presented. Lie Flat seats are excellent. A good Breakfast was served prior to arrival.

### "decided to share his business class seat"
My husband and I travelled from Sydney to Chicago with a stop at Toronto. Hubby flew business class as his work paid for it, I flew economy. I attempted to get a business class seat two days after hubby, the price probably due to cookies had gone up $3000, so for a return ticket it went from $5000, to $8000 in two days. So I purchased an economy fare, Then I attempted to bid for an upgrade, I bid $2250, one way for an upgrade, that meant I would have paid $3250, one way. Initially Air Canada’s bid, as in it is a slider, was $3250, I moved the slider down to the lowest I could bid, coming up with $2250, one way. I received an email saying my bid was unsuccessful. So imagine my surprise to find empty seats in Business Class. So instead I purchase lounge access, which I paid fifty dollars. And got to use in Toronto. I found Air Canada’s lounge food is rubbish. Due to my unsuccessful bid to upgrade, Hubby and I decided to share his business class seat. However, on our leg home, one hostess was ok with it, whilst another hostess was downright abrupt and rude, claiming it was Air Canada’s policy that you can’t change seats. It wasn’t so much that the hostess made up a policy on the go, but it was her attitude demanding I get back to economy, yet she didn’t have anything to say to my husband upon his return, not one word. So do I recommend Air Canada, definitely not.

### "problem in their system"
Toronto to San Francisco. Air Canada has a problem in their system where they can't get the spelling of my name right. Every time I make a booking the system deletes the last letter of my name "Maryam" becomes "Marya". Because of this, I can never check-in online at their system and with any booking I have to see an in person agent every time. As a frequent flyer for business, I am a NEXUS holder, never check baggage and always check-in online to avoid long waiting lines. However because of this problem I will forever have to get to airport early, and stand in line to have an agent correct my name on my boarding pass otherwise security will not let me through with the error on my boarding pass. Last week I flew to SFO from YYZ and Air Canada refused to let me bypass an-hour long line to have the change made and get on to my flight. They told me security would not have a problem letting me through but of course what happened? Security would not let me through and made me go back and stand in line for the Air Canada agent to change my name on the boarding pass. This is insane for an airline like Air Canada to not solve a problem that affects every person whose first name ends in the letter "M". They told me the system thinks that "M" stands for Mr. or Ms. so it gets mixed up. When I reached out to the Customer Relations team, after providing me with a 25% one time discount, told me they would not help me further, update me on whether this issue would ever be solved, or speak to me regarding this issue again.

### "a total disappointment"
My flight was canceled due to a technical failure. It was the last flight out of Boston so there was no alternative for the day. We ended up in a long queue and were at the counter shortly before midnight, only to be told that the next available flight is 2 days from now. We politely declined and asked them to organise a hotel. They said there's nobody to do it and we should do it ourselves and expense the money back. Now finding a hotel in the middle of the night in Boston can be a real adventure. We managed to do it and were as conscious of cost as possible. In the end Air Canada only wanted to reimburse us a 100$ total for the hotel stay. We paid way more. Although they didn't care about what happened to us they didn't even want to cover basic costs. It's now over 4 weeks and we haven't seen a penny. The ticket cost were supposed to get charged back to my card end of June. Nothing has arrived yet. The same happened with a Delta flight and I got my money back within a week. In summary a total disappointment.

### "1 hour to handle a small queue"
Good pilots, clean planes, On time with 1 slight delay, Efficient and professional plane staff. Montreal Airport staff was horrible. I was unable to use the self check in kiosk to to technical issues (missing info on my schedule). It took 1 hour to handle a small queue of 5 which kept growing. The staff of 5-6 counters worked extremely slow compared to counter staff such as Japan (my final destination) or swissport staff. On the other hand, airport security were extremely efficient and fast?? Air Canada Management need to experience the check in experience themselves.

### "experience is incredible"
Hong Kong to Vancouver . First ever trip of me I am on the study tour in UBC, so I am heading to Vancouver on my first ever flight. The Air Canada flight round-trip is very good, regard that the seat is lack of room somehow, the service, the cabin is in good condition. Both flights (B777-300ER) are seems paired up with the Beijing flight (AC30/29) at the time. Kind of punctual arrival and departure, flight experience is incredible in general anyway.

### "Boeing 787 cabin is cramped"
Check-in and boarding ground crew seemed harried and disorganized; both took more time and were less pleasant other airlines. Boeing 787 cabin is cramped, but that's typical across most carriers. App is hard to navigate, requiring me to reenter my name every time I open the app. Baggage was delayed 24 hours, and then delivered after midnight. The one bright spot is that cabin crew were polite and competent on all flights. AC used to be a better experience than the US carriers a few years ago.

### "worst customer service "
Quebec to Austin via Toronto. I was to fly out of Quebec this morning with a connection in Toronto to Austin, TX. The flight was about 30 minutes delayed before the gate agent mentioned anything. I was actually receiving email alerts from Air Canada before hearing anything from the gate agent about the delays. My flight from Quebec was delayed 7 hours which left me no way of making my connection in Toronto. I went to the gate agent in order to re-book my connection. She very quickly told me I would have to worry about it when I got to Toronto and there was nothing they could do for me. I waited around 2 more hours and went back to the same gate agent. I again asked about re-booking my connection. She then gave me a pamphlet and told me to call their 800 number. Called the 800 number and waited on hold for 30 minutes. When someone finally answered it hung up the call on me. I called back and waited 45 minutes on hold. The guy that answered told me there were no other flights for the day that would get me back to Austin and he asked me if I could travel tomorrow (as if I had a choice in the matter). I had paid for premium seats on my initial flights (sounds as though I am out that money). He put me on hold as he booked me for the following day flights (I was on hold at least 20 minutes). During this time I booked a nearby hotel for the night because the pamphlet I was given said the airline would not be responsible for costs related to travel interruptions because it was beyond their control. I went back to the gate agent. Told her after 1.5 hours on the phone that I had been re-booked for tomorrow and asked her about getting my luggage back. The only good thing she did all day was call down and had my luggage pulled off the plane. Gave me a $10 meal voucher to the only place to eat in the airport which of course had a line wait of no less than 45 minutes due to all of the other stranded passengers. She then said she could get me to Toronto today (but still would have to spend the night in Toronto). If she could do that why couldn’t she have re-booked me to begin with instead of having me wait on the phone for 1.5 hours? Supervisor standing behind her seemed as though she could care less as well. So here I sit in a hotel room at my expense in Quebec. I will have to fight the battle with them tomorrow that I have already paid $60 to check my luggage from yesterday. I am sure they are going to want me to pay that again. I will also have to pay for another day of parking at Austin. The worst customer service of any airline I have traveled on.

### "No apologies whatsoever"
Amsterdam to Bogota via Toronto. My luggage did not survive a transfer, it got to my destination two days later but I was only informed of this fact three days later, and then I had to go get it myself whilst they told me they would send it to my hotel. Amsterdam to Bogota via Toronto and the flights were delayed. The staff did not bother to keep us informed about transfers and luggage. No apologies whatsoever.

### "they changed my seat"
Air Canada offers free pre-seat selection for their Asia flights, namely China flights. However, after I booked my round-trip flights Edmonton to Shanghai via Vancouver, they changed my seat selection without notice. After I booked flights, selected seats and made payment, they sent me a confirmation email. In this email they changed all my seats to last row, but they didn't give me any heads-up and so I didn't find out. Today when I was re-organizing my email folder, I happened to see it. Air Canada has thrown us to the last row. I just talked with their customer service agent, and he said the mistake was caused by flight changes. It is a lie because first of all they only changed domestic leg but all my seat selections including international legs have been changed; Secondly, it is only a departure time change (earlier departure), not equipment change. I can imagine how people will be disappointed and shocked when they arrive at airport and find out their selected seats are long gone. And I'll be forced to pay extreme caution to Air Canada when next time I fly with them.

### "service was very good"
Not Verified |  Flew with Air Canada from San Francisco to Montreal and the service was very good, not all flight attendants was smily but at least two were really kind with passengers. Food we bought on board was excellent. Overall flight, onboard entertainment as tv movies and series are just enough, but could offer more choices in French, seats of the B737 MAX not bad, I've seen worse on other B737-8 and 737-9 from other airlines. Luggage arrived very fast on carousel in Montreal. Didn't try wifi onboard so I can't review this part of the experience but will give three stars, guessing it's working properly.

### "said the flight was closed"
Los Angeles to Vancouver.After waiting over an hour in line to check in they began letting people who arrived after us to check in before us. Half the kiosks were broken and there was no one to assist so I got in line to get checking in by an agent. I was there more than 2 hours before my flight. The moment I got to the agent she said the flight was closed and she had to put me on a later flight but it was still 45 minutes before my flight was scheduled to take off so I asked for security. The woman at the counter was so rude and never apologized, she told me it was my fault. Once I spoke to security they also called the Air Canada manager who said he could put me on my original flight and over rode the counter agent. I was able to make the flight. I’m in Canada and they lost my bag.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Paris to Montreal returning from Toronto in May. Had quite low expectations of Air Canada but was pleasantly surprised with their service. Friendly and warm cabin crew, several rounds of drinks on 7 hour sectors, and announcements in both English and French. Top-notch service from this crew as they were able to get for you what you needed. The seat was relatively comfortable and the inflight entertainment system had plenty of good choices. No fuss boarding at both CDG and YYZ, and their mobile boarding pass was a huge time saver at busy airports such as CDG. If there was one thing I didn't like it would be their in-flight catering - strange choice of mains such as shredded carrots on pasta was not very delicious, and they ran out of second options on both flights. However, pre-landing snacks were delicious and the wine selection was excellent. Look forward to flying them again in future and hopefully by then they will change their menu.

### "Staff friendly, courteous"
Not Verified |  Round trip Brisbane-Vancouver-Brisbane. Third trip in 3yrs. Used to have to fly to Sydney to get to Vancouver on a 777, the 787 a much better experience. Meals excellent, lots of choices, hot snacks on demand, and pre-packaged snacks and fruit available overnight. Entertainment options a bit weak: new releases aren't really new, 'world cinema' options mostly Asian or Bollywood, limited Canadiana, Franco options. Ended up watching TV series in bored desperation. 14+hrs is a long time! The seat cover mattress is long overdue (most Asian/Middle Eastern airlines have had them for eons). Quilt and pillow just right, amenities kit ok, basic. Staff friendly, courteous, available and not in your face all the time. Too bad they collect the noise cancelling headsets an hour before landing and you're stuck with useless earbuds.

### "its a real disgrace"
Flew Air Canada from New York to Tel Aviv via Montreal. The airline service on board was very good, however, when it comes to speaking with the airline by phone or email there is no service at all. I waited nearly an hour to talk to a representative, its a real disgrace. For example if you need to order special food there is no way but wait 1 hour or more. For that reason alone I will give the airline a 1 star.

### "not very helpful"
Toronto to Hartford. Customer service not very helpful sent me from Montreal airport to Toronto to speed my return to Hartford but I ended up wasting another full day between the 2 airports. No help again from customer service.

### "very comfortable and enjoyable"
Vancouver to Melbourne. Delayed boarding due late inbound aircraft and documents checking for passengers. Excellent, well-designed, comfortable seat pods. Thoughtful menu and service throughout, very good entertainment choices and accessibility, TV screen well positioned and easy to use. Amenities were good, although on this 16 hour overnight flight some pyjamas would have been good - as other airlines often do. Cabin crew were mostly very good. Overall, a very comfortable and enjoyable flight.

### "Seat is extremely hard and uncomfortable"
Vancouver to London Heathrow. Air Canada created much publicity about the greater comfort on their new Dreamliner, the Boeing 789. The reality is very different. Seat is extremely hard and uncomfortable. Pillow and blanket are thin and flimsy. Service and food on board were mediocre. Staff were mostly unsmiling. Dinner was a dish of dry, cubed chicken with a lurid, spicy sauce. Almost inedible. Arrived exhausted at LHR. Very disappointing. Air Canada’s Dreamliner is no dream to fly on.

### "friendly cabin staff"
Vancouver to Newark. Extremely comfortable seat, very good for both reclining and sleeping. Excellent service from the friendly cabin staff. Outstanding range of refreshments. Air Canada business lounge in Vancouver unhurried, relaxed and very comfortable. Would fly Air Canada any time!

### "good, comfortable flight"
Flew Air Canada from Montreal to Dublin. A good, comfortable flight in a new B737 MAX aircraft, sitting in international premium economy (in this plane it's the same as AC's domestic business class). Service crew was friendly as usual and the flight itself was on time. The seats are substantially more comfortable than in economy and the food is much better as well.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Montreal to Calgary. I had an amazing experience on this flight. I don’t normally go out of my way to leave a review, but the service I received exceeded all of my expectations !They were so accommodating and some of the most friendly and professional flight attendants I have met to date. I wish them all the best and hope they continue to make flights as memorable as they made mine.

### "The flight is canceled"
Montreal to Newark for a connection in Newark to Lisbon. After waiting 1h after departure, the plane takes off. After 20 minutes of flight, the plane turns back and land back in Montreal. The flight is canceled. I spoke to 3 Air Canada employees and they all gave a different reason why the flight was canceled. I had to wait hours in line to schedule another flight. I wrote a complaint to the company and they refused to refund me for the money I lost for food and hostel. They gave me a discount on another flight and they even made it sound like it was a privilege.

### "The FA's were nice "
Booking with Air Canada, via Brisbane then Vancouver to Toronto. Initially they had me on a morning flight from Melbourne but I felt the time between flights was too tight, together with fog/winter issues so I called and arranged a flight the day before, it cost me an extra $300. The shock came at the airport when I found they downgraded me to economy, not a big issue except the $300 extra is more than a normal one way flight. Anyway determined to put this behind me, I used the kiosks at Brisbane airport to check in and self label my bags. The lounge (NZ) was really nice. Boarding was in zones with children going first, then zone 1-5 in order. The plane was a Boeing 787 with pods. Offered fruit juice or water and nuts to start, then handed menus. The FAs were nice but apart from meals, they were mostly absent, the meals were small but tasty. Then snacks (chips, water, chocolate and fruit) were left to help ourselves to. On the menu was a list of hot snacks on request. Meals were trolley service, like upmarket economy. Entertainment was ok, not extensive but adequate. The seat was a little hard but ok. Breakfast was nice although the FA gave me a lecture on sugar when I asked for milk and sugar in my coffee. After arrival in Vancouver and the necessary immigration procedure followed, it was off to domestic and the lounge. Stayed there just a few minutes, it was crowded, inadequate, little to offer, so I just walked around until the Toronto flight. Old plane, again boarded via zones. The food on board was dire. The nice FA offered me alternatives, I just opted for a cookie. The entertainment in board was better than the Dreamliner. All in all the domestic was the better flight but neither as good as the Asian carriers

### "found my luggage was lost"
My flight was leaving at 4pm. Flight AC119. We boarded ok, then was told to deplane due to air con issues. It was delayed half hour. Then another half hour and so on. I was supposed to have a 5 hr layover in Vancouver but time was creeping away until it became obvious I’d miss my Melbourne flight. Lining up at the counter with many others and only one staff member dealing with us including a large tour group that took up over an hour. The AC lady called for help but none came. A young man came to her but refused to help anyone. What shocking service, or lack thereof. I was then put on another Vancouver flight then onto Sydney and Melbourne. On arrival in Vancouver I approached the desk for an earlier Syd-Melb flight than 1.30pm. They said there were none. On my iPad I showed them how many Qantas flights there actually were yet they refused to budge. This was all their mistake and it was compounding. The plane to Sydney was old. The entertainment was less than any other international flight I’d ever flown. They asked for headphones about an hour before landing, The FAs on board were friendly. In Sydney I found my luggage was lost. Do I regret booking with Air Canada - you bet. Never again, I’d go Cathay or China Southern which are so much better next time.

### "My bag did not make it"
My bag did not make it despite over a two hour connection and other passengers that checked in their bag in at the exact time. The airline never bothered to follow up with me to let me know the bag had arrived. After originally telling them it was urgent, they reverted to using a bag delivery service. I had to incur the expense and aggravation of picking the bag up at the airport via Uber.

### "delayed my bags"
Air Canada has delayed my bags on five separate occasions. Once on a trip to Halifax, once on a trip to Las Vegas and this is the third time they have done it on my trip to Italy. Halifax and Las Vegas were both five day trips, I spent the first three days of these trips without baggage. I understood that because I made connections that it is possible there was not enough time to properly get the bag onto the next flight. However, if this is something that often happens maybe it is best they stop charging for connections they do not have the capability of properly executing. This most recent flight to Milan, I checked in 4 hours early for a direct flight. There is absolutely no reason my baggage should have been left in Toronto. This is my third day in Italy without my baggage, how has it still not made it on another flight? I am writing a review on here because the customer service website for Air Canada is insufficient, there is no direct email for customer service, instead they lead you to numerous automated responses. Working in customer service myself, I understand that mistakes happen. However, considering I have given this company thousands of dollars over the last few years I am fed up. I see no reason why in 2018 they can charge $1,200 for a round trip, direct flight to Milan and be so behind that baggage cannot arrive with that flight. I am ready to ditch Air Canada completely and give another company my money. Hopefully this message catches their attention, please make your customer service page more accessible if you want reviews to come directly to you with the chance to make up for this tiring experience instead of being posted to the public.

### "flight was now cancelled"
We had a short 1.5 hour flight from Vancouver to Calgary with a quick 30 min. layover in Kelowna. We got off the plane, and the next flight was delayed (we were suppose to board the same plane, but just pick up some passengers in Kelowna.) They come on the intercom and say the plane is broken so we need to call a number to re-book our flight to Calgary or get a partial refund. (Yes, it was our responsibility now.) We needed to get to a wedding reception, so time was of the essence. All 4 of us were on the phone trying to re-book the next flight, and we were put on hold. And hold. And hold. Then they came back saying they got us tickets, then put us on hold again. Finally came back and said "sorry the next flight is now full", but they have a flight leaving in a few hours with a layover in Edmonton and to arrive in Calgary around 9pm. We needed to get there so we jumped on that flight before it was full, we got new boarding passes, and went to sit at White Spot for some drinks. We waited about 2.5 hours and then that flight was now delayed. About an hour later they told us that the flight was now cancelled. So we just wasted hours in the airport waiting for nothing. We tried calling customer service but there were no more flights that evening and the next one was at 7:30 in the morning. FWe had called to ask for a refund so that we could jump on a flight with WestJet, but they said that was "unlikely" to happen. So now we were trying to get hotel vouchers, nobody would give us any sort of solid information. Every person we talked to told us to go talk to another person, or to call a different number. One guy had told us that all their hotel vouchers were "exhausted". So not only did they royally screw us for the entire day and night, but we weren't even going to get any sort of accommodation. The only good person we dealt with was an amazing lady who finally pulled some strings to get us a hotel, and she was helpful and knowledgeable. If anything goes wrong they make you fend for yourselves when having to re-schedule your flights in a city you are unfamiliar with.

### "all went above and beyond"
I want to give a shout out and Kudos to the Air Canada staff in Paris and in Montreal. Our flight #881 from Paris to Toronto was delayed 8 hours due to weather. Once in Toronto we had another 4 hour drive back to Michigan. Staff at the ticket/customer service desk in Paris was awesome getting us moved to an earlier flight to Montreal then to Toronto. Once in Montreal, the staff were so helpful. Air Canada did not have to help us at all. They could have made us wait for the 9:00 pm flight, sitting in the Paris Airport for 12 hours then the flight and drive home. They all went above and beyond. The three of us were tired and confused but the staff came through! Thank you so much! Maybe if I had flown Air Canada to Paris to begin with, my luggage would not have been lost by Brussels Airlines! Whole trip - no luggage! This was my first time flying with Air Canada and would recommend them in the future.

### "delay was due to weather"
My flight was more than 20 minutes delayed from YYC to YQR. We then had to divert to YXE due to what the crew described as a fast-moving storm that was going through YQR. As a result, I missed my connecting flight to YYZ. Staff at YQR rebooked me for 6.00 am the next day, but offered nothing else as compensation. No hotel accommodation, meals, upgrade, nothing. They said that the delay was due to weather, not the delay of their flight crew in YYC. I will not use Air Canada again. Terrible customer service, and they don't care about their customers.

### "I agreed to pay for the drink"
During the drink service, I asked the attendant "What is that Georgia Bay thing? as I had spotted a can I did not recognize in the pop drawer. She said "Oh it is delicious", opens the can, hands it to me, and moves on to the next row. A few minutes later she returns with the credit card machine. I was not informed that the drink was alcoholic, nor that it cost money, nor did I even request to have the drink. After a rather threatening discussion on the flight attendant's behalf, I agreed to pay for the drink and contacted customer service instead. Customer service  informed me that I would have known the prices of all of their service offerings had I read their 18 page menu, and that I should know better than to order alcoholic drinks that I don't want to pay for.

### "Delayed over and over"
Once again all goes well until I get to the Calgary to Grande Prairie leg of my journey. Delayed over and over. If you don’t have the planes flying don’t sell the tickets! Every time I’m delayed hours. Haven’t had one reliable Air Canada Jazz flight to Grande Prairie in the last 8 times flown. Flight attendants blame it on The “Jazz” entity. Don’t know what that means but 3-4 hours every time is pathetic.

### "not offering any food"
All my flights were delayed and no meal from Vancouver to Montreal through Winnipeg. Also, they lost my luggage in Winnipeg (the aircraft was the same from Vancouver to Montreal) and it was hard to get in touch with them on the phone. The day I was flying back to Melbourne, my flight to Vancouver was delayed by 2 hours losing my connecting flight to Melbourne. They relocated me in an earlier flight and now this one has suffered some delays. This time the flight is 5h and they are still not offering any food on board.

### "slightly below good"
Not Verified |  Omaha to Toronto. My first flight on Air Canada. I would rate it slightly below good. The plane was small but clean. Staff was okay, not super friendly, not rude. Flight prices were average. In air service is very basic — water, soda, juice are about the only complementary items. My only serious complaint was a 20-minute delay on the tarmac when the cabin became extremely warm. No comment or explanation. I would use Air Canada if it suited my schedule but I would not seek them out.

### "passport slightly water damaged"
Myself and my boyfriend planed a trip to Iceland and booked it with Air Canada. The way we were treated last night July 2nd 2018 flying at 23:20 flight to Reykavik flight number AC 816 was my worst experience with an airline. My boyfriends passport is slightly water damaged, but scans where we go. It has never not scanned until last night, but it wouldn't scan at the terminal. But what I'm having a hard time understanding is why were we stopped outside of the US? So we flew from NY to Toronto no problem, passport scanned and was accepted by Air Cananda staff. And then we are about to board in Toronto to go to Reykjavik and its no longer acceptable , why were we allowed to enter into Canada? So we proceeded to try to talk to the women who told us she couldn't do any thing because it wouldn't scan. And proceeded to tell us to go to customer service to see what can be done. So we have to leave the terminal and go through border control, so my boyfriend hands over his passport to the  man working the counter, and now my boyfriends passport will scan. The young gentleman at the booth suggested she wasn't holding it on the machine long enough for it to read. So she refused us for a $2000 flight we booked. At this point its 24:00, we had been at Toronto airport for 6 hours because of delays. We need to go to customer service, rebook the flight, get a hotel and get our luggage. We go to customer service and had the best customer service thank god! The staff there was amazing and super helpful. So we go to get our luggage and its almost 0200, so they have no one there get our luggage and now we have to go to the airport today and hope it didn't go to Reykjavik because we obviously did not rebook the flight with Air Canada.

### "haven't heard from the airline"
Toronto to Los Angeles. At Toronto tI missed my flight due to insane lines and TSA idiocracy making wait in longer line. Once I got to my gate they told me it has been closed but it was delayed for an emergency but I couldn't enter the plane. At this point I'm too tired to argue with person at the desk so I just tell them to put me on the next flight to LA. The next flight came hours later it was a nice plane service was great. My major issue with this airline happened with the baggage delay and how they handled it. As of now, a day after I landed and my carry on didn't. I still haven't heard from the airline and was told I would have my belongings by 3pm it is now 6pm.

### "unreliable service"
Trip started with a phone call at 1:00am canceling the 8:40am flight and putting me on 6:40am flight from Grande Prairie to Calgary. From Calgary flew united perfectly. On return 2 weeks later united early arrival for 2 connections. Get to Calgary and guess Air Canada delayed. In the B gate area every Air Canada Jazz flight I saw was delayed at least 2 hours. Most unreliable service. Very unsatisfied, this happens every time I fly air Canada jazz.

### "helped me get home safely"
Not Verified |  Recently, I was supposed to fly from Toronto City (YTZ) to Pittsburgh (PIT) via Montreal (YUL). I had originally bought that flight since it was cheaper, even though nonstop flights were available. I made a dumb mistake and went to the Toronto Pearson airport (YYZ) instead. Those airport codes are just so similar! Feeling confused after not seeing my flight, I was sent to the ticketing desk to sort everything out. The woman who helped me told me what had happened and was very understanding. She was able to change my flight to YYZ and put me on a nonstop flight to PIT. She did charge me a same day flight change fee, but in my opinion, this was well worth it. I am so appreciative that she and Air Canada helped me get home safely.

### "I am extremely unsatisfied"
Houston to Vancouver via Calgary. We received several itineraries by email. I didn't realize that each one of these was an itinerary change. The last one moved our flight time up from 7:10 to 6:30am. Having 2 small children, we got to the ticket counter at 5:35 am which was plenty of time for our first flight time, but they would not let us on the flight because we missed the 1 hour check in by 5 minutes. The lady at the counter was unhelpful and rude. I called the rebooking number and they said there was another flight that same day (the lady at the counter said there wasn't). The rep on the phone said we need to book with the lady at the counter because it would cost much more if she did it on the phone. I went back to the lady at the counter and she was still completely unhelpful even when talking to the rep on the phone. The rep on the phone spoke with her supervisor who gave it to us at the same price because the rep at the counter refused to help. $450 later and hauling 2 very young children around at 4:30 am for no reason because our flight was changed without real notification (the email never stated there was an itinerary change that I noticed), I am extremely unsatisfied. Flight home- My husband was detained by US Dept of Homeland Security. While this was not the fault of Air Canada, it took them almost 2 hours to get them his bags to be checked. He almost missed this flight as well and I was in the airport in Calgary for over 2 hours with 2 small children by myself because of this delay. This was my husband's first time to fly. It was not mine, but I can say that it was by far my most stressful. Between the cost in money and stress, I don't think I will ever fly Air Canada again.

### "unable to get any premium seats"
Vancouver to Montreal. This was my first time flying with a child. I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every  time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure  11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there. Now I had to call customer service and spend over one hour for them to guarantee us on the premium seats on our return flight, but I am still expecting a full refund for the premium seats I was denied despite having paid for them.

### "disappointed by this trip"
Ottawa to Frankfort. I was disappointed by this trip. The service on that Air Canada B767 flight was below average, the aircraft was extremely hot during boarding, it was only when all doors were closed that air con was activated. Food tray minimal, breakfast was a single slice of an industrial cake and coffee.

### "the lack of a dedicated FA"
Dublin to Toronto. I had not flown before in the new Premium Economy of Air Canada, although I had done so on several occasions with AC Rouge leisure subsidiary including on this route, before it was ‘transferred’ back to main-line AC. Check-in at DUB was problem free and expeditious as PE passengers can use the Premium lines. When this service was operated by AC Rouge PE passengers were directed to use DUB Fast Track security. This perk not offered on main-line AC. Boarding was as expected, PE being the second group to board after Business class. The flight appeared full, all seats were occupied in the PE section. The seats were a little more comfortable than those on Premium Rouge with perhaps a little more leg room. As this service departed DUB early afternoon, lunch was serviced not long after departure. There were 2 choices for the main course and the meal was serviced on china ware. No so the drinks with plastic glasses, (apart form a wine glass on the meal tray!) and coffee/tea from paper cups. This is a downgrade from Rouge PE where real glasses and china mugs for coffee/tea are used. The second meal or snack was exactly the same as offered in Premium Rouge. A significant difference was the lack of a dedicated FA to PE. FAs in PE are shared with Economy, with Economy being a much larger cabin, at times there was no FA to be seen in PE. With Rouge PE there is dedicated FA at all times. Another difference is that the FAs on main-line are more mature, and for the most part more experienced. The flight arrived on time and dis-embarkation was as expected, PE exited followed Business class passengers. Based this experience, I found the AC PE service inferior to that of the nearest comparison, international Premium Rouge.

### "transfer took almost 4 hours"
Beijing to Dallas via Vancouver. Horrible experience transfering in Vancouver airport. After going through custom, we waited for baggage transfer. The transfer took almost 4 hours which caused my missing the flight to Dallas. After going though custom again, I was sent to a red eye flight departing Vancouver at 11:29pm. Worst still is that I had to go through Canadian custom yet again to pick up baggage and go through this whole security and customs all over again.

### "blessed by Air Canada staff"
Pittsburgh to Moncton via Toronto. Blessed by the Air Canada staff at the Pittsburgh airport. I was coming home from a ten day trip visiting family with a 2.5 year old and a newborn, and I did not have it all together. I realized while I was still waiting to board my first flight I had one diaper left, and a 7-hour trip ahead. The attendant at the desk overheard my plight and ran all over the airport and after three stores found me a tiny pack of diapers which she bought with her own money and ran down the gangway to give me. She turned and ran back up without a thought. The whole trip I was helped along by Air Canada staff.

### "staff were incredibly rude"
Worst servce I've ever received. Arrived 5 minutes late to check in for a domestic flight early in the morning because of an issue with transit getting to Pearson and they couldn't help. They're like a bunch of robots that can't understand that just because their computer system is set a certain way that doesn't mean that they can't help a young man trying to get a job done. Manager and staff were incredibly rude to top it off and didn't even attempt to provide a solution. Useless, undertrained, oligopolistic and stomach turningily (I know thats not a word) bureaucratic. 0/10 and unfortunately because of outdated government legislature that protects our airlines from the US we have almost no other options.

### "glad I chose Air Canada"
Frankfurt to Toronto. I am a Canadian living in Germany flying to visit my parents with an infant and a toddler and my husband. Right at the beginning of the flight we were treated so nice and an Air hostess made us feel welcomed, she was so kind and understanding. I am really glad that I chose Air Canada for our trip.

### "very slow to solve the situation"
I had my flight cancelled today, and I (and all other passengers) had the following difficulties: 1) The flight was cancelled by email before being announced as cancelled. That caused a strong misdundertanding among passengers and the ground crew for about half an hour. 2) The flight was rescheduled to 8am. It was a late flight (11.15 pm) and they were very slow to solve the situation. Therefore, a group of people could not go to the hotel and got stuck in the airport. The group of about 20 people had to stay outside the security area from 2am until 4am with CAN30 for dinner and brekfast meals. 3) No alternative to these passengers was presented. 4) Air Canada shamily sent an email with a promocode to be used in the next 60 days, otherwise it will expire. This promo could not be used for upgrade on a next flight. So useless for one from abroad, and not a frequent flyer of AC! 5) The ground crew were badly trained, and once very stressed they were not of great assistance to help people leave the security area nor to figure out alternatives.

### "great customer service"
My trip back from Washington, D.C. At Ronald Reagon airport I met this amazing Air Canada's personnel who was incredibly sweet and helpful from the checkin gate till boarding. This business trip was stressful due to some work complications but after experiencing his great customer service and cheerful personality I started to feel a bit relax.

### "smug with all their extra fees"
Montreal to Calgary via Vancouver. I am disappointed in their services compared with other airlines. This time my complaint is their nickel & diming policies and unwillingness to accommodate passengers. I'm on my way from Montreal to Calgary, but transferring in Vancouver. I asked at check-in if there might be room for me on a more direct flight. There was, but Air Canada wasn't going to let me have it without charging another $75 on top of my ticket price. (Bearing in mind I've also just paid $25 extra for my one piece of regular size & weight luggage). My ticket has been paid for, the seats on the direct flight are available. It should really make no difference to AC, except they would have a happier customer if they would show a bit of flexibility and stop being so smug with all their extra fees.

### "best in 15 years of flying with AC"
Regina to Toronto. I fly Air Canada a lot for work. This flight I got an upgrade to business class. The service was the best I had in 15 years of flying with AC. The flight attendant was Korean - and in true Asian Airline hospitality style - toward the end of the flight he went to each and every customer, bowed down and thanked us for our business. Really above and beyond! Not saying this is something that is expected but really blew my mind considering the normal level of service which is good either way. The wifi was bad though.

### "otherwise very solid product"
Amsterdam to Ottawa via Frankfurt. The Lufthansa flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt which I was originally scheduled to take had gotten cancelled, and I got booked on a later flight without receiving any prior notification. Due to this flight change my connecting time in Frankfurt became extremely tight and so I needed to run to catch my Air Canada flight to Ottawa. When I arrived at the gate nearly everyone had already boarded so it was just myself and a few other latecomers who got there last minute. As far as the flight goes, it didn't differ much from my previous experiences with Air Canada. The food in economy class was horrible, save for the pretzel snacks and the chicken wrap they give out towards the end of the flight. The food in economy class is a major flaw of an otherwise very solid product, and I suggest Air Canada's partner Lufthansa to promptly inform passengers of any cancellations/delays.

### "I would fly with them again"
Tokyo to Vancouver. First time flying Boeing 787 and loved it. We where seated in 26J and 26K. Boarding was slow. The seat was comfortable, the cabin crew were wonderful, the in-flight entertainment was good, could be a little broader but cannot complain. The food was rubbish. We ate in the airport before the flight and glad we did. All in all I would fly with them again.

### "cancelled without warning or reason"
My flight from New York to Toronto was cancelled without warning or reason. There was no inclement weather. No apologies given, the airline staff were rude, did not apologize and acted like this happens very often (it probably does given the poor record of LGA airport). I got rebooked on a much later flight, missing an important meeting. The airline staff didn't care about that at all. In this day and age, the least an airline can do is offer some sort of apology or compensation. I've had better experiences in the past, which is why I did not give them a lower rating. Will be doing my best to avoid this airline from now on, unfortunately, I am Canadian.

### "pay to change to an earlier flight"
Boston to Montreal. We arrived 4 hours earlier for our flight. There were 2 earlier flights available for us to board before our scheduled flight. First attendant at the check in said upon our inquiring that there were no earlier flights available, but there were 2 earlier flights. She didn’t even bother checking. We decided to ask the attendant through security instead. He mentioned we would have to pay 200 USD to change to an earlier flight. Interestingly, I travel with Air Canada for work frequently and this was the first time they indicated I would have to pay to move my flight earlier. We decided to try our luck a third time with a different attendant. This one didn’t even let us finish asking our question and immediately said it wasn’t possible while discussing an unrelated topic with a colleague of hers. Terrible service. We can understand that some accomodations may not always be logistically possible but in this case it feels like we weren’t even being considered. Not a trademark of a customer centric company.

### "unacceptable seat pitch"
Toronto to Vancouver on AC101 on a full Boeing 777-300ER. Check in at Pearson wasn't busy but the staff at the bag drop area had such a rude attitude that made for an unpleasant start to the trip. Boarding was a complete mess, as they were boarding a 400-seater aircraft through a relatively small gate, with no real division for the Economy Class zone boarding normally found for international flights. Because of this, the line clogged the entire walkway of the terminal with people. A lot of bags had to be gate checked due to the full flight, thus, delaying the boarding even further. None the less, the flight departed and arrived on time. The seat, while acceptable for its width, has an unacceptable seat pitch. I couldn't imagine spending more than three hours in that seat, even the thought of bearing a 13-hour flights AC's 777-300ER flies on. The crew was slow but courteous, serving a full flight. Only drinks were complimentary for this flight. Entertainment selection was sufficient for the domestic flight, with some movies only having trailers available for some reason. Overall, not a happy customer and if I were to fly on the same route again, at the same price point I would pick WestJet over Air Canada, having flown the former on the return trip.

### "flight attendants are attentive"
This flight from London Heathrow to Toronto was typical of Air Canada. The 787 pods are very comfortable, the flight attendants are attentive, the IFE was OK, but the food was almost inedible. Air Canada food is sometimes excellent and sometimes dreadful!

### "the worst experience"
Houston to Toronto. I am very unhappy with the services provided by Air Canada. I had previously checked in online the night before. I came by the check-in desk to make sure I did not need to do anything further prior to proceeding through the security gates. I was then asked if I had any bags to check. I said, "No, but I have this bag I am carrying on. The lady at the check-in then stated, "Place it in that", pointing to the airport carry-on sizer/fitter. I did, and it fit perfectly. She then stated, "Well, sir, the flight is full. You will need to check it. I asked if there was any way to not check it as I had my suit in it for a conference I was attending. She looked at me and said, "No". She then placed tag on the bag, and then stated, "That will be 25 dollars. I looked at her incredulously and said, "Excuse me? Just because the flight is full is not a reason to assess me a 25 dollar penalty. That is Air Canada's issue and not mine. I did not sign anything saying I agreed to this penalty". I then asked for her manager which was "busy". I then said I would wait for the manager. However, after 15 minutes, the manager did not arrive. I  proceeded to take my bag through security as initially planned, and everything was fine. I proceeded to the gate at which point I was told that what she said was not true, and I should not be assessed any fees. In addition, I called Air Canada Customer Service, and they also agreed I should not be assessed any fees for a bag that meets the requirements of a carry on but has to be checked due to a full flight. This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline, and I will never choose to fly Air Canada again.

### "rebooking process was difficult"
My flight from Toronto to Boston is canceled due to the weather. While there is no way to tell Mother Nature  there are better way to handle customer service. The website for refund and rebooking did not work for me and you can only transact with them on the phone for this matter not the counter. But I was on the waiting line for probably an hour and no one picked up the phone. In addition to this incident, I was flying from Toronto to Halifax and many of the customers were caught up in the security line due to “unforeseen” (from customers point of view) crowd at the check in and security check. We missed the gate by probably 2 minutes? Can still see the plane on tarmac but it’s deemed as customer fault and we were told to rebook. The rebooking process was similarly difficult. Not sure why their online systems have not been revamped. Customer service at the counter were also usually rude except for the staff at the priority line.

### "Horrible customer service"
Las Vegas to Toronto. Did not have enough over head storage for everyone's carry-on baggage so after boarding was an hour delayed, I had to wait at the door to the plane (literally at the door!) with numerous other people so they could hand write and print bag check tickets. My luggage got damaged and the airline won't do anything about it, they're also refusing to reply to my emails now. Horrible customer service.

### "3 hours delay in Casablanca"
Casablanca to Houston via Montréal. Over 3 hours delay in Casablanca, the service on the plane is the worst in long flight not to mention the quality of the meal. At Montréal, the Air Canada staff were overwhelmed and they had no idea how to deal with many people who lost their flight connections. I was lucky to get on plane on time to Houston, 4 hours flight with no sandwich to purchase on board.

### "whole family thanks you"
Edmonton to Castlegar via Vancouver. I would like to say a special thank you to Air Canada employee in Castlegar B.C. We had a connection in Vancouver and unfortunately our luggage didn’t make the connecting flight to Castlegar. We desperately needed our bags as we traveling to Grand Forks and leaving for a Comox by vehicle the following day. Nichole was kind enough to immediately contact couriers in Grand Forks to ensure that we would receive our luggage as soon as it arrived from Vancouver. We understand that luggage gets lost from time to time, but it is never convenient. Our whole family thanks you, as we were in Grand Forks to help elderly parents move to Vancouver Island and time was of the essence. You made our day when when the courier arrived with our luggage, thank you for not sending our luggage with Greyhound as that could have a disaster.

### "recomend this airline"
Roundtrip flight from Montreal to Shanghai the aircraft type was a Boeing 787 on both legs. I had a stand by ticket and it was available. The airline staff from the check in to the cabin crew was great and accomplished their work professionaly. Some crew members recognized me from a previous flight. The meals in First class were tasty, combined with a choice of wines. The seats were comfortable. I noticed some upgrades on the amenity kit and a small matress was provided for the seat on the return leg. Overall Air Canada has a competitive business Class product. The service on the ground and on board is consistent. I would recomend this airline to my friends and family.

### "say a big thank you"
I would like to say a big thank you to the lady who helped me over the phone with Air Canada to book me a flight for my nephews funeral. After a very hard week, she helped me so much and I had wished I grabbed her name to thank her properly. I appreciate everything you did for me,  you have no idea how grateful I am.

### "Seat pitch was okay"
Toronto to Munich. Aircraft was ok Boeing 787-9 with terrible light blue painting. Seat pitch was okay. Very basic service. There was no welcome drink, no warm towel. No amenities and no menu. Food was tasteless chicken in a plastic disk. There was offering of drinks and wine. No 2nd drink offering. There was no snacks during flight, when I went to the galleys, the only that they could offer me were some crackers. For breakfast they offer only a piece of cake and coffee. Flight attendants were nice but old. The company should place younger staff on long flights instead of the YUL-YYZ route. The flight on YUL-YYZ was on A330 and they served only juices and coffee, you had to pay for food. IFE was ok.

### "unimpressed and disappointed"
Edmonton to Halifax via Toronto. What started out as a very pleasant experience as a nice young man in Edmonton moved us up to nicer seats that were together, quickly became a disaster of an experience. After boarding our flight in Toronto and sitting on the runway for over an hour we were told we must leave the plane as it isn’t safe to fly. We were then told we would have to wait another 2 and a half hours until our next flight, ruining our dinner and holiday plans for the evening. After being told we would be leaving at 530 for sure from Pearson I was again frustrated to find we weren’t even boarding until 530, and then got to sit yet again on the runway for over an hour while the flight crew figured everything out. This entire experience was very frustrating, a terrible way to start a holiday and was made worse by the lack of compensation for our time and frustration by Air Canada, no food vouchers, or drinks were offered and nothing more than an explanation every 45 minutes was given. I am extremely unimpressed and disappointed, as I continue to sit on the runway still waiting to take off at some undetermined time.

### "incompetent handling delays"
I understand that there can be delays. Air Canada is incompetent in effectively handling delays in particular for business travelers. There are a lot of negative reviews of Air Canada for everything from overall friendliness to food. I care about those things – but as a business traveler I care most about getting to my destination on time, and that delays are handled effectively and knowledgeably when there are disruptions so that I can still get to my destination as needed. I was flying from Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto. My flight was delayed to Toronto, causing me to miss my flight to Shanghai. There were two other flights that could have gotten me to Shanghai in time for my meeting. Due to the incompetence of the Air Canada staff I missed both. In particular, there is no Business Class line at the re-ticketing counter. I waited for an hour and a half – missing both other flight options. I was behind domestic travelers with multiple rerouting options and coach fares. Even when I called over a “supervisor” and explained the situation I was told there was nothing she could do, she couldn’t get me to the front of the line, and I would just have to wait my turn. I was going for a board meeting, with my executive team flying in from all over the world for this meeting. All other travel and arrangements – for all of the other people – needed to be rearranged due to my travel issues. I am a frequent Air Canada traveler. I go to Asia at a minimum twice a year in Business Class. I fly every other week on an expensive (typically $500) ticket to my other office domestically. When I called "Customer Service" they were rude, told me there was no management escalation (no way I could talk to a supervisor), and showed absolutely no flexibility. My experience with customer service just added insult to injury. I am taking the time to write this review on as many review sites as I can. I don’t typically write reviews. In this case, however, I really want to warn other business travelers – in particular overseas business travelers – that they are not at all equipped to handle the inevitable travel disruptions and prioritize business class tickets. And that’s in addition to the relatively uncomfortable business class seats, poor customer service, and bad food.

### "said I need to cooperative"
Toronto to Las Vegas. I got to the gate and was told I can’t bring my carry on on board because the plane was full. I said I wouldn’t fly Air Canada again and the lady said I need to cooperative. After boarding the plane I notice that about 10% of the overhead compartments are available.

### "No help with my bags"
Toronto to Washington. Terrible customer service. No help with my bags, self-service to heave your bags onto electric line. I'm supposed to stand there waiting while they "go get someone" instead of go through security.

### "sleeping on the hard floors"
Toronto to New York La Guardia. First they changed the gate without announcing it last minute. A bunch of us missed the flight and it was our fault (they say). Second flight was cancelled due to weather which I understand. But the way the ground staff handled it was so unprofessional. Air Canada cancelled my flight 3 times. I was at Pearson international from Friday to Sunday sleeping on the hard floors cause they don’t reimburse for hotels if your a local, meaning anywhere in Canada. Onn the Sunday the manager happen to put me on a flight out. I got on the flight when I landed in La Guardia my bags were not on the plane it’s been 3 days now. The call centre in india can’t locate my bags and the Canadian # doesn’t work due to high call volumes. I’ve missed my international connection twice, with no bags. I will never ever fly or use Air Canada ever again.

### "flights were canceled upon arrival"
Seoul to Minneapolis via Toronto. Once we arrived at the Toronto Airport, the staff there were so unorganized. They had really bad attitudes & when we asked for directions, the first thing this woman did was questioned us why we were there & told us to go back to the direction where we came from. Coming back from my international destination, when everyone was seated in the plane, it was announced that there were “technical” issues & we would have to sit in the plane for 45 minutes. Well, that turned to an hour & half. Even worst was dealing with flight attendants for 13 hours. Our landing was postponed for an hour due to technical issues and the weather condition. Majority of travelers' flights were canceled upon arrival, and the people at Toronto Pearson (Terminal 1) were helpless. There was no one directing people to where they needed to go for assistance. The lines started to get long at Gate 15 at departures but there was absolutely no one to direct people where to line up or answer questions. We waited at the phone line for 1.5 hour just to wait another hour to speak with a representative. Getting impatient, I ended up at the hotel line for 2 hours just to find out it was to book a hotel when we just wanted to rebook our cancelled flight. Once we got to the Air Canada counter, the lady didn’t even care to look anything up on her computer & just told us to call this number that didn’t even work because it had “reach capacity.” Basically, the only help most of the 300+ travelers got were from other travelers. Also, this worker came onto the intercom to announce to us that they are doing their best to help us. Following that announcement came some short responses from frustrated travelers. We spent the night at the airport and they closed Gate 15 down & turned people away. When I asked about the hotel vouchers, the man questioned me & my intentions instead of help, there was no one floating around to help travelers with cancelled flights.

### "Worst airline I’ve flown on"
Montreal to New York LGA. Ridiculous transfer flight manipulation. Made me miss my flight because of 2 hour delay sitting in plane for de-icing and waiting for other customers on a transfer flight to board. But why didn’t they wait for us? Seriously looking at their bottom line and not caring for the customer at all. They cancelled at least half a dozen flights from Toronto to NYC because of freezing rain but there was absolutely no urgency to fly folks out in the morning so those flying at night got stuck with completely booked flights. I actually had a nonstop flight booked but 7 minutes later they kicked me out of my spot for no reason. Worst airline I’ve flown on.

### "service was below average"
St John's to Sydney via Toronto / Vancouver. I was travelling for several hours. In Toronto crew suggested I ask for 3-4 seats together when I got to Vancouver as the flight was not full. In Vancouver I was given 3 seats in a row but just my luck it was 3 seats where you could not raise the arm rests. There was however in the back row 2-4-2 which were empty. The crew had put their bags in the row with 4 seats. When requested to find a place to sleep I was told to look around the plane. The crew used the seats to put their bags and sit during the flight to do crosswords. The service was below average, staff looked tired and 'service' was not on top of their list. They need to either retire, do short flights or retrain with some of the Asian airlines. Food was terrible. I was ticketed as an international flight from Toronto to Sydney but was expected to pay for food and 3.50 for cheap headphones that would cost them 20 cents. Air Canada needs to have a good look at themselves. They bring Star Alliance down.

### "a subject of itinerary change"
Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney. I booked the ticket for my mother to travel Wellington, New Zealand from Vancouver, Canada. I booked in mid-February to travel in April beginning. My mother is old and has limited English. So i want her to travel hassle free for her vacation. The reason I choose air Canada 1) Price wise i can save about 150$ compared to the next cheap flight 2) I don't want to transit at Auckland because she needs to take a bus between international arrival and local departure at Auckland. 3) Air Canada's transit at Sydney only 3 hours and she can clear the bags at Wellington. My mother is Canadian and she doesn't require an ETA or transit visa to Australia if she has less than 8 hours transit. Exactly two days before the travel, we have received an email from Air Canada with a subject of itinerary change. No information inside the email except the itinerary. As per the new itinerary, transit at Sydney become 10 hours from just 3.5 hours. Same day evening we called the Air Canada to seek the reason. The person came to the phone didn't tell the reason. He just says the transit changed. Then we request for accommodation but he refused. Finally, we request the food voucher as a compensation for their possible mistake. He said they can provide that at the airport. ultimately its a useless conversation for us. ( Nothing provided at the airport at the end.) Then only we realized my mother required an ETA or transit visa to Australia. Transit visa is free but it could take up to 5 days to get it. So we apply for ETA and luckily we received almost immediately. As per there website, this could take up to 12 hours sometime. We were not happy about Air Canada's behavior. So on the same day, we file a complaint with Air Canada and asked them to reply immediately since the next day my mother was flying. It is now almost 5 days and my mother in New Zealand for 3 days. But no reply from Air Canada until now. Money wise we are not losing anything but this was making us nervous. Unnecessary stress. Especially my mother. 150$ is lots of money. But I think next time I won't worry about even 500$.

### "extremely positive experience"
Toronto to Laguardia. Had an extremely positive experience with Air Canada and their staff. After high winds left us grounded for 8 hours, they accommodated my Party of 4 and helped us all get on another flight together as soon as possible. Due to late arrival at our destination they allowed us to change our flight back to Toronto by a day and had a great conversation with Air Canada staff over phone! Thanks Air Canada!! Cant wait to fly to Spain with you in July!

### "paying the price big time"
I was supposed to be on flight from San Francisco to Calgary. They cancelled flight and said there were no other flights to Calgary for the day, that I had no choice but to fly to Toronto and then back to Calgary. Still stuck in Toronto and have since found out there were two other flights that went to Calgary on schedule. I avoid Air Canada at all costs but was stuck on this trip - paying the price big time.

### "no compensation for the delay"
Calgary to Vancouver. It started as a 1:45 min delay then they boarded us and we waited another 30 min waiting for the ramp crew. The incompetence is astounding but it appears to be the norm for Air Canada that rarely in my experience makes a departure on time. Will avoid this airline if possible in the future. Also no compensation for the delay that creates hardship for passengers.

### "irritated with this policy"
My review is specific to Air Canada's purchasing policy and not my flight experience. I purchased a ticket for my wife and I from Toronto to Calgary for a friend's wedding in June 2017. One of our family members passed away and as a result we needed to cancel our flight. We weren't able to obtain a full refund (due to their policy) which is understandable. I was, given a credit of a fraction of what I paid which I was told on the phone twice by different customer reps that will not expire. A series of family circumstances occurred which prevented my ability to fly. After 1 year, I decided to book a flight only to discover that my credit has expired. I emailed and appealed my case to their retention department and all they gave me was a 15% discount on my next flight. They even had the audacity to say it's out of their "goodwill" that they're offering me 15%. Very irritated with this policy.

### "staff said the flight was full"
Quebec to Toronto. Booked for 3Apr  to Toronto thru Cathay Pacific, to connect CX to Hong Kong at 00:50 4Apr. Arrived early at 11am to send my son for 2pm Westjet flight to Montreal. After checking in my son, we asked AC counter if we could change earlier flight. There were no more seats for 12:20 flight, but could check in for 16:35. However, the staff did not tell us it's a standby boarding pass. When boarding at 16:05, the boarding gate staff said the flight was full, put us on 18:20. If you did not have seat why would you check us in. We could just walk out and spend time outside airport, instead of sitting for nothing for hours inside this small airport. We are still waiting now. Also, we could not buy anything from Quebec airport duty free, because of connecting flight, must buy in Toronto airport. Just wonder how a passenger could have enough time during short transit!

### "very reluctant to help me"
London to Havana via Toronto. The flights were fine. The staff were efficient and pleasant on board. However, prior to travel I contacted customer services by email for basic information about whether the airline covers the cost of the Cuban visa card and airport taxes (they do). They were very reluctant to help me. Customer Services actually told me they only deal with customers after flights have taken place! Eventually my travel agent gave me a telephone number to contact the carrier, and I got the information I needed. On the Toronto to Havana flight both ways with Air Canada rouge, no meal was provided, which came as a surprise on a scheduled flight. In Toronto, Air Canada ground staff were very dismissive and unhelpful when we sought information on baggage. Havana check in told us we needed to retrieve bags at Toronto, even though the baggage tag showed check in through to destination. Air Canada staff seemed unable to give clear guidance. Two members of staff told us to reclaim the baggage, but could not tell us what to do when we had reclaimed it. I had great difficulty getting another member of staff to focus on my question: she just wanted to turn away from me. Compared to travel with other national carriers recently, Air Canada was poor.

### "check in all the roller bags"
Portland to Vancouver. They change planes at the last minute which can cause all sorts of confusion at the gate,  they told everyone that their carry on bags will not fit the new plane and they must be checked in. They could just sky check the bags and all would be okay, but they stopped that service also (second flight in two weeks they have done this to me on). They told us because it is a Q400 that they have to check in all the roller bags - this causes all sorts of delays upon arrival into Vancouver and is problematic if you have a connection due to a late inbound AC flight that delayed you to start with! The thing is, the sky check bags end up in the same place as the checked bags. Its just far more convenient for the business traveler to get your bag plane side and run to you connection.

### "Air Canada cancels this flight"
Pittsburgh to Barbados via Toronto. Air Canada has a regularly scheduled 7am flight from Pittsburgh to Toronto that connects with many flights headed to the Caribbean. In our case, on Feb. 4 we intended to connect with a flight to Barbados, from where we would take a short flight to Union Island in the Grenadines and then a short ferry to Palm Island. Problem is: Air Canada cancels this flight - and not infrequently. On this day, Air Canada cited the reason as lack of crew. Really? You can't schedule adequate crew? And Air Canada didn't tell us it canceled the flight until we were on our way to the airport at 5 a.m. What are we to do then? In our case, we had only one other option, which was to buy a last-minute ticket on JetBlue via Fort Lauderdale for $772. Unfortunately, the flight got us in too late to make the connection to Union Island, which means we had to pay for a hotel in Barbados and repurchase the $285 non-refundable airfare to Union Island -- not to mention forfeit the first night at our final destination. Air Canada doesn't compensate you for the cancellation, other than to refund the original one-way ticket. They gave us coupons worth $300 Canadian. That barely makes up the difference between the original ticket and the Jet Blue ticket. Their comment was "schedules cannot be guaranteed and they do not form part of the contract of travel. That's ridiculous.

### "great attention from the Cabin Crew"
As usual, on time service for my flight. I much rather going with Air Canada's professional and business service rather than the "let's be friends" attitude that you get with WestJet. Seats were older, but comfortable. Had great attention from the Cabin Crew throughout the whole flight. Only issue - my headphone jack didn't work very well.

### "Why pay for terrible service"
Flew Vancouver to Edmonton. I have been consistently flying Westjet because I got fed up with Air Canada. This time I had to fly with them and once again I was greeted at the gate by a rude flight attendant. Air Canada continues to disappoint time after time to the point where I avoid them at all costs. Why pay for terrible service, consistently overbooked flights and consistently lost luggage!

### "very bad customer oriented"
I am furious with Air Canada and advise everybody, especially women, to take another airline. My daughter is a girl, 18 years old, and had a ticket from Costa Rica to Amsterdam. The flight was overbooked. Air Canada took 3 woman of the flight that were traveling alone. The only message she got was that she should fly the next day. For her that was a huge problem. She only got a hotel voucher and was on her own there. Ground-service personnel hardly spoke English. I think this is irresponsible and very bad customer oriented. Never fly Air Canada.

### "flight has been delayed"
Fort Myers to Toronto. At 4:25 I got a text saying “delay until 9:15”. I wasn’t surprised as the past 4 times this flight has been delayed, this is because the plane generally comes from LAX and always gets ground delays from there causing this flight to be delayed. The flight was subsequently delayed to 10:05PM, the check in attendant was very nice and even though my Mom had an overweight bag, he let us go free of charge because of the flight delay. At the gate, the boarding was very disorganized and passengers boarded in all wrong zones. The plane’s Auxillary Power Unit  was not working and therefore it was very hot. Our flight did not leave until 10:30 due to passengers taking too long to board. Flight  was fine, except the IFE was very slow. We landed in Toronto and waited another 30 minutes for our bags to come. Do not fly the late Fort Myers Flight as it can be delayed and make your night a wreck. Opt to fly WestJet or take the earlier flights.

### "hopefully it will be my last flight"
To be honest this is not my first flight with Air canada but hopefully it will be my last flight. On 2 out of three flights my baggage was purposely missed and delivered after two days. On one out of three flights the flight was cancelled and one out of three the flight was delayed more than hour. They charge for luggage and they even charge for seat and food during the flight. The newest scam is donations (how can we trust them? ).

### "misplaced my luggage"
Ottawa to Toronto. I started my journey from Ottawa and was supposed to switch to an international airline from Toronto. Air Canada misplaced my luggage and gave me a wrong boarding pass. I was lucky enough to figure out that the boarding pass was wrong and got the right one in time. But they lost my baggage and have still not been able to locate it deferring responsibility to other airline. I asked the person at the check in station three time, if there will be any issues regarding getting my baggage to the second airline company and she assured me that I will get my baggage at the final destination and will not be able to access it at Toronto airport. Grossly incompetent and the worst experience with the airline I have had.

### "Staff did a very good job"
Toronto to Fort Myers. I would say this was a better flight than some other experiences I had with Air Canada. This flight was convenient, had an updated selection of movies on its IFE, Staff did a very good job, and the plane was on time! There was a scenario at the gate with a passenger getting REALLY upset over their bag having to be checked, and the Air Canada staff dealt with it correctly.

### "friendly and efficient"
Great Christmas holiday in Spain starting with a visit to Air Canada’s new Signature Suite. Very personal attentive service and the food was great. The flights to and from Madrid were good. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. The A330 has the classic business class pods. The seat was uncomfortable even in bed mode and lacked storage places for personal electronics. The overall experience with Air Canada was good and I would fly with them again.

### "I found the service terrible"
We were delayed coming out of Vancouver on Feb 23 due to a snowstorm. We sat in the plane on the tarmac for 3 hrs waiting to de-ice, so a total of 8 hrs on this plane on this flight. I do not have any issues with the delay, this is weather related and out of anyone's control. However we had one drink the whole time we were on this flight and they ran out of food. So basically 8 hrs on a plane with one drink and no food. The service starts at the beginning of the plane and works it's way to the back which takes a long time for those sitting at back of plane. As well I had to ask for my drink 3 times after I paid for it, and each time they asked me what I had ordered. Once we connected to the ramp in Toronto it was another 50 minutes to de-board the plane and another 35 minutes to get luggage, as 4 flights were all on one baggage carriage to come through. Overall I found the service terrible, the snack I was able to get also was terrible and did not find a friendly experience overall with any of the staff. My coworker who also was on the plane rang for service several times no one ever came. I have travelled with Air Canada several times and for one reason or another there always seems to be an issue. I decided to write a review this time as I am definitely going to consider other airlines first before I have no choice but to fly with Air Canada. I think this airline needs to remember that "ecomony" calls is what supports the majority of the clients that fly with them and need to ensure those passengers are looked after as well as others.

### "Not impressed with our service"
Due to fly Halifax to Toronto via Vancouver. After 3 delays, 2 sleepless nights spent in the airports, can't blame the weather but it gets frustrating. To top it off, our luggage didn't make it to our final destination which made us miss the ferry to Vancouver Island making our trip much longer than it should have been. Not impressed with our service with Air Canada at all.

### "we bid for an online upgrade"
Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver in Premium Economy. In deciding which airline to take, we put weight on using AC on a direct flight with my partner having 50k Elite. The flaw in this was assuming 50k elite meant something and that a direct flight with one stop was fool proof. After booking the flight, we found we could only select seats available for both legs. So with no twins in a 2-4-2 formation available for both legs, we were forced to select an aisle and middle seat. (though different twins were available on either leg). Call centre and ground staff were unable to allocate different twins available for each leg as it's one flight / boarding card. We bid online for a cash upgrade and initially had money taken from our credit card only to have it returned to our account within hours. A request at the gate in Toronto for a seat change on either leg was answered with "ask in Vancouver". An on time departure but a poor meal service. Neither my partner or I got our choice of meal. A very average stew of veal was provided followed by drinks. On spotting an IPA ale on the cart appearing from club, I was told the IPA was a premium beer and not available in PPremium Economy. The service just feels ill thought out with a meal before a drink! At Vancouver, we were told we couldn't swap seats as we should have asked in Toronto! My partner was initially upgraded for free to biz as Premium Economy and Economy were over-sold which was then withdrawn when a connecting flight ran late and all classes suddenly available. Another average "slop meal" followed by drinks followed served by a very capable and very senior crew. After this alleged enhanced meal, service morphed into Economy with standard mid flight sandwich and an inedible breakfast. A late arrival was followed by late bags. The day before our return we were informed of a four hour delay. On arriving at the airport we checked in fine, and my partner invited to the Air NZ lounge as a star alliance gold member. (no invite for me as it's it's another airline's lounge) Despite the 4 hour delay the base manager wouldn't budge and bizarrely - no vouchers for food were issued despite an 4 hour+ delay. On boarding, we found out the original crew ran out of hours in Vancouver and it operated 12 hours late to Sydney with a spare crew who needed minimum rest. In terms of upgrades (again), we bid the max for an online upgrade and still didn't' get it. An ok meal served with drinks again served after. On arrival in Vancouver 5 hours late, we found the second leg had left on time with another aircraft and we had been bumped to other flights. (no announcements before arrival into Vancouver) At the gate, we were given PE seats and split up BUT on the original aircraft (with a new flight number in view of our original twin seats) Others from Sydney were in the same position a lot of angry customers feeling let down. Another average meal and drinks rounded off my most average Premium Economy experience ever. On the plus side, all crews were great with plenty of drinks runs. The fundamental design and architecture of this route is flawed. The inflexibility is annoying though when it suits AC, they will split the flight in two to maintain punctuality. Checking back, it is clearly most unreliable AC flight in their entire operation Upgrades were also harder on credits as it's treated as one flight. I would never do an ultra long flight with AC again where so much of the experience is fragile, mis-conceived, late and inflexible.

### "secured me a seat on the 5 pm flight"
I was scheduled on flight AC 115 to Vancouver on Friday March 2 to give a lecture. After boarding the plane and sitting on the plane for one hour we needed to deplane as there was a mechanical issue. No problem. I asked one of the Air Canada personnel what was the plan. She said they were trying to get another plane. No problem. Then I heard the plane was cancelled so I approached the desk again and this time I spoke with a young man who was fantastic. I explained to him I know everyone has their reason for wanting to get to their destination, I just wanted to know if he could assist me. He promptly looked at the next available flight with a seat and secured me a seat on the 5 pm flight.

### "the cabin was really cold"
I did 4 flights with Air Canada (in the one trip) and on all of them I had trouble. On the first one (AC91, São Paulo to Toronto), the cabin was really cold, I was freezing. Arriving in Toronto, the person who took my bag appeared to just throw it. I will do the other complaints in my other flight reviews.

### "one of my 2 bags didn’t arrive"
This was my second flight (AC105, Toronto to Vancouver, coming from São Paulo). The seat was pretty uncomfortable and with no space and one of my 2 bags didn’t arrive with me. I told the ground service and he told me that it was coming. I arrived in Vancouver on Saturday at 1 pm and just got my bag on Wednesday at 5 pm.

### "wanted to thank every person at Air Canada"
My daughter and I were on flight AC182 from Vancouver to Toronto. I wanted to thank every person at Air Canada that we came in contact with. My daughter had injured herself skiing and I can’t tell you how kind and accommodating everyone we encountered was. From check in to re assignment of seats to having wheelchairs. The cabin staff were also kind and provided my daughter with ice packs.

### "everyone was so helpful and kind"
Vancouver to Toronto. Amazing service and everyone was so helpful and kind. I had a knee injury and needed assistance. I can’t thank everyone enough for all their help and kindness. I was supplied with wheelchairs and complete assistance. I tried to give the lady who wheeled me all the way to the car pick up area and she wouldn’t take it. The check in lady was awesome to get me a seat that would work for me even though it was a full flight. Thank you.

### "employees was so rude"
Edmonton to London (ON) via Toronto. Worse flight ever. They cancelled the flight and gave an option to claim a refund for that cancelled flight. I called them 3 times and as they told me I did submit a refund claim online. They said we will contact you. I haven't heard anything from them yet. Not a single reply. Never go with Air Canada. 0/10 Rating. Even customer service was worse. Employees was so rude at gate when flight got cancelled instead of being helpful.

### "Customer service is certainly not a priority"
We travel quite frequently and I can honestly say that traveling Air Canada has been the worst experience we have ever encountered. We left from Columbus, Ohio to Paris with a transfer in Toronto. When we got to the airport with the 3 hours that is recommended for foreign travel, no one was at the Air Canada counter. When they finally did arrive we were told that our flight to Toronto was delayed and as a result, we would not be able to go to Paris until the next day. Rather than assist us with alternative flight plans we were given a number to call, which proved to be futile. Our AAA representative was finally able to find a flight (American Airlines) for us so that we were able to get to Paris on the day we were scheduled. On our way home from Paris we encountered a 2 hour delay, with no explanation as to the reason. We got to Toronto with little time to spare for our connection to Columbus. Our luggage was not on the flight, and when we contacted the airlines the following day as to the whereabouts of our luggage we were told that "the system was down". Our luggage eventually did arrive, but this experience has taught us that we will never fly this airline again. Customer service is certainly not a priority with this airline

### "bumped at the gate"
Montreal to Toronto. Oversold the flight and I was bumped at the gate and not even given a choice or a say. Air Canada put me on a later flight to a different Toronto airport and lost my luggage. Still waiting for my bags. Air Canada should fly to Disneyland because they are a Mickey Mouse airline. Avoid flying with these uncaring people.

### "vegan meal wasn't vegan"
London to Toronto. Didn't provide food type selected. Vegan meal wasn't vegan. Staff at check in and boarding were nice but the whole process seemed chaotic. On board it was difficult to get a drink. Thought this airline would be up there with the larger international ones but they are way behind

### "absent for a big part of the flight"
Some good flights, but a so-so flight too. Our experience was really confusing. Our first flight (Santiago Chile - Toronto) wasn't the best. In Santiago they haven't got many staff working. They opened the check in really late, with a long line waiting. The flight was fine, the food was ok, the service in flight was ok too. The flight Toronto-Tokyo was the best one. The staff at the airport were really polite and they solve all our problems. The staff on the plane were really good and they talked a lot with the passengers! They give us two meals and a lot of drinks. Our flight Tokyo-Toronto was ok too. But our flight Toronto-Santiago wasn't the best. The staff were not really that attentive. My partner is vegetarian, the first meal was quinoa and the salad was quinoa! Really bad, we asked for a solution, and they just said "return it". They only give drinks twice and they were absent for a big part of the flight.

### "cabin was not clean"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Vancouver. Prices and services not even close to any European standard. Priced like premium - service like the lowcoster. No food on 5 hours flight. Extra price for luggage. Really, stay away. Seat uncomfortable and cabin was not clean. Staff were really rude.

### "Boeing 787-9 is poorly configured"
Toronto to London. The Boeing 787-9 is poorly configured and seat layout is not passenger friendly. Only consideration given is how to squeeze as many people in the plane. Aisles are narrow and passenger get disturbed by traffic. Air quality is better but seats are not comfortable. Seat 30C is merely two feet away from toilet door.

### "the overall flight was enjoyable"
Second flight on Air Canada from Montreal to Geneva, and again I wasn't deceived. The crew were really sympathetic and spoke French, German and English. The legroom was standard for economy class and the selection of movies on the IFE was more than enough for a 6 hour and 49 minutes flight. But there were a few downsides, not necessarily the fault of the airline that need to be noted. We arrived 35 minutes late at Cointrin and we left the aircraft in rainshowers, but the true downside was a disruptive passenger. Before landing, the crew asked everyone to retract their seat, including in English, but the passenger didn't do it. The crew passed a last time for a verification and asked him to retract it, but when the crew were out of view he retracted it on me again just before landing. This type of dangerous passenger cannot be tolerated. But again the overall flight was enjoyable.

### "an unpleasant attitude"
Vancouver to Montreal. I was sitting in a window seat 19F and my entertainment system was not functioning. The flight attendant said there was a vacant window seat directly in front of me 18F but since it was an emergency exit she would come back and brief me on the instructions. I moved to the seat in question, got settled in again, ear phones in, blanket etc and 20 minutes into the show I was watching the same flight attendant said I couldn’t sit in that seat because it was a preferred seat and told me I must move to another seat! I said that I did not want to move again & reminded her that she told me to take that seat. She said she made a mistake and with an unpleasant attitude rudely insisted that I move. Needless to say if the equipment was in working order I never would have moved in the first place. In order to avoid the situation escalating I did move again to the back of the plane. When the food for purchase cart finally reached me in the backn of the plane almost everything was sold out so I was also unable to purchase the fruit/cheese platter that I wanted.

### "no one has taken any action"
Hong Kong to Columbus via Toronto. We reached Toronto and flight to Columbus was cancelled due to snowstorm. That is when it took them over 4 hours to get us to a hotel. In that time the agents acted as if they had never handled a similar situation. There was no one in charge, or not, who could tell us anything for over 2 1/2 of those hours. I was assigned next day to the very next CMH flight. I asked about my luggage and was assured it would be on that flight. It was not. I filed a claim at CMH, and later was told it was lost, so I filed another 3 days later. The flight to Toronto was on the 12th of January, and it is now February 11th. I have called the lost baggage line multiple times over this period, and no one has taken any action that led to finding my luggage. It was obvious that there was no plan on their part to try to find it, as no one at any time has been able to tell me where it is. One agent tried to track and said he thought it was put on a flight to Pittsburgh on the 13th of January, stayed there 5 days, and was sent by protocol then to Montreal. I asked them how to contact Montreal baggage center and he said that even agents can not call them in Montreal, they can only email them. He stated that he would, nothing happened. I begged another agent a few days later to do something to locate the luggage. He seemed genuine in his concern, and said he would do a thorough investigation and get back to me in 2 hours. He did not contact me again. I had many souvenirs from Hong Kong and gifts from friends as I got engaged on the visit. I feel their system is set up to only deal with the ordinary travel situations. They have given no priority at Air Canada at all to helping passengers in a situation in which they send their luggage to the wrong place. The agents on scene in Toronto, and the leased agents they had in Columbus were at times disrespectful to us. The agents who knew what they were doing or were kind operate in an airline that shows no respect in these situations, and has not once reached out to me to help in correcting the situation. The only contact has been initiated by me. I believe their policy is "let them complain, eventually they will go away! In this instance they are wrong. I will seek out every way I can to give them reviews like this one until someone listens to me.

### "Like air travel used to be"
Flew Air Canada from Montreal to Barbados. Like air travel used to be. Civilized checkin agents and good lounge staff. Gate agents smiled and said good morning. Greeted by Flight Attendant on boarding. Lucked out by having 3 empty seats. Plane clean. Only negative was charging for a headset. Really? The airline needs that $3 for a .15 cent product? Quick sales of food and bar only 30 minuutes after departure. Frequent water service and garbage pick up. Another bar service prior landing. Lovely flight.

### "staff were also lecturing numerous passengers"
Flew Montreal to Lyon. As usual, Air Canada staff with an attitude. On this particular flight I was told I couldn't use my Air Pods because there was no wifi on this particular flight. So no wifi, no Air Pods, no Bluetooth? The staff were also lecturing numerous passengers about numerous ‘rules’. We were in business class, we know the rules. Rule #1: fly another airline whenever you can!

### "the aircraft was filthy"
Montreal to St. John’s on Air Canada. Check-in was quick and painless. Flight boarded by zone number and completed promptly. On board the aircraft was filthy with crumbs, almonds and wrappers strewn across the floor. My seat had an empty water bottle left behind confirming the poor or non-existent grooming of the aircraft before flight. The seat was comfortable but the tray table was very flimsy and hard to balance anything on it. We were served a hot breakfast and offered several rounds of drinks on this 2.5 hour flight. The IFE had a good range of films but I opted to watch my own on my mobile device. The washroom was a carbon copy of the main cabin in terms of cleanliness and grooming. Flight left and arrived on time and the FA looking after us was friendly and efficient.

### "the worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Do not use this airline! Original flight out of Calgary was cancelled. I was not permitted to speak directly to an attendant. Instead I was given a customer service number. After 30 minutes on hold, I finally got my flight re-scheduled for the following day. I had to cover my own lodging. The following day, I sought to get on standby for an earlier flight which I received a ticket for. While boarding, I was told my bag was too large and they made me check it. The moderately rude attendant told me that I could change the baggage claim if I got on an earlier flight out of Toronto. When I got to Toronto, I asked to get on standby for the 16.55 flight to Syracuse. After waiting at the unoccupied customer service counter for over 30 minutes, the attendant there said I couldn’t because I had a checked bag. That flight was already delayed to 18.30 for mechanical issues. My original flight of 20.10 then also got “mechanical issues” and was delayed to 21.45. The carelessness of Air Canada employees is upsetting and the airline’s ability to problem solve is severely lacking. The entertainment amenities on the planes is worse than most other airlines. They nickle and dime customers be charging for small packets of pretzels. Finally, if someone gets a cancelled flight while trying to fly into the US, he/she cannot request a different route or city hub to fly though unless he/she is willing to pay for another connecting flight. Air Canada is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with and I hope I never fly with them again.

### "4 hours on the tarmac"
Calgary to Toronto. I boarded the plane with a 30 minute delay. Then we waited an addition hour for de-icing. Then we were told they needed to refuel so another hour went by. After fuel and de-icing we were told there was a staffing issue and some workers could not continue do to length of shift. After 4 hours on the tarmac we are leaving. Air Canada announced through all this that if anyone deplanes they will not receive their luggage and will not be reimbursed for accommodations.

### "my baggage has not yet arrived"
I took a connecting flight and was told I had to collect my luggage in Toronto for my connecting flight to Montreal. I did so and 3 days later, my baggage has not yet arrived 3 days later from such a short route. I’ve called 3 times and each time I am given different information. Totally incompetent!

### "The legroom was decent"
Flew from Montreal to Frankfurt. Plane was a 777 with the new livery. Boarding was completed without any problems. The legroom was decent and the personal IFE had plenty of new titles and a wide variety of songs. I wish AC offered Inflight WiFi like LH or TK. The dinner was okay, however, they were out of chicken when they came to my row so I didn't have any choice. The 'breakfast' they serve was just a slice of banana bread which wasn't good. The flight attendants were really sincere and did their job well. We departed Montreal with an hour delay and I had a connection flight with just an hour of layover, so one of the flight attendants informed me that they are aware of the situation and that they would relocate me to a front row business class seat before landing. I made it to my connection flight thanks to them.

### "food absolutely terrible"
Sydney to Vancouver. Departure delayed at both ends of trip without notification, explanation or apology. Makeshift check out counters with luggage scales that didn’t work. Limited range of inflight entertainment and useless headphones. To top it all off, the food was absolutely terrible! Cashing in on a popular holiday route with expensive tickets and woeful service! Never again.

### "cabin crew were on point"
Flew Los Angeles to Vancouver. Great Experience. Once you get past the chaos of the boarding area at LAX the trip was really good. Flight was on time and cabin crew were on point. Good meal service and the flight attendants worked the cabin the entire time. Seats were older but still comfortable for a "short" flight. AC does a better job on this route than AA does as AA uses the E175 on the route with little service. When flying this route, or anywhere in Canada I will be using Air Canada. Lounge at YVR was ok, not the best, but not the worst. Seat back AV needs some updating as the screens are small, but the choices were good.

### "clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful"
Our flight was cancelled last minute at the gate and were told to go to the customer service desk. However, upon arriving there, we were told to just go retrieve our luggage because the agents would not be able to help us and that we would have to call their customer service line to reschedule our flight. We were then given a card with a phone number to call to book another flight and to also book a hotel at a discount. However, upon calling the phone agent, we were told that because the cancellation was not their fault, they could not provide accommodation, even at a discount. We were also told that there would not be another direct flight out until 2 days later, although upon checking the internet, we saw that there were many other direct flights for the next day, with other airlines. The phone agent then told us that that they could not book us a flight with another airline, and that we would have to go back to the airport and speak to the desk agent. All the agents gave us different information and seemed clueless, uncaring, and unhelpful! Because of this airline's stupidity, we all lost out on a day's pay and had to drive down from Toronto to Newark so that we wouldn't miss out on another day's pay. Upon arriving back home, we found out that a friend also went through a similar experience previously with this airline.

### "easily the worst airline"
Flew Los Angeles to Toronto. Air Canada is easily the worst airline in the western world. How can one airline loose so many bags, be so late for so many departures and arrivals, offer the most disgusting on board food and employ the nastiest most incompetent staff and still be in business is a mystery to me. Air Canada's hatred of its customers is evident at every level of the company and can be seen in every single employee you come in contact with. Air Canada is a national disgrace and embarrassment of Canada and should be avoided at all costs. Take a plane, a boat, a train.

### "delay made everyone exhausted"
Vancouver to Beijing with a 7-hour delay. The entire trip is only about 10 hours from Vancouver to Beijing China, and the long delay made everyone exhausted. As a gesture of goodwill, this airline offers everybody a 15% off promo code, however, it is only good for a month - few people would fly again within such a short timeframe. On my return trip the flight was again delayed 2+ hours, leading me to miss the connection flight I'd already booked. So I was put on the next flight leaving YVR at 5 pm to Seattle. I did not feel too bad until I learned that the new connection flight was delayed for another 1+ hour. Delay after delay, making the travel very exhausting. I will probably never fly Air Canada again.

### "Overall a good flight"
Fort Myers to Toronto. Overall a good flight. The flight was delayed one hour due to weather in Toronto, and therefore the staff gave out free earphones on the airplane. They also gave free play kits to the children. The staff overall were just lovely. We landed in Toronto and we couldn’t park at a gate due to staff shortages, but the captain was very generous in keeping us updated. It was a nice, clean airplane with lots of legroom. Thumbs up Air Canada!

### "delayed by more than three hours"
Hong Kong to Vancouver. Our flight was delayed by more than three hours for the second time in a row. The customer service associate did not want to hear about the connecting flight I would miss and gave a coupon for 2/3 the value of the cheapest meal one could buy at the airport— what a joke!

### "crew were purposely avoiding people"
Horrible customer service. We were delayed boarding by over 30 min. Once on the plane we left an hour and a half late. It seemed like the on board crew were purposely avoiding people and blamed the airport. We missed our connecting flight to Las Vegas along with 16 other people on our flight and got no apology from Air Canada, aparently putting us up a night in Vancouver more than makes up for a night in Vegas. I usually fly with another airline and only booked with Air Canada because it was part of the hotel package. I will happily pay more for a flight from a different airline since I felt like this happens very often and they didn't even make an attempt to try and get us there the same day.

### "I try to avoid Air Canada"
Montreal to Munich. The experience was really poor! My first flight was 2 hours delayed and I missed my connection flight from Montreal to Munich! The plane had not yet taken off when arriving in Montreal, but due to bad communication and very slow customer service I saw my flight leaving. Luckily the agent booked me on a flight going to Munich via Geneva, this flight was already 3 hours delayed. They delayed that flight another 1.5 hours when arriving at the boarding gate. We again left more than 2 hours late, which then made me miss my connection in Geneva. Delayed plans, bad customer service, no communication, food on the airplane was bad, we got very little water to drink during a 6 hours flight and the entertainment system was old and very slow. In the future I try to avoid Air Canada.

### "delayed an hour as usual"
Toronto to Thunder Bay. Delayed an hour as usual and we were only informed 20 minutes before the flight. How is it possible for an hour and a half flight to be delayed by over 50% of its duration? Literally the worst airline I've ever flown. I'm a frequent flier making 20 flights a year internationally.

### "no effort made whatsoever"
So, Air Canada is officially the worst airline I've dealt with. And I've seen plenty. Side note - YYZ, YAM and even YTZ were open and functioning at the time. My flight was cancelled as I arrived to the airport, without any explanation, as another airline operating the same aircraft type, landed and took off safely. I was given an alternative to leave on Thursday instead of scheduled Monday flight, with no concern of how am I supposed to pay for my stay in Sault Ste Marie for additional 3 days, missing work at the same time. No food vouchers, hotel or any other accommodations were offered. No alternative flights were offered. Nor from another city, nor from different airline. Customer service is outsourced from India and is absolutely useless. That's unacceptable treatment of customers, with no effort made whatsoever to rectify the situation. I was left with no alternative but miss work, look for accommodation and pay for food for three days. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. Please note - the airport wasn't closed, as different airline flight, using the same aircraft type, arrived and left on time. Also, I wasn't offered any alternative and was told that I have to "get to Sudbury myself if I want to fly from there", as well as the claim that "my expenses on the ground will not be reimbursed, because flight cancellation was caused by extreme weather" (please see above RE: airports operable). I was left stranded for three days, with no explanation and means of accommodation.

### "turned an 18 hour trip to a 32 hour trip"
Flew Tel Aviv to Toronto via Washington DC. We fly a lot, and have never had such a bad experience, even with airlines that are much cheaper than Air Canada. It's not just that they treat you terribly but they genuinely do not care! Never have we experienced such poor customer service. To summarize our story: Air Canada staff caused us to miss 2 flights and turned an 18 hour trip to a 32 hour trip simply because they didn't care.

### "great deal and a great ride"
London to Montreal. It's always a pleasure to get a great deal and a great ride. I booked this trip to UK for Xmas back in August for three people (12 adults and 1 teenager) including extra baggage and seat assignment for less than $1,000 cad each. I had very low expectations. One the return flight we had an older A330, which definitely looks old school now, but with better leg room and personal space than the Boeing 787. The seats feel abused and lacking cushion for sure. Having said that the crew were pleasant, easy going and efficient. They served drinks, then a meal service, then another drinks service, then a snack service and I can say for once I wasn't hungry or grossed out by what they offered. Even got a "free" 2nd bottle of cheap red wine. The flight was ahead of schedule landing and we even relaxed enough to socialize with our fellow passengers on board and make new friends. Kudos to Air Canada for a really great economy experience. I still prefer biz or premium economy!

### "unacceptable treatment"
Vancouver to Sault Ste Marie via Toronto. My flight was cancelled as I arrived to the airport, without any explanation, as another airline operating the same aircraft type, landed and took off safely. I was given an alternative to leave on Thursday instead of scheduled Monday flight, with no concern of how am I supposed to pay for my stay in Sault Ste Marie for additional 3 days, missing work at the same time. No food vouchers, hotel or any other accommodations were offered. No alternative flights were offered. Nor from another city, nor from different airline. Unacceptable treatment of customers, with no effort made whatsoever to rectify the situation. I was left with no alternative but miss work, look for accommodation and pay for food for three days. Every passenger on the flight was treated in the same manner. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. AC replied to my claim, stating that they "don't reimburse delays due to extreme weather" and offered me 25% discount on the future flights. Please note - the airport wasn't closed, as Porter flight, using the same aircraft type, arrived and left on time. Also, I wasn't offered any alternative and was told that I have to "get to Sudbury myself if I want to fly from there", as well as the claim that "my expenses on the ground will not be reimbursed, because flight cancellation was caused by extreme weather". I was left stranded for three days, with no explanation and means of accommodation. Not even mentioning I was already avoiding Air Canada, now I will do everything possible not to fly with them again. Unfortunately, they hold monopoly on flights within the country for the most part. Hence the price of the flight to Australia with Qantas could be as low as CAD $937 to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Sault Ste Marie is CAD $1200 is you are lucky.

### "everything was neat, tidy and clean"
A great flight from Air Canada, returning from Frankfurt to Calgary in premium economy. The majority of my recent flights have been on AC (also flown WestJet, EasyJet, and Lufthansa, I've found that AC compares favourably). Getting on board on this flight, I let my clean-obsession take over. If there was something out of place or noticeably dirty on or around my seat, I'd notice. But everything was neat, tidy and clean. The flight was on time. The cabin crew on AC is usually friendly, but this time I was struck by just how pleasant they were: My request for an extra meal (it was a 21-hour-long travel day for me) was immediately accommodated. The attendant came around in good time and offered more wine to the cabin without people even asking. When I missed the second meal (breakfast wraps) because I was asleep, the attendant brought me two servings to make up for it. When I asked for coffee, the attendant brought a handful of something, saying: 'I didn't know if you wanted sugar-and-cream or Baileys, so I brought both - choose wisely! I chose wisely and went with Baileys - and I'll choose Air Canada again because believe it or not, this kind of service and friendliness is pretty typical on most flights, and I've flown with them on countless times. There have been delays, but nothing not related to weather or maintenance; and most delays were compensated by vouchers or flight discounts. In general they're actually a pretty consistent airline.

### "exceptional at apologizing"
Vancouver to San Jose. There is nothing terrible about the flight itself, it’s relative brevity / directness (2hrs), the staff, or other normalcies you’d expect from a flight. I have taken this flight both ways approx every 3 weeks for the last 9 months and I get to the destination between 30-60mins late on average (enough so that I plan for it in my calendar and always arrive the airport 10mins prior to boarding as I know there will be extra waiting). Today it’s some kind of maintenance issue (we’ll likely be delayed 3-4hrs before takeoff is the estimate over the loudspeaker). It’s routine for Air Canada to be delayed on this particular flight. It seems Air Canada is exceptional at apologizing for things though - I’ve heard more of the phrase “I’m sorry” on this flight than anywhere else (and I’m Canadian, so very used to hearing it regardless of context). I’m not a complainer, and a frequent flier, so understand all the things that can go wrong and have sat through most of them. I’m not sitting here fuming or anything. I have a phone / laptop and can work. It’s just something about the inconsistency of this particular flight that I’m hoping to prepare people for.

### "Terrible ground service"
Copenhagen to Toronto intending to connect to a final destination in Florida. The flight was fine, our problems started the second we touched down in Canada. During the flight, we were asked if our final destination was the US or Canada and given the appropriate customs form. However, on getting there, we discover that we still have to go through Canadian customs and so needed the Canadian form too. We then had to get to a waiting area for our bags to come off the Air Canada flight and go through to US customs. On the airplane and by several signs in the terminal not to pick up our bag for customs; it would go directly through. My bag took 2 hours to get to where it needed to go and my companion’s bag was lost. So, naturally, at this point we can’t get to our next flight because US customs requires your checked bag to be accounted for first. So, we missed our next flight. It’s a busy time of year so no other flights were available for two days. We go to the counter to get a hotel since it’s their fault we couldn’t continue on our trip. We’re told by one employee to go talk to another, who gives us the phone number of their help line. I spend half an hour on hold waiting to talk to them only to be told they can’t do hotel vouchers over the phone and I have to talk to someone in the terminal. We finally get our hotel, but they’ll only book it for one night because their policy is we have to try again tomorrow to get rebooked on an earlier flight. So, today, now the day after our original flight, I spend another half hour on hold trying to save them money by getting an earlier flight and not having to spend another night in a hotel only to be told that because another airline operates our final flight, they can’t do anything. So my travel companion goes to the Air Canada counter to get us approved for another night at the hotel. When she finally talks to someone, they tell her she needs to speak to the person at the ticketing counter to be told again that there are no earlier flights to Florida before they’ll approve a second hotel night. So now she’s waiting in line to talk to a ticketing agent and they only have two clerks at the desk and a line of over forty people when there are a lot of passengers displaced during this time of year all trying to get home. Terrible ground service. I will never fly Air Canada again!

### "cancelled and rescheduled"
Our flight from Toronto to Winnipeg on December 29 was cancelled and rescheduled on January 1st. We had no where to stay and besides we had to attend our jobs the next day. The staff in Toronto airport didn't care and was rude. After several times calling finally we got to book a connecting flight on December 30 to Ottawa and from Ottawa to Winnipeg, thanks to the lady who answered our call and did it for us. I don't know her name but she was very nice, polite and helpful.

### "Our flight got delayed"
Toronto to Vancouver. First of all, our flight from Vancouver on Dec 23, 2017 was cancelled and we were never notified by Air Canada. We came to the airport and found that we need to take another flight, which was delayed and we couldn’t make connection from Toronto to Quebec on time. We had to spend 1,5 hours to find another ticket and it was just the beginning of nightmare. Our flight was Premium Economy, and the ticket was changed to economy without any refund or explanation whatsoever. I had a fracture in my spine and metal rod was installed, that was the reason for Premium class and a window seat, so that I wouldn’t suffer from pain. Instead we were seated by the toilet in economy and I had severe pain through the flight and a day after. When we finally got to Toronto our flight to Quebec got delayed and we had to wait another 2,5 hours. We got there eventually, but on the way back it was the same story. Our flight got delayed, we did not make it to our connection flight and on Dec 30, 2017 we got stuck in Montreal. Air Canada provided accommodation after an argument, but we had to take an extra flight to make it home on December 31, 2017. Thank you Air Canada for screwing up New Years for us. The seats that we booked originally were cancelled and they couldn’t find a place to accomodate a person with severe back pain. You can only imagine through what I went through in this 2 days journey. The worst experience in my life for the amount of money we paid.

### "Not happy about this"
Edmonton to Las Vegas. Absolutely the worst experience. First flight was delayed on the tarmac and second never said delayed until the departure time. Then got into a further delay. I am missing my evening that I paid a lot of money for because we are now at a 4 hour delay. And I got compensated with a meal voucher. Not happy about this and will not be flying with them again.

### "they need to have better service"
Air Canada is not bad compared to other North American Airlines. Toronto to Ottawa is a short flight, no EI but a short flight so don't mind. Last year I flew to Istanbul with Air Canada, they need to have better service on Transatlantic flights. For flying within North America they are fine.

### "never fly this airline again"
I took this flight from Vancouver to San Diego with my husband and son on Dec 28th. The flight was scheduled from 8pm - 11pm. 7:30 PM - Upon arrival at the departure gate we were informed the plane was delayed for an unspecified period of time. 8:40 PM - We boarded 40 mins late. My family all had only carry on bags, which we quickly realized would not fit in the overhead compartments - along with a many other passengers. Our bags were taken from us to be placed under the plane, and would have to retrieved via the carousel in San Diego. It seemed odd that all the flight staff watched us board with bags they knew would not fit in the plane? The overhead compartments were broken and duct taped in several places on the plane. One gentlemen even remarked that he thought the front window of the plane was duct taped. 9:20 - Takeoff The plane seemed very old and in dire cosmetic disrepair. The flight staff were friendly. They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog. Everyone was obviously disappointed and also confused because it didn't appear foggy. Once in LA we sat in a deserted area of the airport hoping to be accepted for deplaning. Several announcements were made to try and appease our frustrations but the pilot himself seemed utterly defeated. He mentioned that he "we shouldn't worry, because they were already assured we wouldn't have to return to Vancouver. We were just sitting there on the tarmac waiting for something to happen. At one point there was supposed to be a bus coming to get us and staff to help accommodate our various scenarios. 1:30 AM - We were able to utilize a deplaning corridor (our plane was too small to fit against the tunnel opening, so we walked down the stairs of the plane and up into the terminal via a second set. Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options. We were also told the reason the plane didn't land in San Diego was because the in flight crew had worked 12 hours and wanted out of the air and didn't want to circle to wait to land. We checked the flight status at San Diego airport and it appeared all other flights were landing. 2:00 AM - Air Canada staffers advised those of us wishing to leave to submit car rental vouchers to Air Canada, those in need of boarding stayed back. I will try this but some other folks with previous experiences of this nature didn't seem hopeful that we would be reimbursed. I will remain hopeful. We rented a car for $100 from Avis. 4:00 AM - We arrived at Hotel in San Diego. My parents were to arrive in San Diego today to meet us on the same Air Canada flight 8 pm - 11pm. After our experience yesterday, I was very worried for them. Rightfully so, the flight was cancelled right at 8:00 PM "no pilot". I will never fly this airline again.

### "couldn't get our connection"
Las Vegas to Frankfurt via Toronto in August 2017. Our flight from LAS had a delay of more than 8 hours. But at the check-in we got only the information about a 4 hour delay. We never got information by email or others about the delay or an offer for a better connection. Because of this delay, we couldn't get our connection flight from Toronto to Frankfurt. We got a hotel provided by Air Canada this airline for the time of waiting, but we thought the Holiday Inn in Toronto was very bade. When we finally arrived in Frankfurt, we couldn't reach our booked train.

### "do not compensate for weather"
Vancouver to Victoria. Coming home after a week in Quebec over the holidays and  had an awful experience with Air Canada. After six late flights, an unexpected and uncompensated night spent in Montreal, Air Canada has continued to let my partner and I down. Every one of our connecting flights was late. Our inflight entertainment didn’t work out on our way down, and we were left with an expensive hotel and taxi bill while delayed in Montreal. AC explained that our flight was canceled due to a storm and that they do not compensate for weather related issues. Hoping Air Canada will contact us and try to help, but we will not hold our breath. Thanks for reading and safe travels!

### "Service minimal at most"
Flew Vancouver to Victoria via Calgary. Four flights with Air Canada, 2 on A320's and 2 on Bombardier Dash-8 Q400's. Aircraft clean, all flights fully booked, no spare seats. Boarding efficient by zones. Service minimal at most. Pretzels and beverages offered. Noted soft drink or pop as is referred to being poured from cans into plastic cups. Why not provide cans to customers? Air Canada flight attendants very robotic and impersonal. All flights departed on time. We added an extra bag for $36.75 CAD which we thought was reasonable for an extra 23 kilograms for each of the legs. Would fly Air Canada again.

### "we didn’t make our flight"
Winnipeg to Victoria via Calgary. My partner and I arrived for our flight 50 minutes early, the people in front of us were on the same flight and checked in without error. When it was our turn to check in we were informed that we ‘didn’t make our flight’ (check in closes 45 minutes before flight). We were  charged to switch our flight and won’t be leaving for 7 more hours. We thought maybe it was because security was busy, trying to give the airline the benefit of the doubt. But it wasn’t. It took us less than five minutes to get through security. The staff were rude and unhelpful.

### "need more time to find them"
Calgary to Montreal via Toronto. They lost customer bags on the connecting flight from Calgary to Toronto. We stood around the carousel for 3 hours waiting for our bags to come. and no one had the decency to mention they weren’t coming, there answer was just keep waiting, they are coming. We figured it out on our own that they obviously left them in Toronto. Waiting in the baggage service line for 1hr now (over 30 people in the line). Was told to call first thing the next am around 8am and could likely pick them up first thing in the morning (dec 24) Not sure how you lose over 20 customers bags and have yet to locate one of them? Try to call, Wait on hold for 2 hours to get told, They say they need more time to find them. They offered us $100 each. We got 1 set of clothes each to wear to our family Christmas parties and a few toiletries. They were blaming it on the weather but it was clearly due to there lack of organization. Got to Toronto and sat on the runway for 30 mins waiting for ground crew. When we got on our next plane to go to Montreal it was delayed so we could get on it. They Told everyone onboard it was delayed due to bad weather in Montreal.

### "do not recommend Air Canada"
Vancouver to Montreal on Friday over night. Our plane out of Montreal to Bagotville was canceled due to a storm that did not happen. We were not compensated for a hotel or even taxi to our hotel. The inflight entertainment did not work for me or my partner, although we were flying on a new aircraft. The next day after our expensive unexpected stay in Montreal we finally boarded our plane to Bagotville. We now have been sitting in the small plane for over an hour after our scheduled take off time due to mechanical issues. I do not recommend Air Canada to anyone trying to keep a schedule what so ever.

### "cheap and nasty headsets"
Hong Kong to Vancouver. Our family decided to try out the premium economy service given that it was such a long flight plus the rather lacklustre reviews I have read about Air Canada's economy class comfort and service. As it transpired, it probably wasn't worth the additional expense. The seating was a plus (extra legroom plus a little extra width of seats) and this made the difference b/w no sleep and a little sleep. The first meal - a beef casserole - was very good, and served with metal cutlery etc. The next meal, in contrast, was very ordinary and served with plastic cutlery and I'm very forgiving about airline food generally. The biggest disappointment was the cheap and nasty headsets which meant that it was too unpleasant to watch any movies - the sound quality was that poor. These were flimsy single jack throwaway units used in a conjunction with a double jack fitting in the seat arm (and a loose fit at that). I didn't speak about this with other passengers but noticed that surprisingly few people had their screens turned on during the flight. Note too that I tried several different headsets on several different seats, and they all either failed to work at all or had the same poor sound quality. I've since raised this with Air Canada but their response suggested that this was a one-off equipment failure - it wasn't, those headphones could never provide acceptable sound quality. Appears to be more a case of penny-pinching by management. If they can't afford better then the very least they could do would be to recommend that passengers bring their own headsets.

### "my luggage didn’t make it"
Flew from Adelaide, Australia to Calgary, Canada. No problems with baggage making it on time with me for my first 3 flights. My first Air Canada flight was delayed because of weather, so there would have been plenty of time to load the luggage on while we waited. When I arrived to Vancouver, I had to go quickly to my connecting flight, and so my luggage didn’t make it. When I arrived to Calgary, I was informed the missing luggage would be on the first flight the next day and then would be flown to Lethbridge and driven by courier to my home. Checking the tracking website over the past two days, only one of the bags arrived in Calgary. (They look exactly the same and have the exact same luggage tag and were on the same flight to Vancouver.) The other is yet to be found and the status has not changed in 48 hours. Customer service on the phone continues to ask me to allow more time and not do much to hurry things up. Not impressed.

### "appalling customer service"
On the 19th December I was meant to catch an AC8670 8pm flight from Vancouver to San Diego, my first time flying Air Canada. 20 mins before boarding time, we were told the flight was cancelled because the plane needed to be de-iced and would not make San Diego's 12am curfew. Fine. Then, we were told we had to go out through customs and immigration and go re-book tickets with Air Canada. The lady at the Air Canada desk was extremely rude saying that they weren't re-booking tickets there even though we'd be directed to go there - she provided essentially no customer service. Another thing - some passengers are automatically re-booked onto flights and others aren't which is super inconsistent and something I expect a budget airline to do - I wonder is Air Canada a budget airline or Canada's national carrier? Because it is a total embarrassment of a carrier. Moreover, even though I was re-booked onto a flight the next day at 8pm, I was not given any accommodation vouchers or food vouchers or anything. I received nothing in compensation. I understand the flight was cancelled due to safety reasons, but Air Canada has appalling customer service and I will never fly them again.

### "maybe should charge a train fare"
I booked my flight with Swiss Air Lines. The leg of the trip from Toronto to Geneva is operated by Air Canada and at all times during booking and in all consequtive email confirmations was always positioned as direct. Only at Pearson I knew that my flight is "domestic" and it "stops" at Montreal though it is "indeed direct" flight to Geneva. I asked if we stay on the plane during the stop and we don't - we get off the plane and later board it again. If Air Canada started to turn planes into trains maybe it should charge a train fare. And not letting people know in advance what is that they are paying for in my opinion is a fraud.

### "very polite and helpful"
Philadelphia to Quebec via Montreal. Staff on each leg were very polite and helpful. Seats were average comfort. My issue was cancellation of flight from Philadelphia to Montreal. We got boarding passes in morning and just happened to see an email from AC stating flight next morning was cancelled and they couldn’t get us on another airline. We already had a ride set up and were meeting friends, Hotel was booked. They didn’t pick up the phone to notify us. I called and they said due to weather but they had a flight leaving from Newark. Didn’t make sense They only had one seat on Newark flight. They eventually got us on an American Airlines flight. If it was weather, how could flight from Newark land. Very disappointed.

### "I’ll never fly them again"
Thunder Bay to Windsor via Toronto. Worst service ever, the women behind the desk are miserable in Thunder Bay. I was greeted at 4am with attitude. A rude tone and someone who doesn’t want to be there. Also when I asked why the rates went up suddenly for a bag over the 50lbs. Her response was “I just don’t have a answer for you ok”. Then I arrive in Toronto to find out my flight was cancelled and moved 5 hours later. Without notice and when I asked why the lady behind the desk responded with “weather”. I found it funny how a plane can fly from Toronto to London no problem, but to fly 15 min farther it can’t. It’s a lie. They lie to customers to fill cabins they cancel flights all the time. I can’t think of a time I used Air Canada and was happy. I’ll never fly them again. That’s a promise.

### "Fight attendants were very rude"
Flew Air Canada from Calgary to Toronto. Flight got delayed on the departure by 3 hours, and 1.5 hours on the retun. Fight attendants were very rude, hardly smiled, and I was sitting in an aisle row and I was hit by the service cart numerous times, without a sorry from anyone. The drinks service did not even come with any simple snacks, like the old days, it seems the airline industry becomes cheaper by the day.

### Air Canada customer review
Great service on this Air Canada Express domestic Economy Flex flight, which was on time at both ends. Cabin cleanliness and cabin service were both up to snuff. Prompt drinks service and attendants that made frequent rounds. These smaller Bombardier crafts are only equipped with one bathroom and have smaller overhead bins, but having a tendency to pack light and efficiently, I had a hard time finding fault with the flight equipment. I fly AC always and fly them a several times a year, and I've always been satisfied.

### "The service was terrible"
London to Toronto Pearson. I decided to upgrade to Premium Economy for the extra benefits. I have always travelled Air Transat Club before and thought that this might be the same or better, as it was more expensive. The service was terrible. The flight attendants seem to be in First Class and Economy and the Premium Economy gets no one. We were offered water or juice when we boarded and there was no bar service after take-off. No flight attendants were seen after take-off and close to 2 hours later, the meal came. We were given a glass of wine and refills were not offered. An hour after the meal, we were finally offered a cocktail. This should have been done before the meal service. There was one other pass of the cocktail cart when they passed out a snack before landing. I paid $3,400 return for just a larger seat. No other perks were offered and the crew were not at all pleasant. I even complained to them afterwards and just got a note thanking me for my input. I will never fly Premium Econony again as it is truly a waste of money. I do not even think I will fly Air Canada again as there Customer Service is the worst. Back to Air Transat for me.

### "Thanks for messing my day"
St Johns to Houston via Toronto. My son had a game a game on Saturday December 09/2017. I have promised him that I will leave some work undone and change my flight from Sunday to Friday so that I can make it on his game on Saturday 8:00AM. I have made the change and paid the extra 524.70 $. My flight from St. John’s was delayed one hour. But was still going to make it. I have arrived to Toronto and run from the aircraft all the way to passport control which I have Global entry and that will boost the process faster. While at the passport control I still have 35 minuets and the walk to the gate is on 5 minutes. The passport control did not let me through due to my luggage was loaded off and she told me not to worry, I still have time. She said just go to the helpdesk for Air Canada which was 1 minute away. When I arrived there. I discovered that Air Canada decided to change my flight to next morning and they can’t put luggage on the plane and will not let me leave to Houston without my luggage. I have tried to explain a lot and couldn’t get them to put on that flight or any other flight that could help me to achieve my goal. And funny enough, they have told me that I was paged on my arrival gate to see if I’m going on this flight or not. This is so funny, how the heck I would know that I will be called on my arrival gate, on top of that they should’ve be expecting me running to my departure gate. They have booked me the worst hotel and have told me that I have to go to this hotel without my luggage. Normally for human being, the luggage will be needed at the hotel so that shower can be taken and changing. So they basically they don’t let me go to Houston without my luggage on the flight and would let me go to hotel without it. What make it so funny is that I’m writing this review while waiting on Saturday morning for my flight which have not arrived yet, it’s been 30 minuets already. Thanks Air Canada for messing my day and have me away from my son’s game.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Vancouver to Brisbane. Looking to move from Canada to Australia I was happy to see a direct flight to Brisbane from Air Canada. Value for a roundtrip fare was exceptional, we booked the base economy 'Tango' fare (Y) and we picked up the round trip flight on a seat sale which cost us just under $1,000 each. This included 2 checked bags each, which really helped us as we ended up checking one of our carryon bags as we didn't need it in the cabin with us. Once at the airport, boarding was quick and efficient by the staff on the ground. We boarded and were in the air about 12:20am, 5 minutes ahead of our scheduled takeoff. We were sat in row 31, seats J & K which were exit row seats, a pillow and blanket were provided at each seat. Once the seatbelt sign was turned off meal service and drinks started right away. Options for dinner were Chicken or Beef with vegetables and potatoes. I chose chicken which was average for airplane food (Picture attached). I then browsed the entertainment selection with a post dinner drink. The entertainment had 100's of different films and sitcom option, however none had appealed to me at the time and I was fairly tired so I ended up not watching anything. The best part of the flight was the seat comfort. After dinner I put some earplugs in and went to sleep. I ended up falling asleep for a good 6 hours at which time I woke up and tried the entertainment system again to no avail, at which point I fell back asleep for a few more hours. I did have an exit row which meant I did have extra legroom, however lots of people congregate there to use the washroom that is in the centre row. Even though I had the extra legroom I was not looking forward to the 15 our flight in the middle seat, however in the end I was pleasantly surprised. About 2 hours before landing the crew came around to serve breakfast. The choices were scrambled eggs with salsa or pancakes, I choose the eggs which were not great at all, I would have choose the sweeter option. (There was another service halfway thought the flight for a light snack, however I was asleep for that service). After breakfast the crew quickly cleaned up, I changed and freshened up in the washroom which was fairly standard and had ample space to change. This one was situated in the centre of the cabin however I was told the one up front in premium economy actually had a window in the washroom. A few minutes earlier than expected we had a smooth landing in Brisbane around 9:30 am, where I felt surprisingly fresh after the 15 flight and ready to take on the day.

### "The plane looked new"
Flew Tokyo Narita to Vancouver with Air Canada. Boarding was on time and very smooth. Check in was fast, smooth, and I got the seat I had requested. The plane looked new, was very clean, and crew made sure it stayed clean throughout out the flight. Inflight entertainment was great. Lots of movies and shows to pick from. 2 meals were served on the flight and were quite decent. Best airplane food I have had thus far. I would definitely recommend long haul flights to Asia with Air Canada.

### "staff on board all very nice"
Positifs : Vols à l'heure, sièges confortables (nous avions payé pour avoir des sièges avec plus d'espace pour les jambes), personnel à bord tous très gentils. Négatifs : Les repas en vols étaient plus que médiocres. On nous a servi un bol de nouilles déshydratées avec de l'eau bouillante, un petit sandwich au jambon et deux biscuits secs pour un des repas durant le vol Toronto-Hong Kong. Et au retour, c'était le même menu. Pour le souper, nous avons eu droit à un boeuf tellement gras que ce n'était pas mangeable et comme dessert, un brownies tellement sec que le manche de ma cuillère en plastique a cassé. Pour le vol Toronto-Québec (durée de vol 1 h 40), on ne nous a rien offert à manger. Drôlement différent d'avec Bangkok Airways ou Thai Airways qui nous ont servi des repas délicieux avec des "vrais" ustensiles, et ce, même si les vols ne duraient que 1 h 30. Quand on les compare, c'est assez désolant. - Positives: Flights on time, comfortable seats (we had paid to have seats with more legroom), staff on board all very nice. Negatives: The meals in flights were more than mediocre. We were served a bowl of dehydrated noodles with boiling water, a small ham sandwich and two biscuits for one meal during the Toronto-Hong Kong flight. And on the way back, it was the same menu. For dinner, we had a beef so fat that it was not edible and as a dessert, a brownie so dry that the handle of my plastic spoon broke. For the Toronto-Quebec flight (flight time 1:40), we were not offered anything to eat. Funnily different from Bangkok Airways or Thai Airways who served us delicious meals with "real" utensils, even if the flights lasted only 1:30. When we compare them, it's pretty sad.

### "pathetic ground handling"
Toronto to Washington Dulles operated by Air Georgian. Absolutely pathetic ground handling and gate agents who had no clue about the status of the flights. Gates were changed and we flew to Dulles 4.5 hours delayed with no prior information either at the gate or screen board. All flights around us were being cancelled. Appalling lack of customer service at Air Canada's hub - Toronto Pearson. We landed at Dulles at 1.30am as the last flight into IAD. Will never fly again but wonder what better choices exist on the North American continent.

### "however luggage has not arrived"
Toronto to Medellin via Panama City with last sector by Copa Airlines. Flight originally planned from Toronto to Bogota and Medellin, changed by the airline to itinerary that doesn’t get me to the destination. After long discussions diverted to a flight via Panama City. Business trip however luggage has not arrived (4 days after trip still no known whereabouts). Customer service difficult to reach and frankly useless. Like listening to recorded message. Apparently luggage is still in Toronto, no acceptance of responsibility or offer to solve the issue

### "forced to pay for selecting a seat"
Booked Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver for December. My complaint is the manner in which Air Canada has increased the price of their fares by offering reduced seat fares through travel web sites (e.g. Expedia) only to underhandedly force the purchaser to pay for selecting a seat either before or during check-in and paying for every piece of luggage. This practice is deceiving and dishonest. I have come to appreciate airlines who are forthright in their pricing practices through travel web sites and have flown many that are completely above board. It is unfortunate that we are serviced by so few airlines in Canada that this type of price gouging is allowed to continue. I will take every opportunity to fly another airline including non-domestic airlines other than fly Air Canada or its discount equivalent Rouge.

### "we booked it with a third party"
The plane was super cramped and no food was offered unless you pay for it, including pretzels. Our return flight was a nightmare. We had to change our return date a day early (same flight route). The AC desk at the Portland airport has selective hours and no one there until 2 hours before the first flight out. So we had to wait 1.5 hours for staff to change the flight. The girl arrived and we were first in line (with a huge line up behind us). Staff said we booked it with a third party so we have to go through them to change anything. We asked if there was still room on the flights we were looking to retuning and she said yes. We asked if she could do anything for us, and if there is anything we can do to get on this flight. She said she can't help us and when we exhibited frustration from waiting over an hour and a half in line for a desk agent she said others are waiting too and you are holding them up! After an hour on the phone trying to change our flights, AC wanted $200 per ticket change fee and the price difference between flights which was over $1,400. No one was willing to do anything for us. This was the worst travel experience we've had with an airline. We will never fly this airline again!

### "50% of all flights are delayed"
I have been flying Air Canada Jazz from Portland to Vancouver BC and back for the last 6 years (almost every weekend - except when I fly Alaska instead). I have been trying to fly Alaska more often. My flight is delayed again. Out of all my flights with Air Canada, almost 50% of all flights are delayed. I am wondering why that is. When Alaska has only delayed 10% at most during my 6 years going the same route. I really want Air Canada management to take a hard look at why they cannot be on time more often on the same route that Alaska does. Weather is a problem for all airlines, but it cannot account for a 50% delay record. It is unacceptable for an airline to take passenger's money and not try their best to fulfill their end of the bargain.

### "very good experience"
Vancouver - London Heathrow return. Nov 1-13, 2017. Overall, very good experience. Online check-in easy and quick with very easy printing of boarding passes and luggage tags at the airport kiosks. Ground staff professional. The zone boarding process can be confusing as, even though specific zones are called, passengers from other zones tend to get into line prior to being called. Ground staff don't seem to manage this boarding process well and this is not the first trip where I've encountered this issue. Planes were clean and well kept. Onboard staff were professional and efficient. Meals were tasty, which was a vast improvement over my last international trip with AC. Vancouver - London Heathrow included 1 hot meal and a very small breakfast - a slice of gingerbread and a small yogurt. This is not sufficient for a flight almost 10 hours long. London Heathrow - Vancouver included a hot meal, mid flight snack and then a hot fajita about 1.5 hours prior to landing. Frequent drink runs both flights. Overall, onboard service was efficient and well done, but not outstanding. Seats are reasonable but not overly comfortable. Onboard entertainment system worked very well both flights and there was a good variety of TV, movies and music. The only negative comment would be that AC charges for advance seat selection on Tango fares, fares are high enough without adding this extra fee. Will continue to fly Air Canada and recommend this airline.

### "space is extremely cramped"
Flew Philadelphia to Toronto. I would like to begin by pointing out that at the Philadelphia International airport checking for this flight was done by United airlines personnel. Up to this point I have refrained from commenting about United based on the negative press however after experiencing the checking I have to agree with everything that is being reported. The United personnel at Philadelphia Airport were extremely rude. I am a crew member for a cruise line and normally I ask to have my bags tagged "priority", that way they arrive at the final destination, other airlines usually have no problem doing this however the United person at the counter said to me "No". At one point during the conversation I had to ask if she was having a good day and then that sort of made her realize how nasty she was being. As far as the flight I do have to say that we were up in the air for about an hour and there’s really not much to comment other than the fact that I paid for the preferred seating and there is not much difference between that and regular seat. The space is extremely cramped as you will see in the photo I have attached. The flight attendants however were very nice, the plane was clean and the flight went on without any incident. I would definitely recommend this airline but please be aware that the check-in could be done by United and that could ruin your first impression.

### "They still have room for improvement"
Flew Toronto to Copenhagen. On this international flight and first time with Air Canada I have to mention that I am very impressed with the friendliness of the aircrew in general. The aircraft was beautiful and clean however I paid for extra legroom and I found myself next to an emergency door which I had no problem staying on however the seats did not have a movable armrest. I had a row of two for myself but I was not able to move the armrest because it was stationary. The seat also felt kind of narrow. I was served a hot meal, two snacks, plenty of drinks (alcohol beverages included) and a light breakfast. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment selection was mediocre with only a handful of movies and TV shows. I am a big fan of the Boeing 777 because it is spacious, relatively quiet and depending on the airline the amenities can be quite good. Overall I would definitely fly Air Canada again because they were friendly, I felt safe, and they got me to my destination on time. They still have room for improvement when it comes to the entertainment offerings, the comfort of the seat, and please do not have United personnel do your checking at the airport it ruins the first impression.

### "An uneventful flight"
AC 7711, YYZ-IAH, seat 2A. An uneventful flight which in itself makes it a great flight. I precleared US Customs in Toronto which meant that I could just walk straight out of the aircraft and hop into my car without further delay. The service was quite good and the food was also very enjoyable given that it was an actual hot meal. The IFE system had monitors in the seatbacks which made it easy and functional. Overall a very pleasant experience.

### "poorly trained check-in supervisors"
Brisbane to San Francisco via Vancouver. What an atrocious check-in experience traveling to the US. Stay away unless you're on a visa waiver, visa, permanent resident or US citizen. The check-in supervisors have zero idea how to deal with anything else and are a combination of poorly trained, arrogant, aggressive and power tripping. Two supervisors were involved and they were both the same. They don't know that other forms of US travel authority exist (a US Advance Parole combo card in this case). They had no idea how to type the Advance Parole combo card into their computer, so just wildly guessed, with one attempt before giving up. The computer then said I wasn't cleared to fly, because they'd typed in garbage data, which they insisted was what was going to happen "because we don't have the authority to override the system". Instead of just saying "I'm not sure how to process this card, let me call someone who can help me" their *first* opening approach is to say "we have to offload you because you don't have a visa or permanent resident card and that's what our systems require". No attempt to solve the problem and understand. Utter aggressive refusal to let me explain what an Advance Parole card is and that I am indeed allowed to fly to the US, you just have to call someone who knows what this card is. Literally I was trying to show them my phone and get them to read a paragraph from a US government website explaining what an Advance Parole combo card was and that it grants travel authority. They refused to read it - "I don't care what that says because we have to do what the computer says and it says to offload you". No matter that the computer only said that because they didn't know how to type this card in! Finally they call US immigration, after about 20 minutes of telling me they are going to offload me and aggression. They keep calling the combo card an "Employment Authorization Document". It has that in big print along the top, and the Advance Parole part in little print along the bottom. I keep trying to explain that it's a 2-in-1 combo card and to read the sentence on the bottom when talking to US immigration. We know what to say". US Immigration answers, they refuse to read the bottom of the card, calling it an Employment Authorization Document and looking at me smugly. After many minutes on the phone the person on the other end finally asks them what is on the bottom of the card and they read it out with a grimace. About 30 minutes in after countless threats of offloading and one threat of calling airport police "because we don't like you" I am cleared to fly. They don't say a word to me, refuse to look at me. Just pass my passport to a check-in counter worker and say "he's cleared to fly". The in-flight experience was great, a near new Boeing 787. It was all destroyed by those power tripping poorly trained check-in supervisors who shouldn't be anywhere near a customer facing role.

### "abhorrent customer service"
Vancouver to Baltimore via Toronto, and my bag went missing. I transferred planes in Toronto. I left Vancouver Oct. 3rd. My bag never showed up in Baltimore. I immediately placed a baggage claim report with an Air Canada representative at the airport (which took over an hour as their were no representatives at the kiosk and no one picked up when I called repeatedly; I had to call the 1-800 customer service hotline to get them to contact a representative at the airport). I was told they'd send my bag through to my hotel where I was staying for work for a week. My bag never turned up; I called and emailed multiple times daily to no avail. I had to purchase all new work clothing, shoes, toiletries etc. It is now more than a month later and I have home in Vancouver. Since then I've travelled on several flights for work and have several more this year. I still do not have an answer from air Canada. It has been like pulling teeth trying to get ahold of anyone that could help. My baggage number is still under "locating" and I have filed claims for "delayed" baggage as you cannot file "lost" status until they tell you it cannot be found. I filled my "delayed" claims the day I arrived home to Vancouver Oct 10th. I have made numerous calls, Facebook posts, instagram posts, twitter posts, and emails to customer service, baggage claims, and whoever else I could find to contact. And I still have ZERO answers on where my bag is, if it will be found, if I will be reimbursed. Or if I will even be reimbursed for the $50 I paid to check the luggage (the money I paid to have someone lose my bag). I have been clear that I understand mistakes happen and it is not the loss of property that has me truly disgruntled (although this is a nightmare when on a business trip). In fact it is the lack of communication and the abhorrent customer service that has left me shocked and upset.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Dallas to Toronto with Air Canada and onward to Vienna with Austrian Airlines. My flight was canceled and it took 7 hours on the phone to rebook my flights. The customer service was very hard to reach and I was on hold for a very long time before I got someone to talk to, and after. I would not recommend this airline.

### "staff are incapable"
I travel globally at least once a month. I have never experienced this bad service from any airline. Firstly I could not check on online. When I tried to check in at the airport, they did not understand that I am a European resident, with a valid blue card. Took 45 minutes to sort out. Never happened before in my tavels. I felt Air Canada staff were confused as I have a South African passport. Then worst yet, the boarding of the plane! Have never seen anything worse! The zones dont work, people are agressive. The staff are incapable. Really this airline is the worst ever. Avoid!

### "have staff who don’t know the rules"
Booked to fly Madrid to San Francisco via Toronto. Unless you are an American, European or Canadian do yourself a favor and do not fly Air Canada. They have staff who don’t know the rules and would do everything possible to disrupt your journey. I had a valid ETA to fly through Canada to go to US (final destination) but the staff in Madrid had no idea how the visa works and their solution was to tell me to go to a Canadian consulate because I made the mistake of flying Air Canada.

### "tickets any good to change dates"
Toronto to Ft Lauderdale. Because of a health emergency we had to fly back earlier. Called Air Canada if our return tickets were any good to change dates and was told no. Asked what will it cost us to fly back with the first available flight. She said the evening flight was available and one way ticket for two  will cost us $1250 from Ft.Lauderdale to Toronto. I called AA for a Miami to Toronto one way, economy one way $144/person business class $350/person. Purchased 2 business class tickets flew back that evening with a superb service, neat & clean aircraft. I don't know how many times we have taken AC flights where not once we flew with a relaxed or uninterrupted journey. I think this price gauging might be the last time for us to take AC flights to the US where AA will take us.

### "staff were fantastic"
I was on Air Canada flight 846, Toronto to Munich on Monday October 23. The flight was smooth as can be and the flight staff were fantastic. Very polite and also helpful. Crew leader was so much fun to talk and the crew made the long flight delightful.

### "No one apologized to us"
Ottawa to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. Our flight to Amsterdam was supposed to be via Toronto with the total trip duration of fewer than 11 hours but we ended up with a 22 hours trip. There was about a 3-hour delay in our first flight segment from Ottawa to Toronto, and unfortunately, they could not manage to put some passengers on the two other flights departing in the period of delay. Therefore since our connection time at Toronto airport was 2 hours, we missed our flight from Toronto to Amsterdam and we were offered an alternate route to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. The staff at the airport were rude  in providing a concrete solution and were very reluctant to respond us. The customer service is all about their priority rather than customers' problems. During the first part of the flight, the service and food were terrible. We only had one option and that was a vegetarian meal, when I politely asked for another option, the crew rudely emphasized that that is all we have. One of our baggage was missed when we arrived Amsterdam and later on they sent it to us. No one from Air Canada apologized to us or provided us any compensation.

### "refused to fulfill the refund"
Airline cancelled the flight from Toronto to Victoria. Was suppose to land at 10:30am however was redirected through Calgary, and didn't arrive until 5:30pm. Air Canada took no accountability and refused to fulfill the refund that was communicated to me from the ticket agent who was rebooking the flight. For the flights there were no meals offered. On the way back from Vancouver to Ottawa (6 hour flight) no food was offered.

### "Not impressed at this action"
Toronto to Vancouver. On our anniversary trip to Hawaii booked back in January. My husband I were supposed to sit beside each other middle and isle. Which by the way I confirmed two weeks earlier. Well we end up sitting one in front of the other. No one said anything until we looked at our ticket. Not to mention we got checked in at the premium/business class desk. Not impressed at this action by Air Canada. Waist of my time and money. Thanks for ruining a part of our anniversary trip.

### "I was left stranded"
Windsor to Montreal via Toronto. When I checked in online, I noticed there were only a few people on the flight. Surprisingly enough, about 7 hours before the flight I looked up the flight status to learn that my flight was canceled. When I called Air Canada and asked the reason for the cancellation they claimed "Air Traffic Congestion in Toronto" and said they didn't want to operate the flight with a delay. The agent then tried to charge me $14 to choose my seat on the rebooked itinerary. I was left stranded with no compensation until the next flight the following day.

### "We tried to file a complaint"
Charlotte to Gander via Toronto. I am one of 6 in our group that have the same complaints. In Charlotte, Air Canada charged us an antler/horn fee of $150 instead of a $50 firearms fee when we checked our guns for a Moose hunting trip to Newfoundland. They tried to tell us since we had rifles that we had to pay an antler/horn fee because they were hunting equipment and they no longer fall in the firearm category. We even got a TSA agent to try help us talk sense into the girls at the bag check but they wouldn't listen. Then we were told our luggage would go direct to Gander but we had to check guns in Toronto thru customs. Every person that we talked to employed by Air Canada gave us a different story concerning our guns and our luggage. In Toronto instead of bringing the guns out to us for an ID check we found them in the baggage claim area that anyone could have picked them up. Then in Toronto customs we saw all our luggage stacked in the corner that we were told would go straight to Gander. Also Toronto customs only had 2 people working the 15 check stations and 40 people were lined up for connecting flights and we barely made ours. We checked our luggage and guns again but when we got to Gander all 9 bags including our guns were lost. We missed a full day of a $4300 hunt waiting on luggage and guns. They didn't make it to the airport until the next evening. Then on the return trip home to Charlotte we were charged the correct firearm fee but we watched a girl throw our gun case on the carousel in Charlotte. Hard enough it hit and bounced almost off and another passenger caught it and placed it back on the carousel. These are very expensive guns and scopes. Also she did not bring the guns to us and check our ID to release them to us as she was supposed to. Anyone could have taken them again. We tried to file a complaint at the airport and talked to her supervisor and he said he would reprimand her as that was uncalled for but that we would have to file an online complaint. Also a brand new luggage bag came back with the handle ripped off. And the flight from Toronto to Charlotte had a problem with the fan that pressurizes the cabin so it was so hot on the plane you couldn't breath. It did get better as we flew but the pilot had to fly at a low altitude according to the flight attendants because of the cabin pressure issue. With the treatment we received from start to finish I wonder how an airlines could exist like this.

### "Very nice flight, as usual"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Ottawa. Very nice flight, as usual. Bulkhead seats with limited space as usual but still OK. Staff are friendly with a nice attitude. Still surprising that passengers are accepted with baggage that are almost too big to be checked, particularly inside a cabin with limited storage space. Short flight but nice and smooth.

### "disorganization in regards to baggage"
Vancouver to Victoria. I feel the need to leave a comment here in regards to the disorganization that Air Canada has in regards to baggage. I was delayed and missed our connecting flight home due to customs. I had asked every attendant or working persons that we had dealings with about whether I needed to get my luggage and everyone stressed due not worry about it. And like many would be, I was. I work hard for a living to have nice things, some of those of which I had brought on our trip. There is no system in place and the bag never made it back home. I have been calling into what seems to be a secondary bag check line with zero information as to where it is. I am being told it is still in tracking mode. How is there not a better system with bag tags.

### "Everything was okay except the food"
Frankfurt to Ottawa (after flying Lufthansa from Amsterdam to Frankfurt). I have flown this route many times via London but this time Air Canada only gave the option to transit in Frankfurt. Originally I had a good two-hour and a half transit time in Frankfurt but because the Lufthansa plane got delayed in Amsterdam the transit time got less and so I had to kinda rush to get to the gate. Going back to my flight experience, it didn't differ much from my previous ones. Everything was just okay except the food which is always below standards. The Boeing 767-300ER is an excellent plane, however it does feel a bit like it has done its time and I wonder when Air Canada will replace it with the 787 on the Ottawa-Europe routes.

### "Very basic needs met"
Ottawa to Vancouver. Very basic needs met however the airline doesn't care about customer service or high quality service. Very limited leg room and additional legroom costs $40. I was placed on a different flight after having paid for preferred seating on my initial flight due to my knee issues, but after they changed my flight without my consent, they put me in regular seating. Only pop/water available. Everything else is buy onboard on domestic flights.

### "all quite excellent"
After reading some AC reviews I was doubting our decision to fly AC SFO-FLR via Montreal but they were both great flights. We were traveling on award tix. Focusing on the business segment Montreal to Florence, the seats, bedding, meals, and service were all quite excellent. Crew were competent and friendly; the seats and lie-flat beds comfortable. Our seats across from each other didn't allow for a lot of discourse - I had the left side "single-ish" seat and my husband was center seat oriented toward right side, but as a night flight it worked for us. Were we able to select our own seats we would have taken center-right or one in front of the other.

### "flight was 4 hours delayed"
Toronto to Montreal. My flight was 4 hours delayed, I understand weather plays a factor but there were no updates on the situation, several gate changes and the rudest customer service agent I have encountered at the airport. This was a horrible experience made worse by your staff and I will never fly this airline again.

### "seats are so uncomfortable"
Toronto to Delhi. I flew the Boeing 787-9 on a long 14 hour flight to Delhi. This aircraft is not suitable for long flights. Seat pitch and seats are so uncomfortable that you can barely sleep during flight. Aisles are so narrow that you get bumped by passengers moving back and forth. Service was okay and lack any surprise.

### "you have a very special pilot"
Toronto to Ottawa. The Pilot was flying out to Ottawa and overheard my conversation and distress of having to get to Ottawa General as my husband was in a coma. I was not sure where to go or how to get there and was worried about how long it would take till I was by my husbands side. This pilot came over to me and offered to bring me to the hospital once he landed the plane as he finished his shift and was going home as he lived in Ottawa. I want say thank you as I was overwhelmed and it took some ease and stress off me from the flight knowing I would not have to worry how I would get to the hospital after the flight. He was very humble and offered me assistance if I need anything while I was in Ottawa. I thanked him for his gracious act of kindness and want to ensure that he gets recognized for doing such a good deed. Air Canada you have a very special pilot. Thank you so much.

### "A great round trip"
Indianapolis to Shanghai return via Toronto/Montreal. A great round trip with Air Canada. This was the first time I flew their Montreal to Shanghai route on the Boeing 787. Exceptional service on their international service. I also had a chance to fly Canadian domestic on the YYZ->YUL leg. Even though the flight was short, the flight attendants did their best to distribute snacks/drinks in a short timeframe to a plane of 150 people. The transborder flights operated by Georgian airways were also good. The entertainment system worked without flaw and the seats were comfortable. No delays in any flights.

### "all-round great experience"
Frankfurt to Montreal. Skipped the check-in as I was connecting from Johannesburg and headed straight to the Maple Leaf Lounge. The lounge was great with a wide array of breakfast foods and beverages. The shower facilities were also very good. The flight boarded in an orderly fashion and on board the hard product was terrific offering a very comfortable environment. The FA's were friendly but cordial. The food and beverages were of high quality and there was plenty of choice. The IFE had a good selection of movies and TV programs but the music selection seemed rather abstract. Toilets were kept spotless throughout the journey. The flight departed and landed on time. It was an all-round great experience.

### "a pleasant experience"
Short hop from Chicago to Toronto on evening flight AC514. Flight left slightly late due to delays with baggage loading as it was raining heavily in Chicago. Nonetheless, the flight arrived Toronto on time. Check in was slower since there were only two agents at the counter with several passengers in line. Yet, the staff was courteous and was very welcoming. We were eligible for TSA PreCheck so we breezed through security with ease. Cabin crew were present for the duration of the flight with the captain giving updates while waiting on ground in Chicago and upon arrival in Toronto. Drinks were served with refills offered twice through. Custom forms handed out during descent. Quick taxi to the gate upon landing and we were quick to deplane. Bags arrived swiftly and we were out of the airport within 15 minutes of clearing immigration at Pearson. Overall, a pleasant experience and I would use them again on short hops.

### "delayed more than 2 hours"
Toronto to Seoul Incheon return, both flights were delayed more than 2 hours. Because of the delay, we missed our flight to Denpasar and wasted 24 hours at a dingy hotel. Money paid for the resort in Bali was down the drain that Air Canada would not compensate at all. On top of that, disgusting food, unhelpful attendants - 1.5 hour wait for baggage to come out.

### "this is obviously an airline trying to cut costs"
Flew Air Canada. Plane was great, some cabin staff were good and then it went downhill from there. Lounges in Canada were very poor. Staff were generally OK but this is obviously an airline trying to cut costs. Even flying business they wanted to charge me another $500 to bring a flight forward 2 days. I have never been treated wirh such contempt. Flying overnight from Vancouver to Brisbane they don't even have showers at the lounge. Never, ever had this before.

### "like flying with a different airline"
Toronto to Boston return on a miles flight. Easy bag drop and security thanks to my partner being 35k elite. Pre clearance is way better since the re-configuration (well done Pearson) and I was in the lounge on a guest pass within 30 mins of entering the airport. Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network. The flight was fine with the usual beverage service and an on time arrival in Toronto. In the race for maximising profit and cheesing off customers - Air Canada wins first prize. We were 5 mins late for bags - sure. But the officiousness of the check in supervisor and the stinging us financially shows just how little Air Canada cares about good and honest customer service / experience.

### "service is extremely poor"
I flew from Toronto to Atlanta on Air Canada. The additional charge for checking luggage is unfair. The service on the flight is extremely poor, no food, no snacks and no proper drinks. Lack of customer service and care from the staff. For example when asking for water you get around 50 ML. I would only fly Air Canada if it is the only option, do not recommend this airline.

### "so disappointed in the treatment I received"
Flew St. John's to Las Vega via Toronto with Air Canada. I am so disappointed in the treatment I received during boarding at the beginning of my vacation today. It really put a sour start to my vacation. There was no room for my carry on luggage because people had bags and coats overhead. I was forced to check my carry on and I had to transfer my things such as medical items and other expensive things into a garbage bag that I had to ask for instead of being offered. During this, the flight attendants threatened to put us on later flight! Never even said sorry! I strongly believe they could have improved the situation by simply checking the overhead storage for small bags and coats and asking others to put it under their seats. They also could have been a little patient. I am currently dragging heavy garbage bags around the airport. They definitely could work on their manners and attitude.

### "have not experienced such poor service"
Flew Toronto to Philadelphia. In my entire life I have not experienced such poor service. Shame on you Air Canada. As I reached the airport, the Air Canada queue was so long, almost 200m or longer. Only 3-4 counters were open and service was so poor. Counter staff were so slow and busy chatting. I cannot understand simple logic why can't Air Canada open more counters. Due to this delay, I almost missed my flight since the US immigration further delayed the entire process. As I reached Philadelphia, my luggage did not arrive on time and Air Canada did not have the courtesy to inform me what is happening. What is so difficult in tracing the luggage? I will try not to use Air Canada in the future.

### "friendly and attentive cabin staff"
Seats and seat space quite narrow (although I am slim and have an average height) - typical for a Boeing. (I got the impression that Airbus seats are a bit broader, and there is less noise form the turbines.) Choices of the inflight entertainment program not really sumptuous, but still okay. Very friendly and attentive cabin staff: very frequent offerings of beverages, also frequent collection of garbage. Extremely calm flight. Would definitely recommend Air Canada for long-distance flights from Europe to North America and back.

### "customer service was terrible"
St. Johns to Sarnia via Toronto. The flight and at the terminal were great but the customer service was terrible. Originally there was supposed to be a hour overlay between my flights. When I landed they told me my flight was cancelled and that is was rebooked for the next morning. The email did not tell me why it was cancelled and I asked the customer service why and they could not tell and me and to just get a hotel room and submit the bill online to be reimbursed for the expenses. Submit it and they tell me it is not covered because the flight was cancelled due to weather. I understand it is not covered because it says it on their site but why would they not tell me this before I went to the hotel? Now I am out the $180 for the hotel and $200 on the flight that could have cancelled and got a rental car that would have costed me $60 instead because that customer service rep and the airport didn't tell me why it was cancelled.

### "On board the aircraft looked tired"
Montreal to St. John's on Embraer 175. Check in was quick and hassle free. The agent was warm and polite and efficiently processed our check in. Used the domestic Maple Leaf Lounge which is in dire need of a facelift. Good food and beverage options but pizza was cold. On board the aircraft looked tired. My wife's IFE screen did not work as the tactile function had to be recalibrated. This resulted in no IFE for her for the entire flight. Similarly, my son's headphone jack was broken and my screen had multiple scratches all over it. The FA's bordered on surly and went about their duties as if they were doing us a favour. Toilet in the economy section was smelly and its appearance gave no confidence over its hygienic qualities. Flight departed and arrived on time and it will go down in my flight history as another basic, no frills and no customer focused Air Canada flight.

### "7 hour overall delay"
Ottawa to Kelowna via Toronto. A 7 hour overall delay to destination due to mechanical issues. Multiple gate changes, some of them not broadcasted. 1 hour wait on hold to customer service. Multiple issues in Toronto including taxi out and back for a check. This the last of a list of bad experiences.

### "We were definitely ripped off by Air Canada"
We paid the extra $400 for premium economy looking forward to a relaxing flight from Toronto to Heathrow, July 31 for our daughter's wedding. The last row of our 2 seats did not recline very much at all. Not all seats in this cabin are created equal. Air Canada did not tell us this about this configuration. Our overnight flight was one of the worst we encountered. The 2 seats in front reclined right to our chests. The people in front were reclined and legs were fully stretched and they slept the whole flight We struggled with the reclined seats at our chest and struggled to get comfortable, I had difficulty getting in and out. I am a fairly fit person who had to throw my legs over the arm rest to stand up due to the seat in front reclined into my chest. Our legs were cramped. I traded seats with my daughter a few times. She was in the economy bulkhead seat right behind us. It had more space overall than our $400 seat. We were definitely ripped off by Air Canada. They should refund us the money. We contacted customer care and they offered us $100 towards a next flight.

### "delayed or cancelled"
Montreal to Chicago. I've flown Air Canada numerous times and had flights delayed or cancelled every single time. Our flight last Friday was delayed two hours, now our return flight is delayed two hours again (at least). I'll never be flying Air Canada again and I'd suggest no one else fly them either.

### "new pathway thru customs"
La Guardia to Halifax via Montreal. Thank you Air Canada for instituting this new (since November) pathway thru customs in Montreal to connecting flights! Now I did not have to wait on a long line at customs with all other passengers arriving in Montreal from NY, but was directed to a separate area for customs for connecting flights only, (brilliant), and when I exited customs I was in the gate area for my connecting flight - without having to go thru security again - brilliant. This saves so much time when one may have only a minimal amount of time to make a connecting flight, especially given regular delays! It is so much better, and truly customer-centred. But can you institute this at Toronto airport, too? And also can u make it happen in the reverse direction in Montreal?

### "we were put on standby"
We booked our tickets in Ireland in March 2017 for a flight from Toronto to Calgary. 2 tickets One Way, costing $818 Cad plus $75Cad for bags at airport. We were stunned when we checked in at the desk on 29th August 2017 that we were put on standby. No Explanation was given. We went to the Gate D 28 and spoke again with a Air Canada person at the desk. She said something about the flight being overbooked. She was not in anyway helpful. Many of the people we spoke to queuing for the flight had only recently , and we booked 5 months in Advance. To say that we were distressed and upset would be to put it mildly. We did get on the flight. Never ever again consider travelling with Air Canada. We are frequent travelers and never had an experience like this.

### "Frustratingly poor service"
Frustratingly poor service from Air Canada. No functioning entertainment system or maps for most of our long haul flight from Calgary to London. Despite making a big show of wanting to compensate us all for it, they're refusing to offer anything other than a small discount on another Air Canada flight. Being pregnant, I have no chance of using it - and despite explaining this, they're not interested in any other way of recognising the problem.

### "not one flight on time"
Toronto to Chicago. I fly on Air Canada two to three times per month, mostly to Chicago but also domestically and internationally. It is now the end of August and not one flight in 2017 has been on time. There are not always reasons given, but the result is always the same. Not only has this negatively impacted my business, it has also affected the impression that others have of me. Lateness has become an acceptable trend with this airline. Flights later in the afternoon and evening have no chance of being on time due to delays earlier in the day. As I sit in my seat trying to deal with the implications of being late once again, I am forced to listen to the cabin crew tell me that are the best airline in North America. I have now booked my first flight in 2017 with another airline and will be doing so whenever possible in the future.

### "would and will fly again"
Most are accustomed to seeing very negative reviews of Air Canada, but this review is for a flight almost boringly smooth. I fly Air Canada a lot and I've never had an issue. This time was on a red eye from Toronto to Calgary. The flight was on time. It was a rebooked flight and I was given complimentary preferred seats. We landed in Calgary ahead of schedule. The entertainment system had some issues but the 320s are older members of the AC fleet and will be replaced by the new Bombardier C Series soon (looking forward to that). Cabin crew was attentive and gave me extras of things. Would and will fly again.

### "staff friendly and courteous"
This flight from Sydney (Canada) to Toronto was delayed by several hours due to a mechanical issue. Another plane was flown in and the replacement flight was boarded quickly and underway immediately. Air Canada airport staff was friendly and courteous. We were given meal vouchers and a discount code for a future flight. The plane itself was clean and the flight smooth. No complaints - better safe than sorry when it comes to plane issues (not to mention legally mandated), and they handled it very well.

### "an efficient and friendly cabin crew"
We were placed on this flight from Ottawa to Halifax after our initial connection was cancelled. We were given meal vouchers for lunch, and this replacement flight left fairly much on time and went without a hitch. A short flight in the small Bombardier, served by an efficient and friendly cabin crew. No issues, would fly again.

### "know your service and product"
Air Canada Express operated by Jazz from Billy Bishop Airport to Montreal return. Easy check in, on time departure which was good given the flight was full. The route has recently switched from Sky Regional to Jazz though the product is the same - snacks and a full bar. Excellent crew - really funny, engaging and gave me a double with a smile. Excellent landing, good PAs from the flight deck and an on time arrival at the gate in Montreal. Return was different in the sense that the crew were just about friendly and no announcements from the flight deck throughout. Confused service as the Purser initially tried charging for drinks - know your service and product! Full flight again and an on time departure but unusually bad landing into Toronto City. Toronto City to Montreal with AC Regional remains my favourite service within Canada. If only Air Canada would up the coach inflight service on other domestic flights rather than continue to cut costs and race to low cost carrier status.

### "shambles of an airline"
What an absolute shambles of an airline, will never fly with these again. Flight from Bogota was delayed by 3 hours which meant I missed my connecting flight from Toronto to London. Landed in Toronto at 12am and was given a new flight 24 hours later. This wasn't good enough as i had to get another flight in England, so I went to customer service and was told I would most likely get on the 9am flight as a standby passenger. Turned up at the airport at 5am after 2 hours sleep and checked in, when I got to the gate for boarding the flight was apparently full. Went back to customer service and they told me the next available flight was the one they had given me in the first place. I went online to the Air Canada website and searched earlier flights and there was one 5 hours earlier that they were still selling tickets for. I queried this with customer services advisor and he said it was overbooked by 16 seats, yet they were still selling tickets for $5000 online? He told me that I could book a ticket online if I wanted to pay that much but he couldn't put me on that flight. It's ok though because they gave me a $15 meal voucher to apologise for my 15 hour wait in the airport. What an absolute joke. Best part of the journey was the hotel I was put up in, despite only being in there for 3 hours.

### "caused us to miss our connecting flight"
Our flight from Seattle to Toronto via Vancouver was delayed for nearly an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flight even though we were assured by Air Canada representatives that they would wait. We were then given 15$ food vouchers and standby tickets for the next flight (an hour later). That flight was full and the next flight was at 22.30. A delay of around 7 hours since our original was to leave at 4.15. We asked Air Canada representatives for compensation and they gave us a measly 10$ food voucher which isn't even enough for a sandwich at this airport. When 22.30 finally arrived we were stuffed in economy class on a full flight and upon arrival were informed that our baggage was not to arrive until 8.30 the next day! So we left the airport 7 hours late with no baggage. And for having missed the birth of our cousin we get 25$ in food vouchers. To make matters worse, we missed the pre-arranged transportation we had booked and didn't receive any vouchers for this 154$ trip.

### "had an awful experience"
Milan to Toronto. We had an awful experience with the check-in at Milan,  he had an arrogant attitude towards my husband. When weighing our luggage, mine was 20kg and my husband’s was 26 kg, as limit per person is 23kg, normally in those cases they have told us is ok and there is no overweight. After doing the long line to pay the extra 3 kilos, they told my husband he could have put the 3kg in my luggage, solution that was not given to us in that moment. We went back and my husband told the guy he could be nicer and also could have told us about the 3 kilos change of luggage, I was going to speak and he said ok if you continue complaining I cancel your flight and call the police. Arrogance and threatening are not what you expect in these cases. When telling other staff members, they said you can go and complain on the web page but refused to give me the name.

### "cancelled due to weather"
Houston to Calgary. Our flight was cancelled due to weather conditions caused by hurricane Harvey. Air Canada cancelled their flights too early when weather conditions were barely a slight drizzle. Ticket counter was very unhelpful and gave no guidance for all passengers. Makes it difficult to be proud of our national carrier. A legitimate explanation would be great.

### "failed to provide wheelchairs"
Saskatoon to Toronto. If you are in Canada and want to fly, you lack options! Only Air Canada and WestJet. I flew to India in April and May this year. While coming back to Canada I had my parents with me and because of their old age and my father's nerve problem in his feet, I asked for a wheelchair facility for both. They failed to provide wheelchairs both in Delhi and in Toronto. I filed a complain and after that they gave me a CAD 400 discount on my next booking. So, I booked flights for three of us to go to Toronto (return ticket). Don't take me wrong. Air Canada on international routes is pretty good. The crew are helpful and food is good. Good entertainment options! Legroom is small but its economy! However, their domestic route flights are the worst I have seen. No food or drinks offered on long haul flights (Saskatoon-Toronto takes 3.5 hours). Legroom small. Sometimes no entertainment system (Saskatoon-Vancouver/Calgary routes). They need to be more friendly towards customer. Offer more options inflight.

### "cabin staff was very pleasant "
Calgary to Ottawa. A slightly delayed flight was thoroughly explained over the PA twice and the cabin staff was very pleasant in their service, getting the drinks going right away and answering my 'call flight attendant' ring within seconds. Economy seats were obviously not the most comfortable but of course they're not designed by the airline, so it's not quite relevant to reviewing Air Canada. Smooth flight overall - have never had an issue with them on countless flights over many years.

### "cabin staff were professional"
I was looking forward to this trip from Los Angeles to Taipei via Vancouver. The flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver was on a newer A330. Each seat had its own personal entertainment system, and meal service included dinner and light snacks. The flight to Taipei did not depart until the next morning so I spent the night at a hotel close to Vancouver Airport (Pacific Gateway which also has a free shuttle between the airport and hotel). The flight from Vancouver to Taipei was on a Boeing 787, seat configuration was 3-3-3. Sat in economy. Unfortunately the room between my seat and the row ahead was very limited. I'm 5 foot 10 inches (about 170 cm) and even without the seat in front of me not reclining, my knees was making contact with the seat back pocket and it contents. Needless to say this made for a very uncomfortable 12 hour flight. The cabin could've used a deep cleaning as I was siting by the window and noticed all the dust bunnies clumped up on the side vents above me. The cabin staff were professional and could not be faulted. On the return flight I paid extra to sit in the bulkhead section (Approximately $60 Canadian). This made all the difference in terms of seat comfort. The cabin staff were also professional. All cabin announcements were made in 3 languages: English, French, and Chinese-Mandarin. At Vancouver Airport, all US bound passengers go through US customs and immigration checks inside Vancouver Airport--so when the flight arrives stateside, I was able to pick up my luggage in domestic arrivals which was a plus. The final leg from Vancouver to Los Angeles was operated by United. Anyone who has flown Eva Air to Taiwan might not be impressed with the Air Canada flight experience, but the price was very competitive when compared to the other airlines that fly between Los Angeles and Taiwan. I would consider flying with Air Canada in the future.

### "airline just handled everything very poorly"
Had a horrible experience with Air Canada (and unfortunately not the first). Upon check-in, the lady at the counter informed me the flight was departing on time as scheduled. Thirty minutes later, the first first delay alerts started to come in. Initially, it was a three hour delay, that became 5hr 15min, eventually it settled at a delay of 4hr and 45 minutes. There was no explanation at all given as to the delay, just told to sit and wait. Time went by, and at around 11pm, the airline's lounge started to broadcast that they were closing. With this flight and several other flights of Air Canada delayed by several hours (one delayed by 6 hours), you would think the airline had the courtesy of keeping the lounge open longer in these exceptional circumstances to accommodate the premium passengers and frequent fliers. Finally, it was time to board, and the boarding area was already full of passengers impatient to board the long-delayed flight. Suddenly, the ground staff came on the intercom and announced that the flight would be "delayed" until late afternoon of the next day, a "delay" of 21hrs. People were obviously very upset and there was chaos. The ground staff tried their best to calm nerves and frustrations, but the worst was the lack of news, lack of updates and lack of announcements what passengers were entitled to during the flight waiting period. As for the cancellation, they announced that they are not in a position to book hotels for people (not even to offer discount vouchers), so hundreds of people had to go off on their own at 1am! Really unfortunate turn of events (not even sure what happened), but the airline just handled everything very poorly with lack of information and lack of compensation or regard for the wellbeing of passengers.

### "Absolutely horrible customer service"
My partner and I were returning from a trip from Asia, a 15 hour flight. We were to get a connecting flight in EWR with Air Canada and return to YYZ at 6pm. We made it to EWR with plenty of time to spare and as we were in line to check our baggage, we get a notification that the flight had been cancelled with no further information. There was an AC employee in the area and we asked her about the cancelled flight, she mentioned in passing that the flight got cancelled all the time but we needed to stand in the assistance line to figure out what to do next. We got in line and there was only one rep dealing with an entire cancelled flight. One would think that if a flight gets cancelled, the company would bring on more staff. So, after waiting in line for nearly 2 hours, mind you there were only 4 or 5 people ahead of us, we finally got to the rep, who was incredibly dismissive and borderline rude to us. We were told that because of weather, the flight was cancelled, no other information other than that. I can accept weather can cancel a flight but based on our experiences and the information I found, I suspect we were being lied to. I asked if there was any other information and all I got was a blunt 'No'. All they could do would be to put us on standby for a flight at 9.35pm and we would have no idea if we could get on that or not. If that failed, the next flight we could be on was 8.35am the next day. When I asked if there were any other airlines that AC could put us on, a blunt 'No'. When I asked if AC would put us up in a hotel, another blunt 'No'. When asked if there was any compensation, he blurted out 'nope' in almost a happy way. Absolutely horrible customer service. My partner has priority pass, so we thought we could wait in the AC lounge. We showed up at the lounge, tried to get in, the rep there informed us in a way that he almost seemed to take pleasure from, that the lounge was only open to priority pass members until 3pm. The next flight, ended up getting delayed, we asked the rep at the counter a couple times if there was any status on the standby list, the last time we asked, which was close to 11pm, they told us they would tell us in two minutes, 30 seconds later they called out at list of names, didn't explain what it was and left us completely in the dark. It turns out that everybody that was on standby, except for us got a seat on the plan. When I went up to ask what was going on, they told me that the plane was full, maybe, just maybe if we waited a little while longer, we might be able to get on. It turns out there was another couple waiting on standby that had already been bumped 4 times before us that day. We waited until probably around 11.30pm. The rep found that two people hadn't checked in so we did have seats! He rushed us on board and we got into the first two seats that were available, they happened to be in business class. They seemed a bit confused at first and then realised that the tickets were for seats in economy, the first rep told us not to worry about it but then this horribly unfriendly flight attendant came up to us and told us that we we would have to move. We said okay, grabbed our belongings quickly and started to look for our seats, at this time the flight attendant yells out at us 'just take your seat, we'll sort it out in the air' - well that's great, she is the one that forced us to move, meanwhile embarrassing us in front of everybody in the plane. Awful experience.

### "not okay with the ticket lady"
Montreal to Shanghai. Worst customer service ever. I flew in at 1:00 am, slept in the airport, then tried to check my luggage so I could eat and move through TSA. Went through three different people telling where to go after looking at my ticket. The ticket line was crazy but they were pulling people who had flights closer than the people around them. I was asked about six times when my flight was and waited in line for about an hour and thirty minutes. I am okay with people being pulled to pass me if they were going to miss my flight. I make it to the counter and the lady I spoke to looked at me and made a loud "annoyed" sound and asked, "why are you here. Explained everything and was cut off with her moving her arms rushing me away. When I asked why several people would have sent me through the line if it was too early to check my bags, she informed me she did not know, she was not them. I am okay with not being able to check my bags, I am okay with waiting in line, I am not okay with the ticket lady.

### "flight was late with no explanations"
Flew Air Canada from Bahamas to Montreal via Toronto. On my way to the Bahamas, I was quite pleased with the service on board. My family and I were flying Business class. Our luggage came very fast! Our flight back to Montreal from the Bahamas with a connection in Toronto was a disaster. First of all, the flight was late with no explanations, then when we got to Toronto, we almost missed the flight to Montréal. When we finally got to Montréal (at almost 3 am), we waited for about 30-45 minutes with no luggage! Half the people on the plane didn't have their belonging! There was a sea of unclaimed luggage! We submitted papers and got home at 4h30 am, we got 3 of 4 bags the next day, it took a week for them to find my luggage with no compensation. Notes were taken, never again will I check my luggage in with Air Canada.

### "freezing in the airplane"
Toronto to Vancouver was one of the worst flight experiences I have ever had. It was freezing in the airplane and when we asked for a blanket they said you have to pay 7 dollars for a blanket. And they only accepted credit cards although we had canadian dollars. So I had to pay in Euro from my credit card. And of course they didn't have any complimentary meals or snacks in a 5 hour flight. We paid for a normal flight and got services as low as spirit.

### "their less than caring agent "
Smithers to Penticton via Vancouver. Worst experience ever. My return flight was a couple hours late which made me miss my connection in Vancouver, I was told by the ticket agents before I flew to Vancouver that once I get to Vancouver at Midnight that Air Canada would provide me with a hotel and meal voucher. Once I got to Vancouver I went to Air Canada Customer Service and was told by their less than caring agent that they will not provide me with a hotel and that I could find a pillow and blanket at baggage claim. Got down to baggage and asked for a pillow and blanket and they were once again rude and said they don't provide that.

### !whole experience was below average"
I generally write reviews when I feel like there is a reason to commend or perhaps criticize an airline. Today I regretfully flew with Air Canada again from Vancouver to Montreal. We arrived 90 min prior to our domestic flight. The lines were especially long, and most kiosks for check in were busy. I went ahead to check us in and unsuccessfully an error receipt came out. I was forced to go into the check in line which had a wait time of 35 min. We got to the front of the line and found out that the flight was over booked and they wanted to put us on the next flight out. I was livid - how could they overbook the flight that we paid for? The Air Canada representative also had the audacity to mention that we were running late. After I firmly mentioned that I cannot get on the next flight, they magically found two seats right by one another. A miracle really. On my way from Montreal to Vancouver, I also did not have a pleasant experience. I had one carry on luggage. The front desk staff at the gate came specifically to me and asked to check it in for no charge because they had a full flight, and not enough space for the carry on luggage. I had some personal belongings that I wanted to carry on board, and in addition, I wanted to forego waiting for the checked in baggage to arrive in Vancouver. She relentlessly asked that I check it in, giving me no option even though many others had carry on bags of the same size that were not being checked in. I felt bullied into checking it in. The whole experience prior to take off each time was below average and I will not fly Air Canada again.

### "was very happy with the product"
Flew Toronto City to Montreal. Pleasant check-in staff, even put on an earlier flight, which was thoughtful. I like the free lounge (for everyone) at Billy Bishop. Flight on time and snacks and drinks served on board for this short flight. I appreciate that frequent travellers may have problems, but have to say that for me they checked every box and was very happy with the product, price and delivery (nice to air miles too on Miles & More).

### "not travel with them again"
Vancouver to Lisbon via Toronto. Caught four flights this month and will not travel with them again. Two of the flights were delayed and one of them the air hostess said there was no water on the plane. Please don't make the mistake of booking with this company. One of the delays made me lose a conection flight

### "excellent long-haul experience"
Dubai to Toronto. Another excellent long-haul experience in Air Canada 's business class on a Boeing 787. I was travelling with my 6-year old grandson. AC took great care of him. Quality of food was good, responsiveness of cabin crew was excellent, seat comfortable and flight was on time. My baggage was delayed, but that was the fault of another airline on the previous segment. Air Canada has upped its game on long-haul flights in their premium cabins. Air Canada uses the LH lounge in DXB which is quite nice, including good showers. My only complaint was the long wait on the gangway for boarding as there was no separate gangway for business class passengers.

### "horror arised all over again"
Portland to Regina via Calgary. I hadn't flown Air Canada in years and the horror arised all over again. First flight was delayed by 2+ hrs. We would have to go up for an update ever 30 min because nothing was announced or changed on their tv. The staff were rude and non accommodating to changing flights. The guy said "I'm too busy if you want to switch your next connection you'll have to cancel this current one and wait because I need these computers open". I had to call Air Canada with my phone to even get help but unfortunately no other options by that point. Now I'm stuck with a 7hr layover and get in at 1am instead of 6pm and haven't even left my starting point! I will never fly Air Canada again and you should do the same.

### "Sloppy customer service"
I'm extremely disappointed with the quality and customer service of Air Canada. My flight from Toronto to LaGuardia was delayed because of a thunder storm and we waited for hours. Eventually the call was made that the flight was to be rescheduled. Everyone de-boarded the flight and after much confusion and racing back and forth through the airport to the customer service desk 3 times we all had to reboard the plane. No vouchers or apologies were given. Sloppy customer service and angry customers all around. I will never fly with Air Canada ever again.

### "change was poorly communicated"
Calgary to Havana via Toronto, with a 2 hour stopover in Toronto. Air Canada changed the second leg of the flight to the next day, creating a 26 hour layover. This change was poorly communicated, with only a single email consisting of an attached PDF file with two digits changed in the entire document. Air Canada did not request consent for this change, offer alternatives, or confirm my understanding of the change. I contacted Air Canada to rectify this, and they were able to change the first portion of the flight so that both flights were on the same day, as originally booked. However, they charged a $75 fee for this, without informing me that they would do so. When I attempted to discuss this with their customer service line, I was informed that I could not speak to anyone about this. I was informed that it is impossible to discuss these issues verbally, and that email is the only avenue to address my concerns. In other regards these flights, as others with Air Canada, have been comparable to other airlines.

### "Still waiting for the call"
London to Vancouver. Flight attendants busy talking about private issues while delivering lunch, not paying attention to passengers. The lunch food in comparison to Asian or European airlines is on the lower end of the spectrum. Arrival: Missing suitcase, were advised that it will arrive a day late. Delivery company engaged by Air Canada, did not deliver two days later (still waiting and only living 50 minutes from airport). Air Canada Baggage Care Centre advised that suitcase arrived and had been picked up by delivery company. Delivery company made no attempt to contact customer. 5 calls were left unanswered. Air Canada has no further control over delivery and unable to provide a direct status of luggage. A request to speak to a supervisor at AC Baggage Care Centre was answered that a supervisor has no direct line to be called. A further verbal request was answered that a supervisor was calling back within 30 minutes. Still waiting for the call from the supervisor, probably forever.

### "enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants"
I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them "brushing" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need "Go to town" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline. Our family will only be looking at other airlines in the future.

### "not very helpful"
Vancouver to Sydney. Cabin crew wasn't happy and not very helpful. Meals need to be a lot better when you are paying for premium economy. Plastic knife and forks, paper cup. It was like a big rush to get everything done. The snack during the flight, we had no choice. A sandwich was handed to us without a choice, didn't tell us what was on them. Our seats were good. Services was bad. And spraying the cabin before we got off.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Toronto to Baltimore. In 20 years of taking this flight, Air Canada has not once gotten off on time. This time the flight was cancelled. Air Canada offers no help - standing in a line of hundreds to make a phone call and be put on hold for an hour does not count. I ended up spending almost $1000 to get home the next day. Flying Air Canada is a tense and frustrating experience.

### "major disappointment"
I recently flew Air Canada business class from NYC LGA to Toronto YYZ. Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a "snack" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in "so quickly" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would "catch up" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared. If she hadn't walked into that room, I would've sat there waiting for my name to pop up on some screen and wasted more time! I was considering Air Canada for future Asian and / or European trips but after experiencing this, I am not flying them ever again. Major disappointment.

### "no agent to meet the plane"
Montreal to Shanghai. I am a long-time and generally loyal Air Canada customer, but they will lose my business now. The flight left Montreal 35 minutes late ( no reason given) and docked 1hr35min late in Shanghai, with a 2 hr connection to my Thai Airways flight to Bangkok. I had only carry-on, so no luggage problem, but there was no Air Canada agent to meet the plane and escort me to the connecting gate (I had to go through immigration and then security again). Missed the connection to Bangkok by 5 minutes and then there was no Air Canada agent available anywhere in Shanghai to rebook me or to assist in getting overnight accommodations. Finally after many calls and hours with AC in Canada, I managed to get rebooked the following day.

### "no bags to be found"
Calgary to Columbus. Baggage lost and then delivered to hotel early next morning. Return flight unpleasant experience with staff at YYC over moving to an earlier flight if there was room. The connection gets cancelled in Toronto and on standby list for later flight and confirmed to that flight an hour later. Ask the attendant if our bags need to be transferred. She ensured they would be fine and be on the flight. Flight gets delayed. Finally get to Columbus 4.5 hours late, no bags to be found. File for lost baggage with agent on duty. Call today to see where everything stands and they have no record of the filing. Terrible customer service with long wait times and the only way to submit a complaint is by email due to lack of phone number.

### "staff simply do not care"
Every single Air Canada segment of this return trip from London to Calgary via Kelowna was delayed. The staff were rude on the Air Canada flights. Check-in staff in London extremely rude and abrupt. Check in counter system went down when trying to check in and was told by the staff that this happens every day at the same time, when all the Air Canada flights depart at the same time. Air Canada Lounge in London far too small for the number of flights all departing near enough at the same time. Boarding the plane in London, ticket system went down again and delayed everyone boarding. What has happened to Air Canada? Business class seat a vast improvement on their previous Boeing 777 version, but still not brilliant. As an example of what Air Canada has become, the pre-dinner nuts were served in a tiny paper cup - the sort that you normally put ketchup into at fast food outlets. BA, Lufthansa, etc use fine china. Air Canada staff simply do not care.

### "it did not disappoint"
Beijing to Denver via Vancouver. When I was looking for round trips from Beijing to Denver and vice versa, this was one of the cheapest flights I came across, even cheaper than the US airlines, and it did not disappoint! With comfortable seats, a nice selection of the latest movies and TV shows, and decent airline food, I would pick this over airlines like United Airlines any day. Also, the plane did an amazing and efficient job at letting the passengers out the plane. The only complaints I had were rather minor, one being that whenever the crew announced something, they would do it in 3 different languages, meaning you had to wait 3 times as long for your movie to play again, and also Canada's inefficient system of transferring layovers for people going to the US. Other than that, I recommend it.

### "connecting flight was canceled"
Toronto to Detroit. After a red eye from Calgary to Toronto, the connecting flight to Detroit orginially scheduled for 8:50 AM was canceled. I was told to go to the Air Canada service desk where, understandably, at 5:30 in the morning, they were understaffed. When I was sent to another desk and finally helped, I had been rebooked for a flight to Detroit two days later. Thankfully the worker continued to check and found a 5 PM flight on the same day. I was given $20 in vouchers (which I now know over a 12 hour time span can be spent very quickly). When it was time to leave, there was an announcement made that our flight attendant could not be found and therefore we did not know our new time of departure. It was discovered later that she had gone through the wrong side in customs and the flight crew had to go through customs again; the wait was about an hour before we were seated on the plane. We then had to fish out a bag from the hold, wait to taxi for 15 minutes, and the icing on the cake was a wheel broken off of my new suitcase. The staff were patient and kind but I hope to not fly Air Canada again if I can help it.

### "enjoyed the service in premium economy"
Our flight from Copenhagen to Toronto left and arrived on time. My wife and I enjoyed the service in the premium economy cabin which consists of only three rows. The premium economy class entitles one to priority boarding and baggage. First meal served was very good but the second consisting of a nondescript wrap should not have been offered. Overall a good experience. AC also provided very obliging service when we needed to change our connecting flight to Calgary. Although a word of caution - AC agent in Copenhagen informed us that we could not check our luggage through only to Toronto and the first question we were asked by AC personnel was whether we had only checked the bags through to YYZ. They said that in Canada so-called "short checking" was no problem, while no less than two check-in agent in Copenhagen told us that this was impossible. AC really needs to address this confusion regarding baggage rules which seems to be quite common.

### "flight attendants excellent"
Air Canada flight from Calgary to London left and arrived on time. Service by flight attendants excellent. Food was very good. AC provides good service on its international routes. This is an evening flight and the lie flat seats are comfortable and allow one to sleep for a number of hours.

### "staff wasn't really concerned"
The flight was delayed by a couple of hours making my connection flight to Vancouver hard to get. To make up for the trip interruption Air Canada gave me a $10 food voucher - 10 dollars? That's not good service or showing empathy but shows how cheap the service can be and the staff wasn't really concerned. I am already on an extremely long flight (Bangalore to Vancouver via Frankfurt and Montreal) the next flight I have is 4 hours delayed and 10 dollars is how they show they are concerned. Nice try Air Canada. I wish you would have provided better service.

### "the service was fantastic"
I'm rating only the first lap, from Tel Aviv to Toronto. The plane was a new Boeing 787. Fantastic flight, plane was extremely comfortable in Business, auto-dark windows were a kick and also very helpful. Movies and music extensive and very well organized. The food was so-so, but the service was fantastic.

### "making us wade through the menus"
Edmonton to Vancouver. I'm baffled with the changes to Air Canada In-Flight Entertainment System. They changed the software eliminating Movies | New Releases category and now have categories like Top Rated (by whom I wonder) and New Onboard (might be a very old movie, but new in their entertainment system).They're making us wade through the menus to find anything truly new in each category. Super frustrating. Also, some of the seat headphone jacks were in poor repair or didn't work on this flight.

### "flight attendants were proactive"
Toronto to Calgary. Flew an ancient B767 that was very tired and dirty. When we arrived on board, my husband's seat was missing its cushion that was in the overhead above us and was stained. The flight attendants were very nice and tried their best to help us by getting another cushion from a seat in the back. Tray tables and seat pockets had crumbs and the seats were very worn out. Service however was quite friendly and the flight attendants were proactive about offering water after the initial drink service. In the future I would prefer to fly the newer A320s on this same route.

### "the food was a bit disappointing"
Excellent service from the cabin crew, who greeted passengers by name and quickly offered sparkling wine, water or juice. This was in contrast to service on the ground. The Maple Leaf Lounge was a temporary facility and was overcrowded with poor food and drinks available. I left and used the nearby Plaza Premium lounge. Boarding was a bit chaotic with confusing queues forming 30 minutes before boarding time. The AVOD had a couple of issues, once freezing and going blank and having to be reset. The food was a bit disappointing, with an overcooked tenderloin and a limited wine choice. However, the FAs were superb, making passengers feel genuinely welcome without being intrusive. I know others have had issues with the executive pod seat, but I found it comfortable for both sitting and sleeping. Baggage arrived quickly in PEK.

### "the cabin service was superb"
Business class on Air Canada's 787-9 is a noticeable improvement on the 777, which I flew on the outbound portion of a trip to China. The 787's advances in pressurization (the equivalent of about 6,000 feet vs 8,000 on the 777) and humidity meant that I arrived in YVR less tired and dried out than I did in Beijing on the outbound trip. As before, the cabin service was superb and the food was surprisingly better on the PVG-YVR leg than on the YVR-PEK portion, which had touted a "signature chef. The electronic window dimming worked well and AVOD was flawless. Boarding was orderly (more so than in YVR) and the Air China lounge was comfortable and quiet, though, as usual in China, with really bad wine. Baggage delivery in YVR took close to 30 minutes after clearing immigration, perhaps because the immigration process was so efficient. Everyone first uses kiosks, which worked well and seemed to reduce what have been huge lines in the past.

### "Zero problems on this trip"
I've always flown Air Canada for many, many years, and have actually never had a cancellation, delay, or any memorably negative experience. The flight from Calgary to Montreal left and landed on time, and the aircraft was clean. The attendants were polite and made regular rounds through the cabin, with water or food carts (for purchase, as this was a medium-range domestic flight), or just to check. I was in coach so I had the comfort level I paid for (for those complaining about coach comfort, I hope they realise that coach seats are not designed BY the airlines, and that they are less comfortable than premium or business on any airline). Zero problems on this trip, would (and will) fly again.

### "consistent service, polite crew/attendants"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Calgary. Great flight on a clean 787 aircraft in economy. Very friendly attendants: I was sitting beside a couple that was ignoring every instruction. The man was on his phone almost until take off, and neither of them stowed their carry-on during take-off or landing. Despite this, more than one attendant helped them cheerfully. Due to a misunderstanding of when we were landing, I tried to order some food close to landing time. The attendant in my section was polite, explained that they weren't supposed to take any more orders, but then gave me a free sandwich (worth around $6.50 on this domestic flight) to give me the benefit of the doubt. I always have and will continue to fly with AC for their consistent service, polite crew/attendants, and clean/modern fleet.

### "do not respond to call signs at all"
Flew Toronto (YYZ) to Mumbai (BOM) with Air Canada. The experience was very decent and it had slightly surpassed my expectations. The cabin crew were very friendly and hospitable. Since it was a flight to Mumbai, it was really nice that they had cabin crew who could speak in Hindi. However, like my previous experience with Air Canada, the cabin crew do not respond to call signs at all. Regarding meal service, they were quite delicious and well-presented. The food was recognizable. It was very nice of the airline to serve Indian food and beverages like Indian Masala Tea (Chai) and other Indian main course dishes, snacks and deserts. I was served three meals throughout the flight, which included a dinner, snack, and breakfast service. Although there was a limited selection of movies and other forms of in-flight entertainment, I surprisingly did not feel bored during the course of the flight. Flight was certainly eventful. The seat was comfortable with for the long journey with excellent legroom, though the seat recline was not as good as other premium economy classes I have travelled in. Moreover, during the whole flight it was really cold and for a while, after the dinner service, when people are generally sleeping, the main light was still on, which was very disturbing. However, the cabin interior was very clean and the ambience looked great, especially for an inaugural flight. The ground staff at Toronto Pearson Airport were also very nice and helpful. So I hence, would recommend this airline for international (transcontinental) flights.

### "our last resort airline now"
Toronto to Zurich flight. Flight on time and staff fairly attentive. The on board entertainment has been changed from good present day movies to old ones from the 70's and 80's and 90's with a couple of newer ones thrown in and many foreign films too. The main meal served after take off was plain terrible! There was no choice of food at all! You had to have large macaroni in a tomato sauce and that was it for everyone, its was the worst meal ever served to us by any airline that we have traveled worldwide. If they keep this up they may as well change the whole airline to Rouge because that is the way they are going! On our previous trip we flew with Lufthansa for a similar cost and the service between them and Air Canada is unbelievable! Air Canada is our last resort airline now!

### "don't fly with Air Canada"
Tokyo to Denver via Vancouver. Tokyo to Vancouver was an uneventful flight as you want flights to be. I have no issues with the plane or service on that flight. My issue came in trying to go from Vancouver to Denver. At the last minute Air Canada cancelled our flight. Okay fine. Things happen. (There was no issue with weather in this case.) I'm not upset that the flight was cancelled. I'm upset at how it was handled by airline representatives. First of all, there is no customer service counter for the airline in this part of Vancouver airport, so the entire flight is waiting in a giant line for a mere two representatives to help us rebook. Second, they start handing out a phone number because they said it was faster for us to rebook if we called this number. This is true, and I did call. However, why are they making already frazzled customers do this? Shouldn't they just employ enough agents to handle this sort of thing? As a side note, when I called the number the woman on the phone was very nice and helpful and took the time to answer all my questions. Third, did my rebooking over the phone, and the agent was very helpful. However, she can't issue me a boarding pass or check me in over the phone. I have to see an agent. She assured me that my baggage would follow me, perhaps not on that same flight, but eventually. I'm on my way home, so I'm okay with this. Fourth, I try to see said agent. If I can get a new boarding pass with enough time, perhaps I can get go get my baggage and get it retagged myself. I have no such luck. I can find 3 Air Canada reps in the entire airport (or at least the part I have access to without going through US customs again.) All 3 are trying to help with rebooking. I wait in line while my husband wanders the airport looking for a person or a kiosk or anything. He finds nothing. This is where my issue is. The woman trying to rebook everyone literally will not even let me finish a sentence. She says I have to go get my baggage and go through customs again with it retagged. When I tell her that the agent told me over the phone that I would not have to do this, she rolls her eyes and prints me one boarding pass. I need two boarding passes. You see, our new flight was from Vancouver to Seattle and then from Seattle to Denver. The final Seattle to Denver leg was on another airline. She refuses to print me that boarding pass and sends me away with a wave of her hand and will not answer any more questions. I go to the gate where we are supposed to take off from Vancouver to Seattle. This agent also will not print me another boarding pass. Here's how that exchange went Me: I was wondering if you could print me a boarding - Agent: No. The flight has been downgraded. I don't know if you have a seat. Me: Okay well - Agent: Sit down and I'll page you. (Not sure how she was going to page me without asking my name but what do I know right?) She pages customers being bumped to the next flight. They are unhappy naturally. She is just as snippy with them, not letting anyone finish a sentence. We do make the flight and eventually get home over 6 hours late. We have no bags. Of course there is no Air Canada representative in the Denver airport to speak with. Our final leg was on Alaska Air. I make a lost baggage report with them. I've been on hold with Air Canada the entire time I've been writing this review. Long story long, but don't fly with Air Canada.

### "incompetent service"
If you want to hang out at an airport all day, then Air Canada is the company for you. Otherwise don't even bother booking with them, horrible plane mangament, long delays for this short flight from Montreal to Chicago, and incompetent service. I will never ride with them again.

### "The staff were pleasant "
Tokyo Narita to Toronto. It seems the airline has finally decided to take their competition seriously and their new hard product is good, and unusually the aircraft was clean and the food was recognizable. The staff were pleasant and they appeared to be trying. One of the massive improvements is that Air Canada allows you to control the temperature via an air vent. The seats on Air Canada have massage and can be adjusted for firmness and softness and the AV screens are large and easy to use. Air Canada has a long way to go, but at least they appear to be trying to compete, and that can only be good for the flying public.

### "very good quality"
Vancouver to Toronto on Air Canada's Boeing 787-9, surpassed my expectations and did very well in good service and very good quality. In the process of boarding, was invited to visit the cockpit, in which the pilots greeted me very nicely and we had a nice conversation. The take-off role was very smooth. Once in the air, I ordered a Pizza from the onboard menu, and it tasted great. In-Flight-entertainment screen worked great,very responsive and had a good selection of movies, TV shows, Documentaries, and more. The seats were very comfortable and the cabin was in excellent condition; very clean and neatly organized. The crew was friendly. Once the smooth landing in Toronto, the crew was friendly as we were de-boarding the aircraft (787-9). Our luggage arrived quickly and we were very satisfied and impressed by the service.

### "never recommend Air Canada"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. At the start of our journey we were rudely treated at the check in desk over carry on size luggage. We had recently flew Air Canada earlier in the week with the exact same size carry on pieces and now all of the sudden they were too big to travel with. We showed the check in desk lady that clearly it was an airline standardized measurement and that they fit. She gave us a hard time and eventually allowed us to take them on and not have to check them. When we got on the plane, there was more than enough space for the carry on pieces. People were bringing larger bags on than we had. It was outrageous! Our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we did not even get an email update. The only thing that saved our trip was the kind flight attendant on the aircraft who was very nice and respectful! I would never recommend Air Canada to anyone.

### "was the worst flight"
I was due to travel from Cleveland to Manchester via Toronto. The Cleveland flight was delayed due to technical difficulties. This meant that I was unable to make my transfer in Toronto and would need to find alternatives. There were no Air Canada staff to be found, only harassed United Airlines who code carry with them. No one could give advice, answers or assurances. After 3 hours we were allowed onto the plane. It was a blisteringly hot day and we were sat in a full, tiny plane in the heat with no air con and no ventilation for 20 mins. People in the cabin were beginning to panic - the crew gave vague assurances that things would eventually get cooler. By this point, I too was beginning to panic, feeling distressed and unable to catch my breath. When the plane took off, it cooled down slightly. What followed was an hour of complete hell - the pilots announcements were inaudible. This was the worst flight I have experienced in 40 years of flying. The cabin was dirty, cramped, the young woman serving us was indifferent and I could not wait to get off. I was then transfer via Dublin on an Air Canada Rouge flight, (think Easyjet without the cherry staff) - arriving 8 hours later than planned and without any luggage (it still hasn't arrived) At no time during this process did I feel of any significance to Air Canada - no friendly advice, no offers of help. Upon arrival in Manchester I discovered that 3 other passengers on my flight had had the same experience, they too were looking for luggage that never arrived. Never again will I fly with this company.

### "seats were hard and uncomfortable"
I normally fly BA to Europe, but since their service has apparently gone sharply downhill as of this year (their catering has virtually disappeared and their reviews here on Skytrax are truly appalling), I thought I'd try Air Canada again. Flew from Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva. The check-in/bag drop at Pearson was terrible. I arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and there was a long line that barely moved. It took an hour before I got to a desk. Typical case of lots of desks available but less than half were being used. Not acceptable for a full long-haul flight. The aircraft to London was a B777. I knew that AC had reconfigured these planes to squeeze 10 instead of the previous 9 seats per row. And I'd heard that the seats were hard and uncomfortable. And they are! Fortunately the seat next to me was free, but even so, it was pretty tight and I could not get comfortable all night. AC uses these aircraft on 16-hour flights to Asia and Australia, which must be unbearable. However, the IFE system is modern with an excellent selection of movies/entertainment, and good screen quality. The catering is standard and decent enough, certainly better than AC Rouge, BA or Air Transat these days. Lots of water runs throughout the flight, which were appreciated. My return flight was from Geneva on an older A330. Overall this was a good thing: the seats were wider and more comfortable, with proper cushioning and excellent leg-room. The IFE system was dated, though, and the selection not as good, but still adequate. The catering was again decent enough. All in all I would fly Air Canada again to Europe for direct flights. It seems to be one of few airlines to still offer a good, traditional service for a fair price.

### "staff were unapologetic"
I flew London to Toronto in Air Canada business class (after upgrading from premium economy) which has to be the worst experience of flying I have had. At meal time after other passengers had been given their meal in business class I was approached by the chief steward to be told they did not have enough business class meals to go around and I would not be receiving a business class meal. The staff were unapologetic.

### "awful staff in Rome"
Toronto to Rome. The Air Canada staff at the Toronto Airport were very friendly, professional and very competent. It was very easy to check in and get loaded on the aircraft. Unfortunately things started going downhill after that. The aircraft was freezing cold. They had the a/c on high for some unknown reason. Even after many people complained, one of the cabin crew claimed they turned up the temperature by a couple of degrees. It was still as cold. Everyone was glad to get off the plane in the morning and warm up. Air Canada staff in Rome are rude, impatient, unfriendly and incompetent at best. They act like you are bothering them at the check in counter and after our flight home was cancelled, you cannot make up just how incompetently they mishandled the situation. I'm not talking about just 1 person. It was pretty much all of them. Their communication was awful as to getting our bags back. The passengers were basically left to fend for themselves to find their bags since we were all sent to the wrong turnstile. Then Air Canada sent someone with the voice of a mouse to give instructions on who goes to what hotel. This almost turned into a riot since almost no one could hear or understand. The employee seemed to have no idea what she was doing and gave terrible instructions as to which hotels and where to find the shuttle buses. There was no organization whatsoever from the Air Canada staff. It really was the incompetent leading the incapable. It took the airport police who were wonderful to get us to the hotel. Air Canada could care less. The next morning, we were right back to the rude, impatient treatment at the check in counter with a different person and disorganizion at the gate since we had to be bused to the plane. Everyone was thrilled to get away from the Air Canada Rome staff once they were on the plane. We must give credit to the cabin crew however for the return flight. Although this aircraft was almost as cold, the staff couldn't do enough for everyone. They were kind and professional. The wonderful Air Canada staff in Toronto guided us to Customs and we got all our bags. I would have scored Air Canada higher if not for their awful staff in Rome and the planes being kept so damn cold.

### "had a great experience"
San Francisco to Toronto via Montreal. My husband had a great experience flying Air Canada for our first time. The staff from check-in, flight attendants and captain were all professional yet cordial, ensuring all customers were well treated and comfortable. We had a connecting flight between Montreal to Toronto, with a fairly tight window. The Director of the attendants, made a personal call to ensure the flight would wait for us before departing. Knowing we had to go through Customs prior to changing flights made us quite nervous we'd miss the connecting flight, but the Air Canada staff was quite supportive and helpful, making us feel much taken care of! Of course, they were right, we finished going through Canadian customs and reached the boarding area with 30 minutes to spare.To date this is our favorite airline, and we've been telling our friends and other Tauck Tour travelers how much we enjoy flying with Air Canada. We look forward to flying with Air Canada regularly!

### "delayed over 10 hours"
Toronto to Paris. Flight was delayed over 10 hours in Toronto. Finally when it was time to board, they said that the aircraft was struck by lighting. Oddly enough, that same aircraft boarded again with passengers and left to London UK. In flight service sucked, the flight attendants looked exhausted and no smile. Breakfast was a shame.

### "The flight was alright"
This was an onwards Lufthansa codeshare flight from Frankfurt to Toronto in premium economy. The flight was alright. I had done a special order for an Asian Vegetarian Meal and I did not like the food. On an 8-hour flight, I thought they could have provided a second meal. Instead, they served one sandwich before landing. The in-flight entertainment system was not interesting for me. Overall, this was not a flight I expected, despite there being some value for money.

### "losing our baggage"
San Francisco to London via Toronto. Flights coming back: smooth, and well done. Flight going to London - it's been over two weeks since I first addressed everything that went wrong, including missing flights, being bumped to different flights, them losing our baggage, and their support team literally says an agent has up to 30 days for a response. The flight that left on May 10th was late. About 45 minutes late out of SFO (San Francisco). This ended up making us late for the connection flight in Toronto. When we got to the gate we were informed that we had been removed from the connection flight because we hadn’t checked in. Of course we hadn’t checked in, because the original flight Air Canada had us on was late. So we tried to get back on the original flight. Luckily they got us on. However, they had already moved our bags to the following flight leaving out of Toronto. So they had to move our bags back. They said they would get a runner to do it. Fair enough. When we landed in LHR (London), they didn’t have our bags. We went to the baggage claim desk for Air Canada. They said they had no scans on our bags and had no idea where they were. They asked us to file a claim and track it through your World Tracer program. This trip was becoming a nightmare. Because the flight was delayed in Toronto the flight to LHR landed late. This made us miss our original flight to Munich that we had made on Lufthansa. We went to the Lufthansa desk who said it would be $271.00 for each of us to get a new flight. Still no update on the baggage tracer. Kept calling their baggage claim desk, and they said the bags hadn’t arrived on the recent flight coming in from Toronto. We ended up needing to book new flight with a completely different airline much later in the day. This time directly to Salzburg (our eventual location) coming out of LGW (Gatwick). Total price for the two flights: $293.40. As we were about to leave LHR to head to Gatwick, we got a call from baggage claim. They had our bags. Their World Tracer, which they kept pointing us to for more information which showed absolutely no updates, never showed the bags delivered. In fact, it STILL doesn't show the bags reached us and it's been over two weeks if you can believe it. So…where do we stand? They causes us to miss their own connection flight in Toronto. They caused us to miss our Lufthansa flight to Munich (and we had provided plenty of time from arrival in London to departure for the next flight). They screwed up delivery of our bags (they still haven't officially confirmed us receiving our bags, that's how TERRIBLE their bag tracer is). And yup. I contacted their support team. Nothing. Absolutely NOTHING has been done since we've gotten back from London. They just keep saying the same thing over and over again: a support agent is looking into your case and will respond within 30 days. I am never flying with them again. While some of their agents and staff do a great job, part of their team is absolutely incompetent, has zero sympathy for nightmares like this, and their support team is practically unreachable unless you plan to wait 45 minutes on the phone for one of them to answer, or you want to go through online channels, where they have up to 30 days to get back to you. We are basically out almost $300 for the new flights we had to book.

### "the sub-par product"
Brussels to Toronto via Montreal. Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for. After complaining to the flight director who was charming but useless and mouthing platitudes that she would write it up in her report, I braced myself for the arrival of the pasta dish that no one else wanted and that I was going to be saddled with, unless I wanted to be hungry for the next seven hours. It arrives, the foil is removed and it is dry at the edges. I to eat the bun and lettuce with six small slices of red pepper. The dessert is artificially creamy with peach bits that has some pleasant taste but which hardly provides fulfilling sustainment. An hour before landing we are served a savoury pastry in a cardboard box. Mine is a Chicken Fajita. I look at the writing on the box and it says it is made in the UK with ingredients as silicone dioxide to prevent anti-caking and colour - it also says this Fajita is made with chicken from Brazil. I found out that if you try to use the business class toilets up front, you will be castigated and sent to the ones at the back of the aircraft. I shall go back to Air France when I go to Paris again this summer.

### "Stranded at Pearson International"
Stranded at Pearson International (Toronto) because of our 5-hour delayed flight from San Antonio, we (at least 14 passengers with connections to Montreal and Ottawa) had a very unpleasant experience with Air Canada there. Its personnel at the connection desk offered us no apologies, no options for accomodation and no compensation, but instead lectured us with apparent agitation, even aggression, for being ungrateful daring to question their "hospitality". We spent the entire night on the floor of the airport where its administration "generously" provided prison-style blankets. Complaints to AC customer relations department resulted in an offer of 25% discount for the next flight off so-called "base fair", which (when applied), is still roughly 10-15% percent more expensive than what you could easily find on any consolidator website. Ruined plans, worries of friends and families, unattended business meetings, lost time, simply discomfort, both physical (from sleepless night) and moral (when you are just expected to gratefully overspend on overbooked flights and be happy and quiet about it) - all these things, apparently, are not considered, much less covered by the AC policy.

### "unable to provide a reason"
Calgary to Toronto. The customer service repeatedly asked me to leave the Zone 3 line despite being a Zone 3 individual. When asked for reasoning why they were unable to provide a reason and became hostile in language. This combines with the fact that they are dropping there Aeroplan mileage program with the Star Alliance.

### "not as per expectations"
Flew on April 13 from Toronto to Zurich. Flight was started late by 40 minutes because cabin crew could not manage cabin luggage item of one passenger and they had to call three technicians to fix the problem. Cabin crew were rude and slow. Food served was not as per expectations and many passengers did not eat their snacks. Aircraft and seats were OK. Entertainment was OK.

### "made us pay for carry on luggage"
Tampa to Toronto. Very bad experience at Air Canada check-in counter at Tampa international airport. The customer care lady who was supposed to greet us, was rudely asking why we were there at her counter. She had no sense of customer service. After explaining the reason that we needed to check-in, she was not in good mood to provide service. She made us pay for a carry on luggage which we had brought while coming back from Canada as a carry on luggage.

### "Overall horrible experience"
Was extremely disappointed with service. I had booked a flight months ago with Air Canada to leave New York LGA airport on may 7th at 5:50pm to Toronto with an hour and half lay over there before heading to Edmonton. We found out the flight was cancelled at 2pm that day due to construction at the Toronto Airport. It was ridiculous for them to find out that late that construction would be occurring at that terminal. But that's all fine, what I am upset about is the fact I had to take a flight to Montreal at 8:50pm and have a lay over there until 7:40 am. I was expecting hotel to be covered but unfortunately it was not technically their fault. They also neglected to tell us that technically the Air Canada ticket counter was closed until 4a.m. So we had to "sleep" in the outer lobby where any one could have access to steal our stuff. Needless to say we did not sleep at all and waited till 4am to come into the airport. Overall horrible experience and I expect more from an airline.

### "no complaints about the experience"
Flew Air Canada from Brisbane to Vancouver. No complaints about the experience at all. Departures were on time, friendly and efficient ground and cabin staff and food was excellent. Had read some bad reviews about Air Canada on social media but compared to an earlier trip to Vancouver in 2015 on a rival airline, the flights were a 'dream'.

### "no staff at the airport to help"
I've had the worst time flying with Air Canada from Toronto to Vancouver. First out flight was delayed, then the gate was changed and eventually it was canceled. Over 200 people had to stay in the airport overnight, service of the airline was extremely bad and intentionally slow. Our flight was scheduled 11 hours later, 6 of those hours I've spent in the lines to get a food voucher, collect my baggage, register on the new flight, go through customs twice. There was no staff at the airport to help, and impossible to get any answers. On the new flight, which was over 5 hours long, there were no free meals or even snack. So starving people had to pay to get some food. Airline provided 20$ food voucher per person, that's how much money I had to feed myself for over 10 hours. I had a 13 hours long connecting flight from Europe.

### "Poor planning for provision of food"
Flew Air Canada from Denver to Montreal. Good selection of menu to buy but after a few rows almost nothing is available. Poor planning for provision of food. Why offer it if you don't have it in stock. I fully understand that you can have all menus for all passengers, but almost nothing left after few rows, it sucks.

### "passed from desk to desk"
Air Canada is easily able to provide one of the worst experiences to travellers of any airline. Their inability to manage delays and cancellations astounds me since it's such a regular thing for them. Yesterday most of their domestic flights from Toronto were cancelled due to a known outage of one runway, and most of their international flights were delayed. Despite knowing this it was chaos. I was incorrectly passed from desk to desk when I arrived late to a cancelled flight. Each person sent me to someone else or lied to me. Eventually I ended up outside of security with no luggage, no transport to my destination no luggage and no one who could give me any help or information. Every agent I dealt with lied to me to get me to go away and there was no joined up process for dealing with numeesous stranded passengers. The only helpful person was the woman at the delayed baggage call centre who had empathy, knowledge and genuinely helped me try to resolve my situation. Never again Air Canada!

### "entertainment system has a fundamental flaw"
Flew Air Canada from Vancouver to Montreal. Some minor delays, but nothing major. The aircraft is amazing if not for one thing: the entertainment system has a fundamental flaw. On screen controlls are nice, but also controls have been aded on the armrest. Consequently, any arm on top or near it sets off the screen, volume, light, calls the attendant and so on. The only solution was to not rest the arm period. Does not work. They also no longer give any snacks on board or food. Internet or connectivity are not offered.

### "Air Canada's horrible service"
Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver. My family's wonderful Hawaii trip had a very upsetting ending due to Air Canada's horrible service. We endured multiple flight delays and cancellations due to technical issues with their planes and had to pay for three hotel rooms out of pocket to accommodate our 8-month old baby and my elderly parents who would have been stranded overnight in two separate cities. It took us 2+ days to get back home (instead of the scheduled 23 hours). Our returning flight AC1830 was delayed due to technical issues. We found out about the delay when we arrived at the airport around 7:00 pm (no previous warning) and the departure was initially postponed from 10:00 pm to 3:45 am but got delayed again to 4:15 am early in the morning. AC told us that since they didn't cancel the flight they were not responsible to book us a hotel room despite the fact that we had an infant and two seniors travelling with us. I couldn't understand how AC expected families with small children and babies to deal with this - sleep on the airport floor? We decided to book a hotel room on our own since we have 20+ hours flight ahead of us and an infant baby travelling with us. A motel room with airport shuttle cost us $200+tax USD/room due to the last minute booking. AC did postpone the departure again from 3:45 to 4:15 am. Neither my husband nor I was able to sleep well as we were afraid to miss our flight. This was only the beginning of our horrible experience. We were supposed to have two connecting flights after arriving in Vancouver (VAN-TOR, TOR-DL). Due to this first delay, AC had to cancel our subsequent flights and rebook the rest of our trip. Instead of flying to Deer Lake on the same night we arrived in Toronto, we had to stay in Toronto overnight. However, AC couldn't give us the rest of our boarding passes, nor could it book a hotel in Toronto for us. The agent in Honolulu told us that we needed to get the hotel from AC's customer service in Toronto once we got there. AC's flight from Vancouver to Toronto got delayed again and the plane did not land in Toronto airport until 10:45 pm on May 2nd. By the time we got off the plane it was almost 11:30pm. There were 50+ people in line at the AC customer service kiosk, while only two to three agents were working. The line hardly moved and after midnight an agent came to the line telling us all the hotels around the airport were sold out and we had to look for hotels on our own. He said the desk would be closing in 30 minutes and the agents would leave despite there were still so many of us unserved. He told us to call AC to rebook our flights. He also told us to find hotel on our own; and AC will reimburse up to $100 CAD per room. Seriously, I want to ask AC where to find a hotel room cost $100 or less nowadays?? As we learned that we wouldn't be helped by anyone at the desk, my husband started to call AC about our booking and I started looking for hotel rooms for us since we were all exhausted and I did not want my super-exhausted baby to sleep on the floor in the airport. As it was after midnight already, I couldn't book a room on Expedia or other online booking website as they couldn't take May 2nd as the check-in date. Therefore I started calling every hotel around the airport. Finally a hotel had two rooms available and they cost us $169+taxes although the regular online booking price is no more than $128, thanks to AC for causing the last min booking.

### "never flying with them again"
Air Canada was horrible, first they changed my flight schedule without even letting me know (they rebooked me on a flight from Havana to Frankfurt via Toronto to Amsterdam instead of Toronto straight to Amsterdam, without notifying me) and if I wouldn't have checked myself I would have missed these flights. And when I called about this they put me on another flight, with an excuse about the flight that was very vague and when I looked it up it turned out they told me a very different reason. When I arrived at Schiphol at the day of my departure I suddenly had to pay for my bag as it was not included in their system (while it was on my ticket), so I had to pay 95 euros for a service that I bought when I booked (On the Air Canada site). And when I wanted to check-in for the flight in Havana they couldn't put me on a seat, and I had to wait until 20 minutes before the flight before even knowing if I had a seat. While flying their in-flight system kept failing and turning on again, so I've watched the beginning from my movie for at least 4 times.. Air Canada is horrible, and even after 1.5 months I haven't heard from their refund services. I'm never flying with them again.

### "my company booked it for me"
Saskatoon to Moncton via Toronto/Montreal. This time I was bringing my cat along. They were again initially late by a half hour. Then to further complicate things they made us wait on the Tarmac for an hour prior to take off, due to fog. My connecting flight to Montreal was cancelled, no reason given. Now I'm forced to spend the next 8 hours in Toronto airport with my cat, locked up in the handicap bathroom. The only place I can allow my cat out, so he has some freedom. My flight lands at my destination tomorrow morning at 8.30. A 7 hour flight, that took 27 hrs. And this time with a cat. I would normally never had booked with AC, however my company booked it for me. I didn't have the authority to change it.

### "never has it ever been on time"
Air Canada is the worst ever for on time flights. It's the only airline that has a direct flight Toronto to Indianapolis and never has it ever been on time (12+ flights) and is always late. Not just a few minutes but hours! The 8.50pm usually leaves at 10.30pm. Air Canada do us all a favor and at least be honest with your posted take off times so when new passengers pay your fees for a ticket they know it's not leaving till 10.30pm (and that's the earliest I've ever taken off for the 8.50 flight).

### "thank the airline employees"
Vancouver to Shanghai. I would like to thank the airline employees of Air Canada. I recently took a flight from Vancouver to Shanghai. And left my wallet at the departure gate, unbeknownst to me. Two hours into the flight, an attendant gave me a message from the flight deck that passenger Gagnon had possibly left a purse and box of chocolates at the departure gate. After some confusion, I realized that I did not have my wallet in my purse, nor that chocolate bar that I had bought. My life was in that wallet. And I got it all back complete. Thank you to all those involved!

### "lucky to only lose one day of our vacation"
We were flying Charlotte to London via Toronto with Air Canada. We realized that Toronto was limited by a closed runway and asked to be rerouted the night before but were assured that we would make our connecting flight. Despite our plane sitting outside of the gate in Charlotte we were delayed over two hours going to Toronto due to a lack of landing slots since Toronto was down to a single runway. Canadian flights have priority over US. Luckily, we were able to get four seats (not together) on the next morning's flight to London from Toronto but we had to spend a long, cold, uncomfortable night in the Toronto airport. Air Canada offered no accommodations for us due to this delay. The return flight was almost as bad. Our two hour layover in Toronto was barely enough time to get through security and customs and get out to the end of the terminal for our connecting flight home. We were lucky to only lose one day of our vacation to this incompetent airline. We will never fly Air Canada again.

### "on time, edible food, nice crew"
London Heathrow to Toronto. Good flight, on time, edible food, nice crew. Only complaint is that Premium Economy on the Boeing 777-200 has no separate toilets. I have flown Premium Economy on Air Canada's Boeing 787 and found it to be better - separate toilets and I recall the seats were better, but that is very subjective. Walked around in economy and the 3-4-3 seat configuration is cramped, but that seems to be the new industry standard.

### "a waste of money for service and comfort"
Frankfurt to Toronto with Air Canada. Terrible Seats. They are not comfortable. Any other airline would be better for comfort on a long haul flight in economy. The service was ridiculous. They were obviously tired and did not care. I don't think I will ever fly Air Canada for long haul ever again. What a waste of money for the service and comfort.

### "very pleased with service"
Tokyo Narita to Vancouver. Had a very nice flight in new plane. Left on-time, nice support staff inside airport. Great on-board entertainment system. Food was hot, and very enjoyable. Very attentive staff came around asking if we wanted drinks, coffee, etc, and was very pleased with service. Did not check-in baggage.

### "staff was extremely friendly"
Paris to Montreal return flight with Air Canada. Boarding was managed very well taking into account that about 400 passengers boarded each flight. Both flights were with a great service and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new movies to keep passengers entertained during the flights! I especially appreciate that movies can be watched in various languages! The catering was just OK, the food quality is average. We were served a hot meal (with two choices) with a complimentary beverage. They serve water during the whole flight after meal services which is appreciated. This is much better service in comparison with competitors on this route e.g. Air Transat or even Air France. I definitely recommend Air Canada on this route as it is reliable air company with good service.

### "showed complete indifference"
I was supposed to fly Air Canada from London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto. After arriving in Toronto, I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on a flight several hours later. This was then delayed, and I became worried that it would be cancelled. However, after repeated inquiries with the Air Canada gate agent, I was informed that it would be taking off that night, although hours late. Then at the last second this flight was cancelled, around 9 pm. No announcement was made of the cancellation until after it was supposed to have departed - the flight simply stopped being listed online or on the airport board. I entered a long customer service line, however, in the midst of waiting the agents went home from their shift. No clarity was provided about where we were supposed to go next. The customer service agents simply walked away. A long period of confusion in which it was simply impossible to find any Air Canada representatives. The amount of understaffing was appalling, and there appeared to be no urgency from anyone I spoke to about resolving the many issues that people were having. Finally, I wound up in a rebooking line, where I stood for over two hours before being helped. Despite repeated complaints from me and others to increase the level of staffing, this never happened: there were only two agents for dozens of customers. When I finally got to speak to someone, they made it clear that at the earliest I could fly to Columbus the following evening, because the earlier flights to Columbus were cancelled or fully-booked. The fact that I could not get out of Toronto until the following evening made my trip moot (it was only a two-day trip for a conference, one of which I would have completely missed). I therefore requested that I simply be booked a return ticket to London for the next morning and I gave up on my trip. After some haggling the agent reserved a place for me on a flight. However, although I was entitled by Air Canada policy to a hotel room for the night, none was provided for me. I spent the night on the floor of the Toronto airport. Despite pleading for some kind of compensation (I mentioned access to the airline lounge, so that I might change clothes / take a shower / have a minimum of comfort), I was given nothing but $20 of food vouchers. The next day my flight back to London was delayed almost two hours simply out of poor handling. In sum, Air Canada showed complete indifference to stranded travellers, made no effort to provide adequate staffing to deal with the problems that stranded travellers were facing; provided no lodging, were completely untransparent about the reasons for the delays and cancellations. To top it off, they are now being very difficult with regards to a refund. I was told that I had to go through Expedia, because that was where I made my booking. Now Expedia has sent me back to Air Canada. Air Canada claims that it may take 25 days to process my request. This should be the simplest matter in the world, there is no gray area: my trip was cancelled, I never made it to my destination, and I was left stranded at the airport without lodging in violation of their own policy. I just want my money back.

### "less legroom, very limited IFE"
Victoria-Toronto-Ottawa 15 March, returning 21 March. Reservation made through AC website and seat selection purchased at that time. In both directions, YYJ-YYZ legs served by A321s, YYZ-YOW legs by A320s. Seats and legroom comfortable although there was a 5 cm gap between the fuselage and window-seat armrests, reducing seat width unnecessarily. FAs made frequent runs to offer water. Three main glitches, all to be taken in stride as part of air travel nowadays: (i) Outbound from YYJ, the video safety presentation could not be played aloud through the cabin's PA system (though it was on the video screen), so FAs had to demonstrate the safety features themselves. (ii) The onward outbound YYZ-YOW leg was delayed nearly an hour, with all passengers remaining seated, while a possible technical fault in the cockpit controls was investigated. (iii) Accumulation of incoming flights at YOW meant that YOW baggage system was backed up and dispensing of baggage was delayed till an hour after aircraft had arrived. Oddly, on the five-hour return leg YYZ to YYJ, when I purchased a gin-and-tonic the miniature bottle was labelled "Duty free" and "Export strength" (47.3 percent alcohol). If Air Canada can use duty-free alcohol to serve on domestic flights, their price of CAD 6.50 per drink is pretty steep. This summer, Air Canada plan to downgrade all their non-stop YYJ-YYZ flights to their "Rouge" service level (less legroom, very limited IFE).

### "a pleasant experience"
Toronto - Edmonton aboard mainline Air Canada was a pleasant experience after the so-so watered down Business Class one on Rouge MCO-YYZ. What really was outstanding was the FA up front with whom I have flown with before. Other than that standard Air Canada Business experience, unmemorable food, a comfortable seat and good quality alcohol. I did appreciate my bags actually being first off the carousel which happens too infrequently as I had exactly three minutes to catch a ETS bus into town, or wait an hour, or face a $65 cab ride. The choice of audio on the seat back monitor left a lot to be desired, never heard of many of the artists, don't think you can go wrong with classic rock or pop, but there were few selections of such available, so I listened to my own tunes.

### "Business Class does not measure up"
Toronto to Munich with Air Canada. There is good news and bad news here. The food was better than any Air Canada Business Class meal I have had before. The staff were enthusiastic and attentive. The onboard entertainment selection was very weak, with a few new movies and even fewer classic movies. The music choice was appallingly short. I was not given noise cancelling headphones and was left with the awful headphones that AC gives out for free to economy class. The lie flat bed has very hard and I could not sleep.I expressly book business class so that I may get good sleep. The agent in Toronto did not mention to me that I needed to obtain my luggage in Munich and take it to my connecting flight. So, I had no luggage for the first two days of my trip. Business class is so costly that every individual detail is vital and can not be overlooked. So, despite the better meals, Air Canada Does not measure up when it comes to their Business Class product to the level of even the good European carriers.

### "best experience to the Caribbean"
Toronto to Aruba in economy class  on an A320. Booked the flight with points. Boarding was delayed due to an air traffic control ground delay program. Something to do with the space launch over Florida. We left the gate around 45 minutes late but were able to catch up time enroute. The service was nice and standard for North American flights. Drinks and buy onboard served efficiently, though one of the flight attendants was not very polite or attentive. The entertainment is far better then any other airline flying to the Caribbean. Seats where very comfortable and had a lot of space. Sat in seat 17b With my girlfriend next to me in 17a. Wifi worked great while flying in US airspace. Overall, best experience flying to the Caribbean. Highly recommended.

### "flight seats had been oversold"
Montreal to Vancouver. We arrived at the airport with lots of time to spare prior to our flight. One of the check in ladies helped us get our bags sorted and accepted. We paid to check our bags in for Vancouver on that flight checking in a small suitcase and a larger one. She printed us boarding passes and bag tags and explained that our seat allocations would be made at the gate. We arrived at the gate with lots of time to spare and waited. The staff there announced that they thought there was insufficient space on the plane to take all of the passengers carry on luggage and started to request that passengers voluntarily check their carry on luggage in. They also started to circulate around the passengers and tried to ‘talk’ anyone with largish carry on bags or multiple luggage items to check them in. They then announced that the flight seats had been oversold and that they wanted ‘volunteers’ to take a later flight. Then we were told that they would call out names for final seat allocations. I heard a name that started with the same letter as ours and approached the counter to personally enquire if it was in fact for our seat allocation. The Air Canada staff were all looking distressed and under pressure at this stage. I was told that it wasn’t my name but the lady took our ‘boarding passes’ and said that our tickets were only standby tickets. I noticed that the copy which she kept, with no seat allocation printed on it actually had ‘sb’ in very small letters where the seat number would normally be printed which meant nothing to me up until that very moment. She said she would check and call out my name in due course with seat allocations. After another 10 or 15 minutes and a number of other customers being issued boarding passes, she called my name and started speaking. I explained I was an international traveller and had to get back to Vancouver on that flight. I told her I had bought and paid for my tickets weeks earlier and as far as I was concerned, I was contractually entitled to travel on that flight. We did get onto the flight, probably because I had been so insistent. When we arrived at Vancouver, after the 5 hour flight plus a lengthy wait at the carousel, our smaller case finally came onto the conveyor. I checked with the lost baggage staff, again having to wait for some time in a queue. They were good and advised that my other bag had been routed on a flight to Toronto and would arrive later that night. They would then deliver it to my Vancouver address the next morning. It arrived at about 1430 hours the next day and it looked as though it had been dragged through muddy water. It was filthy. And the luggage tag on it was tagged ‘standby’ as well. I will get the case cleaned now that we are home.

### "flying experience was average"
London to Pearson by Air Canada: Boarding had started on-time, I stepped on-board and was not greeted by any crew member. I walked to my seat which was 30G. I sat down and right away noticed that the seat was quite narrow, however my table was in my arm rest, so that gave me even less space then everyone else. We were then delayed because of 'engine problems. We then departed about 20 mins late. About an hour after we took off they served us our lunch which was quite good and I have to say I did enjoy it. For the rest of the flight I listened to music on my phone, and watched some interesting TV-shows. Then as the flight came to an end we were served a sausage wrap, which was spicy but also enjoyable. We arrived in Toronto 10 mins early and I have to say that the overall flying experience was average.

### "crew were attentive"
Flight to Vancouver on time as was the Vancouver to Victoria. Crew were attentive. Food selection is nothing to write home about. Offered to check my carry on at no charge as flights were full and the size of carry on's that they allow on board is ridiculous so I did. Flight from Toronto to Ottawa was delayed about 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft. Hung out in the Maple leaf Lounge. Food hasn't improved, still just salads and Mac and cheese. Upon arrival in Ottawa the carry on that they checked for free didn't arrive, I have a Tile device attached and could see that it was still in Toronto so with the wait at the missing bag desk added about an hour to process. Bag arrive by courier at my home which is about 100km from Ottawa at noon the following day.

### "horrible customer service experience"
Horrible customer service experience. I am scheduled to travel via Air Canada at the beginning of next month for business. I was recently advised that the date of my flight changed from April 3rd to April 4th. I called the Air Canada offices and wasn't provided with any viable alternatives (leave a day earlier to arrive two days later or refund my ticket). Not one incentive was offered because of this inconvenience. I have never traveled on an airline that doesn't provide travel incentives when there are changes of this magnitude. I will never travel on Air Canada again. Appalling service!

### "staff was extremely rude"
Toronto to Miami. At the self baggage check in, the staff was extremely rude. She made me feel so dumb just because we asked how to place the sticker on the luggage. She then just ignored us and didn't care. I hate travelling with Air Canada and will never again. It's not like I'm getting a better price from AC.

### "Seats were comfortable on both flights"
Traveled to Winnipeg to Ottawa 06 Mar 17 and return 11 Mar 17. Check in at both airports was a breeze and ground staff were friendly and efficient. Both flights departed approx. 30 minutes late and arrived approx. 30 minutes late. Seats were comfortable on both flights, and had no issues with the entertainment system. Didn't have to wait long for flight attendants to come around with drinks, and o both flights flight attendants were friendly. Baggage arrived promptly at both airports. Overall, had a good flight on both departure and return and would definitely recommend this airline for short-haul flights.

### "no TV, no food for a 6 hour flight"
Flew Air Canada from Montreal to San Jose. We were so disappointed to see that the experience for the travellers is the least of Air Canada's concerns. No TV, no food for a 6 hour flight seems unreasonable. The time allowed to transfer from one flight to another is far too short and we got no assistance whatsoever even though we were travelling with kids. Overall very poor. We won't travel with Air Canada Rouge ever again.

### "modern aircraft and good legroom"
I flew Air Canada from Madrid to Los Angeles via Toronto. The flight was great, good food, modern aircraft and good legroom. My first language is Spanish and some stewardesses could speak Spanish and this made my trip more comfortable. The flights were on time and it was a nice experience. I recommend Air Canada!

### "disappointed in Air Canada"
Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna via Vancouver. Flight to Puerto Vallarta was good, staff awesome and service was prompt. Unfortunately on the way home I can't say the same. We checked in early and selected our seats to ensure a window and isle seat and to avoid the long lines at the airport waiting for check in. Once we arrived at the airport we waited 3rd in line for over an hour watching everyone who was checking in at the airport go through infront of us due to a computer issue. Then we were told that the flight was full and we had to sit in the middle despite checking in 24 hours before. Once in the plane the AC unit went down and we sat on the runway inside the boiling hot plan for an hour while crews scrambled to fix the issue. So we take off and I'm excited to get water after waiting in a hot plane for an hour only to wait 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight to even speak to a flight attendant. When I asked why things were so slow they scoffed at me and blamed the airline for cutting down from 7-6 flight attendants for this flight. Now I understand this can be stressful for them and create more work, but where I'm confused is how come on the way down with 6 flight attendants I received awesome service and water and coffee several times? I wish it could stop there but unfortunately it doesn't, we had to catch a connecting flight wich was overbooked, and we were asked if anyone would like to stay behind in Vancouver, only to find out it was so two Air Canada employees could fly home. Once our connecting flight to Kelowna landed at 12am our little plane of 30 had to sit on the runway for an hour while the other 2 international planes of over 150 passengers unloaded. Super disappointed in Air Canada and will definitely choose WestJet when flying next time. I'll Avoid Air Canada at all costs.

### "very enjoyable 8 hr flight"
London Heathrow to Calgary. I had a very enjoyable 8 hr flight with Air Canada in economy! Service was excellent. Flight attendants went out of their way to make sure you had plenty of refreshments and plenty of water. In flight entertainment was 1st class showing all the latest films. Seats were comfortable. No delays. I was served a hot meal with drinks of my choice not long after take off and also a hot snack about an hour before landing. Two weeks later on 18th December I flew back to the UK with Air Canada and again excellent service. Only criticism it is a shame they do not offer different films flying east to west/west to east as some other airlines do. Otherwise no complaints

### "seats were so narrow"
London Heathrow to Newark via Toronto with Air Canada. I chose this airline as I am a Star Alliance Gold member but this was clearly a big mistake. This is the first time I have seen ten seats per row in economy on a B777 and I have flown many airlines. The seats were so narrow the it reminded me of a very low budget airline. Seven hours on a seat like this and you come out with leg and back pain. I had to keep my hands stack on my body as there was no space to rest them. Do not bother paying for the extra legroom seats as these are even more narrow due to the entertainment monitor stored in the armrest. Flight attendants completely uninterested and rude. No response to seat calls. Priority delivery of luggage for gold members not respected at Newark - our luggage came out among the last. Out of the four flights, three were late by an hour without any explanation of apology. Meals during flights small and of average quality. I will certainly not fly again Air Canada and I would not recommend this airline to others.

### "horrible customer service"
Munich to Halifax via Toronto with Air Canada. Horrible customer service! Due to weather conditions, my flight from Toronto to Halifax was cancelled. But the ground staff didn't do anything to solve that problem. Instead they send me to another airline, which was more helpful than Air Canada themselves. Air Canada wanted me to stay for unknown number of days at Toronto airport and did not bother paying for an accomodation. Their hotline in Germany can also only be reached from 09:00am to 5:30 pm. Why? Especially at times with flight cancellations, this hotline should be reachable 24-hours a day.

### "speak the language of your choice"
Montreal to St Louis via Toronto. I am trilingual Canadian frequent flyer 35K with Air Canada (I speak English 1st language, French 2nd language and Spanish 3rd language). I am always courteous, respectful of other cultures and speak the language of the person with whom I am doing business if I can. Air Canada is Canada's national airline (and I believe was even built with some public funding) and is expected to be bilingual English and French. When I travel to Montreal Quebec, quite often the attendants do not show this same courtesy of speaking English to me even when I clearly state this preference as a client. When I fly to other Canadian (outside of Quebec) or American cities they speak the language of your choice. I have flown many airlines over the past few years from many differant countries and more and more I am disappointed by Air Canada for the reasons described above, not to mention pricing and services offered. This lack of simple respect for my culture and language (English) is causing me to reconsider the choice of airline in the near future.

### "attendants were friendly"
Calgary to London Heathrow with Air Canada. This was a good flight that left on time and arrived on time. I took seat 12A in Premium Economy, which felt great compared to coach (which I have typically flown). You get a business class style entrée with a printed menu and choice of entree, and the seats are quite noticeably wider and with more recline. The attendants were friendly and made the rounds regularly without being intrusive. I am definitely a bit of a clean and neat freak, but the plane interior, including the bathroom, was organised and spotless. Upon boarding, we were given a departure drink (I chose OJ). After takeoff, dinner was served with wine. The entertainment system was, as usual with AC, stocked with selections of some recent films. All in all, the flight was smooth and enjoyable. AC gets a lot of complaints that I have never found to be substantiated. I've flown them lots; I've never had a late flight and never had a staff member treat me rudely. They have an international fleet of new or new-ish equipment including many 787s and a really good safety record.

### "rude Air Canada service"
I booked through Expedia. Ticket agent in Sudbury could not find my reservation and asked me my name several times. My name was listed on her ticket as middle, last then first name (like all other air tickets I get). She told me she could not issue a ticket in a not so friendly manner. I explained that every plane ticket I have had prints it the same way. She said no and finally went to another agent to ask. The other agent looked at the ticket and my passport and said "yes it is fine" as I watched. She then came back to me and said I would have to change the way my name is listed or I would not be issued another ticket. I showed her the email confirmation I got from Expedia and she was not interested. Very rude Air Canada service. Flight was fine.

### "doubt I'll fly Air Canada again"
I have travelled extensively over the years with many different airlines and, unfortunately, I have to say, I found on my recent flights Sydney to Vancouver return, the service on Air Canada is amongst the slackest I have experienced. On the way back from Vancouver, I had a head cold and needed regular drinks. I buzzed several times for tea / water etc but only once was my request answered. For the rest of the 16 hour journey, I buzzed but to no avail. Each time I needed a drink, or food, I had to get up from my seat, crawl over my fellow passengers, walk to the end of the aircraft to get my own refreshment. The worst part was, the entire crew was having a lovely time sitting down at the back, chatting away to each ignoring passenger requests. When I asked if they had noticed my bell call, they said they didn't hear it. However, when they looked, there were 3 others needing assistance listed on the screen. I wouldn't have heard the bell either if I was in the middle of a conversation. In addition to the lack of service, I feel that there could have been more food offered (it was minimal on such a long flight) and at no stage did the drinks trolley go around. Up to each passenger to request a drink. I guess it's a money saving ploy. The inflight entertainment was limited to a dozen movies that have been out for some time and didn't cater to a range of tastes. On 2 x 16 hour flights, this meant the choice was very limiting so I resorted to reading my book. Also, no wifi. Now that Air Canada has some competition from Sydney to Vancouver, it may be worth the crew lifting their game to remain competitive. On a positive note, the flight crew did a marvellous job getting us from A to B on both flights. Just a pity the cabin crew let the airline down. I doubt I'll fly Air Canada again.

### "cancelled due to weather"
Victoria to Toronto via Vancouver. I was travelling with my 5 children (ages 2 to 12) and their grandma when our flight back to Toronto was cancelled due to weather. I was on the phone approximately 2.5 hours (on hold) until 1:30am at which time I had to hang up to go to bed. The next day I received an e-mail that we had been rebooked for the following day, meaning we would need to spend another night in Victoria. I called and spoke to a very rude representative and asked what am I supposed to do now with my 5 kids and their grandma and she replied that you need to book yourself a hotel room and that was it. The statement was, since weather is not in our control we're not obligated to pay hotel, food, transfers. Furthermore, only half the flights flying the same route to Vancouver were cancelled that day, all within an hour of each other. That one night cost me an extra $400 I didn't plan on spending. I am disgusted with Air Canada. One positive thing I will say, especially on our flight back to Toronto from Vancouver, flight attendants were very kind and compassionate.

### "offers high quality flights"
I have never understood the bad rap that Air Canada gets. I have flown both main Canadian airlines (AC and WJ) lots and without really caring one way or the other, and have felt that Air Canada consistently offers high quality flights and flight service. On this recent flight I was in Premium Economy on a Boeing 787-8. Leg room and seat width in this cabin is substantially better than in coach, and you get the business class meal (china, glassware, and chilled silverware) with a printed menu and choice of main course. The meal itself is noticeably larger than in coach (if you are in coach, remember that you can ask for an extra meal and they are almost always able to give you one - I've done this on multiple occasions). Being an inter-continental flight, you also get complimentary alcoholic beverages in ALL classes. This flight (as well as AC850 from YYC to London) arrived early. The attendants were attentive and friendly, and airplane was clean, and the service was excellent. The Boeing 787 also compare favourably to other planes; it's noticeably quieter and my ears were popping a lot less because of the increased pressurisation.

### "Washrooms were unhygienic"
Toronto to Dubai. As a proud Canadian, I booked air Canada direct flight to Dubai from Toronto. Flight on time. Nice and big aircraft. Seats compare to other air lines (LH, KLM, Delta) are very small and uncomfortable. The food that was served was one of the lousiest. The cabin staff seem trained not to greet the passenger and not smile while serving. Food served first, drinks served 30 mins after the food. Stupid way to serve for a such a long flight, the aircraft was not equipped with WiFi. Washrooms were unhygienic and after first 5 - 6 hours, no staff was keeping the washrooms clean. This experience made me change my mind and I almost determined not to fly with Air Canada again

### "never go Air Canada again"
Port Elizabeth to Munich via Johannesburg with SAA, and then from Munich to Winnipeg via Toronto with Air Canada. I am a widow, travelling alone at the age of 65. I was most definitely marked as someone easy to dismiss. I had the eTA which is now required by Canadian authorities and I am a UK Citizen. I had checked my luggage in with South African Airways through to Winnipeg and been issued with boarding passes to all my destinations. Upon arrival at the departure gate in Munich I was told my documents were invalid even though they were approved on the Canadian website. My luggage had not been loaded. It was intended I would not fly as the plane was overbooked. I was immediately put up in a Holiday Inn Express and rerouted through Frankfurt, Montreal to Winnipeg 24 hours later. This would not have been done if my paperwork was incorrect - and this same rejected paperwork saw me through to Canada. The ground staff were arrogant and dismissive. They couldn't have been more obstructive. The cabin crew were wonderful, friendly and obliging. Chalk and cheese. I would fly Air Canada only for the cabin crew, unfortunately they are not the ones to deal with. I shall never go Air Canada again.

### "meal was excellent"
Flew from Toronto to San Francisco with Air Canada to attend a conference. I booked a latitude fair, then used E-Upgrade points to switch that to business class at no cost. Flight was on time and pleasant. Cabin Crew were attentive throughout the flight, and the meal was excellent (Canadian AAA Beef Tenderloin with mashed potatoes). The airframe is an older 767 with the classic pods (international business class, lay-flat seat), but is preferable to the A320 with only has trans-border business class (larger standard seat).

### "impressed by the personalized service"
Montreal to Tokyo NRT via Calgary with Air Canada. On both segments I was impressed by the personalized service provided by cabin staff. The meals were delicious and plenty of drinks. The business class product on both flights YUL-YYC and YYC-NRT was dated, old, but the FA made it feel great. It is sad that Air Canada business and economy services are so far apart making difficult to rate this company as a whole because 1 experience in their high density economy kills what ever good you could think of Air Canada. Nevertheless I had a good experience on AC business class cabins today.

### "absolutely worst airline"
Air Canada is the worst airline I have travelled with. I was double charged for a flight alteration 7 days after the flight. When I realized, I called the airline. The customer support referred me to a link online to email the claims department and was told it would take 5 business days. After 5 business days I sent another email. Then I called Air Canada and was told that the other agent was wrong and it would be 10 business days. 10 business days came, no response. I called back today on the 15th business day and was told it was two weeks, so "technically they're only one day overdue". The agent today was most arrogant, unhelpful and useless. Her tone was terrible and I'm kicking myself for not getting her name. Absolutely worst airline and I wish I could take back my business with them.

### "disappointing Air Canada experience"
Hong Kong to Montreal via Toronto. I have been a proud frequent flyer of Air Canada for years now but lately AC has given away it status of premium north American carrier to a high density money maker budget airline. AC is not cheap compared to flying United, EVA, ANA or even Lufthansa is most cases but the company has modified their cabin configuration to the mighty 3x4x3 on a B77L that is not built for such capacity especially when it is meant to do utlra long haul flights. Flying from Hong Kong to Toronto for 15h squeezed in those seats was not a comfortable ride at all. Good points: I got my special meals. IFE contain was good. FA just doing their job nothing warm. Disappointing Air Canada experience!

### "I had a cascade of events"
Shanghai to Toronto, I had a cascade of events which started on the tarmac and in the air which embarrassed the crew. When I boarded my entertainment system and handset was dead. One flight attendant said to grab the seat behind me before we depart. Another attendant said I could not take that chair as it was broken and out of service. The first attendant rebooted the entertainment system and though I could not use the hand set, I was able to use the touch screen. I like to listed to classical music but there was no Mozart, no classical. A drink was served on my tray which collapsed. Now I am soaked with a double scotch. I have an extra shirt in my carry on and go to Business class bathroom where the sink was broken and wrapped in wide, colored adhesive tape. But its fine, when things go wrong, the flight attendant gives you a plastic Maple leaf pin right from his lapel. And documents the whole thing and submits it while we are in the air. I really did appreciate that. A month later I received an the email which was a voucher to use when you book a flight with us. The thing is that the voucher is worth 2 percent of my business class ticket's cost.

### "terrible customer service from Air Canada"
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. I paid for the first morning Air Canada flight. My flight was delayed by one hour with on-going maintenance issues. We were told numerous times that the issues were fixed. Expecting departure at 6:40, it is now 8:00. Passengers were not offered beverages or anything for the discomfort and delay. When I arrived on the flight I had an issue with my bag and there was no room, when I asked the flight attendant for assistance she said "put it where there is room" this was not only rude but inconsiderate. Then finding out there was no room I was told to check in my bag. I am currently on flight AC1620. Finally at 8:04 we were offered a glass of water. The flight attendant walked by only allowing the passengers from the aisle seat to have water. I was not expecting this terrible customer service from Air Canada.

### "great service onboard"
Chicago to Toronto with Air Canada. Great service onboard this comfortable flight. Flight attendants and ground staff were very polite. Inflight entertainment has lots of selection and works very well. Only negative was that no food is served on the this flight unless you pay but I knew about it before I booked the flight, it was a worth the deal. Would definitely fly with Air Canada again.

### "worst customer service experienced"
Booked from Brisbane to Calgary via Vancouver with Air Canada in Premium Economy. Got off loaded in Brisbane because of a late Virgin Australia connection (on same ticket) that got in 50 min before departure. No one even tried to let us make the connection. Was downgraded to Economy from Premium Economy the next day even though Business seats were available. Could not upgrade to Business Class with money because had no aero club membership. No one in the call centre could do the upgrade because there was no manager, which seems to be the title for the only staff who can make decisions. Told that we were lucky to be on the flight at all. They forgot to rebook our son on the next leg to Calgary and so had to take a later flight with 5 hour layup instead of 1.5 hours. Paid for Maple Leaf club and were told in Vancouver this only applied to 1 flight being the return flight where is a 1.5 hour change and could not tansfer to another leg. Dont fly Air Canada - worst customer service experienced in well over 400 flights.

### "would describe my experience as mediocre"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Dallas Fort Worth on January 14, 2017, in Economy. I would describe my experience as mediocre, a C in terms of classroom grades. The plane left Toronto about 45 minutes late, since the plane arrived with a delay from Montréal. There was no apology from Air Canada. The plane was completely full. There was, however, sufficient room in the overhead lockers, as ground staff had warned people to check large pieces (free of charge at the gate, at check-in, my suitcase was 35 CAD). Seating is very tight on the Embraer 175, when the person in front of me reclined his seat, there were about 10 inches from my head to the top of his seat. Thus, the three-hour flight was pretty uncomfortable. Likewise, when I used the bathroom at the back of the plane, I found that I could not fully stand up (I am 6'1"). For service, the cabin crew came through once with soft drinks; everything else had to be purchased. At the end of the flight, I asked one of the cabin attendants where our luggage would be arriving: "On the carousel," she said - not very helpful, as there are about ten of those at terminal E. So, again, this was the average type of flight in the contemporary world of air travel. In my opinion, the Embraer 175 is too small a plane for the distance flown.

### "my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport"
Brisbane to Vancouver. I flew Air Canada Business Class flight AC36 from Brisbane to Edmonton via Vancouver to visit my in-laws as I do every year during Christmas. I am impressed with their new aircraft. The business class seats were comfortable, food was not spectacular however I was happy with it. There was only one washroom dedicated for business class, it was very small and not clean. There were two other washrooms that were shared with premium economy class. Overall, I was not very impressed with the washrooms arrangements. The cabin crew were helpful but not the best. The overall inflight experience was a positive one. Despite the food being so-so, and I was not impressed with the washrooms, I had a restful and comfortable flight. My experience went downhill when I couldn't find my luggage at the airport. Later that day, Air Canada confirmed that my luggage was left at Brisbane Airport. I was waiting on the phone for one solid hour until I reached an operator who told me the best they can do is $50 per day compensation before the luggage arrive. I tried to explain to her that with the freezing cold winter in Edmonton, I could not possibly buy anything warm enough with $50. However, she could not do anything else and Air Canada does not have a customer service phone line. My luggage arrived 2 days later at my in-laws house. By then, I was in Orlando for a 6 days trip in which I had to purchase 6 days worth of essential items in Orlando. Anyhow, I eventually got my luggage when I returned to Edmonton, however, I never received the compensation Air Canada promised. I tried to reach them with their phone line only to be told that I had to write them a "letter". I called Brisbane Airport and was given the manager's number. I called the manager and was told that this was a secure number and that the airport should have never given this number to me and hung up. I have sent Air Canada an email and a Facebook message. I am yet to hear anything from them. I am very disappointed that all these years I had been a loyal customer to Air Canada and this is how I am treated.

### "seat configuration is simply awful"
Munich to Toronto with Air Canada. We were met by the AC Concierge and promptly processed through the check-in formalities. The flight was delayed by a full hour due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort. The FA's were all very nice and worked hard throughout the flight. The in flight service director on the other hand was smug and very condescending. Food was OK for Economy but portions were very small. IFE was descent but music selection remains obscure. Flight arrived late and was otherwise uneventful.

### "new Business Class certainly an improvement"
Flew Air Canada from Munich to Toronto. Our group travelling together January 3 ranged in age of over 60 to 3 children aged 11 months, 2 and 4 years. All of the flight crew were not only professional but extremely pleasant and caring. Food presentation excellent, entertainment program good and seat comfort fine. Even though pod system the layout does allow for communication amongst passengers - the prior claustrophobic feeling has been eliminated. Pilot "connected" in a very nice way with our grandchildren and all of us too. New Business Class certainly an improvement. Check in process civilised. Only minus is Munich Airport which has long walks and different floor levels to conquer till aircraft position can be reached. Excellent experience and personally I was relieved to be able to state that the whole flight went smooth and enjoyable for all of us - including very young passengers. On a side note - the outbound flight on the 23rd of December was good too.

### "expected what we paid for"
Vancouver to Sydney. So disappointed. We paid extra money for more legroom and, whilst understanding the reality of cramped spaces on any airline, expected what we paid for. We have done this on several occasions with Virgin and found the seating and surrounding area to be more than satisfactory. Instead the area in front was constantly used by passengers to access toilets on the other side of the plane and for a toddler (parents seated three rows behind) to run backwards and forwards. The space to the right of us over the wing was used by passengers to stretch and chat the entire overnight flight. The stewards/ stewardesses were nowhere in sight and surfaced only at meal time. The passenger seated beside my husband was a very large man who required an extension belt, no problem and not judging him, but it made for a very uncomfortable flight. Being a large man, he occupied some of my husband's seat as well as his own. When it was obvious (before take-off) the flight was going to be difficult due to this factor, the stewardess responded that she could understand it would be uncomfortable but the flight was full and there was nothing she could do. We contacted Air Canada upon our return to request a refund of the additional money outlaid and were told that they offer a high standard of service and apologised that we disagreed - basically 'bad-luck'!

### "what a terrible shame"
What has happened to our beautiful Airline? We always flew Air Canada for the service and the people but now I fly further to avoid Air Canada. On Dec 31 2016, AC873, FRA-YYZ, either the FA who worked the rear business class section was getting ready for retirement or she was having a really bad day because her unfriendly, take it or leave it, monosyllabic attitude was quite pronounced. The new business class seat on the 777-300 is actually not so bad. The screen's a bit close but it's big and the seat depth is a bit short (I could never get the foot rest up to a comfortable height) but there's lots of space and charging stations and places for things. Very mediocre wine selection, I think one choice of either old or new world in red or white and as I said very mediocre. I hear they have espresso's and cappuccino's but they were not offered. I ordered the vegetarian meal which came out vegan and really it's mind boggling what the kitchen at AC thinks vegetarians eat. Years ago I had an amazing veg meal on a flight from Toronto to Calgary, roasted veg with baked tofu, really well done but this was some tasteless roasted eggplant on Polenta with a tablespoon of tomato sauce and that's pretty much what AC serve these days. All of this would have been overlooked if the FA had shown any kind of welcome or pleasant attitude. It was bare minimum, no more and definitely no service with a smile. AC 610, YYZ-YHZ started out well and I slept through most of it until the last 15 minutes of landing approach, when a little boy two rows behind us in business class, started to piercingly scream for his mother and was unconsolable screaming "Momee" until we landed. I thought maybe mommy was meeting the plane but it turned out that "Momee! was the FA in-charge. To her credit, she remained the FA in-charge and didn't get up but probably not a good idea to fly with the family. I was a loyal AC flyer for decades but now Lufthansa and United I like better and I fly them 90% of the time. The timing on this route was deciding factor in flying with AC this time but that will not happen again. LH FA's are always welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable up front. Other airlines amenity kits are becoming collectables but not so the hideous herringbone, sparse offering on AC. LH, Eva and Thai's Rimova amenity kits are a reason to fly them and not available anywhere else. I think AC have forgotten that many of us love to fly and it's about a happy experience. They are making money again and lots of it but at the expense of the customer service experience. What a terrible shame.

### "use phone but no headphones"
Air Canada - I thought they were a full service airline. Paid over AUD$500 for two of us to fly from Quebec a short hop to Toronto. This doesn't include checked baggage however (an extra $60) nor assigning a seat (that's an extra online fee as well). On arrival at the airport we realised the flight was full and when checking in on the kiosks we had been assigned separate seats on the aircraft despite being on the same booking. Fortunately a passenger next to me agreed to swap. The checkin agent was helpful only in explaining the reasons why we had been seated separately (a full aircraft, people on standby - not sure how any of this was relevant to not seat 2 people on the same booking next to each other). Now what Air Canada would likely say is that if we wanted seats we should have paid the online fee and seat assigned ourselves. It's a pity they have this type of model when they really are the only airline flying between many of these places in Canada. On a positive note, we did arrive and depart pretty close to schedule considering a big snowstorm had just been through the area. However I had to laugh when we arrived in a Toronto and the flight attendant made a PA asking all on board if we could let those with tight connections off the aircraft first, this was while we were waiting 10 minutes short of the bay for a marshaller to come and guide the aircraft onto the bay. I'd avoid Air Canada again except in a case such as this when they were the only nonstop option. On another note as well Air Canada have a policy that no headphones can be used on landing. But, portable electronic devices are permitted. So, you can use the phone but no headphones. When I enquired as to the reason behind this, Air Canada advised that this was for two reasons. Firstly, so they can ensure that you don't miss any PA announcements. And secondly, they can cause a hazard if you trip over the, during an evacuation. I have travelled a lot on many different airlines and this is the first I have heard of such an absurd policy.

### "professional and pleasant"
Flew from Newark to Fredericton, New Brunswick as part of a code share with United, flying via Montreal. When purchasing a code share flight United cannot provide seat assignments however a call to Air Canada with the flight confirmation info from United did let me get advance seat assignments. Ground crew and flight crews were professional and pleasant and both flights boarded and left on time. The CRJ's were cramped and not particularly clean and one of the planes had used tissues stuffed into the magazine pocket. Montreal proved to be very nice airport, especially after Newark but having to go through security for the third time that day was annoying.

### "it lacked in service"
Delhi to Toronto. Although Air Canada had a newer plane, the Boeing 787, it lacked in service. Executive pod seats are very comfortable. Fully flat bad recline. Lots of place to store things like phone, wallet. Food tasted fresh and had decent flavours. One of the washrooms wasn't working - the one in the front right by the cockpit. This is not a big deal for a 7 hr flight but a 15 hrs flight it is. As a result we had access to two washrooms behind the cabin - still not bad. Air Canada did a horrible job in terms of controlling who can access which washroom. Folks from premium economy and economy were using the business washrooms. I mean I paid extra for a reason. Every time I had to visit the washroom - there was a line up. My wife was sleeping and didn't hear the announcement that the front washroom is not working - when she went to the front, one of the staff members rudely said, "we told you it's not working" My wife apologized and came back. Service - Before take off the staff brought drinks like champagne and orange juice, and my wife asked for a ginger ale. Staff initially brought sprite by mistake and then forgot about it. When my wife asked for ginger ale again she was told we cannot serve on ground. Initially we were not given the menu. When I complained they brought it. And then they took away my wife's food menu by mistake. Every time she asked for a menu - staff did a horrible job explaining what's available instead of giving a menu. In the morning she asked for omelette and was still given crepes. Everyone else was given 3 choices for breakfast. But some like myself were given 2. This is how inconsistent the service was. They definitely need to train their staff better.

### "left his phone in the gate area"
Denver to Toronto. My husband left his phone charging in the gate area at Denver International Airport. Upon realizing it, he alerted the flight attendant. She told us the door was closed so it was naturally too late. However, she called the gate crew and the phone was found, and we were told the phone would be sent to us -simply talk to ground staff in Toronto. After doing that and calling Air Canada 10+ times now, I can't find anybody that knows what has happened or what will happen with the phone. Lost and found should be a very easy procedural thing. Don't know why it vexes Air Canada so much.

### "they lied to people"
In all my years of flying, the only upsetting flying instances I have had have been with Air Canada. I understand many variables are out of their control, but the lack of care I have seen and heard about them showing to their customers is disappointing. Tonight is one of those occasions when my flight from Halifax to Montreal for 6.10 was delayed to 6.50. That's no problem, and they told us multiple times during this 40 minute delay that our flight was in the air and on the way. 10 minutes before we are supposed to take off, they announce that the plane still hasn't left because of the poor visibility in Montreal and that it would be delayed for much longer. I understand that the plane can't take off, but everyone has been left upset because they lied to people saying the flight was on the way when it would appear they had no idea where it actually was. Since this incident the flight has been delayed twice more without notice from the staff, the time at the gate has simply changed to show a half hour later departure. We've now been waiting for 4 hours, and can't get any information on what the situation holds because the staff have left the gate. It is clear that they will say whatever it takes to get their customers to shut up, and I will be avoiding this airline wherever possible in the future.

### "left stranded at an empty airport"
Air Canada flight originated from Toronto was supposed to be take off at 6:55pm, Dec 18, 2016. The flight did not take off over an hour later with no clear known reason. The flight was sitting on runway more than an hour. Finally took off 90 mins late caused me missed my connection from San Francisco to Ontario, California. Arrived at San Francisco 10:30pm, my connection flight has already gone. There was no one there to redirect or assist. My wife and I were left stranded at an empty airport with no food or sheet to cover. No direction of when the next flight what so ever. Contacted Air Canada customer service and no one to assist, except useless automated phone directory, which get me no answer to my needs. I truly do not believe how an airline could provide such a poor service and left passenger in a strange place without any service. I will not be travelling with Air Canada anymore and I would never recommend this airline to others.

### "left us stranded at the airport"
Recently, my wife and I were flying from Rochester to Cairo by way of Toronto and London Heathrow. My wife and I were originally told at the gate in Toronto that the flight from Toronto to London was delayed 15 minutes, then it became 30 minutes. Then we were told that a new plane had to be brought in because of a mechanical issue and it would be about a 1.5 hour delay. We explained our concern to the agent at the gate, because we only had a 2 hour layover in Heathrow and were worried about missing our connecting flight to Cairo. She said that the plane would "make up time in the air". Ultimately, we actually left more than 2 hours later than scheduled because the new plane was also late. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Cairo. There are several exacerbating factors than just a delay. When we got on the plane, I told the flight attendant that we were going to be rushed to get to our connecting flight and asked if we could be let out first. Her response was "We'll see". When we landed, we were not given any accommodation whatsoever. We didn't land until approximately 10:15 p.m. The flight crew said that "if" we missed our connecting flight (scheduled to leave at 10:30), we should go upstairs to the ticket office to get re-booked. Apparently, they didn't know, despite servicing that airport, that Heathrow pretty much shuts down at 10pm and so the ticket offices were already deserted by the time we got there and the terminal gates shut down. This left us stranded at the airport, with no instructions or assistance, or any idea what we were supposed to do. We happened to ask a worker at the airport and he said we should check to see if our bags were there. Come to find out, our bags had been taken off the plane and set aside (not on the carousel). No one with Air Canada let us know our bags would be dropped off at Heathrow, rather than go straight to Cairo as originally planned. Obviously, whomever removed the bags knew we wouldn't be able to get on the next flight, even though no one else seemed to. If it hadn't been for the airport employee, we wouldn't have even known our bags were and they would have been inadvertently abandoned. We had to stay at the airport until the ticket office re-opened at 6:30 a.m. Once we got there, the Air Canada employee said a ticket agent would have been waiting outside the plane for us, to provide a hotel room. I'm not sure how we were supposed to know this when we were told conflicting information by the flight crew and the only people we saw waiting at the gate were there to help some disabled travelers in need of assistance. No one had a sign with our name or anything which would allow us to know that steps had been taken to provide us with a place to sleep. As a result of this delay, we lost a full day of a paid tour in Egypt and incurred expenses at the airport for food and beverages, since the next flight wasn't until 2pm that following day. In our complaint to Air Canada, they offered a discount for a future booking and didn't even address reimbursement for our out-of-pocket loss. I've made numerous international flights and this is the first time I've had any substantive issues with an airline. Air Canada's attitude, communication, and helpfulness are, by far, the absolute worst of any airline I've dealt with.

### "would expect better service"
Toronto to Montreal. For the price of flights and airline rating you would expect better service. Air Canada doesn't seem customer centred and the in-flight entertainment options are minimal at best on this trip. Would not recommend this airline.

### "put the needs of customers second"
Montreal to Toronto. The plane was delayed by around half an hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Halfway through the flight, about 40 minutes or so before we were scheduled to land at Billy Bishop Airport in downtown Toronto, the crew announced that the plane needed to be diverted to Pearson Airport, around 1hr away from downtown. Of course everyone was upset, but the reason given for the diversion was that (due to the delayed departure), the downtown airport was closed due to the night curfew. It was around 21.45hrs at the time, so I assumed the curfew was at 22.00hrs. Once we landed at Pearson, a manager came onboard and contradicted what was stated earlier. The plane was diverted because the crew were based at and needed to return to Pearson Airport. There were around 40 passengers aboard, and the time and inconvenience of these passengers were less important than the time of their crew. While I empathise with the plight of the hardworking crew, it says a lot about an airline that would put the needs of its customers second. And the airport curfew at Billy Bishop that the passengers were informed about and initially used as the justification for the diversion? It's 23.00hrs, meaning we had plenty of time to land. So the airline lied.

### "staff friendly, attentive and helpful"
Excellent flight on Air Canada from London Heathrow to Vancouver. The staff were friendly, attentive and helpful throughout the flight. Frequent water service and checks to ask if passengers needed anything. Lunch was above airline average and the seat was quite comfortable for a 9 hour flight. Reasonable IFE though not as good as Qantas and BA which I fly often. Air Canada is by far the best of the North American air carriers, in fact I avoid all others. Staff did a great job on a very full flight.

### "no customer service for lost items"
Don't use Air Canada if there's the remote possibility you might leave something of value on the plane. Their chat service and baggage centre number's is unresponsive (no one answers the phone or chat sessions) with only five days to recover the item. While travelling from December 18, 2016 from Ottawa to Moncton the second flight, AC7502, was delayed on the Montreal tarmac for an hour and a half. As I had a two hour layover between the arrival of the flight in Moncton and the departure of my connecting bus this would only leave a half hour but with the baggage about twenty minutes at best. My issue isn't with the delayed flight but with the complete and total lack of customer support. While rushing to get off the plane to ensure I got to the bus stop outside the airport in time I had accidentally left my Kobo eBook reader in the pouch on the seat in front of me. I only realized it was missing once I was on the bus. I tried repeatedly calling the Air Canada toll free baggage centre number 1-888-689-2247 over the next few days and after an hour of waiting each time never got a representative. The recorded message prior to the hold music advised for missing items on a plane to "chat" with a chat representative. I tried that as well and found that not only was the chat window freezing and unresponsive (if you tried typing there was a significant delay before letters would show in the chat window) but I never could get ahold of a chat representative after another hour of waiting. I wasn't sure if the chat session was working and I tried repeatedly over the next few days without success. I had found, though, that the Air Canada policy was to hold lost and found items for five days. It's now the fifth day and after repeated attempts I still can't get a response by phone or chat. I also sent a form filled message to their general customer support feedback but only received a confirmation of receipt and not actual feedback on the lost item. My issue isn't with the delayed flight or poor customer service. My issue is that there's surprisingly no customer service for lost items. I advise anyone who doesn't want to be in the same position and would at least a chance at recovering a forgotten item left on a plane not to use Air Canada.

### "it was another good flight"
Amsterdam to Ottawa via London. Unlike the previous two times when I transferred at Toronto Pearson, I now made a stopover at London Heathrow so it was an interline flight with British Airways. I tend to choose for Air Canada on the route between Amsterdam and Ottawa because it is generally cheaper and has a better schedule than the competition. It was a really smooth 7-hour long plane trip, and the airplane used on the London to Ottawa route is the usual Boeing 767-300ER, an old but always reliable workhorse in the medium-sized, long-range plane repertoire. The cabin crew members were nice and worked very efficiently. I use Air Canada often and while the drinks and snacks are good, I have come to refusing the main meal because in economy class they always serve the same two things and they're simply uneatable. I really do believe that Air Canada could come up with better standard economy class meals. The legroom was good enough and there was a good choice of films and shows on the inflight entertainment system. Main meal aside, it was another good flight with Canada's main airline.

### "I didn't have a seat"
Montréal to Toronto. I arrived at the airport, after not being able to check in online. After arriving, Air Canada informed me I didn't have a seat! Apparently they overbooked the flight, so if someone didn't show up I'd be able to get on, otherwise I'd have to take a later flight. I was told if I want to ensure getting on one of their flights in the future, I should log on 24 hours before flight, and pay to select a seat online. What a joke. So my 400 dollar ticket counts for nothing. My entire trip was a waste. Thanks Air Canada!

### "seat was very uncomfortable"
Flew Air Canada from Vancouver, YVR to London, LHR. The premium economy space was nice but the seat was very uncomfortable. So bad in fact, that I went to the back of the economy cabin and found a centre row of seats to lie down on. Trouble was, some flight attendants congregated in the row behind, talking and laughing. I asked - politely - if they could be quieter. Didn't work as they came back again, so a sleepless flight. Some FAs rude too. FA selling duty free said 'why don't you read the guide' when I asked about a particular scotch. Inflight entertainment selections poor and touch screen controls unresponsive. Food mediocre at best. Incredible, no proper coffee service with the slice of breakfast cake - has to ask. All in all, very poor - way below AF and BA which I often fly on to Europe. AC performance well below a 4 star airline.

### "cabin crew perfunctory at best"
First time flying Air Canada from New York to Montreal and return. Had a wonderful experience on Air Canada Express operated by Sky Regional on the outbound flight. Friendly, efficient ground staff at LGA, very clean, well-maintained aircraft and very friendly flight attendants. Was looking forward to my return with them on Air Canada mainline. Booked a seat in the "Preferred" section for extra legroom. The agents at YUL were very friendly but the cabin crew had no smiles to spare, and were surly to boot. They were perfunctory at best, and took zero interest in their jobs. A better experience than American Eagle or Delta Connection on the same route because of the aircraft used, but the mainline Air Canada flight attendants could use some training in customer care and courtesy.

### "cabin crew very friendly"
Toronto to Hong Kong. Overall, Air Canada provided me with the basics of this long haul trip. The food was good and the portion is definitely enough for a flight. Entertainment was one of the great things I enjoyed on this flight, a very through collection of music, TV, movies etc. Air Canada could loosen up their seating for longer flights because they really have to understand this is their customer's home for the next 12-16 hours. Make the seats wider would be a great improvement instead of trying to use every space possible to squish in passengers. Basics provided and I'm really not that picky about anything else. Cabin crew were very friendly on this long haul flight, they will tend to your needs very continually and doing everything with their given resources to make you have a better flight experience.

### "IFE with a good choice"
St Johns to Toronto with Air Canada in economy. The check in was ok - although a gold member, I was not given the code to enter the lounge and had to spend time finding it. The flight was very good. It was only 3 hours long, seats had IFE with a good choice. SeatS were OK for a short haul flight. Cabin crew was quite attentive. We were offered a hot drink. I would expect also a small snack for the cost of this flight. Yet, in my view air Canada remain one of the top North American airlines.

### "a reasonable flight"
Toronto to Rochester with Air Canada in economy. This short flight is carried out by a very small airplane, with a total of about 20 seats. Boarding was very fast (only 4 passengers). The pilots were very friendly, and the co pilot gave us safety instructions before taking off. The flight was noisy and there was a bit of draft inside the plane. Seats were not particularly comfortable, but they were OK for a short flight across the lake. When arriving at ROC, our luggage was promptly delivered to the terminal and arrived with us. A reasonable flight. No frills.

### "seats were uncomfortable"
New Delhi to Vancouver. Seats were hard and uncomfortable. No headphones given. Cabin crew was not patrolling the cabin when not serving. Press the button to call them and they took 10-12 mins to come to me. The food served is not enough for me, and had to ask them for something to eat. They do not offer alcohol and don't carry it on top of their trollies. They will give it to only if you ask them but they will not ask you for a refill. No hot towels either.

### "couldn't have been more friendly"
I'm female and a senior and I had wheelchair assistance for this flight from Windsor to Edmonton return via Toronto. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and courteous to me. I can walk some distance but the wheelchair assistance allowed me to not have such a tiring or overwhelming day. I would highly recommend flying with Air Canada and hope to do so in the future. Thank you again for your assistance.

### "no complaints about the short flight"
First time flying Air Canada to fly from the U.S. to Montreal in the province of Quebec. The flight, in general, was comfortable and did not have any guffaws, save for a bumpy descent (which, I must emphasize, is not in any way the crew's nor the pilots' fault). The plane was only half-full, and we were asked to distribute ourselves in the flight. Cabin service consisted of beverages, no nibbles and on both segments of the flight, the flight attendants asked if we wanted a second round of drinks. No complaints about the short flight and will certainly fly with them again in the future.

### "the plane was only about one half full"
Flew London Heathrow to Toronto and return. Our return flight was on a Tuesday afternoon 3pm flight with Air Canada on a 777. We were surprised to see the plane was only about one half full. I haven't seen that in a while. It made for a very pleasant flight. My wife and I each had a row of seats to spread out in. The Air Canada staff was very good. They were very good about beverage service. The meal however was almost inedible. It was a beautiful day and a portion of the flight was over Greenland. Some great scenery. We were on time and with the open seats we had a great flight. Too bad you can't count on that.

### "about as good as economy gets"
We flew Air Canada from Toronto To London Heathrow on a Boeing 777. The flight left on time, almost midnight. The flight was completely full. We had seats in the back of the plane. Most of the rows of seats are 3 - 4 - 3. In the back some rows are only 2 across. That's what we were assigned. There was a little extra room to the outside seat, but, the seats were pretty cramped, knee room was minimal. The food was not very good. It was a night flight, so we weren't very hungry. The entertainment system was so-so, The movie selection was not very good. A few recent movies and some old TV shows. Even the music selection was minimal. The Air Canada staff was pretty good. They were friendly and helpful, even though the plane was full. They made frequent passes with cold water. All in all it was a pretty good flight. Economy flights are pretty basic, This was about as good as economy gets.

### "the airline of my choice"
Montreal to New York-LaGuardia. I travel often with Air Canada because it's the airline of my choice and there's always good route options out of Montreal which is one of their main hubs. I chose LaGuardia airport because there's more flights than Newark airport. The flights were operated by Sky Regional their airline partner on short haul legs. I was suppose to take a morning flight however I ended up taking an afternoon flight because I had a Business Class booking on stand by and the morning flights were oversold. My flights were full, gates agents were asking for volunteers to check in some oversize carry on bags. I had a seat on the economy cabin because there were upgrades last minute. The return flight was Business class. All the flights were good. The service was pretzels with a drink in economy class and a light snack with a drink in Business class. The flight attendant was very nice on the inbound flight, taking good care of me and my family during the flight. The flight attendant was fine on the return leg but she was a bit exhausted. Inflight  entertainment was very good for a short flight. There was a choice of movies and tv shows on the screens on each seat. I took the same leg a few years ago on American Eagle and the aircraft was smaller no in flying entertainment. The service with Air Canada is much better. I would fly again with this airline without hesitation.

### "best carrier on this route"
Istanbul to Ottawa via Toronto with Air Canada. TK from Izmir to Istanbul, normal flight, rushed boarding. Air Canada 787 Dreamliner from Istanbul to Toronto. Very strict security in Istanbul for Air Canada, very reassuring. The flight in economy was excellent, aisle seat. Very comfortable seat, I am 5'8" and had no problem with room, seat between me and the window seat was empty. The flight attendants couldn't have been nicer, great service, after first meal and drink service, water runs every half hour, the flight attendants didn't disappear, and were always available. Mid flight snack and another meal before landing, all acceptable and hot. The size of the windows, humidity levels and fresh air were wonderful, no dryness. An excellent aircraft and product from Air Canada. Flight from Toronto to Ottawa was normal on an A320. So happy Air Canada started flying direct to Istanbul a couple of years ago, they really are the best carrier on this route, and I have flown, Turkish, Air France, KLM and Lufthansa between Turkey and Canada over the past 9 years.

### "not worth the money"
Hong Kong to Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada several times both long-haul with the Dreamliner and short-haul within Canada. Biggest complaints: A meal is not served on flights within Canada, even though it's 4-5 hours long and the price is very high. You basically get a small bag of pretzel or a cookie. On the long-haul flights, I dont know why the food on flights to Asia is way better than to Europe. Second thing on the long-haul flights, there are not enough washroom. All flights on the B787 people were constantly lining up in front of the washrooms. I do not think it's worth the money because the amount you pay for your flights in Canada is ridiculously high but you get minimum service.

### "staff always understanding"
Toronto to Vancouver. As a nervous flyer I find the Air Canada staff to always be understanding. The new dreamliner planes have a configuration that doesn't squish 4 people in a row in the middle. The interior ceiling of the aircraft is very high so it doesn't feel as claustrophobic as some of the smaller planes. I always fly with AC domestic.

### "the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown"
For a while now, I have believed that Air Canada have the edge over British Airways on this route. Whereas BA seem to have slipped into complacency and slimming down their service, Air Canada have upped their game and provided superior service and comfort. However, this month I had the displeasure of flying on their new 787 in economy class. Although the service was, as usual, very good, the seats were the most uncomfortable I have flown in for a long time. The new 787 economy seat is incredibly narrow, offering little sideways movement and virtually no room for the arms. When I managed to rest my left arm on the seat, I was setting off the call bell because the entertainment controls are located exactly where you would rest your arm, very poor design indeed. I also noticed that the quality of inflight catering has dropped, too. I had only one option to choose from: a rather unpleasant overcooked pasta dish which was, basically, pasta with tinned tomato on it and some cheese. I would like to be able to say I will stick with Air Canada, and if I am able to fly premium economy or business, I likely would. If I was forced to take an economy flight, I am fairly sure I will be looking elsewhere.

### "flight crew were pretty polite"
Flew Air Canada on a leisure trip to Toronto in August and I had a pretty good experience. From boarding the flight crew were pretty polite and kind and they kept this attitude for the entire flight. Seat spacing in the front of the economy cabin was excellent although it seemed to be a bit narrower in the aft part. Spacing allowed me to have a comfortable outbound flight and to rest quietly on the inbound night flight to Milan. On both flight airplane left the gate later than the schedule resulting in half an hour delay on the scheduled arrival in Toronto while we landed on time in Milan. Food wasn't bad, had lunch and a snack during the flight to Toronto while dinner and breakfast on the flight to Milan. For lunch and dinner passengers can choose between pasta or chicken menu, the snack is a sort of piadina containing vegetables or chicken. Breakfast was a cookie with coffee, juice or whatever you prefer. Good experience at all.

### "poor customer service"
Halifax to London Heathrow via Toronto. We booked a flight to London for my wife. We made sure it was the direct flight as well to make it easier for her. Also booked it early to make sure we got what we wanted. Near the departure date, we got an e mail to say that her itinerary was changed to via Toronto. I phoned the airline and they told me the flight had been taken off and said book another day or accept what you have. It was a take it or leave it situation. Of course we had to take it. So she endured a long and difficult day as she is less able and the connection was rushed and it was tough. Imagine her annoyance when she finally got to Heathrow to find the direct flight we previously booked arriving at much the same time! They also managed to lose her baggage! Contact with Air Canada customer service was difficult. No response to the web mail submission. Telephone calls just produced advice to resubmit the complaint - which I did and still no response. In the end I had to badger them on social media to get any contact. It took a week to get anything from them. Their response was that some time after taking our flight off, it was put back again and people who had that flight cancelled were not given the opportunity to return to that flight. So those who were wise enough to book early lost out, while those who booked late got what we were denied. They said that as a goodwill gesture they would offer us 15% discount on our next flight. Useless as we don't intend flying again this year. Hardly good will as it was their poor customer service that caused all this.

### "I do not recommend them"
I've been a regular customer with Air Canada for many years, but I've had two very negative experiences with them. I took the business class route from Toronto to Sydney and the interior was disappointing. The meals were awful and my headphones didn't work. My return flight was booked in error on a wrong day, and when I called to make a change to it was hung up on by a frustrated rep who refused to hear my complaint to the end and figured it was probably easiest to just hang up the call rather than deal with the issue. When I called back and explained what had happened, the new rep was unapologetic and didn't even attempt to rectify the issue in any way. They've lost my business and I do not recommend them.

### "2 days of nightmare"
Washington to Montreal. 2 days of nightmare on what should have been a 1.5 hour flight. My flight from IAD to YUL was cancelled, not one person from Air Canada could advise why - huge line was formed and approximately 2 hours later I was offered a flight the following day "first thing in the morning" (for Air Canada, 11 am is "first thing in the morning"). After much effort I was able to convince them to put me on a flight to Montreal connecting through Toronto (yes, my direct flight had to be changed to a flight connecting through Toronto so I could leave on an actual "first in the morning" flight. So when I was finally seeing all this nightmare stop to expand itself, it was actually time for Air Canada's yet other fiasco: they couldn't reprint my ticket because it was bought by my company (business trip) and they didn't know how to do it. It was past 8 pm, I thought I would be home in Montreal at 7 pm, and I was still in Washington DC getting my ticket reprinted. After they were finally able to, I was given a 15 dollars voucher for dinner that I had to use in a hotel's restaurant where the cheapest meal was 30 (or 40 if you added taxes and tip). In addition to that, I was refused a cab service to and from that hotel, and was told to use the free shuttle which started running 4:40 am (and my boarding time was 5:30 am). I arrived Toronto at 8 am and there was a flight to Montreal with room for more people but I couldn't get in because my luggage was on a different schedule, so I had to wait until 10 am to fly to Montreal. Heading to the final moments of this torture which was being "served" by Air Canada, I just hear right now them saying the 10 am flight to montreal was overbooked and not all of us may flight.

### "good flight with attentive attendants"
Tokyo Narita to Vancouver with Air Canada. Good flight with attentive attendants, but it was very difficult to be served in French, one of the official languages of Canada. The flight left on time from Tokyo Narita and arrived on time in Vancouver. Food was good but not exceptional. Confortable new 787-9 with a good IFE system and lot of choices. Overall a good product, but the reference of excellence is still All Nippon Airways.

### "best flight I took"
Vancouver to Toronto. The best flight I took with Air Canada. From the arrival in the cabin to the end of the flight the flight attendants were attentive to our need since we travelled with a baby. Very professional, kind and fully bilingual (French-English) staff. Overall that's the kind of excellent service Air Canada should offer in all her flights. The plane was clean and confortable.

### "service was good"
Toronto to Québec. Service was good but food service was limited. Good seat and clean airplane. Since it's a one hour and half flight it can be interesting to provide eventually some Inflight Entertainment on board and a jet service between these two capitals like it was the case few years ago.

### "Air Georgian is delayed"
Toronto to Detroit. Once again, Air Canada's partner, Air Georgian, is delayed, in Toronto this time. Blaming weather, but I see only sunshine in the lounge. I often fly this route - nice onboard crews. However, Air Georgian has to hold one of the worst on-time departure records. Worst, Air Canada officials doesn't seem to care. Business commuters deserve better, not to mention all of the travellers flying from DTW to YYZ to make international connections, and often disappointed. Why not make this a Jazz route?

### "more than 1 hour late"
Toronto to Washington DC with Air Canada. Earlier this summer I had 8 flights in a row with 3 different airlines arrive more than 1 hour late from the published arrival time. Since then I have been tracking my these delays including my flight tonight from Toronto to Washington. 17 of the last 34 flights I have taken since late June have arrived more than 1 hour late. The majority of these flights (24 of them) have been with Air Canada.

### "huge risk to your travels and finances"
Columbus to Podgorica via Toronto / Istanbul. My Air Canada (AC7344) from CMH-YYZ was delayed, which caused me to miss my connection flight to Istanbul, and from there to Podgorica. Air Canada put me up in a hotel overnight in Toronto, and rebooked my flights through to Podgorica over the following days. However, after spending almost 12 hrs in IST, I wasn't allowed to board my final flight to TGD because Air Canada had failed to issue the ticket in the computer system. Their transfer counter was empty, so I was left with no other choice than to rebook (at my own expense) the final leg of my flight (which left another 12hrs later). In the end, I had to spend 24hrs in the Istanbul airport, and am out $700 for the rebooking, which Air Canada is refusing to reimburse. And the best Air Canada can apparently offer is 30% off a future booking. As if I would every choose to fly with them again. Every step of the way with this company has shown me just how incredibly incompetent they are, and I strongly discourage anyone from ever flying with them. It's a huge risk to both your travels and your finances.

### "specialises in appalling experiences"
Victoria to London Heathrow via Vancouver. Air Canada specialises in providing passengers with appalling experiences. Cancelled my flight from YYJ to YVR at the very last minute. This meant I would miss my flight from YVR to LHR. Air Canada rebooked me on the same flight, but on the following day, meaning I would lose 1 full day from my holiday time. AC staff unhelpful. After much discussion and haggling, I was able to put myself on a later flight from YYJ to YVR, and then from YVR to LHR with a British Airways flight. The lone cabin crew on YYJ to YVR flight AC 8078 appeared so disinterested in passengers - couldn't be bother to even say hello as we boarded and exited the plane. AC 8078 was on a noisy, extremely uncomfortable Bombardier Dash 8-300 propeller plane. Even a 30 minute flight felt like an eternity. Return trip from LHR to YVR and onto YYJ. LHR to YVR on AC high density B777-300ER. Although I had a spare seat next to me, it was impossible to relax, given how cramped the seating was. Aisles were extremely narrow - flight attendants continuously bumped into me. Sleep or rest was impossible. YVR - YYJ sector was again on the Bombardier Dash 8-300 propeller plane. If I can help it, I will never fly AC again.

### "a superb flight"
Vancouver to London Heathrow with Air Canada. My wife and I had a superb flight. The plane was not full so we had plenty of room. Everything worked well, no complaints whatsoever. Checking in was so easy and the staff were very helpful. We also flew Air Canada rouge from Vegas which was equally as good.

### "service is impeccable"
First flight in Business Class with Air Canada from London Heathrow to Montreal. First noted was the ease at T2 and the great service in the Maple Lounge. After take off we were served drinks and snacks that were topped up without waiting for the trolley to come around. Amazing service so far against BA who I normally fly with and Gold member. What is good is the layout of seats, you don't sit facing a random person plus you don't have to climb over anyone to go to the toilet if in a window seat. The tables are great and the cabin crew come and bring a table cloth before they bring the food, another plus better than BA. Appetiser was first class, salmon and salad. Main was a rack of lamb followed by cheese and a selection of ice cream followed by a port. The service is impeccable compared to BA and I think BA is overrated just because of the brand. The plus point is Air Canada is 50% cheaper than BA. So far 3 hours into the flight and cannot fault it. Seats turn into a very comfy spacious bed and again lots of space / storage to put things especially if you wear glasses. Cannot fault Air Canada and it's crew. Looking forward to the return flight.

### "cabin crew very friendly"
Amsterdam to Newark via Toronto with Air Canada. All flights on time, cabin crew very friendly, old 767 but very clean and good IFE. Food was very good and snacks and drinks were served during the flight. Connecting flight to Newark was on an Embraer 175, crew also very friendly. I would fly Air Canada again.

### "experience is eroding my loyalty"
Vancouver to Prince George with Air Canada. I fly this route quite often for work and more than once the plane has been delayed. I understand that mechanical and weather delays happen. However, what is really annoying is that Air Canada hands out these promotion code cards that when you go to claim they never work. I have emailed customer service multiple times with no reply. I went to the Air Canada customer service agents at the airport and they said there is nothing they can do. The last time the stewards tried to hand out one of those cards I laughed said why bother you can't claim them. I have been sharing this experience with other colleagues and they say they have had the same experience which is why they fly WestJet. This experience is eroding my loyalty to Air Canada. If I recommend Air Canada it will be with a caveat.

### "friendly and professional flight attendants"
Flew Air Canada from Quebec to Toronto. Despite a one hour delay, because of the bad weather in Quebec (fog), we had otherwise a good flight to Toronto with friendly and professional flight attendants. Toilet and cabin were clean. We arrived on time for our connecting flight for Tokyo-Narita. One small negative point, they serve only beverages on board.

### "uptight carry-on weight "
Washington DCA to Montreal. Faulty self-service checkin machines that wasted 15 min of checkin process before telling me they were not in function. Unbelievably rude and unhelpful check-in staff. Ridiculously uptight carry-on weight restriction enforcement. Incomprehensible system for carry-on baggage whereby some is put in the hold, but no clear information on how this works, where to leave, where to pick up. Cabin tiny and very tight aisle as well as seat width and depth. Baggage handling damaged my suitcase. Baggage service desk at arrival also very rude in response to this issue.

### "reached the point where enough is enough"
Toronto to Sudbury with Air Canada. For a while I was purposefully flying Air Canada over other carriers as I enjoyed their new inflight entertainment options, but I've reached the point where enough is enough. I could have excused the fact that on about a third of the flights I've taken the sound or screen is broken, as technology fails. I could have excused that they keep adding new fees such as a fee to choose your seat in advance (not just for legroom anymore, for any seat). But this time I feel that I've run into an inexcusably unethical practice that has significantly disrupted my vacation plans. I've been on a multiple-destination vacation, which will take me on 6 flights. Air Canada's pricing structure made it costly to mix and match airlines, so all six flights were with Air Canada. I had decided to cancel the third flight, and drive the distance instead, so that I could see more family members. I didn't care if they charged me for the flight, I just wanted to notify them of the change of plans. When I called Air Canada, they told me that if I did this, they would charge me nearly $400, a $200 cancellation fee as well as the increased cost of the fourth flight, as it would need to be "re-booked". Then they told me that if I didn't pay this amount and didn't show up for the third flight, they would cancel the fourth flight. So even though I was willing to pay the same for less service, they wanted to charge me substantially more. They didn't offer any justification, I'm assuming that it's just designed to take advantage of people who are in a tough spot and have to change their plans, regardless of whether it increases the airline's cost. Pure greed. Even if it leads to additional administration, I couldn't see this amount being reasonable. Then, to top it off, I had asked if I could pay more to switch my last two flights to a later time. Online the price was $761 if I was booking a new flight. However, I was told that to make this change they would charge me almost an extra $1000. I'm absolutely disgusted, and will definitely be sticking to Westjet or other airlines.

### "flight attendants were professional"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Tokyo-Narita. Good flight with the Boeing 787-9. Seats were confortable and the flight attendants were attentive to our need since we travelled with a baby. Despite the fact that the baby food we ordered was available one hour after the first lunch and that the food was ordinary in taste and quantity, overall it was a good flight. The flight attendants were professional.

### "staff seemed tired and stressed"
I flew Air Canada from Montreal to Vancouver in Economy Class. The very full flight seemed doomed from the beginning. Slow boarding - which I think is made worse by the boarding-in-zones method, due to a number of passengers crowding around the boarding gate, followed by even slower service. The 2 staff serving the completely full main cabin seemed tired and stressed. Food and drinks service took hours into the flight and many options were out by the time it finally got to the back of the cabin. The attendants were forgetful about what we'd ordered. The narrow body A320 seems too restrictive for the 5.5 hour flight.

### "staff I talked to was really rude"
La Guardia to Toronto. I travel with Air Canada for business almost once a month. I wanted to talk to the staff regarding standby options but the staff I talked to was really rude and did not even answer my question. I would consider using other options instead of Air Canada from now on. I am very disappointed with their customer service.

### "needs to improve in a couple of areas"
My husband and I travelled from Vancouver to Sydney with Air Canada in September 2016. We had a reasonably comfortable flight but Air Canada needs to improve in a couple of areas. Firstly: all the controls for entertainment, lights etc are in the armrest which is very inconvenient as it is too easy to accidentally turn off or on something unintentionally. I understand this can only be improved when designing new aeroplanes. Secondly: the choice of movies, tv etc on the entertainment system is very limited. On a 16 hour flight people need more than a few old re-runs and a couple of newer movies perhaps not to taste. Thirdly: neither on this flight nor our previous premium economy flight from Sydney to Vancouver were we given enough time to eat our food. Meals appear to be served so close to landing there is a rush to collect rubbish before people have time to eat. Staff commenced collecting plates before I even had time to take the lid off my meal. Most of my meal was wasted and it looked to be quite appetising. BTW I'm not a slow eater. Otherwise Air Canada was equal to most other international airlines and I appreciated being able to fly directly from Sydney to Vancouver and return.

### "arrived 4 hours late"
Chicago to Dublin via Toronto with Air Canada. Plane left Chicago 40 minutes late and arrived in Toronto 40 minutes late. We were not allowed to board our flight to Dublin because the agent said the plane was "full," apparently with standbys. We waited in the customer service line for 45 minutes while the agent worked on another flight. She told us, eventually, that we could "take our chances" with a direct flight or have a certain one to London then Dublin. It appeared to me that she was "selling" us and the 10 other passengers in the same predicament on the second flight because it wasn't full. It too was delayed, waiting for a late connecting flight from Beijing. How nice. We eventually arrived in Dublin 4 hours late without luggage which arrived 24 hours later. When I contacted Air Canada about all of this, they were gracious enough to offer us a 15% discount on our next AC flight which I will summarize by saying - never. Don't believe me? Check the numerous comments and reviews about this sorry excuse for an airline.

### "AC was like a budget airline"
It was my first time with Air Canada flying from London to Montreal. I have to say that the aircraft was good indeed. However my strong impression was that AC was like a budget airline. Inflight entertainment was limited and didn't work for my wife. We needed to ask to re-set it several times. Seats are not comfortable because armrests have built-in remote for inflight entertainment system and lights and you switch it off/on every time when you place your elbow on it accidentally. Serving food: items constantly were dropped down, flight attendants were picking them up from the floor and put on your table. Indeed it was better than United based on my many-year experience but still very close to it. My personal impression - Ryanair is treating their passengers a little bit better inflight - more genuine and attentive. Also, Montreal airport don't recognize Star Alliance membership card privileges for priority check-in which was disappointing (but it was not the airlines fault, but the airport ground staff). AC can be airline of choice indeed if there no any other suitable options.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
Paris CDG to Montreal with Air Canada. Flight left on time. The flight crew were very friendly and attentive especially one who was smiling from the moment we boarded to the moment we left the plane. The food served was the best food I have ever had on Air Canada in all the years flying with them. Probably because it was made in Paris and not Vancouver. - it was quite good. The entertainment system worked fine and it was a very enjoyable flight. We arrived on time and with no complaints at all.

### "crew friendly and polite"
Victoria to London Heathrow via Vancouver with Air Canada. The flight left Vancouver on time. A good flight, with a crew that were friendly and polite. The food was for once quite reasonable and a pleasant surprise as it is usually pretty awful. Arrived on time and had no complaints at all. Entertainment system worked fine. One of the better flights that we have taken with Air Canada.

### "representative rude and discourteous"
Nashville to London Gatwick via Toronto. Air Canada is the worst we've flown. Sept 7, 2016, a 1.5 hour take off delay from Nashville due to our plane's having no air conditioning, and with the air blowers at only 10% of capacity. Problem was not fixed and the cabin temp was nearly unbearable for the 2-hour packed flight to Toronto. The delay cost us a missed connection to London Gatwick because the airline schedules only 1-1/2 hours to connect from the Nashville arrival to their once-a-day London Gatwick departure. To make matters worse, in the process of deplaning from the Nashville flight there were no airline personnel directing US citizens to the shortcut past Canadian customs, which forced many US citizens on our flight, including us, to spend an hour waiting to go through customs, then another hour reclaiming our baggage, checking it back in, and going back through security, none of which US citizens at Toronto are required to do. The airline had booked us on the next Gatwick flight, 24 hours later, but we were able to get a flight that night to London Heathrow, which was delayed by 2 hours due to technical problems. We finally left at midnight. Through this ordeal every single Air Canada representative was rude and discourteous. The airline would do nothing for us except give us $10 food certificates which bought us 2 bottles of water. We had not eaten anything by this time for 7 hours and did not get anything to eat until 2 hours into the London Heathrow flight. Because our rental car had been paid for at Gatwick with return of the car to be made there we were forced, upon arrival at Heathrow, to take a commuter bus at our cost, from Heathrow to Gatwick. The return flight from Gatwick to Toronto was delayed by over 4 hours due to the failure of a  ticket agent at Gatwick to give a fellow passenger more than one claim tag for the two bags she had checked in. This failure caused an extra bag to show up in the system. Staff  were in an out of the cabin for the 4 hours trying to determine the bag's owner. As a last resort, the airline ordered all the passengers out of the plane and down to the tarmac to personally identify their own bags! The delay caused everyone on the plane to miss their connections in Toronto. The next available flight to Nashville was 24 hours later. The airline put us in an hotel 20 minutes from the airport and included 3 meal vouchers which could only be used at the hotel. Trouble is, the hotel didn't even have a restaurant. It took 1.5 hours to get our bags out of the secure area for the overnight stay.

### "Overall very good flight"
Toronto to London Heathrow in Premium Economy on daytime flight on Air Canada 868 on Boeing 787 equipment. Comfortable smooth flight, on time departure, reasonably good food and drink service from competent pleasant staff. Arrival at Heathrow Terminal 2 on time and not too long a wait for luggage. Overall very good flight.

### "flight was not that great"
The flight was a Lufthansa / Air Canada codeshare flight from Frankfurt to Toronto. It was my first time flying Air Canada. The flight was not that great. The movies were boring. I ordered for Asian Vegetarian Meal as a special meal request, which mostly consists of Indian food, but the food was not good. Also, since it was an 8 hour flight, they should have provided 2 meals. Although they provided lunch, which was at the start of the flight, their second meal was a refreshment, which was only a packet of nuts. Maybe a light meal towards the end of the flight was probably too much to ask. The cabin crew were quite lousy, I had to press the call button many times and they still would not come.

### "attendants not friendly"
On a 4 hr flight from Vancouver to Toronto that wasn't cheap no snack/meal provided. Couldn't use cash or Visa debit card either. Drinks offered. Not much room for the window seat passenger to go to the toilet etc without bothering the row in front or own row. Attendants not friendly. On internationall flight x10hrs everything was great.

### "experience is nothing exceptional"
Toronto to Tel Aviv. Delays in check-in process and a rude representative were followed by a $100 charge for 3kg overweight. If that wasn't enough, my luggage did not arrive, they never boarded it on the plane, and it arrives 2 days after me, and after they had me wait up until 23:30 at night to deliver it. When confronting their customer service, they shortly referred me to their creative legal terms, not even trying to address my complaint. Plenty of other options for travel. Their flight experience is nothing exceptional to cover up for anything.

### "flight attendants were friendly and professional"
I flew on Air Canada from Toronto to Sant John, NB last year. It was a smaller airplane Bombardier Q400. Although it was a smaller airplane the flight was quite smooth and comfortable. It was my first time on a Bombardier and I was a little uncomfortable flying such a small aircraft at first. However, it turned out to be a good experience. Flight attendants were friendly and professional. Well Done Air Canada.

### "solid experience, nothing special"
Montreal to Rome. This was my first flight with Air Canada and it was a mixed experience. On boarding I found the plane to be clean and well kept and the cabin crew was friendly. We hit some severe turbulence shortly after take-off so the IFE headphones were given to us only a good 40 minutes into the flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable and legroom was good for me standing only 172cm tall. IFE selection was wide and for the first time I had no trouble listening to the sound through Economy class headphones provided. What really stood out negatively was the food. I selected the pasta and it was the worst I have been served on a long haul flight. On the bright side, alcoholic beverages were complimentary. Breakfast consisted of a slice of banana bread and a cup of coffee. The bare minimum I dare say. Flight was on time and information from the cockpit plentiful. All in all the flight was a solid experience, just nothing special.

### "quiet and relaxing"
On time. Comfy seat. Single seat by the window in a small business cabin. Quiet and relaxing. Good service and excellent food. Vancouver is great to transit, although AC's international business lounge could use an upgrade - no showers, uninspired space. Overall a good experience with Air Canada from Washington to Brisbane via Toronto.

### "Air Canada has upped its game"
On time departure and arrival from Sydney to Vancouver. Very professional service from a friendly crew. Seating 1-2-1, so the single seat by the window is great. Air Canada has upped its game. Food very good. Use NZ lounge in Sydney which was very crowded, but then again, so was the entire airport.

### "improved their service remarkably"
Air Canada has improved their service remarkably over the past few years, adding some fresh new faces to the cabin crew lineup. We took our seats in the emergency exit row, which gave us extra legroom. The flight was approximately four hours long from Toronto to Calgary, mostly turbulent so the seatbelt sign was on most of the time, but the pilot and cabin crew did their best to keep us comfortable with regular updates and advice on when to head to the washrooms. The flight attendants were very helpful and cheery. Other than that, fairly standard beverage and snack fare, nothing memorable but nothing too horrible either. In-flight entertainment was very updated and had a wide variety of movies and TV to watch.

### "no apology could satisfy me"
Toronto to London Heathrow via Montreal. Normally am pleased with smooth travel experience with Air Canada. On Aug 25, however, I checked my suitcase in and boarded the aircraft, flew in to Montreal. Had a 2.5 hour wait time until the next flight. That flight boarded ok and we landed the next morning at Heathrow, and the 'adventure' began. My suitcase did not arrive. I very nearly missed my train at the mainline station I had to travel to because I had to report the missing bag to the agent, who took my details, provided me with an information sheet and file tracking number, and told me my bag was on the next flight. Couldn't seem to tell me why. After a few follow up calls without meaningful responses from the people at the number I was given to call, as well as from the courier, I also learned that the baggage department and the courier do not communicate to each other. That needs to change! Courier delivered my suitcase directly to me 3 days after my arrival. I got a bit of a runaround obtaining information on how best to proceed with submitting my receipts for reimbursement because the form wanted me to send to an address in the UK, but I reside in Canada. I was given instructions eventually and followed that with a letter plus documentation sent off to the baggage department in Dorval, Quebec. It is unacceptable to me that the airline (or whoever it was) should arbitrarily decide who's bag arrives with them and who's does not, especially when you are flying on their largest aircraft, and particularly failing to communicate this information to the passenger. I am not impressed, I am waiting for my reimbursement, and the days of me doing business with Air Canada are now seriously numbered. I understand they do this quite regularly but it is not acceptable. You leave your luggage in their hands and this is what they do? There is no explanation, no reason or excuse, and no apology could satisfy me on this one.

### "a very positive experience"
We were flying from Rome to Montreal with Air Canada on September 2 and it was one of the smoothest flights! Professional crew, very helpful and accommodating. There was a crying baby near us and a flight attendant actually took the baby in his arms and played with her to calm her down. The pilot kept the passengers informed as much as he could on what was going on (we had to wait for about an hour for the takeoff clearance which was not Air Canada's fault, the boarding was completed on time), he apologized for the temperature in the cabin while we were waiting for takeoff, suggested ways to keep it cool, he made informative announcements throughout the flight, and the best landing I've experienced in years. The food was ok, we were served gelato as a snack which was great. No problems with luggage. No problems with pre-booking of seats. Overall, a very positive experience, I don't think you can ask for much more on a long overseas flight in economy class.

### "checked us in was not friendlier"
Quebec to Toronto via Montreal. Lined up at the gate checking desk for 20 minutes. When our turn came the guy told us that he did only luggage drop off and invited us to line up again at the counter next to his. Quite a few people ahead of us. Then a few minutes later while we were still lining up we saw him checking people without any boarding passes. Then the person that checked us in was not any friendlier. This happened at the Jean Lesage Airport which was surprising because the people in Quebec were just the nicest people and because as Air Canada frequent users we never had to deal with such unpleasant people.

### "customer focused carrier"
São Paulo to Toronto with Air Canada. I connected to this flight from a domestic flight and was concerned about my bag not making it as the two airlines were not affiliated. Upon check in, the customer care provided to my concern was exceptional. I had two check in agents plus the AC Concierge tracking my bag which safely made it to the flight. I am a loyal AC flyer and in all of my travels over the years I have never experienced this level of attention and superior service. The ground crew was phenomenal and did their jobs with smiles and without a hint of frustration. On board, aside from the age of the aircraft and the worn-out interior, service, amenities, food and beverages were of high standards. I chose to sleep most of the flight and got a good 6-7 hours of shuteye. Flight left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The work of the ground crew in GRU was the highlight of my travel experience and went a long way in renewing my trust in AC as a customer focused carrier.

### "experience at best mediocre"
Air Canada from Toronto to São Paulo. Check in using the premium/priority lane was quick and effortless. Visited the Maple Leaf Lounge briefly and must say AC is slipping in the lounge product it offers. On board the aircraft clearly showed its age with worn out interior, dim lighting, poor air quality and general appearance. Once airborne, the FA's came around and read out the menu to each passenger as they did not have any printed versions. I could not help but feel sorry for the FA who had to repeat the same script 23 times. The food was mediocre at best with quality well below a business class offering. The drinks selection however was decent. The IFE had a reasonable selection of new releases but the music selection remains obscure and totally irrelevant. I would like to know who actually appriciates AC's music selection. The service director did an admirable job interacting with passengers which gave the journey a personal touch. The seat was the usual pod style and less than comfortable in the flat position. The toilets looked grimy and in need of a thorough scrub. Flight left and arrived on time and although it was tagged as "priority" my bag came out very late during delivery. The experience was at best mediocre and well below what one would expect in business class.

### "I cannot say enough good"
I flew Seoul to Vancouver on August 27th. I cannot say enough good about the service, professionalism and quality of business class product. Through the flight the crew were attentive to the comfort of the guests. The amenity bag, food and attitude was second to none. If there were to be one suggestion it would be to brighten the windows earlier prior to landing. I cannot comment on the IFE because I usually am more interested in watching the flight path and flight information.

### "service was great"
Kamloops to Sydney via Vancouver with Air Canada. I have used Air Canada a lot for my business travel over a number of years, and I have always been satisfied with my experience. Recently, my partner and I planned a trip to Australia for the very first time. I have never flown Air Canada "internationally" before so I wasn't sure what to expect. We found our check in online to be very smooth and quick the night before. The first flight from YKA to YVR was smooth like always. The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in "Premium Economy", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight. We arrived into SYD in the morning, feeling fairly fresh and rested from our flight. Overall, all 4 flights with Air Canada were very good. Everything was on schedule, and the staff that we interacted with were very helpful to us on our journey. If we go back to Australia again at some point, we will definitely take Air Canada again.

### "not sympathetic or helpful"
My wife and I recently took a trip to Montreal, Canada from Salt Lake City - USA, and we flew with Air Canada. Pretty much everything that could possibly go wrong with a travel experience happened. We were stuck on the aircraft for an hour after it had landed, and were certain to miss our connecting flight. Air Canada’s poor communication caused my wife and me to run across 8 terminals at LAX airport carrying our carry-ons and backpacks, to try to reach the connecting flight before it departed. The flight didn’t end up leaving for 2 more hours. During the 5-6 hour flight we were not once offered snacks. When we landed in Montreal our luggage was missing, and we were informed that it was still in LAX. We ended up having to come back to the airport later that night, wasting our vacation time and wasting money on gas and parking. The return flights home were even more of a nightmare. At our connecting flight in Toronto, we were denied access to the plane because Air Canada had overbooked. We had bought our tickets 2 months in advance, but that made no difference to them. The Air Canada representative was not sympathetic or helpful at all. We were put in a hotel for the night, as the next flight to Salt Lake wasn’t until the next morning, and we now had yet another 4 hour layover in Chicago on top of that. The 'compensation' isn't even close to cover our expenses, loss, and stress. When we finally landed in SLC, Air Canada had failed yet again to get our luggage to our destination. There was not even one Air Canada representative anywhere in the entire airport to help us or give us any amount of information. I had to call and wait a half hour on the phone before I got in touch with an Air Canada rep, who then informed me our luggage was still in Chicago. We ended up having to get it delivered to our home the next day.

### "not so impressed if I had paid full price"
Toronto to Calgary with Air Canada. This was a reward ticket using my Miles & More points. We were on holidays so both my girlfriend and I were very relaxed and this helped a lot during the 40+ minutes wait during check-in while they try to sort out an issue with the luggage fee that for some reasons I could not pay as they system was not accepting any of my credit card. Luckily I got to the airport much earlier than necessary. The lady at the counter was very nice and helpful and apologized many times for the inconvenience so no big deal in the end, such things can happen. Flight left on time and flight was smooth even though cabin was pretty cold but with AC even blankets are for sale, at least on domestic routes, so we gave up getting one. I did not buy any food or drink as we had our own. Crew members were friendly and smiling while info from the flight deck was very limited. Overall, considering I got a free ride I cannot complain but I would not be so impressed if I had paid the full price.

### "ruined the first day of plans"
Los Angeles to Madrid via Toronto with Air Canada. I am trying to leave on my honeymoon and this is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. First I show up to find out my first flight from LAX to Toronto has been delayed by 3 hours and I did not receive any notification even though I signed up for it. Then I wait in an hour long line to get my connection flight from Toronto to Madrid changed only to add an extra layover and I am now arriving 8 hours later in Madrid. I am instructed to call customer service since I am unhappy with the solution so I wait 30 minute to talk with a customer service rep only to be told that they cannot do anything for me since I have already been checked in. 1 extra layover, arriving 8 hours later at our destination than originally expected, they can't get me a seat on the plane next to my wife, and the customer service reps can't do anything for me. I will never fly Air Canada again, they have ruined the first day of plans we had for our honeymoon. At least we each got a $10 meal ticket as a consolation.

### "Kudos to all AC personnel"
I would like to take this opportunity to make a favorable comment about the service provided by staff of Air Canada. On our last trip we were detained in Montreal whereby we needed to connect with a flight to Fort Lauderdale. It should be noted that one of the passengers required wheelchair service. A Montreal AC member contacted the pilot to confirm that he had passengers who needed to board in order to not miss our cruise. The pilot waited and we were boarded. Kudos to all AC personnel. We will be travelling with AC on our next cruise in January 2017.

### "ground staff at AMS were useless"
We flew Air Canada from Amsterdam AMS to Toronto YYZ having used British Airways to fly into Amsterdam. Initially we were concerned about the 1 hour 50 minutes connection time but this was not a problem as the Air Canada flight was delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes. Plenty of time for our baggage to make it from the incoming flight. Ground staff at AMS were useless, there were 5 of them behind the counter at the gate but only one appeared to be interested in serving passengers. Once on board, the aircraft itself was old and in serious need of TLC. The seat in front of me was split and the inner foam was bulging out. The in-flight entertainment was delivered on poor quality screens with an even poorer selection of out dated movies. The staff were pleasant enough and appeared to care about passenger needs. Upon arrival at Toronto, only 3 of our bags had made the trip with no explanation as to why one of them was still at AMS. We completed the form and were told that the bag would come on the next available flight on the following day. It didn't come, in fact it was finally reunited with us 9 days later and this was only after I had re-attended YYZ twice after being told that it was there when it wasn't. I have spent approximately 15 hours of our vacation on the phone to Air Canada's Indian call centre and yet the never made contact with me once. Avoid at all costs.

### "efficient and on time"
YKA - YVR - SFO, July 20th and SFO - YVR - YKA, July 26th. I travelled down to the Bay Area out of Kamloops (YKA) on July 20th and returned on July 26th. All of my flights were on time, efficient, and enjoyable. I enjoyed Air Canada's Preferred Seating/Premium Economy benefits on the A319 (the way down) and the A320 (on the way up). The first people to be served, the last people to get on the plane, extra legroom, more comfortable seats, and extra space between your neighbours made my flights to and from San Francisco really enjoyable. I will recommend the extra small fee to sit in preferred seating/premium economy benefits, on any Air Canada flights. The service between Kamloops and Vancouver is always efficient and on time. Air Canada is one of my main choices for all of my flights. Not to mention, you can get a lot of frequent flyer points for whoever you are signed up with (for me, Star Alliance).

### "good experience, not great2
Toronto to Tokyo Narita with Air Canada. Maple Leaf Lounge was basic. It was nothing spectacular but the food was decent. Boarding was quick. The business class seats on Air Canada aren't amazing. I disliked the angled seats and the headphones that were hardwired into the system (they always seemed to be getting in the way). I also found that there was no place to put personal belongings. The lie flat bed was hard and my leg kept cramping. The food was pretty great though. Flight attendants were nice and were always around. The inflight entertainment was adequate. It was a good experience, not a great one.

### "not a single one has been on time"
Flew Air Canada from Vancouver to Los Angeles Okay in-flight service. But over eight flights, not a single one has been on time. When delayed, they seem to have no clue by how much, in one case showing a 1-hour delay until the plane hadn't arrived at the gate 90 minites late, then showing the plane pulling back before the plane was at the gate. Fingers crossed we make it home.

### "appalling quality food"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto to London Heathrow. Appalling quality food, and profit over passenger wellbeing. Took off an hour late as inbound flight late landing, nothing they could do about that, but surely they could have given out water? Food on both outbound was of such a low quality, cheap ingredients and generally poor quality meal when compared to many other large carriers. Children meals no better, deep fried 'smiley faces' and solid tomato pasta. This was a night flight, yet the full brightness cabin lights were still on at 11pm local Toronto time simply so they could finish duty free sales. This just smells of greed for profit over passenger wellbeing. Nobody could sleep and young children and babies were distressed due to this. My wife spoke to crew about this earlier, just to be told 'after duty free they will go off'. Only upon me insisting on speaking to the purser and explaining why this was such a problem did the cabin lights then get reduced to a normal night flight level The inflight entertainment had very few new releases, mainly bulked out by old films and TV shows.

### "supposed to leave Thursday, took-off Saturday"
Cleveland to Sao Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. We faced countless problems from the moment we started our journey to Brazil. We were scheduled to take off from Cleveland to Toronto on June 23 at 5:50pm. To then take Toronto to Sao Paulo on flight AC 0090 at 10:40pm. When I scheduled the flights, we gave ourselves plenty of time in between to go through customs and ensure that we made our flight to Brazil, as I had work meetings and an interstate flight to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday morning. The first problem we faced was our flight from Cleveland to Toronto was late arriving. There were problems with the flight or weather issues - no one really knew what was going on. We did not take off until 10pm - which didn't put us in Toronto until 11:15pm. This made us and at least 50 other people miss their international connections. Air Canada was able to put us in a hotel for that night and we were to come back the following evening for a 8pm flight to Sao Paulo, putting us in Sao Paulo now on Saturday morning at 9am. I was able to move my meeting in Rio and also called the airline to reschedule my interstate flight from Sao Paulo to Rio. We got to the airport Friday evening for our flight that is meant to take off at 8pm. We are supposed to be boarding at 7pm and there is still no plane. We were then told that the plane won't take off until 11pm and after more time told it won't take off until 9am the next morning. This now creates problems for my business meeting in Rio. After working with Air Canada customer service (who were not polite) they were able to change our flights to Rio instead of Sao Paulo so we could make our work meeting. By this time it was already 3am and if we had gone to the hotel we would have to turn around and leave 2 hours later to come back - so my husband and I slept at the airport. This was exetremely uncomfortable and we had an awful night of sleep. We finally got on the plane on Saturday morning at 9am (supposed to take off at 9:15 so we were late again) and we sat on the plane for 40 minutes with no movement. They finally announced over the speaker that there is a passenger on the plane who shouldn't be - and security was there to remove him. After an hour and a half of being stuck on the tarmac we were finally left for Brazil. We were supposed to leave on Thursday evening and weren't taking off until Saturday morning.

### "a really cramped environment"
I used Air Canada to get from Hong Kong to Toronto-Pearson. Check in in HKG was OK, the check in workers were just ones from the Jardine company. However, there is nothing positive to say in this review other than the variety of movies in the inflight entertainment system (which crashed) and the baggage allowance. Service was not good. When you pressed the "call attendant button" you were ignored, or you were shouted at. My inflight entertainment system crashed. I pressed the button and nobody came for an hour. I cancelled and pressed again. The flight attendant shouted at me "Did you press the button?". I was gobsmacked. Generally, during meal service, their attitude was very demeaning and it seemed as if they did not want to serve us. Inflight meals on this flight were your typical airplane food. Nothing special. The seat in the plane was narrow. I used economy class and there were ten seats per row (3-4-3). This resulted in a really cramped environment. Reclining the seat was also useless. The tray tables were small and could only fit the tray and nothing else. Also, there was not much space for storage in the seat back pocket. Legroom was quite cramped, even though I am only 178 cm tall. Baggage handling at Toronto-Pearson was quite slow, despite the fact the gate (Terminal 1) was a short walk to immigration and baggage claim. I waited two hours for my bags to arrive, and I even saw the flight crew waiting even after I went to customs. Now, the only saving grace was the baggage allowance. You could take lots of hand baggage and nobody seemed to care. They were quite liberal and didn't charge me even though I exceeded the baggage allowance (check in) by 0.1 kilos.

### "I had an excellent flight"
Toronto to Vancouver. I had an excellent flight. The seat was very comfortable and IFE was excellent. The meal service and choice of wine was excellent. The staff was happy and checking if I needed anything. I look forward to flying again with Air Canada next month. One thing I was happy to see is I was able to give my meal choice early rather than watch the FA dart about the cabin ignoring many of the passengers while chatting with and taking the orders of certain passengers. I recommend you drop this practice as it is such a downer in the early part of the flight.

### "positive step forwards for Air Canada"
Flying to Montreal via Toronto on the newer class of Air Canada's fleet was a much more pleasant experience than expected, due to my experiences on their older models. The seats are more comfortable, with more shoulder room, and the feeling of more privacy, now that they've gone for more of a cabin feel. the extra storage space for passports, phones, wallets etc. is a welcome addition. The TV screens are large and crisp, in HD (unlike the blurry cumbersome previous screens). Food was of a very good standard, and drinks selection was of a respectable range and standard. Service was friendly and attentive. All in all this is a significantly positive step forwards for Air Canada, despite the flight being late. Of course my return journey was on an older model, with far inferior service and comfort, souring my Air Canada experience.

### "I could not afford the fee"
Cranbrook to Vancouver. While sitting at my gate waiting for my flight to begin boarding I received a phone call from Air Canada to advise me that my bag had already arrived at my destination. About 5 hours earlier I had asked if it might be possible to get on an earlier flight as I arrived at the airport before I expected when I bought my ticket a month earlier. I was told it would be possible, but that I would be charged a large fee. I declined as I could not afford the fee. It seems funny to me that Air Canada had lots of room on the earlier flight for my bag, but not me. Would it have cost them anything to let me take one of the empty seats on the flight before mine? In a similar situation two years previous WestJet kindly allowed me to take a seat on an earlier flight. I

### "no reasoning with them"
We purchased tickets for our son and his friends with Singapore Airlines from Tokyo to Montreal. The LA to Montreal leg was with Air Canada. We had many choices for this second flight but we chose Air Canada because it is Canadian and because both airlines are star Alliance members. The layover in LAX was 10 hrs so we decided to purchase access to the Maple Leaf lounge in LAX. To be able to purchase access to the lounge, the ticket had to be a Flex or Latitude class ticket which it was. Air Canada refused the possibility of purchasing lounge access because the ticket is originally purchased through Singapore rather than Air Canada. So what is the point of flying on Star Alliance partner flights? There is no reasoning with them.

### "flights were operated to a high standard"
Air Canada, Halifax-Toronto-Victoria on 4 July 2016 in economy class. Ticket had been purchased as a Lufthansa ticket through the LH website as a three-part trip: Victoria to Geneva; Geneva to Halifax; and Halifax to Victoria. (The same combination of flights couldn't be found on the AC website.) YHZ-YYZ leg (2h20) was aboard a B767-200 which had started its journey at LHR (and was carrying a number of passengers continuing through from LHR). YYZ-YYJ leg (5h10) was aboard an A320. Both flights were full and operated to a high standard. Good legroom and space for carry-on baggage. FAs passed through the cabin often to offer water or juice. A lot of AVOD offerings, but always preceded by commercials. The worst intrusions of commercials were at the very start of both flights, after the safety briefing, presented not only on all cabin screens but also over the public-address system and on the classical music channels, where from time to time the commercials suddenly blared at more than double the normal volume - forcing you to pull out the ear-buds immediately. Air Canada's food offerings for sale on-board are poor (mostly junk food); but Canadians know that when taking domestic flights they need to eat beforehand. A few days after the flight, an Air Canada agent telephoned to say that an e-reader had been found near my seat on the YYZ-YYJ flight and asked if it might be mine (it wasn't). It was impressive that Air Canada was phoning all passengers seated in that area of the plane to see if it belonged to any of us. Top marks for that.

### "crew acted quite professionally"
Tokyo Narita to Toronto. The economy seat was so uncomfortable for a 12-hour flight. The first and last meals were acceptable. Six hours into the flight, they served cup noodles and sandwiches. Why cup noodles? The in-flight entertainment system offers poor selections and the route map kept crashing. However, I have no complaints against the flight crew who acted quite professionally.

### "more bearable than not"
Air Canada is arguably the best international airline in North America. It's service is somewhat better than the legacy carriers in the US, meaning more pleasant flights. The airport staff at Tokyo Haneda are from fellow Star Alliance partner and Japanese airline ANA, and they are exceptionally friendly. However onboard the plane, the staff are a bit more "standard" by North Anerican standards, but compared to US airlines, they are better. Food was edible to say the most, and nothing unusual. Typical Airplane food. The seat is a little thin in my opinion, and I am rather thin. IFE changed from the flight to Tokyo, which was good to see. Airport services in Toronto, however wasn't very enjoyable, but it wasn't Air Canada's fault completely as customs was sluggish. The second flight was delayed due to weather, but it seemed as if there were mechanical problems too. The flight was rather cold, but they gave us a lot of pretzels. Unfortunately, at Dulles, all of us couldn't find our baggage until they brought it out a good hour after our flight arrived at the gate, and it was midnight so it wasn't a busy time. Overall it was more bearable than not.

### "lengthy line ups"
It was appreciated that my husband and I were seated together for our return flight home from Toronto to Abbotsford. We arrived at Toronto airport over 2 hours ahead of our boarding time and spent that entire time waiting in line. My husband has difficulties with his hip and I have back issues. The time spent standing in line was both painful and uncomfortable. I have avoided flying with Air Canada because of the lengthy line ups and was disappointed to find that this is still an issue.

### "airline should be avoided"
Toronto to Cleveland. ✅ Verified Review |  The worst airline experience of my 56 years of life. The way this airline handles flights, delays and customers in general is almost funny - but it isn't because people's lives are being affected by their dereliction of duty. My flight was delayed for four hours and I must of heard 5 or 6 different stories. The gates were changing, the plane was changing...they didn't have a pilot, they did have pilot. While sitting at the worst terminal I have ever been in, I heard horror stories from other passengers about air Canada. I witnessed 3 other cancelled flights and two other delays. Nothing was due to weather. This airline should be avoided at all costs. They are a disgrace.

### "much nicer experience than usual"
Good flight from Frankfurt to Toronto, in what is now the "old" business class for Air Canada. This is a business class with full reclining seats. They are a little narrow and rather hard. However, not bad at all. They offer flexible meals and this time this offer worked (sometimes the staff decides that it is not available and as the alternative offered is the same meal but in compact form on a tray with less dishes, we wonder why this would not be available). I enjoyed a lighter meal, when I felt like it. The staff was nicer than usual, and they make a point (this is a new thing) to come by and ask you your opinion about the flight. All in all a much nicer experience than usual on Air Canada.

### "worst customer service"
Rome to Las Vegas via Montreal with Air Canada. Left Rome late and arrived in Montreal 2 hours late. Missed our connection and the only option offered is a 13 hour journey to get from Montreal to Las Vegas via Calgary. We looked online and asked if we could just stay the night in Montreal and get on the direct flight to Vegas in the morning (we were originally on a direct flight). Even though you could clearly still buy tickets online they said no, since business class was only thing available on that flight. So instead we now have another connection in Calgary and a 7 hour layover until we can leave on the morning flight from there. No hotel and like I said worst customer service.

### "dreading the return flight"
Toronto to Brisbane via Vancouver. Very uncomfortable experience with Air Canada, especially for the long haul. Is it too much to expect on a 13+ hour long flight that there should be some sort of foot rest so that you can get your feet somewhat elevated. Really felt like "cattle class". This is the first time I've ended up with swollen ankles after a long flight and I have been flying back and forth to Australia, 3 times a year for the last 4 years. In flight "entertainment" was terrible, food was shocking and the washroom was the tiniest thing I have ever seen. Toilet seat didn't even stay up. No amenities provided except for the obligatory hand soap. One snack was offered up inbetween meals and even though the "menu" tells you that snacks are available throughout the flight, flight staff made it quite obvious that they won't get you anything. During the shorter flight from Toronto to Vancouver, the snack / meal cart was only stacked with chocolate and chips. Bad luck if you wanted something hot. Clearly these people do not have experience with the truly great airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Was recommended Air Canada by my travel agent. I'll be letting her know what a terrible choice this was. Pay extra and go with a better airline for long journeys. Really really dreading the return flight.

### "experience overall was pretty dreadful"
Seoul to Philadelphia via Toronto - this is the route I took with Air Canada, not the route that was ticketed. We were supposed to fly from Seoul (ICN) to Washington IAD via Toronto on a United code share. Our flight from Seoul left late and arrived late, which caused a missed 7:30 connection at Toronto. Our request for 2 vegetarian meals was overlooked on this 13-hour flight. The seats were fine for us because we had a 3-person section and could lift the armrests and lean against each other. The flight would have been pretty uncomfortable next to a stranger for 13 hours because the seats are quite narrow. Also, the flight was about the driest I've ever been on - I left with a very dry mouth. When we spoke with the AC personnel about trying to get back to DC, we were told that there were no flights available to anywhere in the DC area that night, direct or through connections. After AC checked with United about a possible routing that would get us to DC at 2:48 p.m. the next day, it became apparent that the routing was not available either. At this point, we discussed other options and I was told that a 9pm flight to Philadelphia was available. We took it. It was delayed 80 minutes. During this time, I booked a car rental from PHL to drop off in the DC area. By the time we left PHL, it was 1am, and I drove to our house 2 hours away, finally arriving at 3am. I found the flight attendants and entertainment selection to be good generally, but the experience overall was pretty dreadful.

### "every other airline is a better choice"
Avoid Air Canada if you are 1) traveling with kids or 2) you don't want to buy brand new luggage or 3) you want a difficult check-in process. We booked tickets 8 months in advance and they couldn't find 4 seats so my family could sit together. Also, during the beverage service on a previous flight, the beverage cart skipped my kids row and served the adults around them instead. On each leg of our journey, the gate agent complained about our carry-on luggage - specifically that our 22" carry-ons (aka industry standard) didn't fit in their convenient 21.5" size requirements. Southwest is 24", other airlines are similar. I've flow this bag all over Europe and only on Air Canada is it an issue? And then the check-in fiasco. I attempted valiantly to check-in the night before, but that didn't seem to work. Electronic boarding pass options? Nope. So we arrive at the gate and guess what - none of the kiosks work either. I scan 3/4 passports, then the machine decides to quit working. Even discount airlines figured out how to have proper check-in procedures at a fraction of the cost. If you value your sanity, wallet, or are traveling with kids - every other airline is a better choice - stay away from Air Canada.

### "there was nobody at the gate"
I had a terrible experience with my first time on Air Canada flying from Baltimore to Vancouver via Toronto. The flight attendant was not pleasant at all. When I got to Toronto from Baltimore, the flight unknowingly was delayed two hours. However, there was nobody at the gate to inform the passengers and we were quite confused what was going on. This delay did not occur on the board until we were supposed to be boarding. So I went to the Air Canada help desk and they were absolutely terrible. I did not raise my voice, but the lady there shooed me away and was extremely rude/unhelpful. I will not be flying Air Canada again.

### "leaves a lot to be desired"
We flew with Air Canada from Sydney to Vancouver and never again would I fly with this company. They should be called Sardine Airlines. The staff had no finesse at all and the meals were almost inedible. Couples who had been booked for months found themselves sitting rows apart. We accommodated a lady who had booked an aisle seat but was given a window seat only to find that she had so little room that she was almost sitting half in my husbands seat. We had so looked forward to seeing this beautiful country but if that is the best that Canada can do, it leaves a lot to be desired.

### "food was cold and super dry"
Ottawa to Tokyo Haneda via Toronto. The Premium Economy product on the B777 aircraft is much poorer than the B787 we have previously experienced. The service was mediocre - one single flight attendant entirely handling the Premium Economy cabin which results in a slow service and many Premium Economy passengers served after the regular Economy cabin. It makes no sense when you paid for a Premium seat to get served at last. My food was cold and super dry because of the long waiting. I wasn’t even offered any drink while waiting for my meal. The Premium Economy arm rests were all sticky and not even cleaned properly when we boarded the flight. Upon departure, they won’t tag your baggage priority unless you specifically ask them. About 90% of Premium Economy passengers end up with no priority tags on their luggage even though you paid for that service. We weren’t offered a drink (juice or water) upon boarding like before. It took 3 hours for the food service - not worth it Air Canada.

### "$20 to select a regular seat"
Los Angeles to Toronto with Air Canada. I have never seen an airline so concerned about squeezing money out of their customers. Purchase your ticket online and then pay $20 to select a regular seat - not a special seat, just a regular seat. Every checked bag (even from US to Canada) are charged which means every single flight I saw staff notify travelers that there is too much carry-on luggage and ask who would like to volunteer to have their bags checked at the gate. I have flown a lot of airlines but Air Canada is by far the worst.

### "inflight movie selection nothing special"
Edmonton to Cancun via Calgary with Air Canada. No issues with delays however the inflight movie selection is nothing special and the games never seem to work on the last several Air Canada flights I've been on. What I was most unimpressed with was the fact that I was flying for at least 5 hours and they still did not offer complimentary meals. Don't use this airline if you can help it.

### "FA's were very personable"
Toronto to Istanbul on Air Canada. Hassle free check-in using the priority lane. On time and orderly boarding. The aircraft interior was well appointed with new business class seats that are spacious and comfortable. The IFE is an improvement over the previous version but the content was a let down as the programming had not been updated with the current month's movies. The FA's were very personable and attentive. The main course at dinner was OK at best but the selection of wines made up for it. Bathrooms were bright and kept clean throughout the flight. The flight departed 20 minutes late but arrived ahead of schedule. The Boeing 787 is a magnificent aircraft and well and truly helps reduce jetlag. Overall a pleasant experience.

### "cabin crew highly professional"
Istanbul to Montreal via Toronto. The members of the cabin crew on both flights offered a highly professional service. However the ground staff of TGS in IST was not helpful at all when I asked about using some Star Alliance miles to upgrade. On the main leg from Istanbul to Toronto, we received complimentary amenity kits, two full meals and free availability of sandwiches and beverages. Meals were generally good, even the pasta was good. The Flight Entertainment System maybe needs some adjustments in number of films which compared to Turkish Airlines was a bit poor.

### "delayed at least an hour"
Flew Air Canada from Frankfurt to Toronto. Weather was perfect on my flights to and from Frankfurt, yet each of my four flights were delayed at least an hour. This seemed to be common from what I heard at the other gates. Baggage fees were inconsistent. I was charged $100 for my bike on my way to Europe but $50 on my way back. At what point the counter agent told another agent she decides when she will open and not the length of the line. Will not fly Air Canada again.

### "a highly professional service"
Amsterdam to Ottawa with a stop-over in Toronto. The members of the cabin crew on both flights offered a highly professional service, and the A333 is a lot quieter than the B767 which previously operated on the flights between Toronto and Amsterdam and vice-versa. Like I have mentioned in my earlier reviews, in terms of schedule and value Air Canada has the best flight options between Amsterdam and Ottawa. However, Air Canada could do more on improving their punctuality as we left Amsterdam an hour later than planned and also the flight from Toronto to Ottawa was delayed, and the food seems to be Air Canada's perennial weakness as it should at least provide better meals in economy couch during long-haul flights. Nevertheless it was okay overall and Air Canada always remains a recommendable airline.

### "I had faith in Air Canada"
I had faith in Air Canada. I had flown with them to Rome and back to Denver no problem. I was actually looking forward to flying with them again. However, they totally messed me about on the Paris flight. The flight out of Paris was delayed for over two hours, causing me and several others to miss their connecting flights in Toronto. Then, they proceeded to be very unhelpful and vague when getting us another flight to our final destination. Then, the flight they got us to our final destination was then delayed by another two hours. And to top off the disaster cake that is this airline, they left my luggage in Toronto but brought my family's luggage to Denver. Would not recommend at all.

### "staff on board were not courteous"
Flew Air Canada from Brisbane to Vancouver. Not a good experience. The Airport Staff made a mistake with my seat and refused to help in securing a seat next to my partner. It seemed that a number of couples and families were separated on the flights (to and from Vancouver). The staff on board were not courteous and almost rude when dealing with us. The entertainment system didn't have the latest movies. The food was below average.

### "none were on time"
In a 10 day span I took three flights with Air Canada from Vancouver to Los Angeles, none of which were on time. The first two flights were fairly small delays of less than an hour, however on the third flight we were delayed due to mechanical error. I understand that these issues do happen periodically with planes but Air Canada originally told us that there was no update, they don't know exactly what is wrong and don't ask about connecting flights. I am unimpressed that Air Canada couldn't get one of my three flights to take off on time.

### "did not offer to switch my seat"
I've flown with Air Canada many times. While it mostly provided decent service and food, the most recent flight left me with a bad experience. The earphone connection on my seat was jammed, so I could not use their system for the entire 14 hours of my flight from Toronto to Beijing. They did not offer to switch my seat or provide a solution, only saying they would fix this after the plane had landed. I generally did not have a problem with the food, and the people on flight were friendly. I liked the fact that they provided a warm blanket and a pillow.

### "all in all a good experience"
Was assisted by Concierge to make my connexion in Montreal due to a late departure from Quebec City. Kudos to the Concierge service from Ottawa (my base) and Montreal who monitored the status of the flights and planned for contingencies. This service is one of greatest value added of Air Canada for high tier customers. Air Canada uses the old Blue Pod configuration seat on this route. 1-1-1 in Business Class. Seat quite comfortable and allows some sleep for this type of leg (6-8 hours). Seat 1 A on this aircraft does not allow you to have a window (or you have to look behind you). It is a good and comfortable seat nonetheless - close to the washrooms if that's what you are looking for (and if you are not afraid of being bothered by noise from the galleys). Air Canada  Achille's heal continues to be the quality of service onboard. While the young crew members are pleasant, helpful and professional, older crew (particularly YUL-based) tend to be less nice and almost discourteous. This will hopefully get addressed progressively, as crew members are trained or renewed. Good food on board and arrival slightly behind schedule despite a late departure from YUL. Was able to use the FRA Air Canada lounge, the best business class lounge in FRA, by all measures. Staff are nice and helpful. Concierge team in FRA amongst the best. All in all a good experience and a product in constant improvement.

### "good service and good food"
Air Canada, with 2 days notice, advanced the connecting flight from Toronto to Charlotte/USA by 40 minutes, and without asking us, booked us on a flight for the next day. As requested, I phoned Air Canada in Canada and had to wait 40 minutes on the line for an operator. I asked if Air Canada pays / provides hotel accommodation for the stopover, in line with European Union rules. A very rude female operator then told me that this is not the airline. However, something must have rung the bell in Italy, because the next day a very friendly Italian staff called me from Rome and informed me that I would get free accommodation. The flights from Rome to Toronto and back were very pleasant, with good premium economy seats, good service and good food. Entertainment also had been satisfactory on a big screen (the movie selection could be improved). The only terrible experience, outside Air Canada's control, had been the USA security screening and immigration in Toronto. We had to stand 2 hours in line and, despite being ushered forward twice by friendly airport staff, boarded our plane to Charlotte as last passengers 2 minutes after official departure. Many other passengers lost their connections due to the newly introduced stricter security controls for the US. The return flights to Rome were again very pleasant without any incidents. Toronto airport is very efficient and pleasant.

### "a very pleasant journey"
Had a very pleasant journey with Air Canada. My route was from Copenhagen to Toronto with the brand new B787-9 and from there to Calgary with an A321-200. Planes were bang on time, the service was good and one flight attendant on the Copenhagen - Toronto flight did even speak Danish. Now that's customer service. On the flight back from Vancouver to London it started so well but the breakfast was a major disapointment. I mean is it too much to serve a normal breakfast on a 10 hour flight? The breakfast was a small cup of yoghurt and a dry cake, packed in plastic, so not fresh in any way. And that was it. Guess most passengers walked straight to a café in Heathrow after arrival. So the fact is this, a great journey with Air Canada were spoilt a bit because of a pretty ridiculous try to save some money.

### "I am unimpressed"
In a 10 day span I took three flights with Air Canada, none of which were on time. The first two flight were fairly small delays of less than an hour, however on the third flight from Vancouver to Los Angeles we were delayed due to a mechanical error. I understand that these issues do happen periodically with planes but Air Canada originally told us that there was no update, they don't know exactly what is wrong and don't ask about connecting flights. I am unimpressed that Air Canada couldn't get one of my three flights to take off on time.

### "rebooked on a flight 22 hours later"
Air Canada Express was just downright bad. My inbound flight was delayed 2.5 hours which made me miss a connecting flight. I was rebooked on a flight 22 hours later, delivering me to Europe sleep-deprived. There were plenty of open seats in business class but they would not upgrade for a multiplicity of reasons. On the way back I went to the outhouse that is the part of Pearson airport Air Canada express flies out of- a small cramped prefabricated building with exasperated staff trying in vain to deal with the huddled masses.

### "gave us wrong information"
Thunder Bay to Dublin via Newark. Our origin flight was delayed getting into Toronto so we had to run to make the boarding time for our destination flight. Although, we made it to the flight they would not allow us on because our bags did not make it. We waited 2 hours from 11pm to 1am to get our hotel voucher, and had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. We were not allowed to get our bags. Our hotel was for one night with an 11am checkout, so from 11am to 11pm we had to wait at the airport. We get to our final destination, and one of our bags actually did make it on the original flight so had been waiting for us there, but the other somehow didn't make it on either. We then waited 48 hours to get our second bag delivered to us. So, we were without much of luggage for 72 hours (great way to start a trip in dirty clothes). It was strange how we flew to Dublin on a plane that didn't have any of our baggage on it when the day before we were told the that we weren't allowed to board because our bags wouldn't be travelling with us. Flight back from Dublin via Newark. We had a 3 hour layover which turned into 4.5 hours due to a delay. Then the captain advised that due to a navigation system failure on the plan it will be delayed another 2 hours. Two hours later the captain comes back and says the flight is cancelled. Customer service agents tell us it was cancelled due to weather so no vouchers (weird how the captain had just told us otherwise). We know we missed our connecting flight so asked for hotel (it was 6pm). They make us wait until 11pm to fly Toronto, then, I wait there until 2am to get hotel voucher. We had been traveling since 1am EST. Get back to final destination, and our bags were still in Newark. Again, very odd how they let us on the plane without our bags. All in all we were without our baggage 5 days and had to spend more than 30 hours waiting in multiple airports. The customer service agents gave us wrong information multiple times.

### "crew were fine"
Flew Ottawa to Calgary return with Air Canada. The plane was an E-190 with 2 seats on each side which was great for my wife and I. We sat in 30 D. After 4 1/2 hour flight both our backs hurt and continued to do so for 2-3 days. Perhaps the cushions had lost it's form. This plane is good for a couple of hours travel, but not for across Canada. Crew were fine. The gate agent in Ottawa was a miserable fellow. We watched him complain to the female gate agent about work, and he was quick to dismiss passengers who approached him with inquiries. Our return trip to Ottawa was again on a E-190. This time we upgraded to premium seat 16. Much better. No back pains, extra leg room. On board staff were great. Gate agents were friendly. Pilot kept us informed. We even flew at 39,000 feet to miss turbulence from the jet stream. Lastly the movies provided were actually pretty good.

### "staff always helpful and polite"
Jacksonville to Montreal with Air Canada - I fly between Quebec and Florida every few months. I have flown with quite a few different airlines and Air Canada has to be my favorite. I have 2 small children who fly with me and staff are always helpful and polite - as well as other passengers for that matter. If visiting Canada, I recommend taking Air Canada if possible - much better than Delta or American Airlines.

### "seat space was extremely tight"
Flew London Heathrow to Toronto. When I checked in online, I selected seats based on the seating chart. However, the configuration of the actual plane was completely different. We ended up in a row in the middle of the plane, right before the area where food is stored - the seats there don't recline (row 16). Seat space was extremely tight. Also, the AC website was down for good 5 hours and I couldn't access it to get my boarding passes. The food was bland and just not good (a couscous or bulgur salad, and chicken pasta), I didn't even bother getting breakfast. It amazes me that what we pay for tickets doesn't even get us decent food. The staff was very courteous and friendly, the plane and toilets clean, the plane on time. My luggage was lost on my way to and from Toronto, both times in Heathrow.

### "giving Air Canada a thumbs up"
A 12 hours long Air Canada flight from Toronto to Tokyo Narita and a superb one! I did not expect much from North American airlines, but to my surprise, I'm giving Air Canada a thumbs up for the flight I travelled. Maple Leaf Lounge was adequate, the shower room was clean and the shower was a satisfying one. The food served was superb and definitely comparable to that of a 5 star Carrier. I had a spacious executive pod to myself with lots of legroom. It was comfortable and I had a great 6 hours rest throughout the flight. The food was okay albeit nothing to shout about. I would say this is on par with many other Asian Carriers. Service crew were attentive and also hospitable.

### "unhelpful, callous, rude"
Sunday, May 15th. Air Canada flight 7374 from Toronto to Dulles. Traveling with family of 6. My mother became ill on the first leg of our flight from Dublin to Toronto. Was transported via ambulance from Toronto Airport to hospital. My sister rode in the ambulance. I stayed to get bags, and to deal with another unnecessary problem - my 80 year old father, in a wheelchair, and my two sons, aged 21 and 23 were going to go on to Dulles as planned but one of my sons was bumped from the flight. We paid full price in January, we picked seats, checked in, etc. No idea why he was bumped. We go to gate to try to get him on the flight. My father is stressed, my boys needed to assist him, handle luggage, get the 3 of them home, keep him calm, etc. The reps at the gate were unhelpful, callous, rude. We were vacating seats for the medical emergency, there were clearly seats available, it was a no brainer. Apparantly Air Canada staff can do nothing but look at the computer screen. It took me 2.5 hours at the airport to find someone high enough up the food chain from Air Canada to get my son on the flight and he was put on at the last minute. I should've been with my mother at the hospital but had to deal with this problem that shouldn't have been a problem at all. Also had trouble getting bags off the flight (they pulled the wrong bags twice). They rescheduled us to fly the next afternoon, then bumped my mother to a later flight and notified via email. She couldn't travel on her own. I spent hours trying to reach a customer service rep (no answer - busy signal over and over, then cut off by auto reply machine). When I got a rep he couldn't do anything said we had to go to the airport to deal with it. Finally gave up. Went to United. They were dealt with getting us on a flight, wheelchair service, etc. in less than 30 minutes of time.

### "trash collection was minimal"
Copenhagen to Toronto. I pushed the call button to request an attendant and about ten minutes after no one came I started to time how long it would take to get service - 24 minutes for someone to come to assist me, for that time there was no sign of a flight attendant in the walk ways. I spoke with the service director about the long delay only to be told that due to the placement of the call buttons on the arm rests that flight attendants can never be sure if a call is legitimate so they allow time for people to cancel the call in case it was made accidentally. I do not know if that is airline policy bit of it is the policy to ignore a call for service I am extremely disappointed. The trash collection on the flight was minimal in that cups and rappers were cluttered for a good bit requiring that tables be left done which minimizes comfort.

### "legroom in row 18 exceptional"
Our return flight from Paris started off on the wrong foot when I tried to check-in online the day before our flight. Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular. IFE was average.

### "enjoyed our experience"
Flight from Montreal YUL to Paris CDG was uneventful. We departed on time and we enjoyed our first experience flying in Premium Economy with Air Canada. The seats were relatively comfortable, with ample legroom and recline. The meal after departure was delicious (chicken curry, edamame beans, rice, with salad, roll and cake). The service was quite good, albeit a bit rushed. A light breakfast was served with banana bread and yogurt, although I expected a bit more for premium economy. The IFE was average, with not a lot of options.There is no divider between PE and Economy but overall we enjoyed our experience. Economy looked like tight quarters on this high density aircraft.

### "Porter got a whole lot more friendly"
I fly with Air Canada extensively throughout Canada. When I first started taking this route (from St. John's to Halifax) they were flying an E90. Which was a lovely plane, lots of luggage space, overhead compartments and space. Since then they have put on a CRA which admittedly was a step down, not to mention a little older - but we made due because it still offered in cabin entertainment and was able to get to and from Halifax in a reasonable period of time. Today, I have been told that in the 2 weeks since my last flight they have downgraded to a Q400 turboprop plane. This plane unlike the last two has nothing, small cabin, small space, no in cabin entertainment and to add more discomfort it will take an additional half hour to make it to its destination. flights to and from Halifax are consistently full, so clearly this is not a space issue. But it is a comfort issue for your loyal passengers. I am not a big fan of Porter as I have always been a loyal Air Canada customer but to be honest when you take away your only "advantage" Porter just got a whole lot more friendly.

### "entertainment very good"
London Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. Daytime flight on this Boeing 777-300. Travelled as a couple and upgraded the seat for one with extra legroom as I am 6'4" tall it always helps! Boarding at Heathrow was hassle free and we were welcomed on board. Seats are pretty narrow being an exit row but plenty of legroom. Food was pretty standard, crew were a bit hap hazard in that they missed passengers during service and were called back on a few occasions for missed food or drinks. Entertainment was very good, toilets were kept very clean and the one nearest our seat was much larger than normal which was a bonus. Departed on time, arrived slightly early despite the freezing conditions in Toronto.

### "they had overbooked"
Turks and Caicos to Montreal via Toronto. We were delayed take-off at Providenciales heading to Toronto due to a broken door. We missed our connection in Toronto because of this delay. They did not make the plane wait for 20 passengers and we missed it even though we were at that Gate at 2 minutes to departure. We were told to standby with 2 of our little kids. We were not given any priority and they had overbooked all 3 planes heading to Montreal that night. We finally ended at Hotel at 2am with 2 small kids overnight. They were prioritizing other standby customers who had decided to take an earlier flight. Air Canada dropped the ball. It's all a numbers game and rehearsed rubbish excuse given to each complaining customer. Too bad.

### "crew are efficient and pleasant"
Victoria to Ottawa via Toronto return with Air Canada. Another great way to get to the Canadian Capitol. From check-in to arrival, all was great. I enjoy the fact that Air Canada crew are efficient and pleasant. However, some of the seats are showing their age. My headset jack required a few tries to get the proper sound.

### "cabin crew were professional"
Flew on the B787 for Narita - Vancouver and A321 for Vancouver - Ottawa. Air Canada B787s are quite basic in comparison to their older planes (B763, B744) that I've been on and I actually like the interior of the A321 more during our journey. The 788 seats were quite narrow and hard and overall, passable in terms of comfort. The plane's interior looked "tired". Food was served fast but was not properly heated as our water and salad were frozen and not consumable. IFE was decent but did not like the fact that the remote was very small and could not be extended, thank goodness it was also touch screen though. Only plus for AC for NRT-YVR was the ground staff and cabin crew who were all helpful and friendly. As for the YVR-YOW leg, enjoyed the flight as we found the Bus to be much more comfortable than the 788. IFE was more user-friendly and of better quality. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. Drinks were served continuously throughout the flight.

### "downgrading Premium Economy"
Air Canada is showing some cheap attitude downgrading Premium Economy to just Economy Plus with such bad experience - in just over a year already their Premium economy has been homologated to what their Star Alliance partners Air China and SAS does. Last week flew Vancouver to Tokyo Narita and the service was the same of Economy except for the main course - after that is just the same drinks, the same snack, the same lunch. They keep the divider curtains open between Economy and Economy Plus section, only closed for the main course because it is different. Then flew Beijing to Toronto yesterday and it was even worse. Economy was full with 3-4-3 configuration and Premium Economy was almost empty - people from economy moving to PE (Economy Plus) seating there, the curtain open between economy and Premium economy. Now they have more Business Class seats with the bathroom in the back in economy for Economy and Economy Plus passengers. Never again Air Canada or Air China who have downgraded to a cheap product and charging the same of others whom are offering a much better product. I can't believe they invest so much money in some new cabins and they do not do that "extra" to buy a better seat and have a much better product.

### "an enjoyable flight"
Air Canada flight AC996 from Vancouver to Mexico City. Very good flight. Left on time and arrived early. The cabin crew were very professional, accommodating, friendly and smiling! An enjoyable flight. One of the better experiences with this airline and had no complaints at all.

### "seats are far too narrow"
London Heathrow to Calgary. Everything that is said by reviewers about the 3x3x3 seat configuration in economy class on the Boeing 787 is true. The seats are far too narrow for comfortable travel. I am an Air Canada frequent flyer and had the front row of economy class on the aisle - travelling with family instead of business for a change. Apart from having to deal with the very cramped middle seat person I was regularly bumped by the FAs and their trolley throughout the flight due to the very narrow aisles. I would rather fly on an older Boeing 777 or A330 then have to suffer this again. To cap it all off the FA gave me a cracked cup which leaked all over my lap. She apparently would have gone to get me some tissues but her colleague was blocking the way - possibly my worst ever flight with Air Canada.

### "not family friendly"
Cramped and not family friendly, are my resounding thoughts. I was travelling with my family, on route from Florida from Toronto to Heathrow, and Air Canada were offering reasonable prices at the time of looking. On booking the flight we requested a bassinet for our baby. We didn't get one despite repeated requests at the airport and on the plane. No attempt was made to accommodate this request. The seats on the plane with capacity for bassinets didn't have babies in them. There were other families with babies that were refused a bassinet. We are frequent fliers and I've never had this issue with an airline before. I was repeatedly hit with the trolleys as the cabin crew made their way up and down the aisles and also by other customers. The issue appears to have been caused by the introduction of an additional seat, so on the 787 the configuration of seating is 3-3-3 in economy. I spoke to the cabin crew about it, as I was unhappy at not being able to get any rest, and on a few occasions when I was holding our baby, his head was also knocked. The cabin crew also expressed their concerns as the reduced width makes their job that much more difficult and that this configuration will be the norm going forward.

### "business class luxury is lacking"
Wanted to try the newish Air Canada direct route from Amsterdam to Toronto. The plane was extremely old (probably over 20 years), and it showed in the cabin interior and design. The Business Class cabin was the old herringbone layout 1-2-1. The seat was a bit torn and dirty, again showing how aged the aircraft is. The crew were pleasant enough, and I just happen to meet them prior to the flight as we went through security together. We joked a bit, and they were quite friendly. The onboard service provided by the crew were also good. However, the food was basic, particularly for a flight over 8hrs. There was a hot meal service, portions were small. I had stuffed chicked served with rice, which was preceded by a nice seafood salad, and followed by a cheese platter. The champagne was ly bitter and undrinkable. The orange juice was not fresh but came out of a Minute Maid carton, unbefitting for the highest class Air Canada provides. The pre-landing snack was a very disappointing cold platter of sliced chicken breasts. The water on offer (Naya) didn't exactly reflect luxury. The one thing that appeared luxurious was the amenity kit with Escents toiletries. I would not recommend this for the extremely high price charged for business class. The quality and luxury of business class is simply lacking. The only thing good about it is that it's a direct service.

### "seat comfort okay"
Air Canada from Toronto to Edmonton on A319 aircraft. Boarding was done by zones and doesn't appear to be any more efficient than previous open call crush method. Middle-aged aircraft in reasonable condition, relatively clean, no readily apparent problems. Seat comfort okay and was better than some other aircraft types in the Air Canada fleet. Tray table space adequate. Overhead storage space in high demand with some people having to gate check their carry-on baggage. Underseat storage space okay for smaller items but best to keep this area clear on longer flights (to stretch your legs/feet into). Purchase food available for sale (credit card only) with Aeroplan points offered on purchases meeting minimum threshold dollar amounts. Selected a cold cut sandwich, chips and vegetable combination (quality okay but not something to tweet about). Complimentary soft drinks, juices, water, tea and coffee available with some alcoholic beverages available for sale (credit card only). Complimentary video on demand selection was reasonable with a variety of new/recent movie releases, television shows and assorted other audio/video programs. Ear bud headphones were offered for sale (credit card only) at start of flight but I had brought my own headphones to use instead. Complimentary Wi-Fi codes handed out at gate prior to boarding to those people who wanted them (special promotion by Wi-Fi service provider).

### "more enjoyable experience"
Edmonton to Kelowna via Calgary. Connecting flight from YEG-YYC-YLW on Air Canada Jazz Air de Havilland DHC-8 aircraft (with change of planes at YYC). First flight was on a newer DHC-8-402 aircraft, in good condition. Seat was tolerable for a short flight but little room to stretch out. Minimal underseat storage and overhead storage is minimal. All carry-on luggage is gate checked due to onboard storage. Flight was relatively smooth with little turbulence. No in-flight entertainment available. Snacks and beverages (water or juice) offered on the short flight. Cabin was quieter than most other turboprop aircraft due to the cabin's active noise suppression system, making for a more enjoyable experience. Second flight was delayed several times and finally departed almost an hour and a half late (no Aeroplan points or other compensation offered for the delay). This was an older de Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft which was showing its age. Seat space limited/cramped with little padding, no underseat storage and minimal overhead storage space (coat or purse or camera bag or laptop only). No meal service - only snacks and limited beverages. No in-flight entertainment available. Flight was smooth at start but became bumpy flying over the mountains and in rainstorms. Gate-checked luggage was delivered on baggage carrousel along with regular checked luggage.

### "I am very impressed"
At the end of March Break, my daughter, her husband, and their 3 and 5 year olds left Orlando on a United Airlines flight to Toronto with 90 minute connection in Newark. The flight out of Orlando was delayed and they, along with 14 other passengers, missed their connection to Toronto. United's solution was to get them on another flight to Chicago, then to Toronto which would get them there 36 hours later! Obviously, the person making that recommendation has never flown with children. Being a Star Alliance partner, Air Canada stepped up and got them on a flight with just minutes to spare, getting in to Toronto before 10 pm. Daughter and 3 year old sat in regular seats, Dad and 5 year old sat in flight attendants' jump seats. Air Canada, I am very impressed.

### "ground staff were pretty helpful"
Ottawa to Toronto with Air Canada. Given a free upgrade since I volunteered to be bumped off the last flight. Surprised they used such large equipment on this flight but I assume it was to continue on to an international flight. On this 40 minute flight there wasn't exactly a lot of time to experience Air Canada's international business class but the FAs came by with drinks and a cheese platter. Plane looked pretty dated and shook a lot during take off but the flight was pretty smooth. Ground staff at Toronto were pretty helpful at directing me to my connecting flight to JFK. Pretty satisfied with my short time on AC.

### "have impressed me the most"
Toronto to London red-eye flight. Of the three airlines I have used to fly between the UK and the East Coast US (BA, United and Air Canada) I'd have to say Air Canada have impressed me the most. Toronto-Pearson T1 is also a very nice hub terminal with a great departures lounge and seamless transfer immigration. Positively delightful compared to transfers in US airports like Boston or Newark. Flight was on a clean, modern Boeing 777 with good leg room and new IFE system. Cabin crew very friendly and attentive. Didn't manage to get a lot in the way of sleep, but that's typical for a 6-hour transatlantic night flight. Only real criticism I'd make of this flight was the breakfast - the meager banana bread doesn't cut it, I'm afraid. The dinner served was quite tasty though.

### "will not use them in the future"
I'm sorry to say that we are having a terrible experience with AirCanada. After booking our hotels and transfers for our holiday, Air Canada contacted us a few weeks prior to our trip to let us know our flights had been changed to the following day. This led to booking an extra night in a hotel near to Toronto airport. Following this, we have turned up to Toronto airport this morning to find out that our flight from Toronto to Barbados has been delayed by 6 hours. An offering of a $20 food voucher is simply not enough in this situation, monetary compensation would have been appreciated far more. They have a large customer service desk with 5 staff members answering questions, however all they have been asked to do is to tell customers to phone a number or send them an email. They seem unable to take any immediate action. It is now 4.5 hours until our flight leaves, I am not hopeful for our journey home. We will not use them again in the future, despite the more affordable price.

### "food I had was fantastic"
Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver via Toronto. Boston to Toronto was a quick hour long flight on the Embraer 190, which is quite pleasant. Quick layover in Toronto and off to Vancouver in a Boeing 777-200ER. The best plane I'd flown in. So smooth and quite, with a great entertainment system. The food I had was fantastic.

### "very comfortable massage seats"
Toronto to Dubai, and Air Canada investment into new aircraft has paid off on this very long haul route. If you are a Business class passenger you will not be disappointed in this Boeing 787 seat Pod. This is my first Air Canada flight on this new route and I chose to use the last of my upgrade credits and $500 to get a Business seat, I was very glad I did this. I was pleasantly surprised when I got on the flight and it was a new aircraft, usually AC focus's on the Asia Market but maybe they decided that Canada's largest expat community of Dubai might switch back to them vise using the high class and direct flight competitors. Who knows, I was very happy in a luxury pod with very comfortable massage seats and a fantastic Entertainment system. The large screens were amazing but I knocked back a point on the score for the endless commercials you have to go thru with every movie or TV program selected - I normally fast forward, read a book or go to the toilet during this time. Meanwhile in Economy the seats looked nice in Premium Economy but Economy looked a little cramped (Boeing likes to add another seat per row over Airbus so seat width is automatically smaller no matter what configuration is flown). One of the strangest things is that for a flight this long (12+ hrs) that a complimentary toiletry flight pack is not given to economy like the old days - very sad that North American Airlines set the bar lower than Europe and Asia Airline companies. Air Canada advertised the wifi but I did not use it at all, too busy sleeping or watching my big screen TV.

### "treat their loyal customers better"
I was booked on a very tired Air Canada aircraft with poor service from Halifax to Toronto. It started with the booking where, as a Aeroplan Elite Flyer, I was not given a choice of seat selection (which we used to have in the past) so asked for a widow or aisle and got a middle seat. Aircraft was dirty and the only redeeming quality of the flight was the decent entertainment system. However you have to sit thru multiple commercials with every selection, even a 20 minute TV show (so the commercials were almost as long as the program). For over 10 years I have been flying steadily with Air Canada/Aeroplan mostly internationally but domestic as well. I know what AC used to be and what it is today and it is sad that to increase their bottom line they have selected to emulate other reward programs (to the point where their loyalty program is negligible) and service programs (where we are paying more per seat yet getting less in flight services including luggage options). Strange considering that airlines are making record profits. Would I recommend this airline, I answered yes. I would not recommend to any international traveler looking for Elite status as there are other Star Alliance airlines that treat their loyal customers better and allow them to keep their status longer.

### "seating, service and IFE acceptable"
Short haul Air Canada flight from Toronto Pearson to Montreal, lasted about an hour. The baseline seating, service and inflight entertainment are acceptable, considering that there is not much time to watch more than half a movie. Flight left on time, cabin crew provided weather updates, and luggage and everything else arrived on time.

### "flight attendants were polite"
Los Angeles to Montreal with Air Canada. Plane was shabby and headphone socket only supported one channel, restrooms were dirty. The flight attendants were polite and attentive, but did not offer drinks, pillows or blankets. Transfer process was poorly explained with no instructions as to the baggage transfer process for international flyers.

### "seats are quite nice"
Frankfurt to Toronto. Not that impressed by Air Canada business class. Seats are quite nice, very good legroom. Service and food not impressive. Asked flight attendant if I could have another glass of champagne, the answer was : I will see if I have some. Perhaps I expected more because a month ago I flew Qatar Airways in business.

### "not the best airline"
Flew to Vancouver return with Air Canada and not the best airline I have flown with. Cabin crew mature and quite unfriendly. We were sat at the rear of the plane on our outward bound flight and we were told that there was no choice of dish as they had run out. Seating was the usual type in economy, one of our tv screens didn't work, but no less comfortable than any other. Hardly any crew announcements and those that were made were not very audible.

### "the crew was pleasant"
Montreal to London Heathrow in Business Class. Check in was easy and was assisted by a cheerful agent. Lounge in the international departures area was busy and uncomfortably hot. Following an orderly boarding, the flight pushed back 8 minutes behind schedule due to late arrival of connecting passengers. Once in the air, the service was prompt. Except for one FA who addressed the passengers brusquely, the crew was pleasant and welcoming. The meal was below average in quality with my fish overcooked to the extent it was almost bone dry so I ended up eating the vegetables only. IFE had a good range of new releases. The seating was in the pod style and comfortable with a plush pillow and duvet. Flight arrived ahead of time and bags were already on the carousel by the time I cleared passport formalities. Aside from the disappointing dinner, it was a pleasant experience.

### "my luggage did not arrive"
Two consecutive trips from Toronto to SF and Air Canada missed my checked luggage both times. We traveled with an infant and so, you can imagine how terrible this entire ordeal was. The first time, they did not deliver the luggage till three days later. The luggage came later on the same day but was not delivered immediately. Instead, Air Canada sends these luggage via domestic two day shipping. So, the luggage was picked up the next day and then makes it way from SF to Oakland and finally to Santa Clara, a total of 3 days later. Customer Service said they try their best to ensure luggage make it on the plane but if it doesnt, they are not liable. I was reluctant to travel Air Canada again but I did and would you believe, for the second time in a row, my luggage did not arrive. I decided to drive back to the airport close to midnight to get my luggage this time (on the next flight that it came on) because of the first experience. I complained and customer service pretty much said sorry and that's it. No reimbursement, no voucher. Never flying Air Canada.

### "may as well be flying alone"
Toronto to Hong Kong. My wife and I decided to go away on our honeymoon over March Break and fly Air Canada despite previous disappointments in the past. History has again repeated itself and our honeymoon has been soured from the minute we arrived at the airport. Our plane has been changed and we are now sitting in the last row, not even together for the 12hr plus flight. When we spoke to Customer Service we got the ever usual response of "the system is automated, nothing we can do". We seldom get the chance to travel and now we may as well be flying alone.

### "disappointment with Air Canada"
I moved to Sydney from Canada and flew with Air Canada. I had my carry-on luggage approved at the beginning of my trip with the proper tags. On a connecting flight, I was told I would have to check one of my bags at the gate because the plane was full. Once on the plane, I had an entire row to myself and thought it was very strange that I was forced to check a bag onto a plane that was clearly not full. Once I arrived in Sydney, my bag checked at the gate did not come out with the rest of the baggage. I spoke with 5 or more airline reps to try to figure out what happened to my bag over the course of a couple days and received different answers each time. In the beginning my bag was just missing and no one could tell me where it was. If I have been forced to check a bag unnecessarily it should not just "go missing". Later in the week I heard varying other stories and eventually realized my bag was just not put on my flight at all. I understand that airlines cannot always fit all baggage, but the least Air Canada could have done in this situation is to track where the bags are in order to avoid unnecessary stress. I eventually got my luggage but had to go through a lot of confusion and stress over it. I was moving across the world and did not need the added stress of a bag being missing. I was also approved by an agent to be reimbursed $100 for missing items after submitting claim with receipts. I submitted a claim to be reimbursed for one of my items missing a month ago and have still not received anything back 3 months later. Upon expressing my disappointment with Air Canada, I was given an apology for the inconvenience and nothing else.

### "receive my bag completely wet"
Air Canada from Toronto to Montreal. Flight was full and departed on time. Gate agent asked me if I could check my bag in as the flight was pretty full. I obliged only to receive my bag in Montreal completely wet. Service was very good for a 50 minute flight; however, due to a lightning storm the plane was held on the tarmac for nearly 1.5 hours. After the alert passed, we stayed on the plane for another hour. The captain was clueless as to why. I wrote Air Canada on facebook and they stated that Montreal Airport had not cleared our plane. Air Canada seems to work fine, it is when they depend on inefficient operators such as YUL when things start going wrong.

### "cabin crew really good"
Air Canada from Mexico to Toronto in economy class. The flight was completely full with little space for carry-on. Food was buy on board in economy. Selection was not very appetizing for a red eye flight. Cabin crew was really good, and kept going around the cabin in case they were needed. The cabin service director was present in both economy and business class.

### "badly manned service desk"
Booked transatlantic with ongoing trip to Central America with Air Canada rouge. Booked Toronto airport hotel overnight as long time between connection. Flight delayed another five hours, day wasted at airport and badly manned service desk with bad mannered staff. Ongoing flight, poor legroom, food at extra charge, renting out iPads because no screens in seats.

### "clean and refurbished planes"
Very nice experience flying with Air Canada. Clean and refurbished planes, you don't notice that they are almost thirty years old (Boeing 767-300ER). Flights almost on time (one hour late out of Toronto due to snowstorm). Smooth Atlantic crossing, tasty food and beverages/wine for free. All seats with individual screens. Nice, helpful flight attendants and good information from cockpit. Seating was fair with decent legroom and comfortable seats. It is a far better and more efficient option to go with Air Canada to Toronto if you have a connection the West Indies (as we had) or South America than to go through USA with their complicated immigrations.

### "consistent and good option"
Overall a very good experience. Lounge in the domestic terminal of Montreal was excellent. Domestic leg on a long-haul plane coming from Geneva was very good. Lie-flat seats in herringbone configuration. A cold meal and alcoholic beverages were offered for free. Cabin crew was friendly and worked well, but their presentation was unprofessional and terribly groomed. Lounge in Toronto was very good but too crowded during that time of the day: hardly a place to seat. Flight to MEX was on an A319. Cabin crew looked well groomed and service was impecable. Meals were really plentiful and the purser worked around the clock to check everyone had enough. Inflight entertainment was not very good, lucky that there was a movie I wanted to see among the options. Arrival gate was changed, but we deplaned quickly and bags came promptly. Air Canada is a very consistent and good option. Too bad grooming and good presentation is not always seen as important. It is all they need to be on par with other airlines.

### "a comfortable flight"
Flew Air Canada from Toronto Pearson to Paris CDG. Exceptional ground staff, spent time in the Maple Leaf Lounge in Toronto which added to our trip experience. Flight itself was on time and the onboard service was excellent. The 787 itself is a great plane. A comforting interior with good leg room and wide seats. Overall a comfortable flight. Only thing missing was a foot or leg rest for our bulkhead seats.

### "my airline of choice"
Paris CDG to Toronto. Check in counter for Air Canada was quick and noticed that those flying economy had the same prompt attention. Comfort, space and service were far superior to other carriers I have taken on that route. Daytime flight and noticed how the windows dimmed and interior lighting changed. Overall Air Canade is my airline of choice.

### "Overall a decent experience"
Montreal to São Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. Smooth check-in via priority desk. Both flights arrived on time although departure from Toronto was delayed by 20 minutes due to late arrival of incoming aircraft. B767 with rundown equipment, tattered lavatory and dim lighting. The indicator for the washroom was inoperable the entire flight showing both washrooms occupied for the duration. Average food and beverages on both flights. Only one choice of red wine on the domestic portion with the FA blaming it on the heavy consumption on the incoming flight. It is hard to believe they were unable to restock at a major hub like Montreal! The IFE had a good selection but I chose to sleep most of the trip. FA's were very personable on both flights and the service director on the YYZ-GRU leg deserved special mention for her attentive and very personable service. Overall a decent experience but the B767's must be replaced soon.

### "restore priority check-in"
Toronto Pearson to Montreal Trudeau. Check-in procedure at the airport is now a mess, especially for E35k frequent flyers. AC should be ashamed! With the new Business Class check-in for 50k and above, the E25k and E35k flyers are relegated to a single agent in a different part of the check-in area. It's great to enhance service for the business class and the most frequent flyers, but it should not come at the expense of the E25k and E35k flyers. We waited close to 30 minutes for an agent today and came close to missing our flight. Previously I've never waited longer than 10 minutes. Air Canada, if you're reading this, please restore "priority check-in" for E25K and E35K flyers. A single agent for a long line of folks does not make for a priority check-in experience. It's more like an embarrassment.

### "food was terrible"
Air Canada, Toronto to Charlotte - the service on the plane was sub-par. The food was terrible. The cost is unreasonable given what you are provided with and the ground crew are not particularly nice or professional. On the plus side, the plane was okay.

### "the lunch was very good"
Heathrow to Toronto with Air Canada. Check-in and security took 10 minutes in Terminal 2 - great. A fairly long walk to the gate area and the Maple Leaf lounge : comfortable, a warm greeting and a most adequate selection of breakfast food. Boarding was completed early for a 0900 departure but we were then delayed for a minor technical issue which was quickly resolved. Friendly cabin crew served a hot breakfast and subsequently a full lunch : breakfast was not great but the lunch was very good with some good wines available. The herringbone seating is ok - certainly better than BA's product - but I believe AC are improving this on their newer aircraft. Arrival a few minutes late due to headwinds but I was out of the terminal with my checked bag in 20 minutes - a record for me.

### "customer service very troublesome"
Flew from Toronto Montreal. Departure flight was late on take off for an hour because fuel nozzle was frozen (10am). Apparent no quality control but I will give the benefit of the doubt to Air Canada. Return flight, passenger loaded and waited for an hour at the gate for "head office approval" for a cowling replacement that had to have been done overnight before going to the gate. Maintenance was checking the cowling measurements at the gate for head office approval. Finally got approval and pushed back. When engine started "something" got sucked into the jet blades and damaged them. Suspect maintenance left something on the ledge of the engine. Plane was pulled back to the gate and disembarked after waiting 20 minutes for customer service agent to come to the gate. When we got off the plane their was no customer service agent. Went to customer service desk at Gate 1 from Gate 47 and lined up for one agent. Announced to go to Gate 11A for replacement plane. Lined up near back of line at Gate 11A and waited for 20 minutes then went to investigate. 150 people plus lined up at an empty wicket. Went for dinner in a nearby airport pub and watched people stand there while we ate dinner. Phoned AC and they called back 30 minutes later to advise to use same boarding pass and no need to line up. Where was AC announcement of this at airport? Quality control and customer service very troublesome.

### "service onboard excellent"
Our Air Canada Express flight left Québec with a delay of more than one hour because of a mechanical problem. Service onboard was excellent. Friendly flight attendant attentive with the need of the passengers. The cabin need a major refresh and modernization. I recommend this airline.

### "a dismal experience"
I flew with Air Canada using Airmiles and it was a dismal experience. On the flight there, the food took 2.5 hours to make its way down the plane - extremely painful as it was right around dinner time. When we arrived in Toronto, the baggage took almost an hour to arrive. On my flight home, they overbooked it (the third flight in a row that they had overbooked that evening). The person at the gate was rude and impatient when explaining the situation to passengers who had paid to be on that flight. In my opinion, it is ridiculous to overbook flights, and it should not be the norm of an airline's practice. The flight attendants were harried and frustrated (understandably), and the airplane took off 25 minutes late. When I arrived in Calgary, the baggage took a long time to arrive again, the belt stopping several times even when bags were on the ramp, making it so passengers could see their bags, but not pick them up until the belt started moving. My two main issues were with the overbooking, and the way the way the gate person addressed people who were trying to find out whether or not they would get on the flight. Reprehensible customer service, I will not be flying with Air Canada any time in the foreseeable future.

### "good service onboard"
Air Canada Express from Sept-Îles to Québec. Smooth boarding in few minutes despite the plane was full. Left on time from and Sept-Îles and arrive on time in Québec. Good service onboard for a flight of 90 minutes. A negative point: Price of the ticket is high. I will fly Air Canada Express again.

### "very generous legroom"
Toronto to Vancouver. Air Canada ground staff in YYZ not as friendly as YVR but I guess it is a much busier station. I again paid $60 extra to book a preferred seat. This time it was 13A on Boeing 787. This seat is in the Premium economy cabin. I was made aware of the fact that this was not *Premium Economy* service as Air Canada does not offer that class of service domestically. It is simply a charge to sit in this section of the cabin. It was worth the money for a 4.5 hour flight. The small cabin is very private, with very generous legroom, seat width and comfort. It also means that you are the first to be offered food and beverage service and among the first to deplane at destination. Buy onboard  choices were in my opinion reasonably priced and a very nice selection. Flight attendants attentive yet realised it was an evening flight and many people just wanted to nap. Two trolley services were offered as well as a couple of water runs. Superbowl was being played as we were flying and the flight deck made two announcements to give the score at the end of halftime and the final score. Perfect, rather than making copious announcements every time the score changed. Cabin crew checking the cabin to make sure everyone was looked after, but respecting the fact that many were sleeping. The only observation I had is that the flight was only approx 65% full yet all the seats in the back 10 rows remained empty. Surely the ground staff could have suggested moving some of the pax to even out the space and make more people more comfortable.

### "not a great experience"
At Toronto airport, even though I had Elite status, the staff didn't make me feel especially welcome or valued customer. I had the opportunity to try out Air Canada's new Premium Economy product on this domestic flight between YYZ and YVR, which required paying a bit extra to be in a special cabin just in front of regular Economy. The seat was not remarkable, except that it has a wider seat pitch and a bit more recline and a footrest. The plane was a Boeing 777, which had 458 seats, and it took a very long time to board the aircraft because there were so many passengers. The crew were doing their job, not particularly friendly or offering service that deserves any mention. On flight was offered drinks twice. The captain (or co-pilot) was attentive though, as we experienced quite a bit of turbulence and he came on several times to assure the passengers. Really not a great experience in Premium Economy.

### "impressed in all aspects"
Vancouver to Toronto with Air Canada. Very impressed in all aspects of this flight. Online check in easy, proceeded straight to the gate, friendly ground staff in YVR. Flight departed on time, very full but didn't feel crowded. Captain kept us updated through the flight. Paid $60 in advance for a preferred seat 18K which was worth every penny. Tons of legroom. My first time on a 787 and it was very impressive. Excellent features and very quiet. Flight Attendants very well groomed, friendly and efficient. I do find it annoying that on a four hour North American flight on a full service airline that the only food offering is buy onboard. However, having said that the pricing and quality of the items cannot be faulted. I prepaid for a meal and snack voucher for $7 Canadian. For that I choose a Swiss cheese / crackers package which had a very generous offering of cheese with it, and a delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye with pickles. It would have cost more than that just about anywhere else. Buying it in advance is quite a saving over the listed prices and the flight crew knew I had done so and offered up choices in advance before things ran out. Quite an efficient system for buy onboard. Water was offered regularly on top of the two trolley services which include complimentary coffee / tea / softdrinks. Early arrival in Toronto after a very pleasant flight.

### "excellent food and drinks"
Flew Air Canada business class from Calgary to Narita on the direct flight. Flight left on time and service on board was good. Good selection of excellent food and drinks. FAs very attentive. Seating is herring bone style and seats fold to completely flat position which allows for comfortable sleeping. IFE offering also good with reasonable selection of movies. One complaint though, the WC was not kept clean. This is unacceptable. FAs should check and clean washrooms inflight if necessary.

### "sleeping was no problem"
Toronto to Frankfurt on an overnight,  checking in was easy with a separate section for Business, Premium class flyers. Maple Leaf Lounge was great, many seats and tables, plus free food and drink. On this Boeing 777-300, Business has a 1-2-1 Pod style seats. I found nothing wrong with them. If it was a bad thing, I couldn't sit beside my wife who I was also on this trip, so I sat behind her on the right side of the plane. To sit kinda beside is taking an isle seat but it's no window seat, plus because the pods are positioned in the pod style, being comfortable in your chair would be hard to chit chat to your traveling partner, so it's down to preference. Food was great, and the drinks were non stop. The bed was 180 degree flat bed and comfortable. There were no PJ's provided like other airlines. I am 6ft 2 and did not find it cramped and sleeping was no problem. I did read reviews in advanced that sitting in the last back seat of each section of Business, provides a bit more storage space, and it was true. So if you book in advanced and select your seat, try for these. But overall, no complaints. The flight was spacious, pods give that cozy effect. There is plenty of plugs and sockets to charge your things. However, non North American travelers, if you need a plug, make sure you have your plug converter.

### "retro experience"
Toronto to Frankfurt with Air Canada - extremely slow check-in, unsure why, but neither the computer check-in or the desk layout are intuitive. At the gate - E-71, ground announcements were not intelligible. Onboard is where the retro experience begins. Crew are friendly, service good, but food, ergonomics and entertainment are 1990s - late 20th C at best. The problem is that, for the money one pays, the actual experience is a complete letdown. For same, lower or slightly higher cost, various competitors offer 21st C comfort and care. Poor entertainment, analog quality, reminds me of a VCR. Seats - I am fit and slim, 177cm tall and barely fit. Cannot imagine how taller people, such as most Western Europeans would feel. Food was forgettable - continental breakfast, some snacks and some pasta. WiFi and connectivity - non-existant. Lufthansa on the flight after - same Airbus, different league.

### "IFE on every seat"
I was supposed to fly to Toronto from New York on Westjet but I got stuck in Boston. I booked an Air Canada flight instead and I was very glad I did. Checking in online was easy and I was able to select my preferred seat. At the airport, Air Canada ground crew were friendly, they let me check two bags for free. Boarding was on time and so was the arrival. It was my first time to fly on an Embraer aircraft. I was impressed - I think E-jets have a lot to offer. There was IFE on every seat and the cabin crew were attentive and helpful. Snacks were available and they were tasty. As it was a day flight, I enjoyed the view, especially when we flew over the Niagara falls. I enjoyed the flight and would definitely fly with Air Canada again.

### "Leg space is really limited"
Air Canada's service was, from beginning to end, appalling. On the flight from Tokyo Haneda to NYC via Toronto one of the flight attendants treated passengers as if they were inferior to her. Before takeoff she ordered passengers to close their overhead compartment (isn't this her responsibility?). At one point, there was a lady with a crying baby. This flight attendant told her to put her two large bags up in the compartment in a rude and apathetic manner. The lady was too short to do so, and she was alone, so she had to get a tall passenger next to her to do it for her. On another occasion, she came over and reached over to turn off my reading light without any warning, which I was using to do my knitting. As she reached over, she spilt water on my boyfriend's leg, she apologised and said "give it 2 minutes and it'll dry. The two male flight attendants were also rude - when handing out inflight meals, they would stare in silence when passengers were trying to decide what meal to pick and when collecting trays they would just hold out their hands, expecting passengers to hand over your tray as well as other passengers if they were sleeping. On the ground, before take off I politely asked an Air Canada staff member if my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other since our seats were one in front of the other. He seemed overly confident that it was possible and told me he would call my name out. I waited until the last minute, after people started boarding, for him to call my name to find out that he found an aisle seat 9 rows away with no change to the other middle seat we initially had. I understand an aisle seat is great when traveling alone, but this was the opposite of what we wanted - we were now 9 rows away. I told him that that's not what we want, and immediately he snapped, took back the flight ticket, and said, "if you're not going to appreciate this change I'm giving you back your old seats. To add, the inflight vegetarian meals were awful, if at all edible. Leg space is really limited compared to Air Canada's smaller, older planes. I would pay more just to avoid Air Canada.

### "food and service very good"
Great experience with Air Canada flying from Vancouver to Sydney. Began with an outstanding agent at check in at Vancouver who couldn't have been more helpful with some complexities with our reservations. Not Air Canada's fault. Inflight food and service very good. Dinner, plentiful snacks, and a very decent breakfast all superior to other major airlines I've flown recently. Flight Attendants helpful and attentive, Premium Economy seat very comfortable. A better product than Premium Economy on other carriers I've experienced.

### "professional cabin crew"
Montreal to São Paulo via Toronto on Air Canada. Smooth check-in and on time performance on all 4 legs. Friendly and professional cabin crew on all flights, especially on the outbound leg between Toronto and São Paulo. Food quality and quantity were decent but the quality of wines offered has deteriorated. The Boeing 767's are really showing their age and AC needs to replace them soon. Lie flat seats offer reasonable comfort but they need better cushioning and back support in the flat position. IFE had good variety for movies and TV shows but audio offering was dismal. Overall it was a good experience although the final leg on the return was cancelled without advance notice and I was not offered the customary Concierge service as a top tier flyer. This meant I had to run around and make alternate arrangements; a blemish to what would otherwise have been a good travel experience. This was particularly disappointing given Toronto is AC's Global Hub. AC needs to either deliver the Concierge service as advertised and promised to its most loyal clients or get rid of it all together to avoid failed expectations.

### "had to pay for food"
Toronto to Aruba, and although this was not an Air Canada rouge flight, we had to pay for food (it's a 5 hour flight). Plus you get to pay 25$ per bag. I don't doubt that this was somewhere in the fine print but I was very surprised about it considering the airfare wasn't cheap. Now the main part. FAs were in a bad mood on both flights, border-line unpleasant. When it's a short flight I couldn't care less. When I'm flying for 5 hours with a 2 year old, customer service is more important. Besides, I used my own headphones since AC charges for their own and I had to insert and hold them throughout the whole movie in a specific way so that I could actually hear something. Really? Considering that this is 4th Air Canada flight in a row with identically bad experiences, I will avoid flying Air Canada whenever possible. Their corporate culture and inflight experience is way below what they cost.

### "promptly offered us a direct flight"
We ended up getting caught in the big storm disruption of Jan 22nd during our flight from Saint John, NB to Santa Ana, California. We made it as far as Montreal and our flight on the Chicago leg of our trip was cancelled. Air Canada promptly offered us a direct flight from Montreal to LAX which we accepted. It was a chaotic time and we appreciate so much being able to get to California. We know that many others spent days trying to get flights to their destinations.

### "excellent first trip"
I wanted to report an excellent first trip with Air Canada. Whilst the economy class leg from London to Toronto was pleasantly served by cabin crew but tiring in economy, we opted on transit at Toronto to pay for business class upgrades to Santiago. What a pleasant experience, and Air Canada ranked very high. The only downside was that our luggage were not off-loaded and continued on to Buenos Aires so we were delivered one day late. But this did not overshadow the experience.

### "do not rely on Air Canada"
This has nothing to do with my last trip but about my Air Canada Toronto to Vancouver flight that got cancelled for my wedding in May 2016. I had already reserved seats and put my down payments. I am 4 months out until my wedding now and they cancelled my flight! The date they had tried to reschedule my flight was too late for my destination wedding, the resort just about almost cancelled my wedding date because of this. Do not rely on Air Canada especially for a huge event like your wedding!

### "polite service from the FAs"
YUL-YYZ departure did not go well. AC canceled my flight and rebooked me on an earlier flight. This was done with no notice sent to me. The end result is that I nearly missed my flight and managed to make it by running to the gate. To ensure my bag would make the flight, the agent at checking told me to take my bag to oversized. Had I not been traveling at an off peak hour I would have missed my next flight to Taipei and been stuck in YYZ for 2-4 days waiting for room on the next available flight. The cabin was filled with AC personnel, who took up most of the overhead compartment space, making it difficult to find any space. The flight was fine otherwise with polite service from the FAs. YYZ-YUL: Was able to go and standby and to get an earlier flight (which departed late). The connections agent was helpful. At the gate, it was one agent professional and the other miserable and rude. Again, due to off peak travel time, delays and crowding were much better than usual. Flight was full, but FAs maintained a professional approach. As a very welcome surprise, baggage arrived in a timely manner on both flights. Had it not been for AC's error and the resulting stress and discomfort on the outbound flight I would have rated the flights 8.

### "supposed to swim to Victoria"
Our inbound Lufthansa flight was late leaving Frankfurt and we missed our Air Canada connection to Victoria from Vancouver. We were told that all later flights to Victoria were fully booked and were put in a taxi paid for by Air Canada to the ferry terminal at Tsawwassen. The Air Canada clerk told us to retain the receipt for the purchase of the ferry tickets and then claim the cost from Air Canada. I have tried to do this and Air Canada tell me that we were not authorised to take the ferry so therefore they will not refund the cost. I assume that as Air Canada sent us to the ferry terminal which is obviously by the water, we were supposed to swim to Victoria. All in all, the customer service, or lack thereof, from Air Canada leaves much to be desired. I guess they just think that I will give up and go away. After all I am only trying to claim a lousy 34 CAD. I did try to claim for the four hour delay in reaching my final destination, but we can forget that too. Well, guess what Air Canada? Air France also offer the route from Valencia to Victoria and let's see if you can work out which airline I will use next time.

### "$25 USD for a checked bag"
US to Canada is treated as domestic travel, so no complimentary booze. (I've flown Air Canada from Seoul to Newark via Vancouver and the transpacific leg included complimentary meals and drinks. YVR to EWR didn't.) It cost $25 USD for a checked bag for each flight. I had three flights through Air Canada on my last trip, so that was costly. The plane advertises WIFI on board, but I couldn't connect on my flights. In flight entertainment is decent. Staff is pleasant enough. Better than United, worse than most Asian carriers.

### "met with no help at all"
Montreal to Charleston via Chicago. Bad experience with Air Canada in Montreal, initial flight was delayed 4 hours causing us to miss our connection. We were then advised to speak to customer service to sort out this issue, and after waiting two hours were lied to - the manager in Montreal guaranteed in person that the delay was not weather related and that when we arrived in Chicago we would receive a hotel voucher for the night. We took the late flight out of Montreal and were met with no help at all in Chicago - no voucher, and we were told it was a weather delay by the Air Canada staff so they didn't owe us anything. As a result we spent the night in the airport, waiting for the only available flight at 6am. In the end, my family and I did everything right and when Air Canada ruined our travel they did nothing to fix it at all.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Rome Fiumicino to Ottawa via Toronto and all went very well. I am a frequent flyer with Swiss, and yet Air Canada has exceeded all my expectations. The flights were on time , all quiet onboard, the meals served were acceptable and generally fantastic service. The luggage assistance was better. No complaints.

### "she should be commended"
I would like to commend the staff who helped me on last nights Air Canada flight AC102 from Vancouver to Toronto. I required a wheelchair on arrival and a lovely young women (3 weeks on the job) pushed me from plane door up to the building and on to a golf chart. I was taken by the cart to near Security and told to wait for another wheelchair to take me thru and down to the luggage pick up. But there was a mix up and no one came to wheelchair me on. I waited for over 10 mins and finally I asked for help and they asked me my flight number. After a few minutes the same girl who had assisted me from the plane took me to luggage and also out to the garage to get to my son's car. She was so wonderful to me. She was quite tiny and I am a large elderly women with severe arthritis. I don't know how she managed to move me up hill so easily and cheerfully. I forget her name but she was such a wonderful guardian angel when I needed it most. Please pass on my thanks and gratitude. She should be commended.

### "extra money is worth it"
First time flying Premium Economy with Air Canada on a Boeing 787. Having used British Airways Premium Economy on the London to Toronto route, I was keen to compare the two. Check in was not at Heathrow as I was hubbing from Germany - the new terminal is great other than the trek to the gate. Priority boarding was quick and easy. On board, the Premium Economy cabin is great - just three rows creating a quiet and intimate environment. A menu was offered along with decent hot towels and juice or water. (in plastic cups) The food was at best average with either cheese pasta of red chicken curry on offer. Neither were my idea of an upgraded meal service. No bar service before a late lunch was offered and so a pre dinner drink was served (when asked) along with the meal. Two T&Cs were offered along with a drink after dinner. The AVOD / entertainment was excellent - probably the highlight! A large screen akin to a tablet with easy navigation. The seat was comfy too though being in the front row meant (bizarrely) that there was no foot stall. The crew were ok - nothing special, but did make an effort to engage. We took off late and landed early so no complaints there. Like BA, the Premium Economy experience morphed into economy for the snack. Another hot towel with the (Economy) hot savory slice merely served on a china plate with two chocolates. There were nice touches using decent glass for drinks, tablecloths on the table etc etc But then odd things such as serving the boarding drink in plastic, poor food choice or a low quality snack on china. All in all, the extra money is worth it to me for the priority boarding, more space and a decent level of service. I think BA has the edge only because the product is more mature. With a bit of tuning Air Canada could really turn it into a quality Premium Economy experience rather than the slightly ill thought out, inconsistent and hit and miss nature of the service.

### "failed on multiple occasions"
Calgary to Los Angeles via Vancouver. I have flown Air Canada multiple times and normally never had bad service, but this experience consisted of a 26-hour hold up in Vancouver International Airport. While the initial delay was due to factors beyond Air Canada's control, our family was then overbooked on multiple flights, transferred to a United Airlines flight, only to be rejected from boarding that flight due to Air Canada not transferring our bag (United Airlines stated that without our bag, they would not let us board the flight due to liability concerns). We then had multiple conversations with various Air Canada employees, one of whom in particular was aggressive and confrontational, telling me at one point that I should consider myself lucky that she was spending her time dealing with me. She also lied to us on multiple occasions. Air Canada eventually offered us a hotel and a flight via Seattle the next morning, and then did a complete about face after we accepted, refusing to honour the offer they made less than an hour before. The reason our bag was not transferred to United Airlines (as we discovered when we went to collect it after the last flight for the day had left from Vancouver Airport without us on board), was that it had already flown to Los Angeles earlier that day. Ironically, we did eventually end up flying from Vancouver to Seattle, and then taking Alaskan Airlines from Seattle to Los Angeles the next day (as Air Canada had offered us shortly after the United Airlines fiasco). I tried to follow this issue up with Air Canada's customer relations department, but unfortunately they failed on multiple occasions to even recognize my concerns adequately (for example, the reply about my concern with not being allowed to board the United Airlines due to lost baggage was to state that the "aim [of Star Alliance] was to build an airline alliance which would improve the travel experience of customers. The reply did not address my concern at all after this statement, leaving me rather confused as to what Air Canada was trying to get at.

### "Zoning hampers boarding "
London to Vancouver. Why there is zone boarding no one really knows nor understands as every traveller is confused about when to board. Zoning hampers boarding greatly as it does not consider row numbers only the ticket price as common denominator. Zone 5 by far what most people have is the last, but since row numbers are all over the place there is a long line-up throughout the plane, since row 19 or 40 are boarding at the same time. Food on Air Canada flights is tasteless. Flight attendants on this flight were not helpful when asked for things such as special meals. There were 2 infants in my vicinity who seemingly were not given an extra seat belt for take off. Due to a minor turbulence coffee was not served as it was too bumpy, but cold drinks were. Air Canada amaze me in ever new negative ways.

### "family unfriendly"
Me and my family (spouse, myself and our 2 year old) recently flew to London, and Air Canada was a subpar experience, and child/family unfriendly. Toronto to London departing at 6:30pm, online check-in did not work and we had to join the regular queue. My wife and I were not seated together although we booked our seats online next to each other. Air Canada staff worked things out with another passenger so the three of us could be together. During the flight, they didn't turn the lights out for about 5 hours into the flight citing 'having a full flight and being busy'. The return flight departure was delayed by 1 hour. We were again seated separately and when I asked, their staff suggested we work things out with other fellow passengers. They did the same to another family with an infant and another couple. People were seated away from their travelling partners. They helped only when I continued to insist. Food on both flights was ok. We received the bags super quickly on both legs.

### "cabins seem very cramped"
Toronto to Hong Kong. Air Canada's business cabins seem very cramped. Although you are seated in a pod it's very narrow with limited storage space. Seat is extremely hard with limited padding. You are provided with a comforter and small pillow. I found the lie flat seat very uncomfortable to sleep on. I cannot understand why these seats are so hard (other than seat padding adds weight). Air Canada seems to have crammed in as many pods into the cabin as possible. Food service was average, basic meal (more like what was provided in economy class years ago). Cabin comfort and food service not at par with Asian airlines but still better than United Airlines. Crew typical Air Canada, efficient, few smiles. Good movie selection.

### "best in North America"
Boarding for Toronto to Frankfurt was quite chaotic, as Air Canada overbooked. Some folks had no seats. There were long lines in the small terminal space and everyone was quite disorganised. I was in Zone 2 for boarding but there were many other passengers waiting in the wrong line, obstructing the traffic. The seat was okay, but not very comfortable after sitting in it for too long. I managed to doze off, but the flight attendants kept coming around shouting "Drinks", "Duty free! which was annoying. They could have been a bit more discreet and gentle about it. Food was okay, but I have had the same thing many times and the menu has not changed for at least half a year. Breakfast was a joke as we only got a banana bread and a drink. IFE (touch screen) was okay, though I didn't really use it. The flight left on time and arrived early. I will recommend this airline in so far as it is the best in North America.

### "2 hours for a beverage refill"
First of all it is super silly to complain when you have a seat in the business class cabin. However, considering what I paid for that seat - what is Air Canada even thinking? It seems like they haven’t flown these planes before or have anyone on staff that has even one flight of experience on their resume. It began at check-in in Columbus where no less than 5 agents stood looking at their computers and doing their best to check in two passengers in the span of 35 minutes. I was embarrassed for them and luckily we had arrived early so we weren’t stressed with time constraints. I am on a flight from Toronto to New Delhi, sitting in 3G with the seat all the way back, attempting to balance myself while typing this, sitting up, on a half-way reclined seat. God bless the flight attendants – I just asked one for help to put my seat back to a semi-seated position and she started pressing the buttons on my seat controls and said, “It’s not working? Well, do you want duty free?” The “chair moving system” is apparently turned off for the moment as they “reboot the entertainment system.”  There is no way to put my seat up and one of the flight attendants acknowledged this fact. I tuned in to the inflight programming before takeoff and that was the last time that it actually worked. I was able to begin the “Diary of a Teenage Girl” but that is no longer a choice on the movie selection. This is a 14 hour flight and we are now only able to access 5 movie choices from the New Releases. This was after the crew attempted to reset the service for two hours. The reset apparently takes at least 40 minutes to accomplish but still never works. The service in business class is poor - I waited 2 hours for a beverage refill during dinner and finally I just got up and walked back to the drink station and refilled it myself. My husband and I – since we’re on our honeymoon – asked for champagne. For the first round crew members presented us with a glass but it wasn’t even chilled. I realize in the grand scheme of life and love and loss this matters about as much as a cricket being run over by a car but  the tickets for this part of the plane are expensive and the service/inflight entertainment/food are all awful? Please stand by while I make another useless observation - there were only 14 people in a 32-seat business class area. Less than half of the plane is full in this “service level” and they can’t keep up with drink orders?

### "service ruined other positives"
Delhi to Toronto Pearson. The aircraft itself is very nice in Business seats are excellent. There was a lot of space and plenty of storage spots. The tray table and lights were well laid out. There was a very large entertainment screen. However, there were a lot of problems with the entertainment system it crashed a few times and on the previous flight could never be reset. The number of movies was pretty poor. Food was decent. Biggest problem was the service, which ruined any other positives.

### "a pleasant experience"
Sydney to Montreal via Vancouver with Air Canada. Orderly boarding and on time departure from Sydney. Aircraft interior was showing its age but all features of the seat functioned well. The cabin crew were cheerful, engaging and very professional on both legs. Food choices were almost the same as with every long haul on Air Canada but quality and quantity were good. Wine selection on the SYD-YVR leg was very good with 3 choices of red and white each. There was a good selection of snacks on both legs. Both flights arrived ahead of time and had regular updates from the flight deck. IFE had decent selection and it appears AC has resolved the sound quality issue with the recent upgrade to their newer version. It was a pleasant experience for a very long journey.

### "frustrating and time consuming"
Booked Air Canada return ticket from Vancouver to Osaka under promotion offer of additional 7500 bonus miles. Just about a week before departure, received an email from Air Canada about flight schedule change. Since I wasn't able to match the sudden change, I called Air Canada. Air Canada agent suggested a different route which including over night stay in Osaka airport and stopping over in Korea- Incheon airport. The agent confirmed I will be keeping 7500 Bonus miles as Air Canada is the one who changed the flight schedule significantly at last minute. But the agent didn't want to offer any hotel option for me who had to stay overnight in Kansai Osaka airport. After long argument, agent told me Air Canada will cover the over night stay as long as I stay in one of the airport hotels. After the trip, for long 6 months, I had to constantly call and email Air Canada in order to get the hotel bill refund and 7500 miles. Each time, Air Canada agent promised that I will receive my refund and asked me to simply wait. When it comes to bonus miles, Air Canada agent would simply transfer me to Aeroplan saying it is not their job. In the end, Aeroplan agent organized extra investigation and confirmed that Air Canada is the one who needs to sort out everything as this was special case. Which means I wasted more time by constantly transferred to Aeroplan agents. After more faxing, emails and calls to Air Canada, finally I was able to reach their refund department. At this point, Refund department agent refused to offer neither full refund nor bonus miles. He mentioned I am only eligible for up to $175 per night for hotel stay - I argued that no one informed me about $175, and also I had no choice but booking more expensive room as most of airport hotels were nearly sold out at the time of booking. And my room was one of the very last ones. For bonus miles, he said he will offer me 4000 miles to show me good will! I was finally able to get 7500 bonus miles and $175 cheque and the rest as air Canada credit for future flight. In the end, I got what I was promised, but it shouldn't have been this difficult, frustrating and time consuming.

### "all-round great flying experience"
The other day I travelled from AMS to YOW with a stop-over at YYZ. Air Canada has not long ago reintroduced a direct route between Toronto and Amsterdam. I travel to Canada frequently so I couldn't have been happier when they announced their return to AMS. Air Canada offers an all-round great flying experience except the food which is was pretty appaling, otherwise the crew offered plenty of drinks during the flight and a tasty wrap towards the end of it. If the CEO of Air Canada speaks of a superior on board product in his letter to the passengers in the Air Canada in-flight magazine then I suggest a major improvement in the food as to make an already great experience even better. Recommended.

### "the worst experience"
My boyfriend and I recently took a flight with Air Canada from Ottawa to Vancouver and had the worst experience we have ever had on a flight. We had arrived at the airport with ample time before our flight, we had already checked in online and prepaid for our suitcase to be checked. All we had to do was print off our boarding passes and check our bag. We waited in line for an atrocious amount of time (there weren’t even many people in line) as Air Canada employees socialized with each other instead of getting people through in a timely fashion. When we finally got up to the counter, they told us we had missed the deadline for baggage check by 2 minutes. The employee were so rude and kept emphasizing that we were late and needed to arrive earlier, use the kiosks instead, etc., as he clearly saw us waiting in line for more than 20 minutes. We checked in our suitcase at a baggage storage unit in the airport overnight instead for $8, and rushed through the airport in order to make it to our flight on time. We got to the gate as they were just finishing boarding our flight. We were about to board when the flight attendants tell us they have no more room for carry-on baggage, and they need to start checking our carry-ons. That alone would have been frustrating enough, but that, added to the fact that we were just denied the ability to check our bag and had rushed around the airport in order to store it, was downright infuriating. Additionally, we did not get beverage service on the flight for 3 hours. My sister went in the next day to pick up our luggage and ship it to us, at a cost of $275.

### "horrible customer service"
I had the displeasure of flying with Air Canada from for business from Edmonton to Whitehorse via Vancouver (and return in the reverse order) for business this week. To say that the flight staff didn't care doesn't paint the picture, distain is a little too strong a word, but only by a hair. It was clear in the demeanor of these staff that they truly hated their jobs. Horrible customer service. The one plus: the pre-flight safety check was digital so we didn't have to interact with these staff any more than necessary.

### "much room for improvement in the product"
My wife and I flew Air Canada from Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver and then back on the same route two weeks later. Prior to the flight, I was a bit concerned about the quality of service we would get compared to Qantas and Air New Zealand, which we have flown before. The crew (flight deck and flight attendants) on both legs was actually quite good - responsive and polite. We had a slight delay due to a minor technical malfunction leaving Sydney, and the captain kept us well informed. I appreciated the frequent "water runs" by flight attendants throughout the flight - important to keep hydrated during those 14 hours. However, there are definitely things that Air Canada could enhance for this sector: Toronto passengers flying to Sydney have an awkward flight transformation whereby they are on a domestic flight up to Vancouver with North American service standards for food. They are entitled to free food because they are flying as international passengers, however, we had to inform or alert the flight attendants of our status (although we found out they already had this information! ), which was awkward to do, particularly if your seatmate was a domestic passenger flying only to Vancouver. Would it be too much to ask if international passengers could be treated the same as those with special meal requests, who are served discretely prior to the regular meal service - On the way back, we had to clear customs in Vancouver, collect our baggage and then put it on the luggage belt for the continuing flight to Toronto. There is a long walk from customs to where the bags are put on the belt. The most disconcerting thing about this was that we barely had time to use the washroom before having to immediately line up to board the flight to Toronto - this was unlike the much more contained but efficient process on the way to Sydney, where we deplaned and then reboarded in the same general area. The quality of the food on the Vancouver-Sydney sector was average at best - bland but adequate. Breakfast included a hardened omelette which was barely edible. Food on the Sydney to Vancouver sector (same meals - chicken with vegetables or beef with rice) were tastier - we attributed that to Australian (vs. Canadian) catering. AVOD was again very lacklustre - older movies and nothing very appealing, music selections were average - used to be XM radio, now Stingray, small old screens - mine had a crack on the way back So no major complaints but there is much room for improvement in the product.

### "uncomfortable Boeing 787"
Just completed a 2-week tour of Rajasthan in India. Flew from Nova Scotia to Udaipur and back. Half of the connecting flights were Air Canada and half with Jet Airways, an Indian carrier. As always, cabin service is better on Asian airlines. But Air Canada has newer aircraft and outstanding flight deck crews who fear no weather. So I was looking forward to a homeward leg from Dubai to Toronto on AC057, which is serviced by new Boeing 787. What a disappointment! I am 6 ft tall and weight about 200 lbs. The lady on my left side was a small, wider person. We could not fit our shoulders across the seat back space provided, so it was a very uncomfortable 14 hours on this non-stop leg. Connected in Toronto to a small Airbus flying to Halifax. Much more leg room and shoulder room. Air Canada, please pay attention to this complaint.

### "very attentive service"
Flew Toronto to Tokyo Haneda with Air Canada. Trip began with a smooth check-in - Air Canada has a whole dedicated priority check-in aisle at Toronto Pearson for eligible travellers. Only criticism was the agent gave inaccurate information - was told I did not have to retrieve checked luggage at Haneda airport for my connecting flight, but turned out all connecting passengers had to pick up luggage there for immigration. The B77L aircraft had the original two-cabin configuration, with decent entertainment options. Meal choices consisted of Canadian as well as Japanese fare. Very attentive service by the cabin crew, who approached each passenger to find out their needs in between meal services. Mid-flight snack was good too even though portion was small. In general, an excellent flight experience.

### "good flight in Boeing 787"
Had a good flight in this new Boeing 787. The lower pressurization makes a real difference in the overall comfort level. The seat arrangements have plenty of room. Seats are more comfortable than those of the Boeing 777 business class pods. The large screen was a real bonus. My major complaint is with the food. Air Canada must improve the look and quality of the food they serve in business class. As for the level of service the flight attendants were excellent.

### "do not seem to care"
I had flown to Vancouver for a medical conference and was booked to fly home (Toronto) from Vancouver on AC 180 on November 29 and had taken time to grab an aisle seat 24 hrs earlier with online pre checkin, so had a seat on this flight , when found out the flight had been cancelled only 4 hrs before departure. Curiously there was another Air Canada flight scheduled at the same time for departure but was told the plane was fully booked. I did notice at the time of checking in the plane was clearly not fully booked (AC 180). The only way to get home was through Montreal which added an additional 3 hours to the flight. How they can cancel a routine route flight full of people and and sub in a plane that obviously had smaller capacity and not able to take all of the booked passengers, re-routing them instead, is beyond belief. The agent did not seem to feel that this was in any way unreasonable even though I had a booked seat on the cancelled flight. So a 5 hour flight turned into an 8 hour flight which would not have been too bad other than it took another 2 hrs to get to the gate in Toronto and get my bag (1hr 15 mins of waiting for the bag). It took over 10 hrs for a flight that I have taken forty or more times before with no problem for 5 hrs. I have flown to and from Vancouver to Toronto for 25 yrs or more often twice yearly and usually on Air Canada's main competitor and have never been bumped from a flight and never waited 75 mins for my bags. I thought I would try Air Canada this time and discovered why so many travellers express negative reviews. Air Canada do not seem to care about service or the traveller. I would strongly recommend if there is an alternative to choose a different airline.

### "service was pleasant"
Flew to and from Halifax to St. John's twice last month with Air Canada. Both flights were on time, and service was pleasant. On the last return leg the the staff at the check in counter were pleasant and helpful. The CRJs are showing their age but got us there and back without a problem. Service in Economy was as expected and the price right.

### "a good experience"
Excellent Air Canada Express flight from Chicago to Montréal, with professional flight attendants who gave good service to passengers. The plane was clean, equipped with confortable seat and very good inflight entertainment system for a short flight. Plane left and arrived on time. In conclusion a good experience on Air Canada Express.

### "a nightmare of a travel day"
Our Air Canada flight was cancelled and the checkin desk was understaffed. When we were told we would have to wait for 7 hours for the next available flight all they gave us for compensation was a $10 meal voucher. We are flying with a 2-year old and now in for a nightmare of a travel day. Absolutely ridiculous given it is only an 1.5 hour flight. I wish I could give a lower rating this experience is so bad.

### "the worst refund policy"
Upon arriving in Los Angeles from Australia we received a message that my father had passed away, we then made alteration's to our trip to return home. Upon returning to Australia we have made attempts to redo our trip. Air Canada has the worst refund policy out, for us to rebook our flights through them it will cost us another $200. 00 each. Westjet gave us a full credit to book our flights when it suited.

### "terrible credit voucher policies"
Air Canada has terrible credit voucher policies. Beware when booking a ticket. In error I booked a ticket with a route error. The rules and fees to change the ticket equaled the same amount as rebooking it. Note the following: There is a change fee for each direction ($75 each direction), a name change fee ($100) and if the new ticket is less than the original ticket the difference is forfeited. Also note that a credit is good for one year from the date of booking, not the date of the flight on the actual ticket. So, basically count any short haul ticket as a write-off if you need to change it.

### "volume and length of delays"
I am not one to usually write a negative review, however my last 3 experiences with Air Canada have been very disappointing. My partner and I have flown to Phoenix, St Lucia, and NYC all within the last year. We have not had one vacation without a significant delay on either the departure, arrival, or both. Tonight we were delayed by 6 hours. The delays, such as this evening, have been due to mechanical issues. I can appreciate valuing everyone's safety, however the volume and length of delays has forced us to view Air Canada as unreliable. We have missed out on nights of hard-earned vacations, and even worse, time spent with family. A few food vouchers for airport food, at airport food prices is simply not sufficient for the repeated inconvenience and frustration we have experienced. Air Canada has told us on many occasions that they appreciate our business, however they have certainly missed opportunities to show us. We will be reluctant to use or recommend Air Canada again - we require a company we can trust and rely on.

### "service was average"
Flew London to Vancouver return. I booked row 18 which is the first row of economy cabin, after premium economy. The leg room was great, more than I expected, but configuration is 3x4x3 so seats are narrow. I thought the service was average but I have never had such poor food on a long haul flight before. The main course on the way out was disgusting, snack before landing was edible. On the return flight, the food was just as bad, and the snack before landing was yoghurt and a piece of banana bread. The service was basic, one drinks round before dinner and drinks offered again with the meal and snack. Water was offered throughout the flight every 2 hours or so.

### "flights were pretty good"
We flew Air Canada from Ottawa to Dubai via Toronto. We were two adults and a 5 month old baby. We paid extra for the bulkhead seats so we could have a bassinet for the baby. The extra leg space and the bassinet was truly a must for our 13 hours long flight. Overall, the flights were pretty good. We had a great price, the service on board was good (although I would of preferred to have at least one of the adults meal served with all the other special meal delivery as it is impossible for both adult to eat while attending to an infant) and the inflight entertainment was bad from Toronto to Dubai which contributed to making a long flight even longer. However, the selection was better on the flight from Ottawa to Toronto!? The meals were ok, but we were served a turkey sandwich which was horrible. I have flown with KLM and Lufthansa for similar trips to the Middle East and they seem to serve more food, bigger portions and great quality meals.

### "Boeing 787 is quite comfortable"
The business class cabin in this Air Canada Boeing 787 is quite comfortable. In fact this is the first time that I am able sleep on an airplane upon 30+ years of flying experience! The biggest complaint I have with Air Canada is the quality of food, which was poor. The printed menu offered a few choices, but end up with no choice after all for reasons that I didn't bother asking. I chose Japanese meal which turned out to be quite salty. I recommend this airline only because of this newer Boeing 787. The 777-300 which I flew before from Vancouver to Hong Kong was terrible which I would not recommend.

### "overall a good experience"
Sydney to Vancouver, check-in was quick and easy. Air Canada uses the Air New Zealand lounge in Sydney which was well appointed with plenty to offer. Boarding well managed and the flight left on time. Onboard the seating was the herringbone style sleeper pods. The seat was comfortable in all positions but not so in the lie-flat mode causing lower back pain. Amenity kit was basic. Dinner and brunch were tasty and the red wines offered were good. There were frequent water runs and one FA in particular regularly walked around asking if I needed a snack or something else to drink. IFE had good selection but the sound quality remains an issue on AC systems. Toilets were kept relatively clean but they could have used more attention. The flight arrived on time but luggage delivery was slow. Overall a good experience.

### "refused to issue a refund"
I purchased a seat upgrade for $1200 at check in. The entertainment system in my seat was not working, neither was the AC outlet. I asked the flight attendant if there were other empty seats that I could move to but it was a full flight. No entertainment or the ability to plug in and charge my own iPad. Flight attendant suggested contacting customer service to request a refund for the upgrade. Contacted AC customer service via e-mail. Waiting 16 days for a response and they refused to issue a refund on the upgrade, but offered a $110 travel voucher. I e-mailed back to say that was unacceptable and asked to be put in contact with a supervisor or someone who could escalate my concern. 18 days later they contact me and said there was nothing else they could do, and that they considered the matter closed and to have a nice day. Not the way to treat paying customers.

### "terrible experience booking"
Haven't managed to fly with them yet - but had a terrible experience booking my flight. Was charged for the flights and everything was good to go, got the confirmation through and was really excited. Then my account got charged a 2nd time for the flights - an extra $1,200 was taken out of my account. This lead to my bank blocking the card because it put me in negative $1000. After calling Air Canada help desk to find out what had happened, I was told that it was a technical glitch and the money would be released in 7 days and there was nothing that could be done to help. Basically I have been left with no money, a blocked card, and no way to access anything for the next 7 days. Spoke to 2 customer service reps and asked for a supervisor but was told there wasn’t one available. Unbelievably disappointed in these antics and can honestly say I will never be using Air Canada again. Broke for the next 7 days and borrowing money off friends because of a technical error on their end and zero help offered by customer service. Horrific.

### "double check your seats"
Trying to book seats or have a family seated together was frustrating and only partially successful. My daughter, so inlay and infant grandson flew from the east coast to the west coast in October. Two short flights and one longer one. They booked and paid for seats on the long flight. Checking in 24 hours in advance, they saw the seats they had purchased had been changed and they were seated apart on all 3 flights. A call to Air Canada corrected the problem, they thought. The morning of the trip they checked online and they had been moved apart on all three flights. A complaint on Twitter got Air Canada's attention and in discussion with an agent they were able to be seated together on two of the flights, but the third one was full so they were now at opposite ends of the plane. They were not able to get the seats they had originally paid for. Now unsure of the competence of the staff, we went to the airport early and the seats had been changed again! How is this possible? They were reassigned together on the flight they had paid for their seats. They were moved together into the last two seats together on one of the short flights but they were apart on the other short flight. This is inexcusable. Who wants to travel alone with an infant? If you are flying Air Canada check and double check your seats.

### "much more pleasant than expected"
London to Calgary with Air Canada, and wasn't expecting much based on previous reviews. Old Boeing 767 but comfortable seat, helped by having empty seat beside me. Cabin crew were happy and helpful. Meal was very tasty and snack served mid flight with warm savoury pastry before landing. Some great views over Greenland and Northern Canada. Overall a much more pleasant experience than expected.

### "offer a professional service"
The flight left Québec on time and arrived on time in Ottawa. The two flight attendants on board were friendly and offer a professional service. The seat were confortable and the plane clean.

### "service was even more strained"
Outward flight with Air Canada was very comfortable as the cabin was only about 80% full but service and food was the poorest we have experienced in 40 years of flying. The flight crew could not do much about the food but the service or lack of it is something that Air Canada needs to sort out asap. All the staff looked like they would have preferred to have been somewhere else. The entertainment system was very basic and the headphones did not work very well. The return flight was full and naturally the service was even more strained, cold food after a long wait and no choice. One beer and one coffee on a 15 hour flight will not have me booking anymore trips with Air Canada. All in all not a good introduction to such a lovely country

### "economy class seat was good"
I've taken Air Canada on YUL-YYZ-YUL route. The inbound plane was an A320 and the return flight an A330 continuing to Geneva. Check in at the kiosks in Montreal and Toronto airport was easy and user friendly. I had a booking in economy class but I got upgraded in business class on the return leg. The seat in economy class was good, the front rows have more legroom for a purchase in general. The service and the cabin crew on board was also good, despite some turbulence on the return leg. Buisness class seat was amazing you can adjust and incline the seat how you like it and there's a massage button. You get a drink prior to take off and a complimentary snack which was a cheese plate with a choice of alcoholic drinks. Overall Air Canada offers a good product and you can see the staff enthusiasm. I would travel again in Business class on Air Canada if I get another chance.

### "a downgraded experience"
Unfortunately, I will never fly Air Canada again as long as I can help it. Living in Hawaii requires a long flight to any designation outside the island chain. I have flown Hawaiian mostly to California destinations and have never been sorry about that choice. I always slept comfortably on red eye flights. However, I was in pain and shifting constantly en route to Los Angeles on the first leg of journey because seating was too close. I am only 5'6 and about 125 lbs so it should not be a problem. I couldn't sleep at all. Then, in Los Angeles, as we were boarding a empty plane that was not even close to being sold out, we were stopped by a flight attendant who lifted both our regulation size carry ons. She smugly said, "if this wasn't a full flight we couldn't let this bag on. Um, why bother singling us out? Why bother even mentioning it? It was wholly irrelevant. She was just rude. When we got to Toronto, we were in more pain and really uncomfortable because we were on the same aircraft type as the flight across the pacific (two rows of 3 seats, narrow body). The Air Canada folks were really unfriendly and downright couldn't be bothered throughout our traveling. It wasn't isolated. After a 6 hour layover at Toronto, we discovered we weren't seated next to one another on our 10 hour flight to Munich. We tried to get them changed and they were (sort of) but then they messed that up and the double booked our seats. So when we got on the plane we didn't have any seats. The kicker is that I went to ask a question of a flight attendant she pretty much ripped my head off and was extremely confrontational. All I wanted was her to tell the other flight attendant an important piece of info while they were sorting out the seat issue. Our flight to Munich on the brand new airbus was amazing. If you have a chance to fly the dream plane do, but the crew were still unfriendly. When we flew home we flew with Lufthansa and it was great. Back on Air Canada from Vancouver, BC to Hawaii - awful. The flight attendants were dressed in cheap looking uniforms. They left the lights on almost the entire time so we couldn't sleep (night flight) and they kept the air on the entire time. Everyone around us froze. There was no TV, music, or any entertainment at all. They told us we needed to download an app after we were on plane where there is no internet. I don't care I wanted to sleep anyway, but it was definitely a downgraded experience. I don't usually care about the fitness of the plane as long as it gets me to my destination, but this one was run down completely with holes in the carpet. Never again.

### "seats fairly comfortable"
We were flying from London to Toronto and Air Canada service turned to be quite good. food was desirable and edible, a lot of beverage offerings, friendly staff. Seats were fairly comfortable. I will be flying with Air Canada again.

### "legroom was more than sufficient"
Red eye flight from Vancouver to Toronto was on time. As I was aware that Air Canada's Y-class on this particular aircraft and route is extremely cramped, I booked a "preferred seat" at the front. This cost an extra 60 CAD but was more than worth it: These seats are used as "premium economy" seats on international flights on this particular B777. Legroom was more than sufficient, as was the seat width. Catering is not complementary, and can only be purchased via credit card - no cash. I don't think that is a good policy as not all credit cards are accepted by Air Canada, at least mine wasn't (my Hotel did, as did the grocer beside the Hotel...). But it is possible to book a meal online ahead of your flight which I did on my way back. This worked just fine and I recommend this service as you pay less than on the aircraft. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Recommended (but don't forget to book that "preferred seat"! ).

### "contrasting flights out and back"
Contrasting flights out and back. Going out Heathrow to Vancouver, the plane was packed and it felt packed. People seem to be let on with cabin bags as big as my main case (it's not only Air Canada who let them get away with it). As a result, the lockers were full, meaning having to squish bags under the seat in front. The result is a real squeeze. We spoke to the crew, and they said AC have removed a galley and set of toilets so they can squeeze in more seats. This makes meal-heating arduous for them and conditions cramped. We were actually dreading the return trip, but it was far less packed, and there was a good 6" extra leg-room. It really makes a difference. I know airlines have to maximise profit, but if they get known as the airline with cramped seats, people will steer clear. On the way out, my entertainment system didn't work, except to show a map. No films, TV, music. On the way back, it all worked. Food going out was OK at best, with the last part being a wrap which dribbled all over my top. Probably my own fault for not knowing how to eat. Food coming back was excellent, really liked it. I'm glad to have had both trips. Sometimes things go well, sometimes not. The crew going out were nice, and clearly stressed because we weren't the only ones feeling crammed in. Coming back, with just that bit more room, the whole atmosphere was so much more relaxed.

### "ridiculously tight and uncomfortable,"
As my Vancouver to Montreal flight was ridiculously tight and uncomfortable,  I enquired whether any seats were available in premium and how much it might cost. My return flight was better comfort, if still tight, the price was reasonable so we upgraded. Unfortunately, the cost varies wildly from flight to flight so we were unable to book same for return flight (cost was more than double). We were thrilled with the attention on board. the seats were spacious and it made our trip a pleasant experience. The flight attendant was particularly wonderful. One point, the pilots seem to always be in the bathroom everytime I wanted to use it, and for long periods, which was odd. By contrast, on my flight back (mtl vancouver, in economy) no bathroom lineups.

### "red eye flight was excellent"
Air Canada from Calgary to Ottawa via Toronto, a red eye flight and was excellent. FA's took care of everyone. Drinks and snack after take off and then breakfast prior to landing. Nice to see the red eye menu has expanded to multiple offerings rather than just the omelette.

### "Air Canada cancelled my flight"
The first leg of my journey was fairly uneventful from YVR-YYZ. There was a delay disembarking due to a stated lack of equipment at the gate at YYZ, similar to a problem I had encountered recently on a previous journey. It is appealing to travel domestically on a twin-aisle plane. But the IFE has more limited offerings than were previously available, so bring plenty to read. Travel on the short YYZ-ROC is almost always a nightmare. I was determined not to be fooled again, and had already lined up a rental car to drive instead - knowing that the average delay has been running well over an hour and I'd easily get there sooner by car. Up until less than an hour before boarding the flight was shown on time (despite the arriving equipment being shown as not getting in until well after the posted departure time). Foolishly I cancelled the rental car, and of course Air Canada cancelled my flight. The customer service desk was 4 empty seats, no staff, but their garments left on the chairs. I'm stupified by how badly this airline works.

### "impressed with 787 business class"
We flew the new Air Canada Boeing 787 with totally redesigned business class seats. I loved it! What a big difference over the last version. My friends used to complain sleeping in the old business class seat was like being in a coffin! Not now - there is more room and the seat is comfy and not too firm. The lie flat seat is now much easier to control with the touch pad screen, and in the sleeping position there is lots more leg room too. Each person is in a private pod, and the whole product has been so well designed and thought out. The TV screen is large and razor sharp, and the BOSE noise cancelling headphones are wonderful. You will also have fun with the new light sensitive windows which do not require a shade. They have a new food menu in business class. I am not a fan of airline food and don't drink any alcohol and so I am not a good person to comment on this. Overall I am impressed with the new 787 business class on Air Canada.

### "delayed by six hours"
This trip involved Air Canada flights from San Diego to Kingston, Ontario, via Toronto Pearson Airport. The connecting flight from Toronto to Kingston was delayed by six hours, and instead of reaching my destination shortly before 9pm as I had planned, I got in shortly before 3am the next morning. Air Canada issued all passengers a paper slip with information on claiming a 10% off next trip voucher. When I went to the website to claim my voucher, I was unable to do so, as the webpage insisted that my first name didn't match the first name on the original ticket, which is of course false. I then called customer service, and spoke with someone who had absolutely no idea how to resolve this issue. So, the 10% off voucher is completely useless. I fly frequently for work, and I can safely and accurately say that Air Canada is the worst airline I have flown in the recent past.

### "has gone downhill"
No meal for this Air Canada international flight after Vancouver, had to pay. On return from Vancouver, breakfast was not served until 1 hour from landing in Sydney, we were starving. Seat comfort was horrific, and padding completely worn out. Terrible ground service at airport arrival. No assistance to help with missed flight from Sydney to Brisbane due to maintenance delay in Vancouver. Air Canada has gone downhill.

### "Air Canada still cares"
Montreal to São Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. Smooth check-in assisted by two very pleasant agents. First leg was on a tired looking aircraft but service from the Flight Service Director was fabulous. Service consisted of snacks and beverages as this was a short jump. Flight left and arrived on time. Second leg was delayed by almost 2 hours and was on an even more tired looking Boeing 67. It is time Air Canada replaced these vintage birds. As it was a late night departure I skipped dinner went to sleep right away. I got a good rest on the fully flat pods and woke up in time for breakfast. The service was good and the meal was of reasonable quality. Washrooms was another piece of proof of the aircraft's age but they were kept relatively clean. Upon arrival, I was met at the door of the aircraft by the Concierge who advised me of what I had to do to make it to my connection assuring me I was secured on the flight despite the late arrival of the inbound flight. I must say this was much appreciated and went a long way in convincing me Air Canada still cares.

### "seat was very uncomfortable"
Lots of nagging problems. Late Air Canada departure (40 min) from Toronto to Shanghai, only compounded by an even later arrival (85 min) to Shanghai. Paid for an exit seat that was very uncomfortable. Cushion material was bunched and broken down. One of the most uncomfortable seats I have been in. Food is terrible, some not edible. Return flight was better, but still would not recommend. Staff service was excellent.

### "service inflight was very good"
We upgraded our Air Canada tickets to business from Toronto to Calgary as we flew from Miami. The lounge was okay. Its nice and big, but doesn't seem to have a lot of food and drink to choose from. Friendly staff, and it was clean. The plane was clean and comfortable. We had excellent service from our flight attendant, who smiled and welcomed everyone on board, and service inflight was very good. The food was delicious. Especially love the ice cream and fresh cookies.

### "Inflight entertainment the worst"
On the outward flight, Heathrow to Vancouver, we were unimpressed by friendliness of cabin crew. They seemed to have no interest in offering a positive customer experience, and viewed passengers as an inconvenience. The meal on departure was vegetarian, as they had run out of the meat option. There were no apologies, and the food was horrible. The meal prior to landing was a wrap and was tasteless. The return flight had a different crew but the same attitude. Again they ran out of the meat option so could only have vegetarian. When I asked who to complain to I was given a business card at the end of the flight. Clearly the head of the cabin crew was too important to talk to passengers. The breakfast prior to landing was a yoghurt, slice of banana bread and a small cup of coffee. Inflight entertainment the worst I have seen in years.

### "A321 business class is poor"
We were rebooked on the Air Canada redeye from San Francisco to Toronto after the United Airlines connector was delayed 4 hours, thus causing us to miss our original daytime flight. There is no Air Canada service desk at SFO behind security, so we were fortunate to find an active departure gate with an Air Canada agent who helped us confirm our rescheduled flight arrangements for later that evening. United were unable to issue the onward boarding passes at our origin city on the rescheduled Air Canada flights, so it is a good thing we found an agent willing to help us. If we had showed at the gate for the flight that night with no boarding passes, we would have likely been out of luck because initially, Air Canada could not find our tickets! United had made a mistake in the rebooking, so it took numerous calls from the Air Canada agent to United to find them and reissue our boarding passes. When this was finally accomplished, we decided to purchase an upgrade to business class since we wanted to get some sleep on the overnight flight. Mistake! The product on the A321 in business class is poor, with poorly padded seats, and a miserable level of decline. Didn't sleep more than a few minutes at a time, as doing so caused my head to flop around like a bobble head doll when I began to doze off. Overall, business class was a waste of money. Though the ground service crew in San Francisco were unfailingly polite and accomodating, we should have just remained in coach as we were originally booked. No doubt it would have been a miserable flight in terms of comfort level, albeit at a fraction of the price we ended up paying.

### "customer support on ground poor"
Air Canada cancelled a flight and did not rebook passenger for the most convenient return, but had to wait 5 hrs at Columbus terminal for the rebooked section. THis airport has no Air Canada rep. One has to call Toronto and wait over 15 minutes for an agent while having to listen to Air Canada advertising. I felt I was a hostage. My last three flights before this also had issues. That was with luggage and cancelled flights. Level of info is confusing and different depending who you talk to. Level of Air Canada customer support on the ground is poor.

### "disappointed with experience"
London Heathrow to Vancouver with Air Canada. The flight attendants did not respond well to the fact that the flight was almost full, yelling "the flight is full" as they reluctantly helped passengers with their cabin baggage (how this was our fault was beyond me). The IFE system had limited choices, and my seat (last row of the cabin) was very uncomfortable as it had a very marginal recline. However, the meals were above average. My starting point had been Edinburgh that morning, and unfortunately my suitcase missed the connection and did not make the flight from London to Vancouver. While this wasn't the fault of Air Canada, almost four weeks later I am still waiting for a baggage irregularity report from them to submit to my travel insurance company (despite requesting this in a phone call and by email). Overall, feel disappointed with the experience.

### "a good value for money"
Geneva to Toronto via Montreal, and I would say that Air Canada is a good value for money. Staff was kind, everything was on time. I strongly suggest not to take last places in the aircraft, in the middle of its tail, when it gets 3 instead of 4. Thought that it can benefit with extra space for my legs, but I was wrong. Moreover, screen ahead wasn't directly in front of me, so I had to watch movies with my head constantly turned - my mistake to choose that seat. Stop in Montreal wasn't comfortable (crossing border, changing plane, picking up luggage and sending it again) and it lasted too long, in my opinion.

### "we won't fly them again"
This was our first time flying with Air Canada, and we won't fly them again. Our seats were on opposite sides of the plane, until just before boarding when they eventually gave us seats together. The seats were not comfortable, and there wasn't enough legroom. The staff were not entirely friendly. The food wasn't filling and too little for a long haul flight. On our flight to London, the air hostess was very ignorant, as our in flight entertainment didn't work for about 2.5 hours of the hour flight. The connection for the headphones didn't work properly and we couldn't enjoy the entertainment.

### "would fly with them again"
Air Canada was a great airline to fly, with a good choice of inflight entertainment on screens at every seat. The staff and cabin crew were courteous and helpful. Leg room was a little tight but can be expected on a small aircraft, also the seats were a bit old but cabin was clean and inviting. I would appreciate more selection of inflight snacks and drinks. The headphones for sale were of bad quality and only worked in one ear and not worth the price. I would fly with them again.

### "never book Air Canada again"
We were supposed to leave Indianapolis on September 5, 2015, traveling to Narita Airport Tokyo to join a Trafalgar tour. Upon checking flight status for our 6:00 a.m. flight, we discovered the flight had been cancelled. We called Air Canada to reschedule as there was plenty of time on the ground in Toronto and we could easily have made our Tokyo flight. No one at Air Canada had the slightest interest in helping us, telling us that we would have to leave on Sunday, September 6th, instead. I'm still kicking myself for agreeing to this. We missed our pickup service from Narita Airport to our hotel, included in the price of the tour, and had to arrange and pay for transportation out-of-pocket. More importantly, we missed the entire first day of the tour and saw nothing of Tokyo at all. This was an expensive, once-in-a-lifetime trip for us and the incompetence and indifference of Air Canada caused a great deal of disappointment. Upon contacting Air Canada after our return, so that we could get the required paperwork to submit to the trip interruption insurance, we were told that the reason for the cancellation on Sept. 5th was that a flight attendant had been unable to get through security. Why this was our problem, and why another flight attendant could not be assigned, is beyond me. Thanks, Air Canada, for ruining what should've been a fantastic vacation. I'll never book an Air Canada flight again.

### "in general a good experience"
Toronto to London Heathrow, and an efficient and simple bag drop. Information at the gate was helpful when boarding. Reasonable legroom and no problem finding space for cabin baggage on a full flight. Service was friendly and efficient. Regular offers of water were made throughout the flight. Food fine, not the best but ok. Not a peep out of the captain all flight. Ridiculous seat-back monitor, took me a while to master it (press slightly up and to the left of whatever you want). The earphone socket was on its way out; sound was intermittent, but this may be because I was using my own headphones. Good choice of movies and TV, but no wifi. In general a good experience, I would fly with Air Canada again.

### "pretty good value for money "
In general Air Canada do a good job with their transatlantic flights and represent pretty good value for money (currently undercutting Air Transat on many flights). The planes offer standard legroom, a good level of cleanliness, attentive service and a really good infotainment system. They seem to have a consistent problem in my experience of boarding in a timely manner (nearly all my flights have left a little late). The food is generally good, and the drink service on my last flight was regular, generous and friendly. The downsides - the last 2 times I have flown with them they messed up my meal orders. The time before last they did not have a gluten free option as I had requested. The last time they gave me a gluten free meal with chicken in it. I am a fusspot gluten free/veggie (which had been noted on the agent website's booking form), luckily my wife had the vegetarian meal which happened to be gluten free. Their official response - they can only cater for one dietary requirement. Sad to see this in the 21st century, so if you don't fit into a particular box, bring your own food along to avoid disappointment. Fair do's to Air Canada though, they do keep offering money off when they mess up, but I would prefer a meal I can eat with no fuss or bother. My only other minor dislike is having the headphone socket on the armrest of the seat where it is really easy to knock it out or damage the socket.

### "be flying Air Canada again"
Air Canada from London to Toronto, and really impressed. First flight with them and the staff, service and aircraft were exceptional. Good was great. Seat configuration and room was good for economy. Entertainment was working and a good selection available. The food quality was great for economy - we were seated in one of the back rows but still had all choices of foods available. Plenty of complimentary beverages and choices. Will be flying Air Canada again.

### Air Canada customer review
Very poor service and second-rate food on my flight from HKG to Vancouver. I was given salty nuts but no offer of water or a drink, despite staff serving drinks to others who had ordered pre-flight drinks. Had to ask staff to get me something when I became obvious that he was not going to get me anything. Headphones where dirty and staff provided a replacement. Bread in a plastic bag, 2 types of salad and fruit for an appetizer and horrible main, dessert included more fruit, offer of coffee once and no offer of water or any drinks. Breakfast included fruit and bread in plastic and water in a plastic container. Staff not willing to make you comfortable, they seem to have no understanding of good customer service.

### "hot meal served was terrible"
Recently travelled Air Canada from Calgary to London and the hot meal served was terrible with a piece of cake on the side. I have travelled with Air Canada for a few years and have noticed that food has got worse and the volume decreasing. This time it was pretty poor and considering that the seat prices aren't cheap, they could have done a better job with the food. ⚑ Air Canada Ranking

### "food choice was limited"
Ground VIP service: been driven from Domestic gates to International gates by the BMW 7 valet service that was great. Maple leaf lounge in Toronto, very crowded, not much space to sit. Seats in the B787 are 1-2-1 config. with lie flat bed. Avoid seats row 1: very noisy from the galley in front. Food choice was limited, only 1 fish and 1 meat choice. Drink includes normal business class wine, and champagne. The welcome drink is also sparkling wine, not real champagne. Entertainment was great, with a 18 inch screen and extended choice of movie and tv. Staff were very unhappy doing the job, no smiles. The flight attendant was surprised I asked for water during the sleeping part of the flight. I never got the tea I ordered during breakfast. Overall: the hard product is great with the 787 but the Air Canada staff should learn service skills.

### "I don't feel like they are sorry"
I don't usually book my flights, the company I work for does it, but after this last flight (Toronto to Halifax) I will request them to not use Air Canada. I travelled 2 days across the globe to get home and the last leg home, which should have been less then 2 hours was 3 hours late. This is completely unacceptable. All they say is sorry for the delay, but I don't feel like they are sorry. My spouse has to pick me up from the airport, we have 2 small children she had to bring with her. Completely unacceptable.

### "a great help to my friend"
I had to fly a friend with altzheimers across the country with Air Canada in September. It is probably the longest possible distance across the country. I was first told it was not possible for her to be unaccompanied but later this was changed. In fact one stop that we had to book, the one in Calgary was eliminated. This was a great help to my friend. I very much appreciate that this service was offered. This is my first review to anyone ever, but I am very grateful that my friend was safely delivered across the country by Air Canada.

### "not worth paying business class for this route"
Flew from Montreal to Toronto with Air Canada, A320, Business Class. Lounge: used the Maple Leaf lounge in Montreal domestic section, food and snacks were available. Seat 2-2 configuration, standard recliner with screen on the back of front seat. Food: Inexistent no meal was offered, just drinks offered. Very disappointing to have no food or snack offered on 1hr 20 minute flight. Entertainment: Selection of movies and TV show offered. Staff: absent, too busy playing with their phone. Really not worth paying business class for this route.

### "getting your luggage intact is essential"
Arriving at Toronto for a tour of Canada, we had no luggage. Air Canada told us it was delayed. So it has been for the 10 days of our stay. Inefficiency and lack of will to solve the problem at Toronto Air Canada baggage desk. Contact with their Baggage Customer Care Center by phone was impossible in French, in English, totally inefficient - this center is located in Delhi India (no kidding!). The employees of the hotels we stayed in were unable to get anything from Air Canada. All way during our tour, we were told: "alas, they are notorious for the fact". Departing from Montréal, the first decent and willing to help employee of Air Canada we met managed to retrace our lost suitcase in Toronto - got it redirected to Montreal, and put automatically on our flight back. Arriving in Brussels, we got quite a nasty surprise - it looked like our good Samsonite was attacked by some frantic ice hockey player. Okay, we didn't lose our sense of humor, but let's be serious, service on board may be good, and the crew may be doing a good job too, getting your luggage intact is essential. Morale of the story: if you travel with Air Canada, travel light.

### Air Canada customer review
Recent surgery required wheelchair assistance for my Columbus to Vancouver via Toronto trip. I was not prepared for the excellent level of attention that I received from Air Canada. All of the ground crew efficiently transported me through the terminal, boarding, disembarking, immigration, etc. The flight crew provided me with extra ice for icing my foot during the flight. I was quite worried about my level of comfort during this Air Canada trip. I am pleased to say this was one of my best experiences in air travel.

### "never received luggage during two weeks"
My husband and I used Air Canada to fly Pittsburgh to Toronto to Rome in May. We had no luggage when we arrive, and never received luggage during the two weeks we were in Italy. My numerous calls from Rome to Air Canada baggage agents in Toronto established that Air Canada did not load our bags on the flight to Rome. An Air Canada agent stated that the bags would arrive in Rome on 27 May. The number given to me to call the Rome airport to determine the status of the lost luggage never answered even though I and various Italian friends repeatedly called it. Air Canada was aware of this issue and promised to contact the Rome airport on our behalf but they never did so. My bag was delivered to my home on June 11th, five days after we had returned to the US. My husband's bag was delivered on July 11th. Air Canada promised us a passenger reimbursement for expenses we incurred because we had no luggage. Nevertheless, Air Canada they ignored my claim for this reimbursement. Air Canada is hiding behind the fact that the last carrier we flew to Rome was Lufthansa.

### "no complaint about Air Canada until today"
I have never had a complaint about Air Canada until today. Most times, I actually stood up for the airline but unfortunately I will no longer to come to their defense. I recently had to change an existing flight with Air Canada due to a death in my family. Air Canada was not very accommodating and would not offer any bereavement discount (not even waving the change fees on my flight) and will only grant a refund upon proof of a death certificate. The customer service rep did not display any empathy to my situation.

### "ADA not a high priority with Air Canada"
We flew Air Canada from Raleigh-Durham Int'l to Toronto on a regional planes. Upon arrival with two disabled wheel chair bounded individuals it took 45 minutes for them to get off the plane. When the ramp finally appeared for them to deplane, the mechanism was not wide enough for the wheelchairs to reach the door, so the persons had to walk the ramp in order to reach the wheelchair. The return trip was worse. The flight was delayed from 5:45 to midnight. At midnight, there was no staff trained to bring the equipment for my disabled friends. Those commuter planes have door which drop down with steps and require healthy ability to maneuver which my friend did not have. Without any consideration of what we had been through, the flight desk attendant said that we would have to stay in a hotel because there was no way to get them on the flight. We said no - so in the pouring rain, me, my husband and the caregiver manually walked (me actually moving one foot at the time up the steps) the caregiver in front and my husband in back) up the stairs and closely guided his wife who had a little more ability up the steps. So, ADA is not a high priority with Air Canada.

### "new business class seats are excellent"
The new Air Canada business class seats on the Boeing 777-300 are excellent. A lot of room as I was able to get one of the "throne" seats that converts to fully flat bed. Large screen IFE was excellent with many TV and movie choices. Noise cancelling headphones were available as well as blankets and pillows. Ground and Cabin crew were efficient but not very friendly. Food offerings were good but nothing spectacular. Snacks were handed out several times. Overall, a good experience.

### "extremely cramped, uncomfortable"
Almost 8 hour Air Canada flight from Toronto to Madrid and then from Barcelona to Boston via Montreal. The aircraft was old, outdated and didn't have personal tv. The service was great the whole time, but the airplane was awful. Extremely cramped, uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. Would not fly Air Canada to Europe again.

### "luggage missing for three days"
When I landed in Prague our luggage was missing. We made a report and sent several emails trying to get information about what to do, as our luggage was missing for three days. We had nothing for three days in Europe. We were told by friends after we were supposed to get a daily allowance to buy necessities for stuff but didn't get any information or returned emails about anything. On the way back, our flights connecting were very unorganized, we were given the wrong information about our luggage and missed our connecting flight by one minute - we had no delays they just gave us very tight connection flight.

### Air Canada customer review
I appreciate that Air Canada has 3 direct flights to/from Winnipeg Saskatoon. Efficient 1-1.25 hour flights certainly beats driving or taking the bus. They had a good selection on drinks and did not mind if I took a snack on board. Very friendly service. My sister lives in Saskatoon and now I would only see her by traveling on Air Canada.

### "being treated extra special"
We took a trip from Sicily to Los Angeles, and the last leg of a trip was from Montreal to Los Angeles with Air Canada. I received my boarding passes with an assigned before leaving in Rome, however, as I was checking into my LA flight the staff notified me that she moved our economy seats to first class! I was too tired to thank the attendant properly. If this review will reach them, I just want them to know that you are a huge blessing! We were stationed overseas for 6 years and this trip was bringing us to a new military assignments. This break of being treated extra special just really made my day.

### "will never fly Air Canada again"
Return economy flight from London to Vancouver with Air Canada. The crew were rude and indifferent, customer service does not seem to be their thing. One male crew member was the rudest I've ever encountered. He openly and loudly complained about taking rubbish from a passenger; moaned about most things as he made his way through the cabin and had the worst attitude imaginable to every situation. Why do any of these people continue to do this job if they don't like the public? I guess this is a good route for cabin staff and rewards them for their years of service. It's not cheap to fly with Air Canada, we paid a lot for the seats - they're not a budget airline but offer worse service than one. The seats are poorly designed, the buttons for the remote are built onto the passenger armrest : it's almost impossible not to lean on the panel whilst seated, so the lights, volume, and service button are frequently accidentally pressed, it's very annoying. Not that this bothered the flight crew, who never attended a service call on either leg of the journey for anyone. The food in economy is poor, and on the first leg of the journey, one male crew told me he had no idea what type of chicken it was, it was just a chicken meal! We will never fly with Air Canada again, and I would not recommend them.

### "Air Canada accepted full liability"
I tried to give the documentation with instructions on disconnecting my son's electric wheelchair to the baggage handler in Halifax. He refused to take them saying he knew what to do. Air Canada insists on this documentation which should be fastened to the wheelchair by the baggage handler. When we arrived at Heathrow, special Needs staff lifted G into his wheelchair; he switched the power on but his chair was dead. We spent the four hours between our flight to Manchester with engineers, ground staff and special needs staff but no-one could fix the chair. The headrest appeared broken too. We were transferred to a different terminal in a manual chair. We spent a further two hours at Manchester where staff tried in vain to find the problem and complete paperwork confirming damage. Staff read the wheelchair manual but this was too technical for a layperson to understand.We borrowed a manual chair to take G home, his own broken chair being delivered home late the following evening. Air Canada have accepted full liability and will pay the nhs for repairs (it's an nhs wheelchair). The repair contractor found the baggage handler had disconnected every possible connection in the wheelchair rather than disconnecting one easily accessible plug for the flight duration as was in the written instructions he refused to read. The wheelchair had to be completely stripped down for the reconnections to be made. Air Canada say they will also compensate us as G had to sit in his emergency basic canvas seated manual wheelchair for two days. He cannot move around in it and as the back does not tilt it makes it difficult for him to eat and drink. With regard to the flight, the seats were comfy with plenty of legroom - and I have long legs! Staff were polite. Breakfast was a choice of pancake or omelette. The latter had dried up potatoes and diced veg with a revolting gloopy spinach sauce. Awful! At least they carried our luggage - they left our main bag behind on the outward leg and G had no change of clothes or battery charger until they delivered it to our hotel 24 hours later.

### "service of Air Canada was poor"
Our plane in Las Vegas was 6 hours delayed. From Air Canada we got coupons of $10, for food and drink. However, you can't buy a sandwich under $10 at the airport. We missed our next flight and Air Canada booked a hotel in Toronto (arrived 1am). Only 1 person explained the situation to passengers and had the coupons. After that we had to wait several hours before we arrived at the hotel. There they told us that the hotel was overbooked and we had to go back to the airport. We got another hotel and 4.5 hours later we got to bed (6.30am). In the evening we flew to Amsterdam, 24 hours delayed. The service of Air Canada was poor. With the coupons they give you, you can't buy a  meal and a drink.

### "several hours delayed"
Our flight from Calgary to Frankfurt with Air Canada was several hours delayed, but it was impossible to contact the service desk and nobody could give us any information to start with. Our connecting flight to Amsterdam was missed and nobody seemed to care. Crew were not friendly, however the worst part was the food. Airline food may not be the best, but this was awful. On a 10 hour flight, dinner was pasta carbonara, which was like plastic. After 8 hours, as breakfast we received 1 small yoghurt and a slice of banana bread. No snacks.

### "incompetent, disinterested and unhelpful"
I have never experienced such a diabolical level of customer service. Incompetent, disinterested and unhelpful staff. Having been delayed by 7 hours due to a technical fault resulting in missing a connecting flight we were met by unhelpful AC staff who informed us that we would have to sort our own connecting flight out as she had already worked too many extra hours this week and was going home. We were then asked to make our way to a hotel for the night only to be told by the hotel when we got there that they didn't have enough rooms. This all happened at 2.30 in the morning at 6am we finally got to another hotel. The appalling service doesn't end there. I appreciate flights can be delayed but I expect a better level of care especially from an airline who states their vision is "to make every customer feel valued". I will never travel with Air Canada again.

### Air Canada customer review
I recently flew from London to  Edmonton. It was a 9 hour flight and for the most part alright. The crew was very nice and helpful. When I boarded the plane, the flight attendant took one look at my Lebanese passport and spoke to me in fluent Arabic! It was quite the lovely surprise,and great to know they cater to more then just Canada's national languages. The macaroni cheese I ate was on the low end, I would rate it a 4/10. The movie selection was alright, but the music choices were poor. Free headphones, free snacks anytime you asked, with good coffee. The seats were a little cramped.

### Air Canada customer review
I recently flew from Fort Lauderdale-Brussels via Montreal. The flight from Fort Lauderdale to Montreal was good, but I was a bit disappointed from Montreal to Brussels. On the way back, however, they sure redeemed themselves. Flight from Brussels to Montreal was superb, with yummy pasta and great IFE. Connection was ok, than the flight back to Florida was good.

### Air Canada customer review
The cabin crew were disinterested and slow. They act and like they are doing a special favour for you by pouring you a drink or even getting you some napkins. Blankets and headsets weren't offered but sold to you. You either bring your own (which takes up space), buy theirs, or freeze without being able to hear the movie. Comfort levels will decrease and the flight attendants won't be able to help much. A flight attendant told me that they cannot help me lift my luggage into the high luggage compartment. Any person complaining about any slight discomfort with reason were rudely put on the spot (the lights were broken and couldn't be turned off for one of the passengers so the passenger had to ask about it or else he couldn't nap. The flight attendant only tried their minimum best to help by taping the lights and then left him alone. The taped lights continued to fall off but the flight attendants just ignored him and responded only if the passenger actively tried to complain again. The flight attendant just tossed my napkins down on the table and left without a reply. I found it quite rude and impolite. The seats were new but poorly designed. The buttons for the remote were built onto the armrest of the passengers. It looks simple and basic but it was terribly uncomfortable for the passengers. Thus, many times the service button was accidentally pressed causing the flight attendants to become annoyed at us even though it was an accident. The lights, service, or volume buttons would accidentally turn on whenever I try to rest my arms on the armrest. A suggestion may be to add a cover for the buttons so that these small inconveniences can be avoided in the future. Sadly, I bet this will not be implemented anytime soon as this review will be ignored and forgotten.

### Air Canada customer review
Using MEX T1 is not always pleasant as it is crowded and small. Check in agents were friendly, but when I asked if there were late upgrades available, they said that business class was full. This turned out to be false, as there were two seats available. Boarding started late, but was done in an organized way. Once on board we were greeted by some very friendly Montreal-based crew members. The two francophone flight attendants were very friendly in a not-fake way as opposed to the overcompensated service that can be found on some airlines, the anglophone flight attendant looked a bit surly and was not friendly, but she did her job fine and was polite. It is a bit of a shame that food is the typical American "buy-on-board" selection. The options available were similar to any café food (sandwiches and wraps) served on a napkin along with other unfortunate junky choices. All non-alcoholic drinks were free of charge. (TIP: It is worth it to pay $7 when booking online, this will allow you to choose a main dish and a snack from the menu at no extra cost. Bear in mind that these items will be more expensive on board and that you will need to be carrying a credit card). The airplane was in great conditions in spite of its age. In flight entertainment was the standard personal video, but choices were not very enticing. Arrival was done in a very organized manner, and crew made sure that passengers with tight connections left the plane first, which is very considerate. Overall, Air Canada offers a very good solid and consistent service by its human capital, it is always nice flying with them.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada's new 787 Business Class turned out to be a definite improvement over all its other "pod" aircraft. The suites have lots of room,huge TV screen,massage function, and really private which is nice if flying alone. The service was great and my only beef is the hot meals could use an upgrade as well. I fly business class all the time with Air Canada and the meals don't ever seem to change. All in all I am really pleased with Air Canada business class and especially the new 787 service. I am the same guy who gave Air Rouge bottom marks so I felt when an airline does a good job it deserves mention as well. I can't wait for my next 787 flight which is coming up next month.

### Air Canada customer review
I have no idea how Air Canada rates as one of the best airlines in North America. We flew business class and my head phones didn't work. They offered me some sort of points. But the real problem was my luggage tagged, "priority", came off last. I waited 45 minutes while all the luggage was unloaded and my ride home drove endlessly around the airport. Last luggage down on the carousel. I tried to contact them today on their "chat line" and no one seems to be working there as I waited 30 minutes without anyone answering. Air Canada, living up to what ought to be their motto, "We're not happy unless you're not happy

### Air Canada customer review
The only thing I can conclude after numerous flights with AC over the years is that in terms of their international economy they're no longer trying to make it pleasant. I had an okay seat, 31K, at a bulkhead, with no window unfortunately. There's a jump seat there for crew, but the staff member simply asked me if I knew how to open the door in the event of an emergency, then told me not to open the door if it were underwater, and then walked away to join her friends at the rear. The food choices were awful. There was no drink service until dinner, and that was rather late as we were waiting for connecting passengers who never showed up, and whose luggage had to be offloaded. I put on a sleeping mask I'd brought along, and put a blanket over my head, and slept for nearly the entire flight, as the catering was so basic. I could just as well have bought a $2.99 frozen pasta at a grocery and have had it heated, such was the dinner service. Also, the IFE, especially the map, still does not work in the economy cabins. The FA said she'd reset my unit, which I doubt she did. I've seen numerous complaints about this. How hard is it to rectify this?

### Air Canada customer review
What a difference a cabin makes. I flew back to YYZ from LHR on 20 August. I learned the flight was full, and as I was in economy in a seat with no window (31K) I asked if there were any other economy seats that had a window. I was only offered the middle of the middle section, which I declined. I then asked if my Aeroplan miles would be of any use, but was told there were people with higher status on the flight. It doesn't hurt to ask, and it certainly helps to ask nicely, and to be decently dressed. I had a brief chat with ground staff, who were not in AC uniforms. Moments later, one of the ground staff approached me with a huge smile on her face, and a boarding card in her hand. I was taken up front to executive first, seat 10D. I've flown this cabin before, and was really pleased about the upgrade. It didn't matter to me at all that I didn't have a window at my seat. Such a huge difference from economy. Crew really can't do enough for you in the premium cabin. There were bubbles for boarding, along with pretzels, due to an allergic pax near me. I went up to the galley after takeoff to enjoy a glass of decent (but not really good) champagne, and some hot nuts. I then returned to my seat for meal service. There was middling champagne, but excellent reds and whites served with lunch. I had a seafood appetizer which was good, but which was not presented very attractively. Then I had a main of mushroom and herb-crusted lamb with red currant jus. I had this on a flight a few years ago out of CPH, and it was as good as I remembered, cooked rare. The CSA worked my side of the cabin, and he was attentive and friendly. The meal was filling, and so I skipped the cheese, and had ice cream and a cognac, and settled in for a sleep on my way back to Toronto. There was a snack service before landing, but the sandwiches, though wrapped, were really stale. The interesting thing is that the IFE's map feature does work in Business Class, but doesn't in economy: why is that? A pleasure to ride up front, but a drastic difference from down the back with economy pax. Again, I'll suggest that AC can do a lot to make their economy experience better: after all, tickets are about 1400$C for this trip in high season.

### Air Canada customer review
Two days ago I flew with Air Canada on my way back to the US from Vietnam. I flew in a B777-300ER. The flight was okay with on-time departure and arrival. The service was not okay, it was of a cheap quality. The food served was horrible and the meal was poorly prepared. They gave us the food as if they were throwing it on to the tray table. Both of my kids could not finish the meal which is unusual. This is a long haul flight and 3 meals were served. One hot meal with very little food. The light meal was a cup of ramen noodle. Then the breakfast was another poorly prepared meal. The entertainment options were very limited. Overall, I am very disappointed and would not choose to flight with them in the future.

### Air Canada customer review
Flight got cancelled and was left stranded in Ottawa for over 24 hours. No real help to try to rebook to an earlier flight, or offering to reimburse so that an alternate earlier flight can be booked through a different airline. No reimbursement for food, extra night accomodation or travel to said accomodation, was told rudely by staff that given it was a weather issue, they could take no liability for the cancellation. Which is fine, but we weren't even told the reason for the cancellation and delay until pressed!

### Air Canada customer review
Checked into the flight using the priority counter and was served by a surly agent. Boarding was via a jetway but we had to go up the stairs to get to the top of it. Aircraft was stuffy and lighting dim. Flight departed 15 minutes late. The seat was comfortable but legroom was limited. AC must generate quite a bit of revenue from the so called "Preferred Seats" in economy class for which there is an extra charge while the rest of the seats offer a cramped experience. FA's were prompt with their service which consisted of a single beverage of your choice. There were no refills offered which was likely due to the short duration of the flight. Bathroom at the rear was smelly and the odour reached deep into the cabin whenever the door was opened. IFE was OK but AC has now disabled the ability to fast forward through the commercials at the beginning of the program which forces you to sit through unwanted ads. This used to be an issue and AC had implemented the fast forward feature but it appears they have now regressed. Honestly, who wants to sit through commercials? There were no announcements from the flight deck and the flight arrived 17 minutes late. Overall it was the usual mediocre AC experience.

### Air Canada customer review
Sitting at the connecting airport with an undetermined flight delay. I am not pleased with the level of communication or with the amount of times the delay has been delayed. I was also not pleased with the low level of air circulation on our previous 10+ hour flight. Other annoyances on that flight included getting my seat bumped by the beverage cart with no apology, no inflight entertainment (including wifi/Air Canada app). I am will not recommend Air Canada for any upcoming trips.

### Air Canada customer review
I never had flown with Air Canada before, many people were without entertainment system. Luckily I had a working one, with fun and updated movies. Food is okay, didn't have any problems with it. Staff was nice, and ask you if you want something to drink very often. Conclusion was a nice flight.

### Air Canada customer review
A 14-hour plus direct flight from Sydney to Vancouver was quite pleasant initially. Had a few hours of napping, to which the first snack/meal service was provided. However, I was hungry a couple of hours later and I did what I have done with other full-service carriers - I asked the attendant for a snack. I was told "No" and looked at as if I had asked for the strangest request. At this point in time, I was desperate enough to fork out money for a snack, and apparently, they do not have that option either. If only, maybe, the staff had gone the extra mile to explain that there was a lack of snacks (as it was a full flight), that they do not have this service with Air Canada (they literally only offer 1 snack and 1 meal service, as per their website), or if she was nice enough to offer a beverage, I would not be writing this review. Our connecting flight from Vancouver to Montreal was delayed, so we missed it. The only saving grace, was that the next flight that we were put on was only a 2-hour wait, which isn't too bad. The next plane was full, so I was seated separately from my partner, and had my hand-luggage involuntarily checked-in upon boarding the aircraft, because there was not enough overhead compartment space. The Vancouver to Montreal flight, was by no means any more pleasant, as they do not serve complimentary food, but available for purchase. To me, if you're to charge extra for food onboard, you're a low-cost carrier.

In general, I find flying with Air Canada can be a bit of gamble. If there are no weather or schedule delays, they are fine (note: fine, not excellent). If you have to rebook/change flights due to delays or cancellations, then this is where they begin to lag in terms of customer service.

### Air Canada customer review
Booked business class seats for me and daughter (15 years old). Inside the plane, discovered there is a "wall" between rows, so we would be seated separately and she would be by herself. No sign of this on booking site, no one at check-in knew about it. No assistance from the crew, had to personally find somebody to change seats. On the way back, tried to find out at the airport how to secure seats together. Clerks sent us from one counter to another and back again. Trip itself will not be memorable. Very tight seats, very bad attendants (except the chief attendant on the way back).

I was leaving Split, Croatia and five minutes prior to boarding my flight I received a text saying my flight from Munich to Toronto was canceled and they couldn't rebook me. Upon arrival to Munich - they put me in a hotel an hour outside of anywhere with only a taxi voucher. When arriving for my "rebooked" flight the next morning - my ticket was unable to be found. I almost missed my flight to Toronto because it took them so long. My 8 hour layover in Toronto turned into almost 12 - which they also did nothing to help. To top it all off - they had lost all of my luggage so I had been in the same outfit for almost three days. Our flight was so late that no one was in the terminal to help locate my bags.

### Air Canada customer review
The plane was delayed in Toronto for three hours due to weather. We were told that there would be someone waiting at the gate for us to help us fix our missed connections. No one was there and we had to go to the transfer desk where there were 100 people waiting and only one person working. We waited for 2.5 hours and missed a chance at a second connection. We were travelling with small children and told that we would have to spend 8 hours waiting for the new connection. They offered nothing. We have had a multitude of problems on each Air Canada trip and we now will actively try to avoid them.

### Air Canada customer review
Our family's first experience with Air Canada was in June 2015 flying from Portland to Paris. We deliberately packed only in carry on size luggage so we could keep luggage with us. The agents at Vancouver forced us to check all three pieces of carry on luggage. My family spent the first two days in Paris with no luggage as all three pieces were lost in Montreal. Other family took the same itinerary home from Paris on a trip a month later (August 2015). Could lightening strike twice? We checked three pieces of carry on luggage and all of it was lost in Montreal. We arrived home last night. One bag has been found and the other two have not. Clearly, Montreal is too large an airport for Air Canada to navigate in the two hour connection window the airline set up on the itinerary. We will take our travel dollars to another airline in the future.

### Air Canada customer review
I am not a frequent flyer and my experience was due to ignorance but I am sure there are many like me. First on flight from Toronto to Moncton, arrived at counter 1 hour before the flight with my boarding pass that I printed at home. After waiting in line for about 25 minutes, I was told that I had to go back and print my baggage tag also. The person at the counter flatly refused to print it for me. My suitcase was small enough to bring on the plane but lost a small bottle of liquor at the security because it was over the size limit. Secondly on the return flight from Fredericton, I was told the flights that that day had been oversold and I may not get a flight. I had bought this ticket beginning of June but was told that because it was an economy ticket, there was not much he could do. After getting really upset, he managed to get me a seat on my booked flight. Staff in Toronto and Fredericton were rude and unwilling to help. I will avoid Air Canada at all cost.

### Air Canada customer review
The flight from Shanghai was on time, the plane was clean and the staff were very good. We had the first row seats so there was no leg room problem (paid extra for it). The only problem was the food, the 3 meals served. I do not expect 5 star meals on a plane, but the food was inedible, tasteless and cold. I think AC with all the money it makes can serve better food on these long flights. Going out on this trip I flew with Singapore Airlines, the difference between them is incredible.

We booked a flight from Toronto to Beijing. The flight lasted 13 hours, which included: Tasty breakfast, lunch and dinner, dessert. Great service, friendly crew, GPS, comfortable seats, and nap time. Same thing on the way back. I don't think there were any delays

### Air Canada customer review
I'm writing this review, still waiting for my delayed flight from Toronto to Rochester, NY. My flight from Shanghai was delayed (controllable reasons - problem with the plane) for about 2 hours, so I ended up missing my flight to Rochester, NY. I had to spend a night in Toronto, and the process of getting my hotel voucher was not easy - it was a lot of asking and waiting. My flight from Shanghai to Toronto was not very pleasant, some staff members were very rude, their tone was demanding and patronizing at times. I'm not sure if it's because that they assume that you don't speak English (most passengers were Chinese). Now my morning flight to Rochester is delayed for another 2 hours - they said that the original plane that I was going to be on had some problems. I hope that my new flight will be on schedule. I think it's unacceptable to be delayed this many times, for controllable reasons.

### Air Canada customer review
This was a very disappointing flight with rude staff. The toilets were in a terrible state, much like a portaloo mid-way through a music festival weekend. I would normally fly Air Transat but decided to go with Air Canada as they sell themselves as a "premium" airline. One thing that kept coming up was how rude the staff were. One of the passenger's on our flight had their call light on for at least 30 minutes before anyone bothered to check on them. This is after a stewardess walked by them more than once. On both flights the in-flight entertainment wasn't working properly for a variety of reasons. Nothing was done to resolve this issue.

### Air Canada customer review
Have flown with AC numerous times. Domestic and international. Flights out of Toronto are almost always delayed, have had 1 bad experience out of Vancouver but am generally quite pleased with their service out of Calgary (my home base) flight attendants are hit and miss as with everything in the service industry but overall they have been very helpful over the years and have even met me at the gate and drove me across the Tarmac to make my connection on 2 separate occasions. The IFE has not worked on 2 flights that I can remember but is really quite good when it's working.

### Air Canada customer review
I showed up at Pearson at 5.45 am for my 8.30 direct flight to San Diego. For some reason, the automated Kiosk couldn't read my credit card, so I had to enter the check-in line. I was in line by 6.:00, and spent two hours waiting. It was total chaos, the line was out of control, they only had 4 out of 12 kiosks open, and the woman attempting to organize the line so that people with impending flights were moved to the front just plain failed. I wouldn't have cared about how rude she was if she had just succeeded in doing her job. I stayed calm, didn't complain, and followed all instructions I was given. I missed my flight. They simply lacked the wherewithal to check in a passenger who arrived 2.5 hrs prior to departure. I travel a lot, and I've never experienced anything as unprofessional as this before. The employee who ultimately checked said the "it's not their fault the airport is busy, and showing up 2.5 hours prior to arrival just isn't enough these days. Whose fault is that? They re-routed me through Chicago, and I got to experience a wonderful 14 hour trip from Toronto to San Diego. At least I got a fifteen dollar meal voucher.

I flew IND-YYZ-YVR-PVG and PVG-YYZ-IND on the way back. Air Canada have a great international fleet. Good service aboard the long haul international flights. However, the transborder/domestic service was average compared to other airlines in the North American Area. The flight from YYZ-IND was delayed and they gave us a $10 voucher. I will fly with them the next time I go to China.

### Air Canada customer review
London to Toronto. Flight delayed 5 hrs and no explanation or food vouchers were given. When it came for boarding, ground staff were shouting at passengers. Flight was very old B767, Air Canada should stop sending these old 767's across Atlantic, entertainment system did not work for the whole flight, crew tried to reset it but it did not fix the issue, it was a very long flight to have no entertainment system. When it came to food, it was awful.

### Air Canada customer review
We had a confirmed booking to fly from Toronto to Newark on 27 Jul 2015 by AC 768. At the time of checking in, we were shocked when they said that we were on stand by when the tickets were booked over 4 months ago. The seats were not allotted until we reached the gate, which meant we were not scheduled to fly on that plane. Unacceptable! They started serving snacks and drinks just 30 mins before landing and they only served a few rows, not all. Reason being it was time to land. So, the cabin crew did not know how long they will take to serve all passengers? Why did they even start serving? Air Canada dropped lowest in our rating considering the amount of international travel we do every year.

### Air Canada customer review
I travelled 27th July from Toronto to LHR. This was quite possibly the worst experience I have had with an airline. The plane was delayed but the main issue I had was the state of the 767-300 aircraft. The entertainment system was not working, seats were in a poor condition, WC's were in a poor state and the experience was somewhat disappointing, particularly as I paid almost £800 for the flight. I would probably not consider flying with Air Canada again based on the experience I had.

### Air Canada customer review
Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto. It is nice to see there are still some service-minded people left at AC. The flight from Toronto to Montreal had very basic service given the short duration and the time of day. Luggage delivery both in Toronto and Montreal was shockingly slow.

### Air Canada customer review
Indifferent cabin crew acted like passengers were an inconvenience. No choice of meal, only pasta in a white sauce and this was an international flight. I have flown Air Canada several times and have no idea how they get a 4 star rating I have flown other four star airlines such as Lufthansa and Etihad and I can say Air Canada does not belong in the same category.

### Air Canada customer review
Our flight was a 10 hour and 43 minute flight from Calgary to Tokyo however during the flight we were not able to access the entertainment system as it was broken. We went up to the service desk to ask if there was anything that was available that we could use instead of the entertainment system on board but understandably last minute there was nothing. The service we recieved at the ground desk was terrible. We were not treated with much respect almost as if we, the customers were something that was not important. After our disappointing encounter with the ground staff we got on board. We found out that our light and attendant call button were both broken. We got complaint forms however when we tried to enter them online all three cards had invalid claim numbers and therefore we cant claim anything. I have tried to call the airline from Japan but there is no free call to the airline therefor after not having entertainment we have recieved no assistance. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

### Air Canada customer review
The first leg of travel was from Istanbul to London on Turkish Airlines - amazing service, customer service and comfort. The second leg from LHR to YYC on good old Air Canada was a nightmare. Boarded on time, sat on tarmac for an hour with no communication and forbidden use of bathrooms. Food during flight was mediocre to poor. Service was terrible, seemed like the staff was being forced to work there, seating was less comfortable than the Turkish Airlines used during first shorter sector.

### Air Canada customer review
Came off a flight from London and had booked an internal flight to get me to Edmonton. Turns out it would have been quicker to drive. We boarded on time but were then told that there was an electrical fault with one of the radios. We waited on the tarmac for an hour and then an engineer came and replaced the offending part. During this time, communication from the flight attendant was scant and when he did speak it was comical. Each time he read the announcements from his dog-eared handbook looking like he would rather be anywhere else in the world from here. We eventually took off and the flight to Edmonton was fine. On landing we were in the middle of a thunderstorm so there was no tractor available to tow us to the gate. We waited around 30 mins and then we were good to go. Coming back it was another story. I was booked on the 3pm flight back to Calgary to connect to AC850 at 17.50. I checked in and was happily waiting at the gate when my cousin called to tell me we were delayed (she was getting updates from an app on her phone). There was nothing to say we were delayed on any of the airport screens. Further updates came through to say the delay was being extended and then it finally came up at the gate, although no announcements were made. I had to watch the 4pm and 5pm flights depart on time and then finally the 3pm flight was cancelled and we were transferred to the 6pm flight. Obviously I had missed my connection by that point. Cabin staff on the return leg were rude and unhelpful when I tried to enquire how best to get to my next gate at Calgary. I understand that airlines are always prone to delays but the lack of communication really annoyed me. I'll definitely try to get a direct flight next time. Flight attendants could definitely benefit from some customer service training

### Air Canada customer review
Flew out economy but paid extra to get 35A which is an exit row seat. Seat was ok but a bit snug width-wise. Queues for the loos tended to stand right in front of me so it was a busy area. Inflight entertainment was good but would benefit from more recent films. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions. Food was really good, a lot better than other economy flights I have taken. Coming back I upgraded to Business Class and was given seat 7a. I didn't get to choose as I missed my original flight due to a connecting flight cancellation so was just happy to have made the flight. Seat was ok but uncomfortable in fully flat mode - it would have been a lot more comfortable with an extra cushion layer. Flight attendants were friendly but rushed to get everything done before people wanted to sleep. Food was good but some choices ran out quite quickly. I liked the idea of pre-ordering breakfast and letting them know if you wanted to be woken for it or not. Overall a good flight, a lot better than the experience I had on my connecting flights with Jazz

### Air Canada customer review
On the way from Toronto to Beijing we were told that there was no hot water beverages due to "contamination issues. The flight staff were not very friendly. On the way home we were forced to downgrade my ticket from first class to coach because my children were in coach and it was against policy. My husband and I sat in the last row of first class and my kids were in the first row of coach. The first class row was literally right in front of the row my children sat in. There were absolutely no issues on our leg out to China with my kids sitting in coach. I was never told that this was against policy. On our way back the ticketing agent refused to issue our tickets. We tried upgrading the kids that was refused because on the second leg of the trip there were no first class seats available. However, on the second leg of the trip there were only economy seats on the flight. The desk agent made us wait for over an hour refusing to give me back my passports. They said the only way we could fly is if they downgraded my ticket for an economy class seat. The agent refused to allow me to keep my first class seat. The whole situation was beyond logic.

### Air Canada customer review
Smooth check-in aided by a friendly agent in Montreal. First leg to Toronto left and arrived on time. A small but tasty snack and full bar service was available on the short flight to Toronto and the FA was friendly and very efficient. Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly. Overall it was an OK experience but lack of coffee and tea on a very long flight (especially to China) was inexcusable.

### Air Canada customer review
Initially I was reluctant to fly Air Canada after all the bad press about their service and quality but I can only give a big thumbs up for overall service and friendliness of the crew. Food quality is poor, but no worse than most other airlines.

### Air Canada customer review
I am a Canadian who lives and works in South America. I have made the trip from Ecuador to Canada three times this year. Each time I traveled, my baggage as been misplaced and delayed (three times in a row, consecutively). Their staff in Pearson (Toronto) are not informed on baggage through customs. I was given three different answers by three different employees. Air Canada has a policy where you do not directly speak to employees regarding complaints. Rather, you write in an e-mail complaint and are told you'll get a response withing 25 days to a month. AC's lost articles policy is time consuming, requires paper mail and has a lengthy window period for response. This is not worth the hassle in many cases.

### Air Canada customer review
Wasn't the worst flight I've been on, I'll say that. But when you arrive 2 hours early and your flight gets delayed and you arrive at your destination and they not only forget to put my checked luggage on the plane but half a dozen other peoples luggage on the same flight might I add, is just plain ridiculous! Yes I understand it happens, but not to eight different people on the same flight. I fly a lot and out of all the airlines I fly, this has been the most disappointing! My boyfriend and I checked our bags at the same time and his bag arrived.

Departure from Montreal scheduled at 20.00 delayed at registration for 22.30. Midnight at embarking door, flight was cancelled without any kind of explanation, no option on another flight. We were asked to pick up our luggage, we were given a phone number but no human assistance, no voucher, no advice. The only hotel we could find at 1.00 am was the Marriott). We are elderly women foreigners without contact in Montreal. Next morning we learn by email (assuming you can read your mail abroad) that a plane will board at 17.00- no apology and no explanation. Arrival in Geneva with 20 hour delay. No assistance from Air Canada, nobody to help and direct us to a so called "reasonable hotel".

### Air Canada customer review
I was disappointed by my travel day with Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto connecting in Toronto to Dublin. The first leg was delayed by an unknown amount because of maintenance issues. They bumped me and other passengers to a different plane so that we would make our connections (after delaying for about 1 hour and 45 minutes), which was appreciated but I ended up in a terrible seat and still cutting it extremely close and I have no idea when the original plane actually ended up taking off. We landed in Toronto and almost ran off the plane to try to make what I thought would be a very short connection of about 30 minutes in a huge airport. Turns out the next leg was also delayed, so far by 2 hours (I'm still sitting her, waiting to board and fuming) for, again, maintenance. Apparently this time they know what's wrong but they have to go get a part to replace something in one of the pilot/copilots chairs? At least that's what I gleaned from the flight attendants and various other passengers discussing the issue. I understand that delays happen sometimes. But its a little ridiculous for both of these planes to need last minute maintenance. We haven't been offered any kind of compensation for all of this trouble and I'm annoyed. I've flown air Canada before and had things go as expected but only once before and a 50/50 record isn't great.

### Air Canada customer review
I was travelling from Edmonton, CA to Cairo, Egypt on Monday July 6th 2015 on flight AC 8153, with my 17 and 15 years old children and my 7 month old baby. We were supposed to catch flight AC 852 from Calgary to London, however, there was a 2.5 hour delay and accordingly there was a risk that we would miss our flight from London to Cairo. I went to the Air Canada customer service, who told us that if we missed our flight we would be compensated. However, on flight from Calgary to London I was disappointed once again, I asked the flight attendant for a can opener because I wanted to open my baby's formula but they said they didn't have one. It was very inconvenient considering that the flight was 9 hours long. They didn't give me extra food or any baby food (which was supposed to be provided since they knew there was going to be a baby on board). When we got to London at 2.57 pm, we, obviously with no surprise, missed our next flight that was planned to depart at 3pm. We were booked for the flight that leaves at 10.30 pm, thus making us stay at the airport for 7.5 hours! We were treated with no respect whatsoever. We were just given vouchers and told that was all they could do for us. Finally when we got to our final destination, adding to all the hassle we faced, our luggage had not been put on our flight and we had to wait for almost 48 hours before we got them.

Recently had a pleasure trip to Boston, Cape Cod and New York. Unfortunately before we left I broke my foot and was on crutches for the trip duration. We signed up for handicap assistance through Air Canada. They were our flight provider for every leg of our journey. I am so impressed with the service Air Canada provided. At every Check in, one or more Air Canada representatives were there with a wheelchair to transport me (with my 78 year young mom), to the next flight connection. Everyone who helped was courteous, experienced and efficient. It made the trip so much easier, and there were some very tight connections, especially in Toronto. Thank you so much for your outstanding service Air Canada. My only complaint is the new $20 baggage fee which is the only reason my review is a 9 instead of a full 10. I wish it did not exist

### Air Canada customer review
As a top tier AC frequent flyer I checked in using the priority lane. The agent was aloof. We had an onward connection with Lufthansa and despite providing her with booking reference and ticket numbers, she insisted there was nothing she could do to issue our boarding passes, so much for seamless integration with Star Alliance. On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection. AC lost its title as Best North American carrier and I hope this serves as a warning to them as their service and especially staff interactions have put them on par with the rest of the mainstream carriers in North America. There is nothing left that distinguishes them from their American counterparts. Time to get your act together AC.

### Air Canada customer review
I went out of my way to take the new Air Canada Dreamliner and it was worth it. Although the Toronto to Copenhagen flight is relatively short - only 7 hours - it gave me a chance to experience the excellent new product and service. Business class has a spacious 1-2-1 layout in what AC calls private pods. Private they are for you very much feel isolated from the other passengers, which I appreciate. I love the 787 big windows. It makes you feel more connected to the exterior. I also loved the new IFE with a great touch-screen product. You can view your menu and all your wines on the screen. Food was superb - this time had an outstanding chicken tikka masala. The sparkling wine though, could be improved. It's too sweet for my liking. As is expected today, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed. When sleeping, perhaps the seat is still too high up for sometimes when turning around I would hit the front console with my hips. I don't have big hips. What I also loved about this pod is plenty of storage space. It was worthwhile to fly via Toronto to Europe from New York, just to avoid the American airlines.

### Air Canada customer review
Even on this very short 65 min flight from New York to Toronto, Air Canada gets it right. The Embraer 190 has a spacious 1-2 business class layout, with comfy cushy seats. What impressed me most is that we had a proper meal-service which I very much appreciated. This is very rare in North American skies these days.

### Air Canada customer review
As a UK expat, I've done this route (YVR -LHR) dozens and dozens of times and have now taken the ridiculous step of flying via Calgary or Edmonton instead of taking the direct flight as the new "High Capacity" configuration on this route is outrageously bad. Even with Altitude status - so I can get a bullhead seat - the direct flight has appalling seat width and recline. Adding in extra economy rows so a few "Premium Economy" seats (is that a joke AC? ) can be jammed into this flying nightmare makes the matter worse. The 3-4-3 seats per row is a fine example of pure greed. Even the new business configuration is dire - what was wrong with the pods? I much prefer them to this arrangement. My advice: take a connecting flight on a different plane type with a sensible seat configuration. Inflight meals, entertainment and staff are usual AC standards - nothing special but getting better. I'm usually asleep most of the flight so I'll defer to other passengers for more details on this aspect.

Toronto to Vancouver and back. Outbound I had a broken USB in first seat outbound, then broken headphone jack on second. 2 meter trim strip falling off and into aisle. Climate control failure onboard had passengers sweating profusely. Return flight, suddenly my carryon, which had flow with me all over Canada for 3.5 weeks (I was covering the Women's World Cup) is too large or too heavy, though it is max carry on size on other airlines I've flown. Wouldn't let us board. After 30 minutes and showing them the photographic gear they wanted me to put below (they would not guarantee it's safety,) they finally accepted my idea to put my camera bag in the crew area. Onboard, they ran out of food. Flight attendants left our consumed flood on our trays for 1.5 hours. When I rang call button to ask them to pick up the tray, I was chastised and told to set it on the floor. The attendant who came to me couldn't take it away, she told to me to set it on the floor in the exit row.

I just wanted to recount the excellent customer service I received regarding an unfortunate circumstance concerning a return trip to Aruba from Toronto last year. The agent at the ticket counter should be complimented on his empathy and understanding. However, I should also mention that I was disappointed when no attempt was made to inform me about changes made to the flight, especially since the departing flight from Toronto was delayed by one day. In spite of this disappointment I would continue to fly Air Canada.

Air Canada is known for poor food and very poor entertainment options (the television programs are very limited and don't change regularly) but the seats are good in economy and excellent when you have a flight with the pod configuration in business.

### Air Canada customer review
We travelled Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge to Italy in June/July 2015. For once, we have very positive things to say about Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond.

### Air Canada customer review
Canadian Customs and very slow baggage pickup caused delay in getting to the check-in counter to transfer baggage. Waited 45 minutes to get through customs, baggage was another 20 minutes before they got it on the carousel. When we got to the counter, the agent refused to issue boarding passes because she said we would not make the flight - we had 50 minutes before departure. The transfer baggage counter had actually closed 20 minutes before we arrived. We were forced to spend the night in Toronto. Toronto Airport is a terribly disorganized Airport and Air Canada fell very short of what I have known them to be. They charged for extra baggage even though they participate in a codeshare. They also took advantage of inexperienced travelers by checking in two people booked on one ticket so they could double the extra baggage charge. I personally will no longer make Air Canada a consideration for any flights in the future.

Upon arriving at Dublin Airport at 9am we were told our flight was delayed 12 hours. Keep in mind the weather was sunny and beautiful. No explanation given, just some crummy food vouchers for $25 to be used in the airport. Our connection to Chicago was going to be missed, so Air Canada said they would put us in a hotel at their expense, once we arrived in Toronto. At 9pm we boarded the plane only to be held on the runway for another 2 hours. Once again, no explanation. A long flight to Toronto then commenced. Upon landing in Toronto we were then told that they would not honor the hotel, but that we could sleep on the cold concrete floor in the airport until our Chicago connection was ready to board.

### Air Canada customer review
All 4 flights were on time and Air Canada product shames every US carrier, especially in Economy. Every seat has free IFE which was adequate for SFO-YUL and YUL-LHR sectors, but it could be more extensive for longer flights in AC's network. Food was for purchase on North American flights and complementary food on the transatlantic flights was okay. The crew on all flights were very friendly, although I found the Montreal-based crews to be slightly warmer than their Vancouver-based colleagues. I would definitely fly with Air Canada again.

### Air Canada customer review
Upon arrival at the airport, we paid $75 for 3 pieces of checked luggage and went to the bag drop only to be told we didn't have seats as the flight was full. If someone has paid for a seat on a plane, they should have that seat. After a few minutes of arguing, he assured us that we would be on the flight. When we had gone through security, we went to the customer service desk and explained what had happened. The lady there told us we did not have seats at this stage and that the guy in baggage drop had no authority to guarantee that we would get on the plane. She told us to wait at the gate to see if we were allocated a seat. After a very tense hour, and after most of the passengers had boarded, we were eventually called to the gate and given boarding passes, seated several rows apart. Compared to other airlines around the world, and particularly our domestic flights on Qantas and Virgin Australia, the standard of service is well below par. Having to pay for checked in luggage on top of an inflated flight price, and only offered a soft drink or juice and small pack of nuts adds insult to injury. They made the end to our lovely 6 week holiday in Canada a stressful time unnecessarily.

Tired B777-300ER. Most B773s are sparkling new, this must have been one of the originals. Crew was delightful, food was average. Would consider Air Canada slightly better than US-based airlines but not world class by any means.

Had a nice experience on this short haul. On a 1.5 hour flight there was a TV screen with movies and shows for free if you bring your own headsets. Free drinks and snack. Better than any domestic service. Check-in convenient. Good recognition of Star alliance gold, allowed me access to lounge though I am a United gold and allowed free check in. Flight was overbooked, but got into the flight due to my status.

My first time with Air Canada. Refitted Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 layout. Fine as I had a seat empty next to me but it would be squashed when full. I had a 3-3-3 layout on the way home and was glad of the extra space. Flight was fine - slightly un-engaging and sloppy staff (one spilt water over me and didn't even notice). Food was awful though - low quality and very little of it. The Kosher meals served around me though looked huge and tasty! I'd say BA Economy is a better bet overall.

Vancouver to Toronto. Checked in 2 pieces of luggage at 25.00/piece. I don't mind the user fee but the carry on luggage was extreme. The flight was full. Carry on's excessive and large. The option to have carry on's stowed while waiting at the gate was unfair to those who had to pay to stow luggage. It was obvious that most of the carry on did not meet the regulations. Way too much luggage brought onto cabin. Very time consuming waiting for people to find a place to store luggage. The flight was uncomfortable. Seats are not large enough for most people to sit comfortably. Nothing complimentary offered other than water, other food and beverages to purchase. On a 5 hour flight I think free juice/coffee should be offered.

### Air Canada customer review
I've flown transatlantic on Air Canada twice this year, both less then ideal experiences. For my flight from Calgary to Munich there was a promotion to check ski bags for free for flights to Europe. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told I would have to pay $100 because by bag was over 50lbs and the promotion only applied to those under this weight. Once I got my boarding pass, I found that I was not seated in the window seat that I had previously booked. This was also the case for my flight from Toronto to Munich, as I had booked beside my friend flying from another city for that flight and we were at opposite ends of the plane. Then we sat at the gate in Calgary for over an hour once boarding was completed with no reasonable explanation for the delay - thankfully I had a 5 hour layover. I am a loyal customer to Air Canada and Star Alliance and I choose to fly with them above other airlines, but experiences like this that make me question my loyalty.

### Air Canada customer review
Flight was delayed at time of boarding for 45 minutes of maintenance. Was delayed leaving the gate for half an hour because no available ground crew. Once in Montreal, baggage delivery took forty-five minutes. Two later arriving planes got their luggage first. What should have been a one hour forty five minute trip ended up taking four hours.

YYZ to ZRH on Boeing 787 in economy with my wife and infant. Check in staff in Toronto very helpful and the line moved quickly. Boarding and flight departure on time. I am 6'4" and flying economy I was worried about leg room as I was unable to reserve a preferred seat. Air Canada Boeing 787 cabin was clean and felt open with the lighting and larger windows. I was surprised at the amount of leg room there was in an economy seat, as so many people have stated it was poor. My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a "remote" control located on the arm rests. The buttons are usually pressed by the person sitting beside you which will cause your seat light and functions on the entertainment screen to be activated (sucks when watching a movies and volume keeps going up and down). The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and service with a smile. Our first flight they even attempted to have people give up the bassinet seat to allow us to sit there. We had a great expirence flying with AC and will use them again in the future for sure. And on a side note the pasta served for the meal is much better than the chicken.

I recently traveled YWG-LHR and returned home from EDI-YWG with AC Rouge. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with how well the trip went in both directions. Outbound flight was delayed about 2 hours due to maintenance, staff kept us updated and were very pleasant. After the aircraft couldn't be fixed they quickly changed to a spare Boeing 777 in YYZ and got us going as quick as they could. Meals on board were not bad, only suggestion would be the continental breakfast could be improved. Seats were comfortable and service was good even though a full flight. Returned on Air Canada Rouge in Premium, seat was adequate, food was good but flight attendants need more training and need to act more professional. Priority bag was first off the carousel and connection was perfect, flights on time no complaints.

### Air Canada customer review
Check in was chaotic due to bag drop desks being used for full check in. Baggage once tagged had to go to a separate area to be weighed thus taking the staff away from their desk. By the time we got through security the flight had boarded but there were a number of stragglers who boarded after us and delayed the flight. Seating in row 20 was good for a long haul flight with AVOD which was a step up from Air Canada rouge and the options were reasonably up to date with a decent choice. Toilets were also a good size. Service was fine but food was a disgrace - it was described to me as the Asian option, presumably because it was served with rice. The second meal was no better, inbetween these meals was a large sandwich stuffed full of chicken,  the odd water run now and then. Does not compare favourably with the competition on this route, even Air Canada rouge via Osaka is a better option.

### Air Canada customer review
Last Friday I had a flight from Calgary to London Heathrow. My 9hr flight turned out as the worst flight I have had. After flying with British Airways for years now I decided to try Air Canada, but I won't again. The service and food were bad and a lot of screens and/or earphone plugs aren't working. As an single traveller, 6"4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her. I ended up with some cheese and crackers, grapes and a cup of peanuts, one headphone working and a terrible feeling for letting me change my seat for other people. Besides all that the food was not good at all. From the dinner plate I got, I only ate the brownie.

Flew from Vancouver YVR to Sydney NS YQY via Montreal YUL and Halifax YHZ. First segment from YVR to YUL was an overnight flight on an A320. Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6'2" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself. Overall my first travel with AC was satisfying, but next time I'll make sure I'm not hungry before boarding.

We flew Ottawa-Toronto-San Francisco and returned Los Angeles-Toronto-Ottawa, business class on all trips. The flights to and from Toronto to Ottawa were uneventful. The food served was a fruit plate. The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating. In general, Air Canada business class for North America is nothing special with seats that do not provide a lot more room than economy and the food is only the middle of the road. I question the economic worthiness of the North American business class.

The service on checking in my bag, going through US customs and moving through security was shocking! There were a maximum of two employees working at any stage and that meant that it took me over 1hr 45min to get through to my gate. Fortunately my flight was delayed but if is hadn't been then I would have missed my flight for sure. The number of staff was abominable and it should not be that poor.

As a Super Elite Million Mile customer I have been loyal to Air Canada in the past. My Super Elite days will end in 2015. They switch many popular routes out of Vancouver to Rouge. My one and only trip on Rouge to Hawaii was terrible. Uncomfortable business seats, teens as flight attendants were confused. Secondly, the new business configuration in order to cram in more customers is the worst I have flown on. Impossible to lie flat as there is no space for your feet and the serving tray is like a guillotine when opened. Thirdly, they significantly increase the e-credits required to receive an upgrade and at the same time cut in half the Aeroplan miles earned on short haul flights. I cannot find any positive change. As a result I have switched to WestJet Plus and Alaska.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew from New York to Beijing via Toronto in May and coming back June 11th. I was badly surprised by the lack of professionalism of Air Canada FA. I was spoilt with hot liquids, water and juice 3 times during the flight from Beijing to Toronto, by different FA. Full flight both times, no smiles and kindness from any of the flight attendants, they were rude and seem to be very upset with some of the passengers. Our flight from PEK-YYZ was delayed due to two passengers missing, and while waiting on board, one of the FA's over the microphone said "Perhaps we should give a round applause to the two passengers missing". I find this very disrespectful and inappropriate. Overall, not a pleasant flight, rude cabin crew who shouted for people to remain seated, they didnt seem to care for passengers and they we were just doing their job with minimum standards. Very disappointing experience with Air Canada.

Vancouver to Toronto, AC 132 and Toronto to Baltimore, AC 7936. 6/5/15. We just returned from a wonderful trip to Alaska. We flew Alaska Air there and returned on Air Canada flights. Big mistake! We booked last October and had confirmed reservations. From the moment we arrived at the airport, there were problems. First, their carry-on size is smaller than other airlines. OK. We repacked and paid for an extra checked bag. Then we proceeded to get our boarding passes only to find out we were on standby. No reasonable explanation offered. We proceeded to the gate where I stood ready to be first on line. The gate agent was patronizing and condescending, at best. He finally told me it was my fault since I did not select seats when I booked (the system said I could not select seats and would have to get them later.) I have travelled the world over for business - I am not a rookie at this. We waited and did get seats. Then they asked people to check their carry-on bags for free since the flight was full. We did it and were assured we were checked through to our final destination. Our first leg is completed - comfortable seats and good food options on board. Upon arrival in Toronto, we had to clear customs. We do all we are required to do, but we are not cleared to proceed because our bags have not been accounted for. We wait and are in fear of missing our next flight. Air Canada stamps our card so we can proceed. We run for the gate only to find the plane is not even there. We finally board and get to our final destination late. We wait for our bags and one is missing. No one from Air Canada is to be found and their phone system is very slow. We finally get through and are told the system is down and they can go nothing to track our bag. We did get our bag. The experience from start to finish was unpleasant and there were no apologies offered.

Flew on AC992 from MEX to YYZ. Plane an average A319, took off punctually. The check in service was smooth and very quick yet I had already printed my boarding pass at home. The cabin crew was very attentive, served drinks at several time during the flight. Only the water seemed to be undrinkable because it tasted like pure chlorine. The leg room on the aircraft was not the best for a 4:30h flight. Baggage drop off at Toronto Pearson quick and efficient. I think I would fly Air Canada again, even if the experience was not more than average.

### Air Canada customer review
YUL-LHR-YYZ-MEX in Economy. It is always a pleasure to travel with such a professional airline. Cabin crew members are always really good. I did the YUL-LHR on May the 7th and I was on one of the newer Boeing 777-300ER with 3x4x3 abreast economy class. The cabin was new and spotless, seats were really comfortable and inflight entertainment was excellent. Service was really good, but the second meal was only a very bad slice of cake. LHR-YYZ was on an older 777-300ER with 3x3x3 abreast economy on May 26th. I could not perceive any difference in width between the inbound and the outbound flights. Most of the cabin crew on board this flight were the best AC bunch I have had in a while, there was one that was very nasty to a passenger whose English could not be understood easily. Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty. I had encountered the CSM working in this flight before, and I have to say he does know how to co-ordinate a team. Air Canada does not offer free meals in its flights to Mexico anymore, but I prefer them over the competition because they are a no-nonsense airline with hard-working.

### Air Canada customer review
ORD-YYZ on Apr 23 on an Embraer 175 operated by Jazz and YYZ-CPH on Apr 28 on a 787-800 Dreamliner after a stopover in Toronto both legs in Business Class. ORD-YYZ was on time FA's were friendly and fairly attentive a dinner (chicken skewers on warm salad) was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. Seats were comfortable for the short flight however not as good as the first class seats on US airlines. Check-in in ORD as well as in YYZ worked well manned premium counters and just a short wait. AC uses UA lounge in ORD which was poor as expected. Fairly crowded no actual food some limited snacks most alcoholic drinks were for purchase but some were complimentary such as house wine and one type of domestic beer. However the lounge has a manned bar which for practical purposes means as this is the US tips are expected anyway. Boarding was uneventful which is good. Arrival in Pearson a mess arriving passengers are held back midway in the terminal by airport employees while crossing embarking passengers make their way to their plane. This lasted for several minutes with frustrated arriving passengers with tight connections having to wait for the embarkation process to finish. Also airport employees were rather rude in this situation. Customs hall before border control packed and 45 minutes wait to get through border control. Arrival process in Person obviously not AC's fault but still very unpleasant; not a good first impression for Canada. Check-in and security at Person was a breeze. YYZ-CPH was boarded on time but then delayed for almost an hour at the gate and on the tarmac because one generator did not work. For this reason the plane was also unpleasantly hot while on the ground. Once in the air everything was fine. The Dreamliner is obviously a modern and comfortable plane. AC’s version has a 1-2-1 pod style configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD with a decent movie selection. Crew of friendly senior FA's were excellent professional courteous and attentive. Air Canada is obviously going for a European style of service rather than following the style of US based airlines. Also FA's were regularly present in the cabin to check if something is needed and generous with wine refills. Dinner was a seafood appetizer salad and roasted cod plus various dessert choices. I thought dinner service was very good for airline food. Also featuring some Canadian flavors as well as a Canadian Chardonnay. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Skipped breakfast in favor of sleeping an additional hour so cannot comment on its quality. AC's Maple Leaf Lounge again excellent comfortable spacious and with various quite good food options and a nice selection of drinks. A very pleasant experience and several quality steps above the lounges operated e.g. by UA or AA. Arrival in CPH was delayed 45 minutes but fine otherwise. Border Control in CPH fast and efficient and quite surprisingly for CPH no long wait for the luggage to arrive. All in all two very pleasant flights. Have not flown AC previously because of the airlines mixed reputation but wanted to make use of the stopover possibility in Toronto and to fly the Dreamliner. Will definitely include AC in my future travel plans after this experience. (Star Alliance Gold).

AC761 to San Francisco AC 760 to Montreal. May 26 - June 2. I flew from Montreal to San Francisco on May 26 The plane was clean and the staff were really friendly and experienced. The entertainment system had some good selections. Overall its was a great flight my only complaint is that this is a 6 hour flight yet they still make you pay for food which I find is not fair since I flew Montreal-London in December and its a shorter flight yet you still get a meal.

My wife and I flew Ottawa to Vancouver return. All the planes were full. The positive was that the airline crew were friendly enough and worked well together on all flights. On the way there we flew threw Montreal and boarded an A330-300. A nice big plane with 2-4-2 which works well for couples. On the way back we flew direct on a smaller A320 with 3 and 3 seating. The back of the plane felt very warm and all the restrooms are at the back so there is always a constant flow of people. Air Canada does a good job of providing seat back screens to their fleet. Movie choices were acceptable but regular TV either wasn't available or the selection was poor. The food and beverage cart went by twice and water was offered more often. Nothing is free except the water and soft drinks. I should mention Air Canada has improved it's telephone waiting times considerably.

May 23rd 2015 we flew Air Canada enroute Fort Lauderdale - Ottawa - Frankfurt. From FLL to Ottawa we flow with an E-190 and Ottawa - Frankfurt with 767-300ER. All flights were on time without any delays. FLL-Ottawa: The Flight was full. A lot of cruise passengers were on board this flight. We had the last row in this small aircraft. The restrooms were at the end and they were very busy. Ottawa-Frankfurt: The Service was very poor. We had a Seat in the last row and we got only veggie meals. Unfortunately they had no more meat meals for us. The beverages were poor too. No more Coke Zero after 1/3 off flight time. They had enough Alcohol on Board.

Last month flying from Montreal to Geneva. First the plane left with a delay of about 45 minutes after 2 hours in the air the airplane was detoured back to Montreal due to mechanical problem. Back in Montreal we encountered nothing but rude and useless staff. I had to pay for a cab and Air Canada only offered a voucher for 10 dollars. Next day the same aircraft was used to resume the trip. The returning flight Geneva-Montreal was also cancelled due to mechanical issues and it was the same aircraft. I lost it at the airport when the useless staff just give me a new flight for next day without even try to look for an alternative flight (several flights going to Paris for instance). I had to call customer service in Canada to change another flight also with Air Canada to South America. Long story short try another company and do not spend you money on this company. I wish I had taken a flight with KLM or AirFrance. They were cheaper but with 1 stop.

Nearly got bumped off our flight from Toronto to NY Newark. Wasn't allowed to check in online. Arrived at the airport early and noticed our boarding cards had not issued seat numbers just asterisks. When we mentioned this we were then allocated seats with a new boarding card. The flight was overbooked and some people were subsequently bumped. We paid 25 dollars each way for luggage but loads of people who had brought large hand luggage were then made to check them in but for free. We felt this was very unfair.

Departed on-time landed 30 minutes late due to strong winds nice flight food excellent cabin-crew smiling and attentive except for one old lady throwing meal trays like boomerangs.

I will still fly AC on long-haul.

I was involuntarily bumped from a UA flight 3803 (an Air Canada code share) from Toronto Pearson to Washington Dulles on April 12th. I was in transit at Pearson en route from Tel Aviv to Dulles with an original layover of 2 hours 55 minutes. My initial flight AC 85 from Tel Aviv was late departing and arrived in Toronto at 5.50pm an hour and 15 minutes late. That still left me more than an hour-and-a-half to make it to flight UA 3803 scheduled to depart at 7.30pm. After disembarking from flight AC 85 and reaching Pearson's passport control an Air Canada attendant advised me to go through U.S. customs and proceed to my gate. I arrived at the gate on time at 7pm when boarding was under way. When my boarding pass was scanned a UA gate attendant said I could not board because the Dulles flight was oversold and I had been bumped from the flight some time earlier. No reason was given for the bump. The UA gate staff told me to speak to Air Canada about booking another flight back to Washington and I later had to cross the border into Canada and stay overnight at a hotel paid for by Air Canada. I boarded Air Canada flight AC 7354 to Washington DCA the next morning April 13th. After arriving at DCA I discovered to my dismay that the suitcase I had checked in at Tel Aviv was not on my flight. I spent 5 hours at Pearson trying to sort out the mess resulting from the bumped connection.

First time in 40 years to fly with Air Canada. We loved the slightly wider seats. Disappointed in no movies to watch as not all travelers have i-phones etc. Also on our trip down my husband asked twice for coffee black. He did not get any and was not offered anything else. On our trip home I asked for a black coffee. She said she was making more as several travelers had asked. I did not my coffee or anything else to drink. It was a long trip with nothing to drink especially when they had asked. When trying to get their attention they seemed to avoid my tries. We found the two female stewardess's not very friendly. It may seem a small thing but very frustrating for a traveler.

We recently returned from Dublin to Toronto then on to Winnipeg. Other than cutting it close due to limited staffing in Toronto our flight was excellent. Due to the rush in Toronto one of our carry ones was placed to go in the cargo hold. When we arrived in Winnipeg it stayed in Toronto they were most helpful and kind at the Winnipeg airport and we received 3 phone calls the following day in regards to the misplaced bag and it was delivered to our home. We are very thankful and more than appreciative of the service we received what a great end to a wonderful holiday.

Flew Toronto to Heathrow. Much worse flight than on the way out. We paid a hefty extra fee for exit seats which had no storage whatsoever and not even any room under the seats. Ridiculous. Crew were poor not friendly. One older male member of staff was quite attitudinal acting as though he was doing everyone a huge favour by serving them. A reasonable dinner but breakfast was a measly piece of banana loaf. That's it! The worst airline breakfast I have had.

Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already. Imagine if they decide to go with their high density seating like in their new 777s. When the person in front of me reclines I almost hit my knees.

AC1828 Kahului OGG to Vancouver YVR April 30th. This was one of the worst trips on Air Canada that I have experienced. Really how many people can they jam on a plane? The seats were so close together I had trouble and I am only 5ft two inches tall. I cannot imagine how taller people manage or bigger people for that matter as the seats are also very narrow. The seats barely reclined maybe and inch or so. This was a long flight 5.5 hours with no food offered. Drinks of just tea coffee water and some soft drinks offered only twice in the whole trip. Not sure what the attendants do in all this time. The reading lights for all the middle section of seats did not work. This was an international flight - US to Canada but I think Air Canada views it as one country. The flight crew had the nerve to say on leaving "Hope you had a good flight". Obviously they have never flown in economy on this flight. My neck ached so badly after this flight.

FRA to YYZ. Business class pods were wonderful. We fly these several times a year. The new Maple Leaf Lounge at FRA was beautiful! The food was fresh and plentiful power outlets were readily available spacious and the showers were excellent. The lounge is right on top of the departure gate resulting in a easy process to board the plane. Flew a 777. Pods were clean FA's were attentive and pleasant bathrooms were clean food was excellent for an airline and flight was uneventful (the way it should be). I am *A Gold. Fly AC mostly and most flights are pretty boring. Flights arrive and depart on time. Only one time in the past 12 months did my flights get cancelled or delayed. In this single case Air Canada had me rebooked quickly.

Traveled YYT to MBJ for holiday. The YYT to YYZ leg was Air Canada main YYZ to MBJ was Rouge. After reading the many complaints about Rouge service I was on the lookout for problems but did not find any. Excellent service on both trips with a very attentive cabin crew. On the return leg from YYZ to YYT we were unable to land due to fog and had to return to YUL arriving at 2.30 am. Air Canada gate agents met us in the terminal with hotel and meal vouchers and informed us that a new flight for us would be departing at 9am and we received our luggage quickly. We opted to not got to the hotel as it would be a short stay so we checked back in and waited in the Maple Leaf Lounge. We reported for boarding at 8.30am but were informed that due to weather at YYT we would be delayed until 11.30am. Air Canada agents handed out meal vouchers and we returned to the lounge. Flight departed at 11.30am and we arrived YYT without incident. Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely fly Air Canada again. The delays were unavoidable as no airline controls the weather but we felt that Air Canada did everything they could to keep us informed and comfortable throughout. I should add that we were loyal Westjet customers until this year and harboured a dislike of Air Canada before this trip but we have definitely changed our opinion.

Flew LHR to Toronto. Food was fairly good as was drinks service. Crew moderately friendly but not overly. Didn't look like they enjoyed their jobs. Legroom was good in economy. Boarding was good. Check in at LHR all self service and decidedly rude staff who would be better employed actually printing luggage labels etc than offering blunt and rather patronising advice to confused passengers. IFE is decidedly 'yesterday'.

### Air Canada customer review
Three flights on Air Canada: first flight was YYJ-YYC - a Bombardier Q400 Propeller Plane. It was surprisingly quiet and smooth for a propeller plane as I sat as far away as possible from the engines at the very last row. Cabin crew acceptable but no food offered on this flight. Next leg: YYC-FRA on an Airbus 330 - cabin crew on this flight were atrocious. Food was literally thrown on passengers tray tables. Serving portions were very small. The food which was offered was disgusting - the tomato pasta dish was extremely unappetizing. And the "continental breakfast" was a small piece of cake and a yoghurt shake - it was hardly a snack let alone a breakfast. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal service not to be seen again until before landing in FRA. Final leg: YYZ to YYJ onboard an Airbus 320. Seats uncomfortable - my neck became sore about an hour or so into the flight. Again no complimentary food offered on this five and a half hour flight. Overall Air Canada never ceases to disappoint.

LGA-YYZ-HND. I tried to reserve my seat on their online service in advance but what I saw was only their sorry page and I couldn't process any more for my seat request. When I checked-in at LGA they provided me another boarding pass for my connecting flight. I asked them to reserve a front side seat by aisle but they said they could not reserve any seats for my connecting flight at LGA. When I landed at YYZ I stopped at their counter for transferring passengers to reserve my seat but amazingly they said they couldn't do that just before the departing time. Just before my flight started boarding they changed my boarding pass and my seat was between aisle and window seats. I have asked them to give me another seat but they answered they can't do that because the flight was full. I don't know why I couldn't request my seat in advance at LGA and transfer counter at YYZ.

Our HND-YYZ flight was 12 hours long so it's pretty important to fly with a good airline. However we have very rude and unfriendly service extremely bad food (they just skipped me with the second meal). My husbands outlet wasn't working and the flight attendant answered to my polite request to help with luggage (there was no space above our seats).

I have just returned from a trip to Japan from Washington D.C. (DCA) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on Air Canada flying DCA to YYZ to YVR to NRT. I returned from Tokyo Haneda (HND) via YYZ to DCA. Flight 1175 from YYZ to YVR was horrible - a 777 with 10-across cattle-car seating. Never again! Flight 3 from YVR to NRT was a great disappointment. Poor food (no taste and meagre portions) and a lacklustre cabin crew - lazy and not helpful. I had decided never to select Air Canada again (and was dreading the return flight) however Flight 6 from HND to YYZ (also a 777) had 9-across seating and a much better cabin crew. The ratings below reflect my AC006 experience AC1175 and AC003 would get poor ratings in virtually every category - even the Inflight Entertainment kept shutting off the map I was interested in watching.

April 26th CPH-YYZ. I fly to Europe or Asia every month. Status is Super Elite. I was excited to take my first Dreamliner flight. Get to the airport at 10am for a noon flight. While in the check-in line somebody mentions the flight is delayed - by 12 hours! No call no warning no SMS ahead of time. Terrible customer service. Only one SAS guy capable of handling re-bookings. It was painfully slow. The 4 out of 5 "Staff Service" is for the lone AC employee I saw who did her best to calm people in the line down. Even my Trip-It Pro app didn't get any update feeds from AC about this flight. Shameful! I was eventually re-booked through FRA arriving at YYZ six hours late.

### Air Canada customer review
I flew out of Hong Kong to Toronto. I tried to book my seat online as offered by the Air Canada website 24 hours before my flight but the system would not allow me to do so. I was sick with the flu and requested to get an aisle seat 5 hours before my flight at Hong Kong airport. I was then told that the airplane was overbooked and that no aisle seats were available. I was told to go to the Air Canada counter to request one. To my great surprise their is no Air Canada counter in Hong Kong airport. I was then told to go to my gate and ask the personnel there which I did and they offered an end of the plane seat without a working TV. This was unacceptable for a 14 hour flight. I was then told to keep my mouth shut and keep the seat that was originally assigned to me. I travel for a living and this kind of service I have never seen before not even from discount airlines like AirAsia or Cebu Pacific. Next time I will know better and save some money by booking with a discount airline from which I can get the same service or better.

### Air Canada customer review
After reading lots of negative reviews I was a bit nervous about flying with Air Canada! We have just returned from a 5 week holiday flying with Air Canada all the way through from Sydney-Vancouver-San Francisco-New York- Toronto-Tel Aviv and back again. We got quite a reasonable airfare and when I consider each of the flights we took over the duration of our stay I have to say that overall I have no real complaints. We had no delays to any of our flights no flight schedule changes no issues whatsoever. All of the staff including ground staff and flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and we had no negative interactions. Staff were lenient on a couple of occasions without baggage allowance and we never waited long at the check in counters. Long haul flights no matter which airline are generally arduous and uncomfortable but Air Canada was certainly not the worst airline we have ever flown. The food was a little hit and miss but then it is extraordinarily difficult to cater meals for everyone also we tended to always eat a proper sit down meal at the airport before boarding a long flight so we often just skipped the first meal anyhow. If Air Canada offers a similarly well priced fare for our next holiday we would definitely consider using them again.

YUL-FRA April 2015. A330 was in good shape. I like the arrangement of Air Canada's business class I am tall and find their lay-flat bed system to have plenty of room unlike some airlines. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food service was good.

LHR-YUL April 2015. A330 was in good shape. Very comfortable seat/lie-flat bed. Not a super long flight and they offer 2 meal services I couldn't do the second as I wasn't hungry. Staff were friendly and attentive. Flight arrived 45 minutes early nice bonus. Lounge in LHR is nice connected from Copenhagen and had to change terminals I thought I was walking to Canada pretty long hike.

Flew YDF-YYZ-PVG in Economy. Although I usually check-in online I did so at the airport since it is a small airport and I had luggage to check through to Shanghai. Staff were friendly and efficient. The first flight was an A319 from Deer Lake NL to Toronto which was comfortable and had a great selection on the AVOD. There was food for purchase and complimentary drinks. For the Toronto-Shanghai flight boarding was relatively efficient despite being a full flight. Take off was on time and the same AVOD was available. Seats although small were comfortable. Beverage service began 45 minutes after take off accompanied by a small bag of pretzels. Supper was served approximately 1.5 hours after take off which consisted of either a pork or chicken option. I had the chicken in cream sauce with roasted potato carrot and green bean. Also each tray had a corn and iceberg lettuce salad a white bun and brownie for dessert. It was quite decent for airline food and certainly not the worst I've had travelling. The wine selection was decent too. At the halfway point a Nissin cup of noodles were served with a chicken finger sandwich on white bread with a pack of biscuits. Finally there for breakfast there was a choice between congee or eggs and sausage. I elected for the mushroom and chicken congee which was quite good. It was accompanied by melon and a white bun with jam and butter. Overall it was a good experience and the flight arrived smoothly and promptly in China

AC881 CDG to YYZ. Clean and well maintained 777. On-time pushback from gate takeoff slightly delayed. Pleasant cabin crew led by attentive Cabin Service Director who was working my section of the J cabin. Food choices good meal service well timed. Wide variety of entertainment choices. Landed within 5 minutes of scheduled time and baggage delivered to carousel in record time for YYZ. Great flight.

### Air Canada customer review
My wife and I just arrived this morning on AC flight AC99 from Rio de Janeiro Brazil to Toronto. The seats were very small and cramped but being in economy class we couldn't say much. The big Surprise came when the attendant brought our Kosher meal for both dinner and breakfast for us to open the seal. We were shocked with the portions. They were so small and only 4 tiny items for dinner and less for breakfast this morning. Even when Passover was over 3 weeks ago now we still got Passover meals for our dinner and breakfast. I called customer service today because our daughter is flying tomorrow with the same AC flight to see if something could be done in order to avoid old food for her and the answer was that whatever it is designed for her to eat it is already there for tomorrow night's dinner and they couldn't do anything. I'll definitely think twice in a different alternative next flight.

I flew from Victoria BC via Vancouver (AC 854) to London on 17th April 2015 at 18.40 hrs. The plane from Vancouver a Boeing 777-300 appeared new. The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie! I also fly often to Toronto in planes with 2-5-2 configuration and that is more comfortable sadly the FAs and the good are still rubbish. If they change the configuration of those planes I will never fly Air Canada again.

YUL-YVR-YUL both legs on a tired looking A330-300. I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.

I live in Cleveland and fly to Paris twice a year. I fly Air Canada through Toronto. Yesterday my flight from Paris was delayed by an hour making my chance of making connecting flight to Cleveland very slim. I went to the Air Canada desk to try and get a seat on a later flight and the customer service agent helped me make the earlier flight by walking me to the front of the customs line the (to me unnecessary) security line and then the immigration line. Without her I would have had to wait an additional 2 hours.

I flew AMS-LHR-YOW on April 2nd and return on April 12th. Both were BA/AC interline flights. The BA flights and the transits at London Heathrow from T5 to T2 and vice versa proceeded very smoothly. Now my comments on my experience with Air Canada on this trip: Air Canada uses the Boeing 767-300ER between YOW and LHR. Despite this plane showing its age it's always a very sturdy and reliable plane no wonder that many airlines are still using them regularly on long haul routes. On my outbound flight the captain gave accurate cockpit announcements and staff members on both flights were very attentive and professional. Food snacks and refreshments were plentifully provided throughout the flights. My only issue is with the seats which were uncomfortable and there was very little legroom. Otherwise the meals were decent by airplane food standards and Air Canada offers a great inflight entertainment service keeping you busy on a 7-hour flight. I travel to Canada at least a couple of times a year and previously I used KLM travelling to Ottawa with a stopover at YUL. The route I took with Air Canada this time works out better for me personally and overall I am quite well satisfied with this airline. Will use them again in the future.

### Air Canada customer review
I have to say that Air Canada is the only Continental North American airline offering Premium Economy for some long haul flights and is very competitive with some Asian airlines that offer this cabin and I have to thank to AC for this. Despite the amazing good service and private cabin the comfort is something that is not quite the best. The front seat row 12 on the Dreamliner 787-8 is missing the leg support and relax as all other Asia/Pacific airlines such CX NH JL QF BR which has superior seat comfort and welcoming Champagne as well not only water and juice as AC offers. The food is very good and the drinks are well served 10 min once we are airborne. Flight Crew is very friendly and keep someone at the 'food bar' ready to help you with a drink or snack such as cookies during the entire flight. My flights were YVR-PEK on March 24 returning on Apr 2. Thank you Air Canada for stepping over your all other North American Airlines with this service without removing the good service on regular economy.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew from Sydney Australia to Vancouver on Air Canada and was truly a miserable experience. I'm a petite person and was miserably cramped in a small seat the food was disgusting and the most of the staff acted like those of us in economy class were an imposition. Two women who chatted loudly for 12 of the 14-hour predominately evening flight were not asked to lower their voices so that others could sleep the in-service entertainment a small screen inserted in the back of the seat ahead of us was dark and virtually impossible to see and although staff did pick up trash after meals they didn't after serving various beverages so we were left sitting in rubbish for the duration of the flight. Complaining seemed pointless in light of the persevering misery of the overall experience; I and most of my fellow passengers just took it all in stride. I will never (at least wittingly or willingly) fly Air Canada again. When I got home a Canadian friend said "You flew Air Canada? Sorry! They're terrible! Such a great country such a lousy airline.

### Air Canada customer review
AC63 - YVR to ICN. Flight was delayed because of malfunctioning A/C. Plane had left the gate and had to return. The total delay was over 2 hrs because of strong headwinds. The plane was immaculate as it was one of Air Canada's new B787-800s. The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses. Many people pressed the attendant call button or the overhead light unintentionally by resting their elbows on the buttons.

YYZ-PEK - March 20 - April 11 - The staff who work for Air Canada must be really unhappy in their jobs - no smiles here. The food on board could be greatly improved. On the return trip we noticed that the dining trays in our row were dirty and had not been cleaned from previous passengers. The toilet was also unclean and that was at the beginning of the flight.

Toronto - Milan Malpensa (MXP). At Toronto airport the monitors were showing "on time" but when I arrived to the gate boarding was almost completed. On board: dirty. Aircraft: old 767-300. No smile or help from the attendants (all over-head compartments were occupied by their equipment). Pillow and blanket: basic quality. Food: hot chicken low quality salad and cake. Cold bread given by hand by the crew. Breakfast: banana bread. 20 minutes later they came around with drinks and coffee. No magazine on board. Crew shouting loudly for duty free during night flight while people were sleeping. Wouldn't recommend.

YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase. AC offers an expensive inconsistent product with unreliable on time performance.

AC 016 31st March from HKG to Toronto. A very pleasant surprise. The service was outstanding and the attention to details also surprisingly good. I was impressed by the attention to service and the passengers exhibited by the staff and overall Air Canada has certainly improved their intercontinental Business Class product. The seats were very comfortable and this is the first time I have flown the Hong Kong to Toronto route on Air Canada. I usually fly Cathay Pacific or EVA and dollar for dollar Air Canada comes out on top.

YYZ-YVR-SYD on AC34. Short line with quick and efficient service at the Business class check in at Toronto Pearson Airport.

Fantastic service onboard. Definitely recommend.

### Air Canada customer review
YYZ-MSY on Air Canada and MSY-YYZ via EWR on United. Both legs in business class. Outbound to MSY on AC on cramped old CRA equipment. Not good enough for a three hour flight. Food was mediocre. Pieces of cold chicken thrown about on a few lettuce leaves. Overhead bins too tiny for carry-on resulting in bags being shoved under seats wherever possible by an overwhelmed and stressed attendant. Disgraceful considering the usurious fare charged by AC. Inbound on United was most surprisingly day compared to night. Roomy and comfortable 320 Airbus attentive attendants serving an open bar drink before takeoff and during flight to Newark excellent lunch provided with soup and chicken salad or a cheeseburger and potato salad as choices. Flight from EWR to YYZ also well managed even though only a one hour trip and comfortable on an Embraer with proper sized bins for hand luggage and spacious business class seating. On top of which return fare nearly half of what AC charged which is reason we flew United and from now on shall continue to do so in lieu of AC who have lowered their standards horrifically.

My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.

Just flew AC6 and AC5 and I have to say that AC are the worst airline I have been on. The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery. As a regular NH flyer I feel the code-share between AC and NH reflects badly on NH who are outstanding. First and last time to fly AC - an airline who are really let down by the worst flight attendants I have seen.

PBI-YYZ-YOW on the Tuesday after March break. Both flights on time first on an A321 and the second on an embraer e-190. Both aircraft clean with an excellent choice of IFE for regional flights. The crews were professional if a little aloof; seat comfort and legroom was as good as it gets in economy. Air Canada is a solid airline and (at least regionally) does not deserve their bad reputation.

Just finished my flight from EZE to YQB with Air Canada's two cabin 777. It was a wonderful flight. After the stop in Santiago the fresh crew took care of all details. Although SCL is not the best kitchen in AC's network the food was good. The service was efficient but not rushed. It allowed for the cabin to go in sleep mode fairly early on in the flight. I don't understand AC's decision to move away from the two class config pods. They are comfortable and for me 6'1 a welcome lie flat experience. Slept very well and woke up just in time for breakfast. Hats off for this 5 star crew! Seems to me AC is working hard on maintaining and potentially increasing their service standards.

Outbound Sydney to Vancouver (Sat March 14th) due to turbulence no tea of coffee - except that the flight was very smooth for the hours in which no tea / coffee could be served. Wed March 18th Vancouver to Sydney announced on take off that hot water machines not working so no tea/coffee for the 14 hour flight. I don't believe it! Service very poor. I almost wonder if staff are working to rule due to some kind of dispute. Went to the galley three times in the flight to serve myself some water. No one was offering.

### Air Canada customer review
Just flew from Seoul to Vancouver and then onwards to Los Angeles less than 24 hours ago. Flight was fine except that I'm not too sure if the four star rating is justified - I'd say its more like 3.5. Tried the 787 for the first time and I have to say that the lighting system is brilliant as it eases the level of brightness on the eyes whenever the light is turned on by going from dark to bright gradually. Another added bonus to flying with Air Canada is that it makes US entry easy since customs and immigration is cleared in Canada thus not having to deal with the debacle that is met at US airports. As for the in flight experience the food wasn't half bad but the seating and entertainment can see some improvements. The seats were not ergonomically designed and no matter what position I would turn my body I just couldn't manage to sleep due to the discomfort and entertainment although extensive did not have a decent selection of films to choose from.

Took my first 787 flight on Feb 27 from Beijing to Vancouver. Thoroughly enjoyable with great service. I prefer the new pods to the old type. Will be doing the same flight soon in Premium Economy which looks very inviting and I did try out the PE seats. I also checked the economy cabin and I am not about to experience it. On their downward spiral on customer comfort this is a high density cabin to be avoided. I am supportive of open skies as until there is some real competition in Canada on product and prices both AC and Westjet (which I no longer fly) will keep squeezing the passenger on everything.

Surprisingly decent flights from YWG-YYC-OGG. Flights on time from YWG delayed slightly from YYC-OGG. Air Canada 767-300er (non rouge) is a solid air craft. Surprised however that the crew did not offer a free meal on a 7 hour international flight. Passengers we're restless about that. Decent pitch for a guy who is 6"4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of "turbulence" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked "you know the seatbelt sign is on! Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary. This route for sure will be a rouge flight soon in which case avoid like the plague. But for standard AC mainline about as expected nothing wrong but a few things missing. Far superior to United service to Maui for example through Denver.

Last Sunday travelling as a legit full fare paying J class pax from LAX-YYZ-YWG. AC792 arrives late from LAX into YYZ but still there is an hour to connect to AC271 YYZ-YWG. Canada Customs press a magic button which allow my 2 checked bags to go directly to my connecting flight when I announce I am returning from a vacation in Hawaii. I proceed to my domestic gate to board AC271 and while in line am redirected by the gate agent to see her colleague at the gate desk. I am told I have been taken off the flight as my 2 checked bags won't make the flight? I am offered a Y class seat on the last flight of the night with a suggestion by the gate agent that the stars may align and I may get to ride in the cabin I paid for. Sent unceremoniously to the Maple Leaf lounge to await my fate I am granted access to the exclusive club even though I have now been stripped of my upper class status. Within an hour I am presented with a J class boarding pass for the last flight of the night to YWG. Was I bamboozled by my favourite mother country flag carrier giving away my original highly prized seat 1A on a Jungle jet back to Winnipeg on AC271? My 2 checked bags went through YYZ without me even seeing them and they were secured for travel from LAX-YYZ-YWG on company aircraft yet I was denied boarding AC271 based on the fact that my bags would not make the flight? Was I being punished for flying Delta from HNL-LAX in order to avoid flying Rouge? Or was my seat given away prematurely to a company commuter? Even when you pay full fare J class you have to role with the punches.

On Friday Feb 13 2015 my wife and I were to leave Boston for Toronto enroute to Tokyo to see family. Our plane was 45 minutes late arriving in Boston but were we reassured that making our connecting flights would not be an issue. After we boarded in Boston we sat for another 35 minutes before the plane left the gate. Needless to say we missed our connecting flight to Tokyo by 5 minutes. When we got to Toronto Pearson airport-which is the most unfriendly and confusing airport we have ever had the misfortune to be in-we got to our gate the plane was still there with the bridge still at the plane but we were told the gate was closed. After I informed them that if they could sit our plane for 35 minutes at the gate in Boston without moving then that would give us time to board our flight. We were rudely informed that that was not possible and were directed to go to customer service. Air Canada told us that they could not get us to Tokyo that day and that we would need to spend the night in Toronto. They paid for the room and some of our meals but the customer service was horrible. No attempts were made to book us with another airline as we have had happen in a similar situation in the past. Two years United screwed up and caused us to miss a flight to Hawaii but they bent over backwards and got us there only one hour later than our original time. Air Canada could take a few pointers from the competition. I will never fly Air Canada again and I will never fly into Toronto Pearson again. They both have much to learn about customer service.

Worst business class experience and not worth the money. The flight attendant was tired and made it quite clear to all of us in fact she actually expressed the fact. Passed the drink cart twice offered nuts and a bag of chips I asked for clamator and vodka got the clamato minus the vodka. Then she proceeded to sit where I could clearly see her reading a magazine and eating - very professional. When we were about an hour from destination the attendant got up and finally started breakfast prep then placed the cart in the middle of the cabin and started serving fruit plates 15 min later she served the hot breakfast not long after the descent started. Trays collected finally and still descending the coffee cups and juice glasses are still not picked up. This flight was not a business class experience and it will be some time before I take Air Canada business again.

Traveling Air Canada was the worst experience I have had. The agents were extremely rude and unhelpful in Toronto Pearson airport. Common courtesy seemed to have been an understatement. Flights were cancelled without proper notification leaving passengers stranded in the airport with no where to comfortably stay. Not sure if this is policy but agents were not required to assist with bag tagging leaving first time fliers lost and confused.

Booked to fly DCA to Quebec City via Ottawa Feb 13 leaving 7 am arriving 10.30 am. Instead after "crew rest" issues delayed the first flight ended up doing: DCA to Toronto where we missed our next connection due to delayed flight; and then the next flight was cancelled (no snow that day) and after much negotiation with bored reps (and a 1 hour hold with customer service) we ended up Toronto to Montreal where we were promised we could get to Quebec City but when we arrived they couldn't book us for 48 more hours to Quebec. Ended up renting a car in Montreal and driving to Quebec City where our bags were lost for another day. 3 hour process turned into 24 hours and we never arrived at our destination via Air Canada. Were promised flights that didn't exist no apologies. Never again.

ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada is by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with. I was forced to sit through a 8 hour flight from London to Toronto with no TV entertainment because their screen was faulty while other passengers around me had their TVs working. The staff on board thought offering me newspapers was a good alternative to not having TV entertainment which we all pay for as part of ticket costs! Its like asking me to eat carrots for 8 hours rather than giving me the solid meal I was told I would receive as part of the service. Unbelievable.

### Air Canada customer review
Planned to travel with Air Canada (Toronto to Ixtapa) on January 31st for a one week vacation in Mexico (given the short duration time was of the essence). Arrived at Pearson in good time and was advised the flight would be delayed 15 minutes (acceptable but just!). On arrival at departure gate loading of plane was initiated then minutes later an announcement that the loaded passengers would have to be deplaned as there as a maintenance issue (not a weather or staffing concern!). First observation: why does Air Canada insist on placing faulty equipment in the loading gate? Don't think it is too much to ask to have a functional plane ready and available to load at prescribed time! Worse the 'delay' (over the next six hours) lead to a flight cancellation at about 7pm. Many families with small children are then expected to deal with the development one that was obviously known hours earlier but not shared. Air Canada's behaviour in this regard is consistent - it would be only a common courtesy to advise on such matters - honestly and in a timely fashion - so passengers can make other arrangements. But no the airline drags the waiting times out until no other options are available. As a result a plane-load of angry passengers are at the 'customer service' desk to make alternate (hotel and air travel) arrangements only to learn that the staff there have not been advised of the situation. As a result more time is lost (almost an hour) as harried staff scramble to address the issue making other arrangements etc. without being prepared in advance for the onslaught with answers ready and alternate course of action determined! Again incredibly poor planning from this passengers perspective. Finally we were advised that we were scheduled on a flight the next morning and this one actually took off as scheduled and on time. Remarkably as for this passenger it was the first Air Canada flight (out of the most recent five flights flown with the airline) that was neither 'cancelled' or 'delayed' on departure (I reference flights between March 2014 and January 2015 in this regard: Denver SFO Nashville Miami and Ixtapa (1)). As a result my 'trust' in Air Canada is at an all-time low as they simply cannot be relied upon to reliably meet their contractual obligations. Worse no one seems to care about the stress and inconvenience caused by their unreliability. Wherever possible I would strongly suggest finding other airlines to utilize if and when possible.

Flew YYZ-YVR-NRT return. Very disappointing business class service really third rate compared to other international airlines such as Cathay Pacific or Singapore. Boarding the flight from Vancouver to Toronto was disorganized and there was no clear line for business class passengers had to speak up to get on the plane. Deboarding was just as bad and no priority deboarding for the business class passengers. The only reason I'd fly with Air Canada is my belief that they have well-trained pilots and well-maintained fleet. Again that could just be a perception and other Canadian carriers may have the same standards.

Business class from Vancouver to Seoul. Food quality was very good and flight attendants provided excellent service. Air Canada is obviously in tough competition on the Pacific routes from Asian airline competition and has improved the quality of its offering. Selection of movies could be improved though.

Flew on AC33 and AC34 both flights were fantastic. Sat in seat 19c on both legs of the trip and the extra legroom was worth the money Got to Sydney and back home safely and customer service was excellent. Will definitely fly with Air Canada again.

### Air Canada customer review
I fly Air Canada quite frequently for work between YVR (Vancouver) and YYC (Calgary). I switched over from WestJet after I had a bad experience of multiple late and delayed flights and I could not be happier! Flying with Air Canada in Canada is much better then flying with WestJet (from my own personal experience). I enjoy flying on the smaller ERJ 190s compared to a 737 on this route; less cramped and not as many people on board. I find that domestic check in with Air Canada moves quite smoothly with no real issues or problems. I have also noticed that Air Canada's prices are sometimes cheaper then WestJet (surprising I know). From my own personal experience I have to say the overall customer experience with Air Canada has improved quite a lot in the last number of years. Definitely recommend Air Canada on this route!

Recently I booked a flight through Airmiles from Phoenix to Vancouver BC and are supposed to return on Tuesday January 27th. My husband who flies hardly at all was appalled at the way everyone was crammed into the plane and he has refused to take the return flight back to Phoenix. We have booked another flight on WestJet at a cost of $740. I doubt if my husband will ever fly Air Canada again. We were not the only people complaining about the lack of leg room. I am sure if it weren't for AirMiles there wouldn't be anyone on these planes.

Flew AC015 from Toronto to Hong Kong. Prior to travel had to wait 25-35 minutes on long distance call to add special request. On board: They failed to provide the special meal. They were trying to blame it on me since I paid $120 for preferred seat. The flight attendant said she'll see what can be brought from Business class leftovers. They even failed at that so they brought me the side items of the meal (without the entree) which was awful. This was way too inferior to another European airline which I flew with last month. If that wasn't enough they ran out of water half way and at least one toilet got clogged. You couldn't wash your hands in the other ones! The Captain came on the speakers apologizing and explaining that the alternative would have been to land in USSR six hours ago but that they decided to carry on for many reasons. None was mentioned. Horrible experience overall. I'd avoid Air Canada on my future travels whenever I can.

### Air Canada customer review
Weather delayed Montreal to Toronto flight on 01/04/15. Air Canada did nothing to rebook missed connections for people. My husband spent 2 hours on hold finally got to speak with an agent and walked her through the booking process because he had already found a flight with an open seat she was amazed there was even a seat on the plane. He started the 3 hour drive to Minneapolis where the Toronto connection was bound. 2 hours later Air Canada cancelled the flight from Toronto to Minneapolis with no explanation - and it wasn't weather. Worse yet they made one or two garbled announcements and that was it. My wife and the elderly lady she tried to assist were finally told they could only leave the secured gate area with an escort through locked doors gee guess Air Canada gate agents should have mentioned this when they cancelled the flight and told everyone waiting they would have to leave the gate area. Rude gate agents no directions on what to do to rebook just left their stranded passengers to figure it out for themselves.

### Air Canada customer review
In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.

I flew from New York LaGuardia to Winnipeg via Toronto on December 22nd and return leg from Winnipeg to New York LaGuardia via Toronto was on January 9th. First check-in at LaGuardia was a nightmare long queues and no staff. Some of the customers complained to Air Canada agent and her reply was "you should be happy for what you have". Boarding was chaotic and plane departed 50 min late. On the way back boarding in Winnipeg took about 45 min because flight was full AC staff had to check in many bags into the hold of the aircraft. We departed 25 min late and arrived into Toronto 15 min behind the schedule. On the better note clean planes good legroom and awesome cabin crew who were attentive and kind to passengers. Checked in luggage arrived on the baggage belt within 15 min of our arrival.

### Air Canada customer review
Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable. In the event there is a problem and you need to contact someone be prepared to be put on hold for at least 1 hour. The last few times I have called 60 minutes was the quickest I was able speak to a human.

My wife was scheduled to fly from Montreal (YUL) to Toronto (YZZ) and then connecting to Minneapolis (MSP) on 01/04/15. Weather and de-icing delays kept passengers in the plane for over 3 hours waiting to depart from Montreal. She missed her connection in Toronto. Air Canada took no action during the 4 hour delay to rebook anyone who was going to miss their connecting flights. In the meantime AC's "customer service" number was continually busy. Stayed on hold for another 2 hours and finally got through to a booking agent. Got my wife rebooked for a later flight out of Toronto to MSP and wondered why this wasn't being handled internally by Air Canada. I notified my wife and she was able to check in and get to the gate in plenty of time for the later flight. I had a 3 hour drive to Minneapolis to pick her up. Just as I was getting on the interstate she text me saying that AC said there would be a slight delay but that it would be short. Halfway to Minneapolis I got another text saying that AC had cancelled the flight without explanation and were providing no assistance to stranded passengers. The gate agents were rude and simply told people they couldn't help them and that they would have to leave the gate area. What they failed to tell the stranded passengers was that they couldn't leave the secured area without assistance from AC or security. It was just by pure luck that my wife stopped an agent from another airline who explained that the passengers would need to be "let out" through a locked door so they could return to the ticketing area and start the entire process of booking a flight over again. Flights get delayed and cancelled that's just the way air travel has become. However Air Canada's total lack of regard for their passengers well being after a flight is cancelled was echoed by everyone flying Air Canada. The rudeness of the gate agents after the flight was cancelled and the empty promises of booking agents to assist stranded passengers was unparalleled. When the passengers were finally able to get to the ticketing area for Air Canada there were five queues with five functional computer terminals there were hundreds of people waiting in the five lines - but not a single Air Canada employee to be seen despite Air Canada's promises of assistance.

LHR to YYZ on 12 Dec. The flight was 4.5 hours late food was awful and then to top it off my luggage was left behind at LHR. Return trip was just as awful with the standard cramped seats and to top it off they messed up my meal (dietary requirements) not once but twice. The meal was given to the wrong passenger and when I spoke to the flight attendant all I got was an apology that they did not have anything else to offer. Then they repeat the mistake again during snack time. If it weren't for the virtual monopoly on the LHR-YYZ I would not be travelling with AC ever again.

I booked 3 full fare flights to Cabo San Lucas on line at aircanada.com. Air Canada changed my direct flight from Cabo to Toronto twice prior to my departure. The first change had me stopping in Houston for a layover and then on to Toronto. Clearly not what I paid for. Shortly after that flight was changed routing me through San Francisco on a 'red eye' that had me arriving home Monday morning at 5.55am. I was to arrive home on Sunday evening but finally arrived home on Tuesday morning at 10am after they had handed me off to United who simply overbooked my flight. I contacted Air Canada for assistance from Mexico three times but they simply weren't interested. I truly wish there was real competition in the Canadian Airline industry so that I could avoid Air Canada in the future.

YYZ to BGI return were both excellent flights. Attentive service great food snacks and lots to drink. The flight attendants were constantly replenishing whatever we were drinking. Flight to BGI was delayed two hours for de-icing but I just lay back on my fully flat bed. Coming home the weather was better so there were no delays. The lounges were good too as we enjoy the lattes at the Toronto lounge. The Barbados lounge is a bit more sparse but thankfully the air conditioning was not cranked up this time.

YYZ-FRA-YYZ Business Class outbound on Lufthansa 747 code share which was a joy of comfort pleasant personable and attentive crew and with excellent catering and wines and return on Air Canada 777-200 with a sullen senior crew who greeted any request as a seemingly huge imposition and who disappeared at every opportunity when not dishing out the insipid catering. How this airline gets four stars and boasts about it is beyond me.

Flew from Calgary to Narita before Christmas 2014 on a 767 economy. Food was horrible! Came back on a 787 to Vancouver. After 10 days in Japan I actually found the food on 787 to be good. Controls on the armrest are sensitive to the point of annoying. Slight elbow movement may trigger the entertainment screen to shut off or the overhead light to turn on or off. I usually put my carry-on with fragile stuff in front of me after seeing how they shove in the huge carry-ons with force. Should consider restricting the seat incline to a smaller angle. It's not fun have a seat in front of your face during a 10-hour flight.

YOW-DCA on an RJ. Seat 1A (single cabin). No lounge access in YOW for US-bound passengers but was allowed to go through security to the AC domestic lounge. Very nice lounge with great view of the airfield good drinks and food (salads soups rolls snacks). Check-in agent for US departures for Star Alliance gold could not have been nicer or more obliging phoning around to see if I could use the domestic lounge. Flight delayed about 50 mins due to late arrival of the aircraft. On board the one FA was very nice and efficient. Captain kept everyone updated.

### Air Canada customer review
Yesterday I flew from London to Toronto on a Boeing 767 which is basically a lovely plane. My complaints about this flight which apply to every Air Canada flight I've taken in the past few years are principally about: a) terribly uncomfortable seats and b) the lousiest food anywhere in the air. a) Seat comfort. Who on earth designs a seat that is so short that it puts unbearable pressure on the middle of the back of one's thighs? And this wasn't a Rouge flight either but a mainline experience. Why do they torture us with seats that are so close together that our knees are grinding against the seat in front? I'm a very average sized person - 5'10 and 170 pounds - so there is no excuse why the seat should not be comfortable. And let's not even mention the fact that the available tilt is about 4 inches from front to back with zero lumbar support. b) Long ago back in the 70's when I was a university student I used to wonder why the cafeteria food was so terrible when Air Canada could server a very decent meal at 35000 feet in a pressurized aluminium tube. In those days I routinely asked if they had any leftover meals on transatlantic flights because the food was actually quite enjoyable. Not any more. It's just awful. Virtually inedible except when one is starving. And yesterday's flight was the very worst. Recently I had the opportunity to fly to from and around Central America on the Colombian airline Avianca. Although the aircraft themselves weren't new the in-flight experience and especially the food was exceptional. The difference between the food service on Air Canada and Avianca is night and day. Avianca has delicious food and interesting menus served with a smile. Air Canada has heated cardboard served reasonably efficiently but without any enthusiasm by flight attendants in dowdy uniforms. I'll be looking for alternative carriers to Air Canada from now on. Among North American airlines Delta gets my vote at the moment.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew to the UK on a new "Dreamliner". Should be renamed a Squashliner. Air Canada has to be congratulated for cramming more seats into this aircraft than ever before. I paid a premium for the extra legroom seats behind business class. The aisle seat is placed right in the centre of the entry to the aisle of business class. This results in constant crashing of the food and beverage carts into the seat even though the new carts are narrower than those used on other aircraft. If the video screen which is in the armrest is used the situation is even worse. everybody trying to negotiate their way through the aircraft hits the screen. The crew were excellent and very aware of the problem of overcrowding on this aircraft. The 787 is a nice aircraft quiet but not comfortable in the Air Canada layout.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada continually disappoints. Their loyalty program is worthless unless you want to cash in your points for a flight with 3 connections and even then you still have to pay $500 in taxes and fees along with your points. Flew to Jamaica on AC Rouge as part of a vacation package. Worst plane ever nice flight attendants that had to deal with the airlines inability to properly stock food and beverage (they ran out of everything about a half way through the service so half the plane had nothing to eat). Both outgoing and return flights were an hour late in arriving. Other than some of their non Rouge planes being nice and the entertainment in those planes being pretty solid there is not much good to say about this overpriced airline and their ability to deliver flights on time and in a satisfactory manner.

### Air Canada customer review
Belfast - Montreal return. A rather unpleasant experience from start to finish. Best part of the trip was the flight to London only because that was on a codeshare flight with another airline. Air Canada flight from London to Halifax was on an old and dirty 767. Crew were rude and didn't have time for customers. Entertainment system dated and food was well below par of other airlines. Halifax to Montreal on a E175 and crew did bare minimum to pass their time onboard and again were just as unpleasant as the previous lot. My luggage got left in Halifax even though I had a 3 hour layover was reunited with my bags 2 days later with no apology offered when I returned to the airport to pick up lost luggage. Return flights were no better. Customer service and even customer interaction at the airport and on the aircraft isn't their strong point. I am heading back to Montreal in a few weeks time Air Canada are the cheapest but I have booked more expensive tickets via another airline so I can avoid flying Air Canada.

Our fight at YYZ was originally delayed 35 minutes. However when the plane never arrived it was bumped to a 1:25 minute delay. After everyone boarded the plane there was an additional 25 minute delay to upgrade the computer system with landing information about our destination. We were offered free $3 earphones for the inconvenience. I normally wouldn't write such a negative review based on one experience but this is after being silent for several similar past experiences.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew YVR - LHR - YVR in Executive first. The so called new suite on Air Canada's Boeing 777 on select routes only must be one of the worst business class seats ever designed. I was seated in 2D. When you first arrive at your seat you think that you have plenty of space. However once seated you soon feel very claustrophobic. The large arm rest on the left is made up by the very small armrest on the right which puts you very close to your neighbour. Just sitting normally ones left arm/hand naturally rests on the seat controls so without warning your seat starts moving. The tray table has a 3 phase deployment which could only be done by cabin crew. All passengers battled. Your seat can only be upright or flat with no in between settings. When flat the massage function on my seat would not turn off. It would only turn off when upright. When flat your feet go under the seat in front leaving no room to move your legs around. It's like laying in a coffin. There is no ground area for any luggage and no space for your duvet or pillow (which you are not allowed at your feet for take off / landing). All in all a very badly designed seat. I wasn't a great fan of the previous pod system but it is far better than this current design. I would rather have flown BA even with the backward facing seats. Service was good and the staff cannot be blamed for the tools they have been given to work with. I have had better comfort and sleep traveling in Economy.

This is the worst experience I've had I understand it's New Years and its busy which is why I think they should be a little more organized. I will never fly Air Canada and would never recommend it. We came at 3 am to check in for our 6am flight yes we don't get served. Still waiting while they take the Toronto flight. We have been standing and still standing here to check in our luggage. They have no customer services. We have a big group with boxes and carts. We have been told to go in 3 different lines since 2 hrs ago yet still waiting. I would never fly this airline ever again.

B787 AC004 NRT to YVR Dec 22nd 2014 seat 3G. Offered menu choices soon after take off by meal time we were informed that they had run out of the beef option. In Business class no less! My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class. I felt sorry for her as she was attentive a hard worker and did her best but had to comply with a restrictive mandate working for an airline that has a lot of room to improve.

Flew on AC 855 from LHR to YVR on December. 22 in economy. Crew attentive throughout flight. Lots of water juice and ice cream between meals. Lunch better than many offerings in other airlines' economy cabins. Wine quality well above average. Air Canada seem to have finally fixed their often faulty IFE system. Plenty of music and film choices though latest film selections could have been better. The downside? Like other airlines Air Canada has reconfigured economy seating with four seats now in the centre section. As a results seats and aisles are very narrow. Not too uncomfortable for a daytime flight but I'd find it impossible to sleep on an overnight flight.

Flew from Toronto to San Jose CR via Houston. Trying to leave YYZ Air Canada could not provide more than one person at the gate and then did not have a flight crew available. The delays were not notified in advance and we could not cancel hotel reservations. We missed connecting flight in Houston but were informed that United was holding flight for us. When we arrived at United counter they informed us that they told AC that flight was not held so we returned to AC counter only to find it closed. We then went looking for baggage and were told that the baggage was never included on flight out and then hung up on us. We have now spent five days waiting for baggage with no information provided to us or partner carriers very unusual. Typical response is apology with no further information or update nor return call of any sort. Complete incompetence exhibited by AC throughout this process and direct and outright lies in regards to continued correspondence with the firm. I will never fly with this airline again.

### Air Canada customer review
Service has deteriorated every year in the last 5 years. The staff at the airport representing Air Canada treat customers with disdain and do nothing to communicate delays etc. We are always left to guess about delays since no announcements are made. There is absolutely no courtesy shown towards regular customers. We are treated in a way that shows that our business is not valued at all. I only fly Air Canada because I have no choice where I live. I am happy WestJet will finally be providing service out of my local airport. At least then I will be able to experience some courtesy and satisfaction when I have to fly anywhere.

### Air Canada customer review
Decided a few years ago to commit to flying with Air Canada (live in Toronto) as I knew I would be traveling quite a bit to London for work and for consistency of booking and to take advantage of the loyalty program I wanted to stick with one airline. As a disclaimer for these flights I was not "overly" concerned about pricing but rather timing and comfort. That said I definitely wasn't willing to pay insane prices. In my opinion and for how I was traveling Air Canada has been by far the best airline I have traveled with (I have not flown airlines such as Emirates as they don't offer the routes I need but of course I have heard good things). There is no question that a direct AC flight to your destination might be more expensive than flying with another airline with one or 2 connections. If you are not too worried about spending more time traveling and in result save a few bucks - then go for it. That said where AC really shines is comfort and from my experiences service. The no. 1 reason I fly AC is comfort. In economy there is a good amount of leg room. If you disagree try flying United in row 30 and then report back. Secondly there is free in-flight entertainment in every seat. The flight from Heathrow to Toronto will fly by with a movie and some TV shows. Thirdly the first class cabin on the YYZ-LHR route was incredible. I am a light sleeper and also 6'2" and even with the decent economy seats in AC economy I still have trouble sleeping. As most of the YYZ to LHR flights are red-eyes and I need to be rested for meetings when I arrive - I often spent the extra money (or later on upgrade credits) to fly in business. I don't care if Emirates gives you a hot towel to exfoliate your face halfway through the flight what AC provided was a great lay-flat bed in a semi-private pod and I got a good 6 hours of sleep. It was invaluable. Where the true service came through was on the return. When getting a ride back to LHR there was crazy traffic on the M1. Airlines recommend arriving to LHR three hours before your flight. I arrived 45 mins before the flight. The AC staff were so helpful in getting me checked in and somehow got me on a golf cart and I was driven through the bowels of the airport escorted through security back on another golf cart that drove through random hallways passed luggage belts arriving right at the gate just before they closed the doors. Sure maybe some of that treatment was because I was booked in the first class cabin but I have had equally great experiences when booked in economy.

From start to finish my experience of Air Canada was one I don't want to repeat unfortunately. From them changing planes and not notifying me so the exit row seat I'd paid for to accommodate my 6ft 5 son was no longer available to the poor quality food on the plane (the vegetarian tea time snack consisted of a banana plum and Satsuma) and the functional but not welcoming staff and the very narrow seat on the 787 all in all a very disappointing experience. The only plus points I could find were the online check in and bag drop and the entertainment system on the 787.I would best describe Air Canada as a transatlantic budget airline but maybe I've been spoilt by travelling with far superior airlines in economy class in the past.

Just flew Paris-Montreal round trip for work in economy on 777-300ERs (both ways). Really excellent entertainment system had a plug for my laptop in the seat and very friendly and helpful cabin crew. Not much they could do about the continuous turbulence on the way back which forced us to stay buckled up all the way but handled it with good humour. Two thumbs up!

### Air Canada customer review
We recently tried to book a flight from Halifax to Orlando with Air Canada. Unfortunately all suitable flights were showing Rouge as the operator. We had recently had a very bad experience with Rouge due to the minimal seat space and no padding in the seats. We refused to even consider a Rouge seat. We seriously considered driving to Orlando until CAA found us direct flights with WestJet. Much more attractive than Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
London Heathrow to Vancouver via Toronto. Was looking forward to trying the 787 Dreamliner. Well what a disappointment. Firstly Air Canada somehow managed to offload us from the flight in London and this was only realised when they scanned our boarding cards at the gate. In the meantime Air Canada had sold our assigned seats to someone else and after much stress we were eventually given seats right at the back of the plane. No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold. Again more seating changes for us and we were now seated in economy middle aisle instead of Premium Economy. Overall a totally unpleasant experience made more stressful by Air Canada at every stage. I don't need this when I fly and will now take my business elsewhere.

On Dec 6th our scheduled flight from Vancouver to Nanaimo took off as planned. We had been informed that Nanaimo Airport has a critical density of fog but that they would try to get everybody across. The landing could not be done due to the fog so they flew us back to Vancouver. By that time it was close to midnight. All passengers were asked to go to a nearby service desk. Every single party received a voucher for the Fairmont Airport Hotel and everybody was re-booked for the first flight to Nanaimo the next morning. Very smooth! Very generous!

Travelled on flight AC034 Sydney to Vancouver on October 14 the staff were not very friendly or happy. Moving around or using the bathroom was very difficult as the seat belt signs were kept on for most of the flight even when the conditions weren't turbulent. Some of the staff were rude and unhelpful.

Travelled on flight AC033 Vancouver to Sydney on October 31. Again staff were rude and unhelpful. Inflight entertainment did not work in our row of seats for entire flight - 16 hours is a long time to listen to aircraft noise and read a book. Seat belt sign again used to excess and it did mean that tea and coffee were never served as no hot beverages when seat belt sign is on. Staff kept one toilet for their own use by claiming it was 'out of order'. One member of staff was extremely rude and loud actually shouting instructions at passengers. Would not fly internationally with Air Canada again.

LHR-YYZ YYZ-YOW YOW-YYC YYC-YYZ YYZ-LHR. Each flight was fantastic. The long haul flights were flown on the 777-300 with the standard Executive Pods they are a favourite of mine. The food was fantastic on all the flights Air Canada has recently started a "room service" style breakfast on flights to Europe. You get an order card and tick off everything you want at night before you go to bed and in the morning have it delivered at your chosen time. Great new idea. Staff onboard were fantastic as usual. Can't wait for my next trip!

### Air Canada customer review
I was flying Ft. Lauderdale to Toronto. I paid a full fare economy ticket and paid for a "priority seat". I want to know what is so priority about it as they make you board the flight last as it is in the front of the plane. All other airlines give you priority access when you pay extra for your seat assignment. Would have been better off picking row 30 for free.

AC flight 85 YYZ-TLV in business. The flight was flawless service was excellent food was good to excellent. The AC 787 is an amazing product well designed and comfortable. Missing overhead bins in the center above rows 4 and 5 made for a few uncomfortable minutes as we boarded - flight attendants should anticipate this and be available to help. The seat is excellent long enough and wide enough. Yes the foot well is narrow but I got comfortable and slept deeply for 4 hours (same issue on Swiss United ANA). The pillow and comforter are far better than those offered by United Swiss Lufthansa. The adjustable cushions make it the best Business seat I have experienced. Topping it all off is the 18" screen along with a well designed hand controller with its own fully functional LCD touch screen.

### Air Canada customer review
Economy flight to London on the Dreamliner was the worst ever. To leave at 11.50 pm boarded at 12.One hour delay while computer is programmed for Heathrow then 30 minute delay because of shift change. New seat cut off circulation in the back of my legs and I had the sensation of being crammed in to make more money. The entertainment centre controls are in the arm rest right where one would put their elbow. All night the passenger beside me was turning on and off his and my system and overhead lights. If I put my elbow on the arm rest I would do the same to the passenger beside me. Try sitting for 8 hours with no place to put your arms and light flashing on and off as you tried to sleep. Needless to say there was no baggage for my connecting flight to Lisbon. Don't fly the Dreamliner.

Frankfurt to Toronto and Toronto to Halifax 20 November 2014. Lufthansa from Bremen to Frankfurt to start the trip check in very efficient flight on time and efficient. Frankfurt airport needs to have better internal direction for connecting passengers. AC flights on time service efficient and as expected in economy meals ok for economy. Cabin staff were pleasant and efficient nice to see a difference here to some previous flights. Overall price and value for money no complaints.

YYC to YXE. I politely asked the check in personal at Calgary a basic question about baggage fees and received a very defensive rude response. Customer service does not appear to be much of a priority. Flight attendant was not particularly friendly and had minimal interaction with passengers. I find the overall experience much more efficient on Westjet and they're fleet is newer too.

### Air Canada customer review
YVR to NRT. First off you can fly YVR to Haneda on ANA. I recommend that route. Narita is such a hassle even on the "direct" NEX train it takes an hour into Tokyo and that is after the long haul flight after Customs after waiting for a train before you transfer again in Tokyo or even if your hotel is near a station make the 900 meter walk out of Tokyo Central or Shinagawa. (I am not exaggerating. The time it takes to wheel your luggage from the NEX at Central to the lobby at the Shangri-La is nearly 20 minutes and that's when the station is relatively quiet.) AC was using an older aircraft on this route and it wasn't really too noticeable until we flew back on something much better (Cathay). The biz config in AC with their very comfortable if a tad firm lie flat seats afford privacy and ensure a good rest. The AV system is good although the screens aren't too big. Crew was extremely attentive and very friendly. One even had a sense of humour! The first meal was half decent quite good. The second a breakfast was mediocre. I find the "second" meal on AC long haul flights is always a letdown. The wine on AC could be better. On Cathay they were serving better champagne a wonderful Saint Veran a superb Gruner Vetliner and a lot of other wines that had obviously been tested at 39000 feet. Most AC wines just don't make the cut at the altitude. This was a points flight but if I was paying I would definitely choose ANA.

### Air Canada customer review
Toronto to London - I booked 3 seats and had them pre-assigned so we could all sit together. This was confirmed and the seats allocated. When I arrived at the plane the crew had split our seats up and would not change other seating so we could sit together. My 4 year old was initially sat alone next to a stranger. The result was that I could not go to the bathroom with my son without leaving my baby. I could not change my baby without leaving my son alone - my wife was 30 odd rows away. The stewardesses would not help us get food from bags (which were all with my wife because we were meant to be sat together). When I complained through customer relations I was told that it is always challenging travelling with children. They let us down at every stage of our journey and ruined our trip home.

### Air Canada customer review
A lot of anticipation on flying the AC Dreamliner - a large spacious quiet aircraft that just eases the flight hours away - not - Air Canada decided to put in very small aisles tiny uncomfortable seats and an entertainment system that doesn't tilt. I'm 5'4" and 135 pounds so if I can't fit in a seat - something is drastically wrong! And I couldn't get comfortable - the flights to/from Europe were each 12 hours of misery. How greedy could AC be as to try to fit in that many seats? The plane is already super-efficient - so having an aisle seat is awful - you will constantly get your elbows arms and feet banged by the flight attendants. Add to that - the washrooms are so small I couldn't even fit in. And the toilet seats refuse to stay up! Come on AC adding a slow-release toilet seat would cost you nothing!

### Air Canada customer review
I recently travelled on AC from Vancouver to Heathrow and back. I had a premium economy seat booked on the outbound leg and an economy seat for the return but had purchased a preferred seat. I upgraded to business class on both legs on check in for $900 on the way out and 900 Pounds on the way back! AC have managed to hide their business check-in at YVR and LHR I had to ask both times where it was. At YVR its basically in the Domestic check- in section of the airport. The check-in agent mentioned that I had a good seat (4A) which is a single seat by itself. My heart sank a little when she mentioned that the aircraft had a 'high density' configuration. Airline speak for a plane where they have crammed in more seats. Onboard I found the new business seating terrible clearly designed for short narrow people. Once the seat is in lay flat mode your legs go into a narrow gap under the seat in front of you. I'm 6' and 230lbs and had a few centimetres of room to the side and above before my lower legs were hitting the sides of the available space. The seat feels narrower than before making the whole thing coffin like. The pods were much better and offered more privacy. This particular seat had excessively large armrests some of that space would have been better used to widen the seat. Where the seat controls are positioned you will hit them when you use the armrests in the regular fashion causing the seat to move when you don't want it to. When I mentioned to one of the cabin crew about the seat comfort he said "I know we're ripping them out'. Clearly gone are the days of the $600 or less last minute upgrade to business. I don't think that the new charges justify what you get. Otherwise the staff were friendly enough the food was ok and the cabin was too hot. If you happen to do an upgrade to business from economy and paid for an economy cabin preferred seat email them to get your $90 back otherwise you wont get it. Finally I had a look behind the curtain at Premium Economy certainly didn't look like the pictures on the AC website which gives the impression that its somewhat separate from regular economy it isn't. Although I make an internal connection within the UK from Heathrow I will be giving KLM a try next time to Amsterdam where onward connections are still good. Their business upgrades are typically $500.

### Air Canada customer review
Problem with Air Canada was that Air NZ was our main carrier and they use Air Canada for the YYZ/LA and LA/YYZ leg at end. What a contrast - a first class carrier and a no frills one. All Air NZ flights treated passengers as if they were valued and always gave them something (even a 75 min flight got wine and cheese). A 5hr one with AC got you a cup of lukewarm coffee. ANZ staff chatted and joked with customers. Air Canada's just went through the motions. It really felt like a "bus run". It was was so disappointing to see how far Canada's national carrier has sunk. I will avoid them at all costs in the future - too bad ANZ doesn't fly everywhere from Canada.

Vancouver-Beijing in Business Class. Plane had the older pod seats which are comfortable but starting to show their age and could use some touch-up. Outstanding crew with every member very friendly and professional along with superior catering and generous amounts of good wines. Lights dimmed perhaps a bit quickly to encourage us to go to sleep but on the whole a much better business class experience than most other airlines.

AC 25 YVR-PVG return. Had the privilege to fly the AC brand new Dreamliner. Gentile lighting changes dimmable windows comfy seats and less noise. The flight crew is composed of English-French and English-Mandarin staff. Most of the crew were very pleasant. Drinks and foods were served on time extras were given upon request. Water was served periodically during sleep time. Although I never watch any movies on flights I did go through their collection. I must say the number of titles in stock was massive. You'd be more than satisfied if you enjoy IFE on long hauls. Another thing I've noticed is that travelers get updates from the pilots before taking off and landing and I don't see this happening for other Asian carriers. This is a feature some people enjoy and it is also an annoyance for some other people.

### Air Canada customer review
A return flight from Vancouver to Heathrow was very disappointing in many ways. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. During the long overnight flight the cabin was ridiculously and uncomfortably warm making sleep difficult there was an unsettled noisy baby on board to whose parents the flight crew offered no help and due to the stupid design of the seats incorporating lights and volume controls in the top of the arm rests it was quite impossible to rest ones arms or support oneself on these armrests. The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked. Fortunately BA did sort out the mess without any assistance from Air Canada who had gone incommunicado and would not answer calls. We were fortunate that we were able to complete our journey that day. I am not certain all our fellow abandoned passengers were so lucky. I am afraid I could never trust Air Canada in the future.

Today I was on a connecting flight with Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver through Toronto. The flight to Toronto was delayed and I asked whether I would be able to make the connection which I was assured I would. On landing in Toronto I made it to my connecting gate 20 minutes before takeoff and they had already removed me from the flight. Colleagues who arrived at the gate behind me were not removed from the flight. The explanation from customer service was that they were in business class and I was flying economy. Needless to say the flight I was on and made the connection to was now full as was the next flight making me late for a meeting this evening.

Toronto to Fort Lauderdale on October 27 with October 28 return. All flights on time. Aircraft clean and attendants do their job. Several water runs in addition to the usual beverage service. IFE quite decent. Not sure why Air Canada typically assigns a middle seat hoping to coerce you into buying an upgraded better seat. Seems a bit petty but despite the hoards of negative reviews I'm quite satisfied with Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
I traveled in economy from Paris to Montreal in October 2014. The overall experience was not too bad but the main negative point is the very poor quality of the food onboard. It is impossible to eat what they serve. Better to take your own food if you travel with Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
AC through its contract partner Sky Regional YUL-YTZ (RT DH4 service). Although the equipment is old and the seating is cramped the overall flight experience was good. Advance check-in eliminated the hassle of YUL check-in and aside from a change in gate at departure everything went smoothly. Changing my departure on the return was easily done at the airport by a pleasant agent. I used the MLL in YUL courtesy of my Elite status. Although the lounge was crowded I was surprised by the improved range of food available. The MLL agent was polite and smiling (in the past they have been grouchy). Significant improvement at the YUL MLL in the last year. The departure area at YTZ is shared with Porter and is run down shabby and crowded. Both flights were nearly on time despite weather conditions. This was my first use of AC at YTZ in many years as I have been a loyal client of Porter. I gave AC a try because of my displeasure with my past Porter flights specifically the deterioration in service and on time performance. AC is just as good if not better than Porter on this route and with my FF status the AC experience was superior overall. AC is excellent when there are no IROPS no baggage and it is a short haul flight.

I've flown AC before but luckily with folks that work with the airline thus a very favorable fare (tax only). Our most recent trip to Europe included a one-way flight from YVR to LAX for a 3-day layover for some fun in the sun. We asked to be moved up to an earlier flight as we were meeting some friends in LA so I contacted AC reservations three times and got three different stories. I decided to go to the airport the day off early and asked where I could change my flight. This is where the unfriendly cold staff interactions begin. When I asked where I could go to change my booking the lady proceeded to hold up a finger telling me to pause while she scrutinized carry on bag sizes for passengers then when she "had a moment" pointed in the general direction of a service desk and said "there!". A short walk and 10 minute wait in the line led me to another miserable lady who told me I should be in the international terminal since I'm flying to LA but in this case "she'd make an exception". I proceeded to ask her if there were two different operating companies for domestic versus US flights knowing the answer. The lady gave a short and concise "no" response and proceeded to tap away at her computer for minutes without looking up or saying a word. Her next words were to give me the outrageous "change fee" costs which I paid to get the ordeal over with. When I asked about the policy change she said didn't give any explanation other than "that's the way it is now. Inflight the staff were even worse. We flew on a "Rouge" flight which I guess is their budget full-staffed sub. Long story short the worst airline I've flown! From their front-end service staff to in-flight crew all around miserable people. I'm never flying with them again. Lets put it this way my wife and I were almost stuck in Europe during the Lufthansa strike and we feared having to travel on an Air Canada flight back home.

Air Canada have either revamped or replaced their 777s and they are now 3x4x3. I was stuck with a large woman next to me a seat leg directly in front of where my feet needed to go and the leg had an entertainment control box on either side of it in effect requiring me to have no legs as there was nowhere to put my feet. If I had been a 6 foot+ man I would have been miserable. The new leather seats are harder than the old ones and are very uncomfortable. The screen can no longer be angled. The service was the one thing which has not changed it was as dreadful as it has always been. We will after 25 years of flying with AC be looking for a new carrier. The two 9 hour+ flights were pure misery.

Our supposed 7 days in Ireland turned into 5 due to the inept staff at Air Canada. Connection was late and missed our direct flight to Dublin which was oversold for the next night - after 7 hours in Toronto the next day we then flew to Frankfurt for another 7 hour layover before finally reaching Dublin 2 days late. The Tampa-Toronto flight was held on the tarmac in Toronto 20 minutes as there was no gate crew and the flight attendants did not allow connecting passengers off the plane first then customs closed. Air Canada booking agents "forgot" to rebook my husband and I on the direct flight resulting in the Frankfurt layover - inept. Return - same issue missed our connection in Toronto to Tampa had to fly 4 hours later to Orlando at midnight and rent a car to drive home. Will never fly Air Canada again!

Avoid Air Canada AC875 and other flights to/from Europe if you are taller than 5' 9" and don't want to harm your knees and suffer from leg cramps after your flight. There is absolutely no space between your knees and the seat in front of you. When the person in front of you reclines you will get trapped in your seat. Worst of all the staff will treat you as the problem for being too tall. I know that I will never fly them again. Lufthansa and Air France offer much better alternatives. I have flown to Europe with these carriers and had more leg room with better meals as an added bonus.

### Air Canada customer review
AC 1173 to Vancouver on October 12 and returned to Toronto on AC 152 October 19. It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job. Appropriate training and supervision is definitely in order.

I was very disappointed with the airline. On my way to the airport I got a text saying my connecting flight was cancelled and they had to re-route us. I was to arrive at my destination at 0930 in the morning and didn't get there until 5 in the evening. I had a 2 hour wait in one airport and a 3 hour wait in another. This was not acceptable to me as I was travelling with my husband who is a dialysis patient and had meds with him that had to be kept cold also my 75 year old mother who has problems walking. Not once did we get an apology or even a food voucher to eat. Thankfully we were only travelling from Deer Lake to Toronto - usually a 2.5 hour flight but took us 11 hours. Very disappointed.

### Air Canada customer review
Having had two bad experiences with Air Canada I will never fly with them again. First issue: Booked to depart Vancouver at 0800 on 1 Aug 14 on a flight to Toronto we arrived at the airport early. Checked our bags and got our boarding passes however on the boarding pass it did not have a seat allocation but indicated that this would be done at the gate no problem. As we had cleared security and it was now only 0620 we casually got a coffee and wandered up to the gate. On arrival at the gate my wife went to the desk to get our seat allocation only to be berated by the desk person who told her they had been paging us we didn't hear anything. He then informed her that our flight was boarding. We said that our flight wasn't until 0800 he then told us that our original flight was delayed until 1000 and we had been placed on the one now departing. Obviously had we not arrived early we would have been waiting around until 1000. All well and good but why weren't we informed of the change when we check in? Arriving early in Toronto messed with our booked transport which caused a few anxious moments and we had to get a taxi however thanks to Viator we got a refund on our transport booking. Second issue: The next flight was from Toronto to Seattle (E90) 3 Aug 14. On this fight the cabin crew showed a complete disregard for the comfort of the passengers. We were seated in the second last row of seats and were very conscious of people using the toilet no problem. However the flight had a number of turbulence issues and at one stage the line up for the toilet was half way up the cabin. On a number of occasions people asked if they could use the toilet at the front of the aircraft and this was denied. It did not help matters with the seatbelt sign going on and off. At one stage a young girl who had been waiting a long time got to the front of the line only to be told to go back and put her shoes on. I have never been told to put my shoes on. Anyway all that said I will never fly Air Canada again. The first impression is always the best and lasting impression.

I travelled from London Heathrow to Calgary return. Check in was speedy. There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it. Next time I will try Canadian Affair (charter) Premium Economy. This was a leisure trip so expense was very important as I was paying! If Economy is well priced on Air Canada it may be worth it but not Business Class.

Myself and my wife along with a 3 year old we took a flight from Toronto - Vancouver. Staff were very rude at check-in at the boarding gate as well as on the flight itself. I requested a pillow and a blanket for my son who was very sleepy as we had transited from UK the air crew rudely said to me that we have to pay for it I didn't mind paying but it is something unheard of. I travel so often but never asked to pay for these things even in the cheapest airlines in Europe like Ryanair EasyJet etc. I will never recommend Air Canada to anyone and will never fly with them again in the future. This doesn't seem like a star alliance to me. Worst by all means.

Flew back from Paris to Toronto 4 Oct does Air Canada actually have anybody checking "hand luggage" an amazing amount hand luggage seen going onboard aircraft. By the time we were boarded all the luggage bins were full of large suitcases. This has happened a number of times now. Tired of struggling to load our small bags and will now try another airline that actually enforces hand baggage size. Would help if Air Canada thought about all customers rather than ignoring an obvious problem.

Arrived at Halifax Airport on Saturday morning 04.30 for our family trip to Cancun. Check in was slow with only one attendant taking her time. After scanning our passports the Air Canada attendant told us that because my husband and son has the same first names it causes problems for their system. She was very rude about the whole situation! Arrived in Toronto where the attendants were more professional and friendly. Inflight was uncomfortable and tight which can be expected with economy class. Overall flights were OK but we will avoid flying Air Canada again.

B777-300 Vancouver-London Heathrow 2 Sep 2014. The new business class seat is terrible - narrow short ridiculously sized and shaped. It's okay as a seat but I paid for a good night's sleep. Forget it! I'm 6ft 4 and when the seat turns into a bed it slides the lower half of your body into a tiny plastic coffin-like box with no room to move your legs at all. It wasn't long enough for me - so it wasn't humanly possible to lie down! As a result I arrived at LHR tired and irritable lacking the sleep I had needed and paid for. The cabin crew were brilliant but they told me that a lot of other business class passengers had complained about this new seat. It's also difficult to get the seat back up again from a thr "bed". My seat 2A on C-FIVO was also missing a flexible reading light. It is a reasonably new aircraft so why on earth was that missing? Basically Air Canada has decided to shove more seats in every class onto this aircraft at the expense of comfort and space and every passenger is short-changed as a result. The B777-300ER that normally takes 359 passengers is being converted to 458 passengers - mine was one of them. The passenger loses. I have read that it is a plan to reduce cost per seat by 15%. It is a total disgrace - avoid this aircraft at all costs. Air Canada used to be a great airline but it is heading downhill. If this is the way Air Canada is going then it's time to change airlines folks.

Visited 8 cities in 15 days and ended with São Paulo to Toronto (AC91) which was my only flight on AC. Bit of a bumpy ride with tight seats but the staff and entertainment more than made up for it. Staff made sure we all were totally taken care of offering all drinks food items and water at all hours! They also had to take care of a serious health issue with one of the passengers and ensured the rest of us were well taken care of. Entertainment was great! Could chose own movies and had no glitches! Best staff ever had on any flight! Will be flying AC again!

Over priced by a long shot. Due to the protection they get from the government they feel that it is their right to charge 1/3 more for flights. They claim that they will match competition pricing and actually publish on their site that they will but refuse to do so when approached. Online and phone reservation staff are confrontational and rude. Would not recommend them.

AC 88036 YYZ to PIT Dash 8. Plane ride was uneventful your standard economy seating. Inflight service - pretzels and a drink (soft drinks and juice free).

### Air Canada customer review
I assumed that a large country like Canada would be a safe bet for my trip to New York. On the way out staff were a slow and unhelpful but our main complaint was the food - we boarded at 12 so assumed lunch would be provided instead a 'light snack' was served at 2.30 and there was no meat option because they had already run out. Before landing we were served another 'light snack' which was the smallest wrap I have seen. On the way home our flight was delayed at LGA for over an hour with barely any communication until we could board. Onboard my sister asked the attendant if we would make our connection - he looked at our ticket and said probably not without any sympathy or conciliatory expression. When he gave us immigration cards my sister told him we didn't need them as we were only transferring. He said "you might if you have to stay overnight in Canada" - a possibility that had not yet been suggested to us and which was delivered in an incredibly flippant way considering we had told him we had important work engagements we needed to keep the next morning. When we got to Montreal we rushed to the connections gate where Air Canada staff who were supposed to guide us told us the plane wasn't waiting for us despite there still being time to make it. The rest of the evening was spent walking from end to end of the airport as Air Canada staff constantly referred you to different colleagues for help. In the end we had to stay overnight in Montreal wake up at 3 to fly back to Toronto and then on to New York arriving in London 12 hours after planned. Even based on the first outward flight we know we will never fly with Air Canada again.

5/9/2014 LHR to Vancouver AC855. 23/9/2014 Vancouver to LHR AC854. For Economy the leg room was OK compared to other airlines albeit still cramped. The staff were friendly and helpful. Entertainment system also OK. But the food! It is simply the worst quality I have ever encountered on a long haul flight and was so bad that I bought food from Subway in the airport to eat on the return flight. That turned out to be the right decision considering the quality on the return flight was as bad as on the outgoing flight. Simply not acceptable on a long haul flight and for that reason alone I will not fly Air Canada again.

Seattle to Toronto on AC542. Nice and relaxed flight just a bit late because of the traffic congestion on the Seattle airport at the time of departure. E190 cabin light and fresh seating way better that on a larger types of aircraft. Flight attendants professional and friendly. Good inflight entertainment a large selection of Canadian movies including documentaries and short ones which is really nice.

Flew from Honolulu to Vancouver economy class. Ground staff were helpful and reasonably friendly. The plane was a 767-300 and the seat was very uncomfortable as the padding in the middle of the seat had vanished over the years. The four stewardesses in my area must have been 60ish and not up to speed. One stewardess asked a passenger to get out of his seat and close the overhead bin as she had a bad back. Knowing that Air Canada did not serve meals domestically I checked online about international flights and it said that meals were served. None provided. During the flight I was offered a decent beverage twice and a couple of times the stewardess came by with a tacky plastic jug and served lukewarm water. I travel to and from Asia quite often and have never experienced such poor service on any other airline. I will absolutely go out of my way to avoid flying Air Canada again.

Montreal YUL to Boston BOS on Air Canada Express CRJ100. Checked in online but still needed to use airport machines to print boarding cards and luggage tags assisted by pleasant AC staff. With this small aircraft you have to leave cabin cases at the door and they are returned to you on landing although there were the usual few passengers who decided this reasonable rule did not apply to them. Announcements in the air virtually inaudible because the FA held the microphone too close to her mouth and then shouted into it - training issue here. Drink and snack served on this short flight. Being a small aircraft it twitches a bit in flight so nervous flyers should be aware. Flight left 10 mins late but still arrived 20 mins early in Boston.

Quebec YUB to Toronto YYZ on Air Canada Express Q400. First time in a Q400 and what a horrible aircraft! Noisy rattly and with a constant vibration through the seats this 100 min flight was about as much as I could take. Air Canada staff were pleasant and efficient both in the air and on the ground although the boarding official was a bit sniffy when he found we were not business class passengers (in an all-economy aircraft!) and the flight left slightly late but arrived 30 mins early. Good service from AC but I will try to avoid that aircraft in future.

Booked Air Canada for a family vacation to Greece. Going there we dealt with rude staff. We brushed it off and believed it was just a bad day for them. Our return flight was no better. The flight back was from Athens Greece to Montreal and then Toronto. The sad thing was instead of returning home to Toronto on Saturday 4.30pm as our tickets stated we had the privilege of being bumped off our flight and sleeping at the Montreal airport with my 12 year old son and husband. No explanation was given except for "sorry this flight is overbooked". We had assigned seats and everything so how does this happen?? Apparently there was no hotel available that night either so it was a very rough night. I emailed customer service and still have had no reply.

The worst long haul airline and I travel a lot but I am doomed and have been for last 15 years as it is the only direct connection between London UK and Halifax Nova Scotia. The price is outrageous the service is generally poor (even in business I don't find it super friendly) and it is the only long haul airline where I have to bring my own food when I fly economy. Also completely inefficient and useless systems if you want to book an end to end flight using different members of Star Alliance for different legs of the flight (if not in the same class). Every time I have to deal with them I have to grit my teeth.

AC034 20 September. Just got off a 14 hour flight from Sydney and thought the crew was excellent. They were attentive continued cabin presence and friendly. I also thought the seat (even though a little warn) was better than other airlines like Malaysia Airlines A330. Very pleased with everything and well worth the price. Definitely a 7.5 out of 10.

### Air Canada customer review
Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.

### Air Canada customer review
We recently returned from New York La Guardia airport to London Heathrow. Our first flight was delayed which meant we missed our connecting flight to London. Both my sister and I missed several appointments - work for myself and registration for her PhD and meetings for my sister. It was also my sister's 25th birthday which is an extra detail but made the subsequent experience much worse to take. Our return flight included a connection at Montreal - the plane from New York was delayed and from the offset the staff on the plane were incredibly rude disengaged and unhelpful when we asked for advice and reassurance. The whole process was terribly managed - we arrived at the boarding gate in time to see our plane pull away from the gate - some better communications and we definitely could have boarded that flight with a five minute delay for the other passengers at most. We were then sent around the airport with cursory explanations and a lack of basic guidance - for example no one explained there was a shuttle bus to the hotel or even pointed us in the right direction. There was a lack of staff in the airport due to it being a bit later in the evening and we felt completely unguided in the process. I was stunned that a customer-focused service could have such a poor grasp of good communications and moreover just didn't seem to care about it's customers as well. We arrived in London 12 hours after our scheduled arrival time. Overall the process was poor in itself - bad food stingy amounts. When my sister asked if we would be served another meal the attendant smirked and said 'You could loosely call it a meal'. I'd never fly with Air Canada again.

Flying from London Heathrow to Kingston Ontario is a tiring trip at the best of times flight delays on both legs due to “the late arrival of the aircraft from its previous destination” only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston.

### Air Canada customer review
Over the last two years we have taken 31 flights. Of those flights 11 were on Air Canada and on 8 of those 11 there were either delays of more than two hours or cancellations. My most recent was on Air Canada YVR to YEG - the flight was cancelled and it created a great deal of confusion for Air Canada. First they would let us know about putting on other flights in 15 minutes half an hour later they were still confused and lost. They said they would give a lunch voucher but couldn't get them to print and that took 45 minutes. Finally a lunch voucher that would buy an airport pre-made airport sandwich. Back after lunch and sched on flight in another hour (now 2.5 hours later). This is very typical or even quite good service for this airline. Food and beverages - if you like a mini bag of pretzels and some juice or water or coffee then great. I only travel Air Canada when absolutely necessary.

Toronto - Tel Aviv - Toronto B787 Dreamliner. Executive First. Aircraft is superb and is now my favoured choice over the B777. Innovative numerous improvements in passenger comfort and convenience. Cabin staff really proud of the aircraft and it shows in their service. Flights left on time and arrived early. Concierge at Tel Aviv personally accompanied me to my seat (a first). Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience on both flights. A thumbs up to a great new aircraft and a motivated and delightful crew.

### Air Canada customer review
I am a Star Alliance Gold Card holder and fly business class frequently. I just returned from a trip to Thailand and flew the Vancouver to Hong Kong leg (return) business class in their newly configured 777-300 series aircraft. The new business class seating arrangement on this aircraft is an unmitigated disaster. Where do I begin! It is primarily a 2-2-2 layout with 3 rows being 1-2-1. This single seat is only available to AC super elite members. So AC has decided that any other full fare business class travelers on this aircraft are not entitled to a single seat. Ridiculous. The tight seats are far too firm and narrow footwells make it impossible to properly stretch out and have a relaxing sleep. There is no storage area and materials used are cheap and do not even belong in a Premium Economy section. Window passengers do not have a clear access to the aisle. You have to climb over the other passenger. This is unacceptable in a business class in today's airline industry! I browsed through the Duty Free Magazine located in the seat pocket in front of each seat and asked the Flight Attendant if I could order something. She advised me that the configuration of this aircraft did not permit any duty free sales on board. No duty free on board when there is a duty free magazine located in every seat pocket! I will never fly on this aircraft again and my frequent flights to Asia will be on other Star Alliance carriers which are improving their business class product not reducing it to cattle car status such as AC.

Flew LHR to Vancouver Premium Economy on newish plane with different layout premium economy is no longer separated by a bulkhead and curtain so we had to put up with kids running up and down the aisles and noise. On top of this they messed up on our return flight from Calgary. No premium economy available so we chose the front two seats in economy they changed the plane last May didn't tell us so we lost the seats after a few calls to the call centre in India they refunded the charge for the so called premium seats but it's not a money issue we wanted the seats. Arrive at the airport and now we have to pay $70 for our third case that was FOC on the way out. We explained we would have booked it if we could but no joy they charged us. The only way to complain is to write to them apparently which we will for sure. Based on these issues I wouldn't recommend this airline.

On 14th Sept flew Air Canada express - Saskatoon to Vancouver on AC Express. Excellent service by flight attendants. The plane is starting to show its age. We then flew AC 47 to Honolulu. Here again the aircraft is showing its age. Our preferred seat 12 A and C has no window. Service was excellent. The flight attendants were older and were very professional. We learned that Air Canada Rouge is taking over this route in Mid Nov. and we will be returning on that flight in Dec. Our flight departed late however arrived in good time. We had problems stowing our carry on bag as bins were completely filled. Flight attendant did put our bag in a bin in Business Class.

I flew from Toronto to Tokyo on my way to Manila on 22 Oct and had the worst service experience I had in a long haul flight (12 hrs). I was seated at the window seat on several occasions I had a request for food water in the middle of the flight I pressed the attendant button waited more than 20 mins then an attendant went by and just went past no stopping on our side of the aisle and asking if anybody needed anything this happened in the middle of the flight when everyone was asleep so I didn't want to call out loudly but was waving my hands. This went on for 3 more attendant passes me before I was able to get the attention of an attendant. On the way back flying from Tokyo to Toronto I opted for an aisle seat thinking it was easier to get their attention it was but they were not the friendliest or most cordial I was asking for snacks in the middle of the long flight I was asked to go to the back myself to get pretzels and cookies. No more long haul Air Canada flights for me if I can avoid it.

A trip from home from Greece to Calgary resulted in arrival 41 hours after the scheduled time. Air Canada did not contact me once during this time only provided vague updates through the hotel staff. On the ensuing flight from Greece customers were still charged $10 rental fees to use the in-flight iPads despite being delayed more than a day and a half. Disgusting customer service and clearly poor plane maintenance practices. A good way to ruin a vacation is to fly with Air Canada.

We had three short haul domestic flights with Air Canada - YVR to YYJ YYJ to YYC and YYC to YVR. One flight was on time one was 25 minutes late and the other was over an hour late. Minimal information was provided about the delays and most of that was obviously incorrect. Check-in at YYJ and YYC was simple and efficient but at YVR was terribly slow with only 2 bag drop desks open and huge queues. The overhead lockers on the YYC to YVR were inadequate leaving everyone a scamble to find space anywhere they could. I would give any other airline a try next time - Air Canada performance leaves much to be desired.

LHR to YVR 777-300ER. Fairly new aircraft with everything clean and working as it should. Cabin crew were okay without being anything special. I found the staggered beds to be quite comfortable although if travelling alone it is better to avoid the pairs of seats near the window unless you want to climb over/be climbed over by a stranger. Food was okay but nothing special. Air Canada lounge at Heathrow was nice but the check-in process was poor. The premium desk was far removed from the economy kiosks with poor signage and the Air Canada roving ground staff lady that we dealt with did not help. It was only when we reached the bag drop desk after a long wait that we were told where we should have gone.

On September 8 I boarded my connection flight scheduled to depart at 6.30pm from Calgary to London Heathrow but after boarding the pilot announces that there was a problem with the de-icing device. They spent hours trying to fix the problem but in the end the flight was canceled. By the time we walked out of the plane it was almost midnight. I understand that due to safety issues there was no choice but to cancel the flight but what I'm extremely upset about was the unhelpful staff and lack of support for the 300 passengers walking out of that plane at midnight in a snowing city hungry and without anywhere to go. After exiting the plane we were summarily dismissed by agents who could do nothing to help us rebook our plane find hotels or even to just to remove our "checked-in" status so that we could call the helpline to rebook our flight. Because the desk agents failed to remove my "checked-in" status (when I asked they told me it would be done in about an hour which did not happen) I had to call the help line 3 different times before someone there was able to reach the ticket office to fix things up and issue me a new ticket for next evening. Needless to say it was a sleepless night. As a single Canadian adult traveling by myself with all the right gadgets and adequate travel insurance I was lucky enough to sort everything out myself albeit with endless frustrations. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been for foreigner families or elderly people with hearing problems. Because of this experience I will probably take a vacation from Air Canada for a long long time.

### Air Canada customer review
Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding.

Flew from Calgary to LHR. Comfortable seat food was good. Plane was clean. Only defect was the inoperative entertainment system. That was no great hassle I had a good book. Boarding was well done. Terminal 2 at Heathrow was hopeless. It took an hour to get through Immigration. Many booths were empty and the fast track computers were "down" so the fast trackers cluttered up the "other passports" group. Air Canada has some terrible reviews and my son in Calgary warned me of its reputation so I had bought some muesli bars just in case. I was pleasantly surprised the flight was good. I would use them again. Round the world flights seem poor value.

No entertainment from Toronto to Lisbon simply lights out. While I had entertainment from LA to Toronto my daughter had none for both legs of the trip. I can not imagine in this day and age that an airline offers no entertainment. Food was okay but you must pay for wine on international leg of trip. I think it's either BA or AF from now on.

Travelled from Heathrow to Vancouver we sat for 90 mins on the runway with little info but just problems with one of the engines. The TV did not work and we had to wait for the stewardess to be ready to re boot it! The seats are 3x4x3 and very little leg room although the leather seats were quite comfortable. The worst thing was the rude service we got from the air hostesses they looked like it was too much trouble to do anything for you! The food on return flight was appalling before we landed we were handed a yoghurt and a dry slab of some kind of cake. For the price of the flights I felt the great films did not make up for the bad service poor food and cramped conditions!

### Air Canada customer review
Booked a flight in February to Greece since booking our return flight has been changed 4 times. We first had one stop in Montreal then straight to Edmonton landing at 10.30 pm. After the 4th change Air Canada had added another layover in Toronto after Montreal now returning at 1.30 am. I wouldn't have booked this flight if I knew this is the way they operate. There are too many other airlines that never change there flights no matter how full or empty the flights are. Book through another provider.

### Air Canada customer review
Our family flew from Vancouver to Sydney in Business Class on the final leg of an around the world trip. All other Star Alliance airlines were great. Air Canada was shocking! There were no shower facilities in the Air Canada lounge in Vancouver. The aircraft was very dirty. Crumbs of food smeared sticky stuff old rubbish around our seats. We had ordered special meals due to medical conditions for 3 family members. The food was inedible - overcooked. Our business class meal consisted of chicken that was too hard to cut potatoes that disintegrated as soon as we tried to pick it up with a fork. Dessert was a small fruit salad. We were offered our breakfast instead of our dinner in case that was better and the crew were understanding but there were no other food options available for a 19 hour flight. We were hungry for 19 hours (travelling with 2 children). This would have been unacceptable in economy. Upon receiving our complaint Air Canada offered 10% discount off our next flight. Useless as we will never fly with them again.

26th September 1.5 hours late leaving London Heathrow for Montreal. Knew I would miss my connecting flight to Toronto City where I had family waiting for me. Was assured from the aircrew that Air Canada ground crew were aware of the delay and arrangements had been made to fly Toronto passengers out on two flights. All we had to do was contact the AC agents at Montreal. Suffice to say no one was available to help in fact a less helpful bunch of individuals I have yet to meet. After lots of chasing around from one departure gate to another I was eventually put on a flight to Toronto Pearson which resulted in my sister having to dash across Toronto at the last minute. Furthermore it seems my luggage arrived on an earlier flight isn't that a security breach? All in all a very poor service from Air Canada which has resulted in me vowing never to fly with them again going back to Air Transat.

AC001 YYZ to NRT. Could not scan the boarding pass to retrieve baggage tag using the machine hence we had to queue up for 'check in assistance'. The line up was long we had to wait for 1hr. Boarding was quite quick. Service was mediocre kind of bad actually when you compare it to ANA (I have a connection to CGK using ANA). Return trip AC006 HND to YYZ. Same service except for better IFE due to newer aircraft (b787). Food was not delicious but edible on both sector. Overall Air Canada is a mediocre airline.

London Heathrow to Montreal 28 August 2014 Boeing 777-333ER C-FNNW. One of Air Canada's latest Triple Sevens equipped with their latest interior in economy with black leather seats and a very cramped 3-4-3 configuration. Very narrow seats uncomfortable but just OK for a 6.5 hour flight. The controller for the in-flight entertainment screen is now placed in the arm rest just where you lean your elbows causing lights and cabin call alerts all over the cabin. Little thought has been placed into the design of Air Canada's new economy cabin! Also my light control was turning on the incorrect light (obviously little testing of their systems on a new aircraft). Cabin attendants all old-timers and all very miserable but this is consistent with my experience of AC's transatlantic offering. Food - perhaps it is time they quit the hot food service! Still cannot believe this economy cabin design has actually entered service and other airlines that also employ the 3-4-3 configuration on the Triple are far more comfortable.

Vancouver-Calgary-Grande Prairie and return Aug 24-27. Unlike recent ghastly experience with AC Rouge - this was all on regular line. Planes were on-time clean and crew were friendly and efficient. Maple Leaf Lounge in Calgary is being re-built but there was plenty of seating and the food and drinks just fine. A highlight on the GP-Calgary (5.00 flt) - a very friendly and funny FA. Two young chaps were using inappropriate language as they boarded and she (young FA with charm and humor and lovely French accent) reminded them of "language" around others. We all smiled and they complied and I was impressed with her. Very nice trip on all four legs.

### Air Canada customer review
HKG-YVR. Each time I take Air Canada between Vancouver and some Asian destination I become increasingly frustrated with half of the staff's attitudes. It seems to me that some of these flight attendants tend to get easily frustrated towards Asian passengers. One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us. It's extremely inconvenient to unplug it in and out all the time when a passenger next to you has to get up. Plus this is also one of the least comfortable economy seats I have sat on.

24 July YWG-YYZ. I was leaving on an early morning flight on July 24 2014 and had a serious fall onto my face just as I was leaving for the airport. I arrived at the Air Canada check-in in pain and shock. I was greeted by the most caring and compassionate ticket agent who immediately called the medics. They got a wheelchair and ice packs for my face and accompanied me through customs after clearing me for travel with the on call doctor. They gave me extra ice packs for the flight to Toronto and the flight attendants gave me a bag of ice to rest my face in and constantly checked back to check my comfort. Empathic and caring flight attendants.

Flight from Heathrow to Ottawa AC889 - myself and my husband and daughter. We had paid top prices to travel to visit family in Canada. On boarding the plane we were not greeted merely nodded at by a 'gentleman' who barely glanced at our boarding passes and said 'down there'! Not a great start and this attitude and lack of care or service continued throughout the flight. Not one of the cabin crew smiled during the whole flight - for which I was awake the whole time! Yes we were travelling economy class however we had paid premium prices for these flights! Very disappointing to be treated so poorly. As for the 'food' - words fail me!

### Air Canada customer review
Our Air Canada flight to Barcelona August 8 and our return from Madrid August 21 were saddled with cancellations delays and very poor customer service. As the 8.50 flight was getting closer to departure time on the night of August 8 passengers were first told that the aircraft had not arrived while the crew had come in. Then we were told that there was no part and it was best to wait and be safe than sorry. By 10.30 additional staff came in and said that the part had arrived. After an hour of waiting close to midnight we learned there was no crew to fly and the flight was cancelled. The station manager came in with security and more staff. The manager said that all hotels in downtown Montreal were full booked thus no hotel for us. He however guaranteed that we would be flying the next day to Barcelona and that we could retrieve our luggage and AC staff will make sure that we are comfortable. There was not a single staff member around after customs so passengers who decided to sleep in the airport went around looking for benches and chairs to sleep on. Vouchers of course were handed over but in the beginning my sister and I were told of the following: no food will be served on the flight but would be available for purchase no re-routing to catch our tour and AC was not responsible if we missed our tour. All these actions on the part of Air Canada were well orchestrated and any questions from passengers was met with Security ready to handle any raising of voices. Our Air Canada saga however did not end in Barcelona. On the way back August 21 from Madrid again the 1.30 pm flight was moved to 3.00 pm. It was not difficult to figure out again the cause for delay. As more fresh looking passengers came in to join the 3 pm flight it was clear the delay was done to combine the 1 pm and 3 pm passengers. The delay caused us to miss the connecting flight in Toronto for Montreal our final destination. When we asked Air Canada customer service if we could take an earlier flight to Montreal we were told that our luggage had been checked in for the 10.30 flight to Montreal. We could not say anything to customer service only to find out that our luggage did not arrive in Montreal in spite of the nearly 3 hour window to load our luggage. As someone enticed to fly Air Canada's direct flight to Barcelona from Montreal this airline gave its passengers a sing song routine when all passengers like me wanted to know what is really happening with our flights. Air Canada should never forget that we paid the fare they asked for be it from a travel agent or online.

My original rant today starts because of Air Canada's online flight tracker. Every time one of our friends comes in from out of town we normally follow their progress online to make sure we don't have much of a wait at the airport. Air Canada doesn't seem to care and leave their customer's rides hanging today it was almost an hour. Now my second rant is from personal experience a number of years back and I tell anyone who asks me which airline they should use and shouldn't. I haven't taken a flight myself with Air Canada since we booked a trip using airmiles and never will again. Our flight to Cancun was originally set for 32 hours 5 stop overs and leaving from an airport an hour and a half away. A few days later I received a call from them to change my itinerary to 26 hours when I asked if they could let me use the airport 10 minutes from my home he said since we put you through the trouble OK. Sleeping in my wheelchair inside of the Mexico City and Guadalajara airport we arrived in Cancun utterly exhausted and me with a diabetic low blood sugar. On the 6 hour flight home with an overnight in Calgary my wife left me ahead to grab our luggage. When they came to get me I told them my supplies were all in the overhead compartment. The rude stewardess wouldn't even look and told me that my wife had everything. I get off of the plane and when I saw my wife she didn't have my jacket medical supplies or test kit. After spending the night trying to retrieve my medical supplies in the city we went home exhausted again. They had the nerve the next day to tell me to come and get my supplies. After them making 3 trips I finally got everything back. Even if I was offered a few flight I will never board another Air Canada plane ever again.

YYC to Narita return: Horrible flight there. Checked in for my wife and I with seats together the night before. Somehow when we showed up at the airport the seats were separated. Managed to change 1 seat with a nice Japanese lady. Both inflight entertainment systems did not work. About 50% of the cabin had the same issues. How hard is it to test the system beforehand? Or upgrade to a system that works. On the way to Narita we were both stuck with the Japanese meal being at the back of the plane. Was awful. On the return flight back we managed to get seats in the front of the plane and had a much better meal. Still 1 out of 2 inflight systems did not work properly only a couple of movies worked. We were both a sleep/dosing when they served the breakfast ~2hrs from Calgary and were both woken up did it look like we wanted breakfast?

I flew Air Canada from BOS-YYZ on 8/20/14 in economy class. FA's were friendly and the seats were very comfortable. Not that many movie choices but it is a short flight. On the way back there was a problem with my name during boarding (probably because I was an unaccompanied minor) and as an apology I got a free business class upgrade. The food was great and the seats were very nice. I recommend it.

Flight AC 7439 was cancelled in LaGuardia no explanation. Put on another flight to YYZ and connection to Edmonton. Counter clerk printed out wrong boarding pass so had to return from security to get correct pass. Flight was late and arrived in YYZ with 30 minutes to clear customs grab bags drop off bags at domestic go through security and get to gate. No Air Canada representative anywhere in this process to assist in getting through quickly so we missed our flight. The counter clerk insinuated we should have asked for help. I asked the Baggage Clerk the Information Clerk the Customs Clerk and the Security Clerk. There was no Air Canada representative present anywhere during this process. I realize there may be a reasonable explanation for cancellations but we were given none. Worst part is that their Executives could care less so it goes from the top down as to the contempt they have for passengers. Air Canada will never see me or my family on one of their flights again.

YYZ-YEG Full flight. Overall a great experience from web check in to early departure and early arrival. Great service by friendly cabin crew. Clean plane. Terminal 1 at YYZ easy to use. Air Canada has WestJet beat.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada Express (Jazz) YYZ - Charlottetown PEI - YYZ August 12-19. Given the strong and well deserved criticism levelled at Air Canada's bizarre Rouge offering I want to compliment those in charge and working in their Express service. Our flights to Charlottetown and back were on time professionally operated with a calm atmosphere completely absent the tension that exists on so many stressful jammed-in flights. The CRJ 705 to PEI was very comfortable you could cross an ocean in those seats no problem. The smaller CRJ 200 on the way back is more snug with a couple of inches less leg room but still adequate for the flight length. The CRJ 200 lacks the entertainment system and catering of the 705 that is the only thing removing some stars from my overall rating. Now that I will not book an Air Canada flight that could be Rouged at a later date it is good to know that there are some services under the Air Canada brand that one can take with a confident expectation of good service and a pleasant flight. Well done Jazz Aviation and AC Express.

### Air Canada customer review
We flew LHR-Toronto outbound via Halifax and return via Montreal. Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious. Overall we were pleasantly surprised.

AC8886 I flew from Edmonton to Newfoundland. My flight from Edmonton was delayed 55 minutes the lady at the ticket desk did not even check in my son so that caused a hassle when I went to get on the plane. When I got to Halifax the plane was delayed 3.5 hours. I had 2 cranky boys under 3 years old everything was closed at the airport they gave me a $10 meal voucher and were very rude about it. I do not recommend this airline.

### Air Canada customer review
I will definitely not fly with Air Canada again. Had a previous bad experience with them and thought maybe give them another chance. Wife and I flew out of Paris from CDG. Boarded aircraft along with other 398 passengers and waited for over an hour for the plane to depart. No apologies nor explanations other than a brief P.A. about waiting for one late baggage. Plane arrived at Montreal one hour late and all passengers were not allowed to disembark due to some medical problem with one single person with another further delay of 20 minutes or so. We rushed to baggage claim to retrieve the check-ins then to an Air Canada connections kiosk. The clerk was extremely slow and seemed unsure how to process the transfer and became irritated when told that we were in a hurry to catch the 4 pm connector in 45 mins. She eventually told us that she would be placing us on a 8 pm connector instead. She became even more irate when asked for an explanation and merely told us to move on and just place the luggage on the conveyor. Another agent then came over and demanded us not to place the luggage on the conveyor as the flight was not until 8 pm and we were required to lug them around until further notice. While waiting for the connector - we spoke with a supervisor at an Air Can ticket counter and she explained that all passengers must be checked in 1 hour to departure hence we were placed on an 8 pm connector. At no time did any Air Canada staff members offer any apologies or help to alleviate the problem.

### Air Canada customer review
LHR to YYZ. We travelled in an old 767. On the inbound flight it was a beautiful big 777 and frankly much better. This 2-3-2 configuration was crowded on a long haul flight and there are only bathrooms in the back of the plane. Our seats at the front - you get it. I do have a few issues with this flight- the bathrooms had not been cleaned and smelt terrible! I think a flight attendant did a good clean up mid flight as it seemed to improve as the flight went on. Surely not appreciated by her. My other issue with Air Canada on both flights is that the cancelled their pre dinner drink run. Cost cutting? Maybe. And the food was pretty lousy too. My children's meals in particular were terrible. Finally our IFE had a glitch and the first 40 rows had their programming interrupted about 20 times. I know first world problems - but when you pay for it. On a brighter note 'some' flight attendants were friendly (others not at all). We will go back to our regular Air Transat route across. Cheaper cleaner and more bang for buck. Friendly too.

### Air Canada customer review
YVR-LHR on the high density 777. Will avoid this aircraft in the future. Seats were filthy when we got on the plane with garbage shoved under the seat and in the pockets. Not acceptable for business class. Service was poor and staff constantly running around frantically. No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger. If you are seated next to someone consider yourself stuck because it is very difficult to climb over when the seat is reclined.

I have just recently completed 2 return trips YYC-YYZ in Y class after a number of AC rouge flights and have to say I felt like I'd been upgraded. Flights were comfortable entertainment had a great selection right at my seat and I didn't have to download an App to watch 30 yr old movies. Inflight service was good lots of overhead cabin room and the best part - adequate leg room! I am still a fan of AC but really hope they do away with AC rouge asap. It's bringing the AC brand image down to a very low level.

### Air Canada customer review
LHR to Calgary: Check in at brand new T2 was a complete shambles - not sure if this is AC's problem or T2 teething troubles? Not enough staff around to deal with self check-in problems and only 2 check in desks available - the queue was long and slow! On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed. Not sure we'll be able to avoid using T2 again in the future but certainly we will not be choosing AC again.

Our NRT-YVR flight was quite pleasant. The flight attendants spoke English and Japanese and were friendly and accommodating. They helped with the overhead luggage (something rarely seen with US carriers) and worked hard to help with entertainment and tried to provide service during heavy turbulence. There were at least two choices of dinner both quite nice. Kids got their meals first. Slippers would have been nice (like one gets on Asian airlines). The movie selection was good. Overall an on-time well-handled flight.

We bought a ticket for Vienna - Toronto - Orlando and back Miami -–Toronto - Vienna online and got tickets for flights AC6167 AC1866 AC917 AC 6166. The first problem was we could not reserve seats for the Vienna-Toronto flight because it was operated by Austrian Airlines. We checked in online at the first opportunity and had an uneventful trip to Miami the Air Canada Plane being a little rugged was an "Air Rouge" flight but it was ok. The return flight was a disaster. The Plane from Miami arrived late from Toronto which resulted in missing the Vienna flight. We asked the onboard personnel if they could give us any information on the status of our connecting flight but the same problem again: they told us they had no info on the Austrian Airlines flight and that it was "out of their hands" - then they got annoyed when we asked for priority disembarking. Well we ran for it but it had not waited for our party of 8. We were split up re-routed to Paris AC880 and then after 5 hours of waiting to Vienna by Air France flight AF1738. We had to get the Air France boarding passes ourselves offered no assistance like food vouchers or lounge access but told us we could fill out a complaint form online. We had to run around so much (with 2 little children) that we used 3 hours up anyway. When we arrived finally in Vienna the luggage was missing again some confusion which Airline was responsible now. The onboard and ground personnel were indifferent at best. I will avoid air Canada at all costs in the future.

Flight from Ottawa to Fredericton. I arrived 42 minutes before boarding and "missed my flight". I Was charged 170 dollars to book a flight later. Customer "service" staff made no attempt to get me on my flight. They were rude and had zero empathy. On the return flight I was offered an earlier flight out of Fredericton but had a 6hr layover in Montreal. Weather in Montreal had delayed several flights. Air Canada staff directed me to wrong help booth on the first floor where I waited 45 minutes before being told rudely that they were too busy with people who had missed their flights to help me and I should try the Jazz booth on the other level. The Jazz booth had a two hour wait because of the recent weather with only one staff at the desk. When I arrived at the wait line I asked a passing staff if this was the right booth for Jazz and she told me to "just wait in line" whiteout even answering this simple question. I waited two hours and was told that they could not give me an earlier flight. Flights were on time but customer service was absolutely unacceptable. Needless to say this is my last flight with this airline.

LHR-YYZ return. I was on a 3-3-3 configured 777 which was quite comfortable however I would avoid the newly configured 3-4-3 777 as I understand the seat width and pitch is less - I have had experience of this configuration before and it is not comfortable. Food going out was great but terrible coming back - I guess LHR has better catering! Regular drinks runs with a full bar rather than just juice/water was a welcome surprise.

### Air Canada customer review
We acquired our tickets on May 2 2014 for travel on July 26th 2014 the flight to Charlottetown PEI was okay apart from being delayed leaving Edmonton International due to overbooking again. We received $50 per person off with 1 free meal each. Travel agent paid Air Canada for our meals however we never received them. I was told vouchers would be provided via Air Canada when our tickets were scanned but that never happened. On the return flight Aug 9 2014 from Montreal to Edmonton one of our assigned seats 33F had no television working so our son did not even have a TV screen to watch on the 4.5 hour flight back to Edmonton. This is the last flight we will take with Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
I will not fly on Air Canada if I can help it. My wife and I won tickets to fly anywhere in Canada in a contest (not through AC). We decided on St. John's NFLD. Somehow the ticket agents and boarding staff knew that we didn't pay for our tickets and from that point on the service ended. The man at the boarding desk actually said to me that I had no right to request better seats (the plane was only half full) because we didn't pay for our tickets. I was appalled at the rudeness we experience and will not fly on an airline that pays employees to treat people like this. We usually go to the border cities to fly out of to save money. But to fly domestically I will use WestJet if possible. Have flown on them twice and the service was excellent.

### Air Canada customer review
August 2nd 2014 AC009. We arrived at a very crowded very unruly check in counter in Calgary where it was clear staff had no control of the lineup. When you're travelling with a 5 month old this situation can create a lot of stress. Once we boarded the situation became worse. The seats were dirty and clearly very worn. It was evident that the planes climate control was broken. We sat onboard the aircraft at the gate for what seemed to be a very long time with aircraft engineers trying to fix the problem. The pilot claimed the problem was fixed we began our taxi away from the gate and then the plane just sat there. We went back to the gate and tried to get it fixed. After a lengthy wait (again) we taxied and took off. Of course once airborne the cooling system still did not work and the pilot informed us that we were going to be diverted to Vancouver to potentially switch planes. Told a new plane was being readied and we would be boarding 7pm Vancouver time. When we went to our new check in gate the situation went from worse to downright awful. Ground staff had no idea on seat assignments and couldn't figure out where to seat everyone. We thankfully got our bassinet seats but other passengers were told to board and to find a seat "anywhere they could". We finally got in the air 9 hours after our ordeal. I will never fly Air Canada again.

I travelled premium economy on Air Canada from Vancouver to Heathrow. This product is very good value in my opinion. Seats were similar to AC domestic standard business class about 38' or more pitch two on the sides. The dinner meal was a condensed business class meal in my opinion having travelled in that class previously. The wine drinks service was excellent staff were very attentive. Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones. I thought the dinner meal was better than what I ate on united first class. UA could take lessons from AC.

San Francisco - Toronto - Madrid: Poorest plane I have flown in and that's saying a lot as I've flown a lot during my time as a flight attendant and on my own for pleasure trips. Seats in the plane from Toronto to Madrid were very narrow and cramped (and I'm a petite slim female) and extremely uncomfortable (did they purchase the seat foam at the dollar store? I think Greyhound bus seats would have definitely been more comfortable). I had recently called in to customer service to request a bland meal after getting horrible food poisoning days before my flight but unfortunately there was no special meal for me at dinner time. So lucky me I got to eat a bread roll for dinner. No free food was served on the flight from San Francisco to Toronto? It was considered a "national" flight. What? It was an 8-hour flight that crossed an international border. Entertainment was one screen in front for the whole economy cabin on an international flight (Toronto to Madrid). I'll never fly them again.

We were in the waiting lounge for a return flight from San Diego to Vancouver when we were told that the flight was cancelled due to technical problems. They offered us a flight part way to San Francisco and a hotel for the night there which we accepted. When we arrived at the SFO airport to leave however AC demanded another $50 for an extra bag. We explained that we had already paid this in San Diego and that it would have been for the entire flight to Vancouver not just part way. The AC "customer care" representative was surly and annoyed at our refusal to pay this charge twice. Common sense finally prevailed but we had to demand a supervisor in order to sort this out.

AC865 LHR-YUL B777-300ER full flight and expectations fulfilled. Great plane seats comfortable for a 7 hrs flight IFE is superb with new touch screens (like ipad) good variety of movies music and series selections food OK pasta was delicious however the wrap snack was nothing special perhaps an ice-cream would have been a better option as we're in summer now. Staff very dedicated and attentive always smiling passing through the cabin quite often for water services and more. Amazingly enough it was my first time on an intercontinental AC flight and I got very satisfied with this experience.

Certainly tickets are overpriced but its because there are no competition on Canadian air market. Would certainly consider flying with them again.

AC 1856 July 15th Las Vegas to Montreal. AC 845 July 28th FRA to YYC. AC 1896 July 28 YYC to Las Vegas. We had a terrible experience flying Air Canada business class. First of all on all segments' seating was separated for my wife and myself and every time we tried to change seating so we could sit together AC staff didn't seem to care and gave us false info on the aircraft seating arrangement. We had to stop over at Calgary and the flight attendant was not familiar with the US citizen passing through and did not give us a Canadian custom form (luggage must be picked up and sent through US custom at the airport). The Air Canada ground staff were also was not clear about US bound passenger's procedure. Air Canada is no doubt the weakest link in the Star Alliance family.

### Air Canada customer review
AC 811 from IST to YYZ on B767-300. The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection. Air Canada must take a serious look at their ground service arrangement in Istanbul as it really gets the passengers off to an unpleasant experience.

Ottawa to Antigua via Toronto (July 20th). The flight between Ottawa-Toronto was lengthened by more than 20 minutes and left us with 35 minutes to catch our connecting flight to Antigua. Not an easy task when you have to run up floors than down while changing to other sections of the terminal. The return flight on July 27th was even worse. Toronto-Ottawa was cancelled due to severe weather. It took us two hours to access customer service on the premises. Not enough agents contradictory advise. We were put on stand-by on the 00.30hr flight with crossed- fingers wishing us luck. I can't understand that with the technology we have today they don't known the number of people who book the flight. To make matters worse no ground crew for an hour that left us in Ottawa at 2h30am without luggage and a closed office.

777 Business class HKG to YVR. Only 1 meal selection available cabin service nearly non-existent 2 of 3 washrooms closed (to store A/C staff luggage) typical A/C flight crew - surly and extremely "seasoned". Every second row has horrible seat configuration. Without exaggeration there is more room between seating rows in a compact car than there was on this business class seat. Use any other carrier if you can - there is no way that you can do worse than Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
Mexico City-Toronto-Milan Malpensa round trip in business class. Air Canada delivers a consistent and sound business class product with some features that make it more similar to a first class product. For example the seat configuration on the 767 (1-1-1) is really comfortable and give a great degree of privacy that is not provided on other 4* airlines. Staff service very attentive. I had a 12 hours layover in Toronto and Air Canada provided me a room free of charge at the Gateway Sheraton: a detail that was very much appreciated. I suggest an improvement on drinks in Business Class: for instance an upgrade in whisky and a wider selection would be both very much appropriated.

I flew from Toronto to Sydney Australia via Vancouver. The flight was very comfortable. Sure the seat could have been roomier but there was adequate leg room. The leg from Toronto to Vancouver was great no one in the middle seat! And because I was continuing on to Sydney I got free food (a choice of a meal item and a snack). The food on the long haul leg was okay nothing special but edible for myself. Free bar service is nice! Service was good and water was plentiful. I think Air Canada's seat back TV is best in class. Lots to choose from when you can't sleep! The only think I wish Air Canada did differently is get rid of 3x3x3 seating and make it 2x4x2. Yes less seats overall but it would make it a more pleasant flying experience for all!

### Air Canada customer review
We flew from Ottawa to Hong Kong returned from Shanghai to Ottawa both via Vancouver. I paid extra for choice of preferred seats and while there was sufficient legroom the seats were so narrow as to make comfort and ultimately sleep impossible. The food was really nothing more than garbage with a choice of "gruel" or a slice of some sort of egg for breakfast. For dinner I chose the beef which was a very poor quality meat all fat and only 3 little pieces. I think next time I will pay more and try to fly with another carrier.

### Air Canada customer review
We flew from Toronto to Hong Kong direct. The seats were fine and the flight attendants were friendly but the food was really atrocious. The sum of the meals were carbohydrate heavy. For snacks we were offered pretzels and later some kind of shortbread-like cookie. The snack on the return trip included a roast beef sandwich which had nothing but white bread and roast beef (no lettuce no dressing nothing!). Oh yes one of the other snacks was cup o'noodles. For main meal one of the dishes was some kind of white pasta pellets with a little bit of chicken. Another main meal was white congee (i.e. white rice porridge) or egg. So again carbs carbs carbs! I'm not anti- carb but the meals were all heavily laden with carbs with very little else to go with it. Not even vegetables!

### Air Canada customer review
Winnipeg to Nashville via Toronto. Was scheduled to fly Sunday morning. Plane was delayed due to mechanical problems things like this happen. The problem was we were not informed that our flight was delayed while standing in the line. The board showed our flight to be on time. Needless to say we stood for over 2 hours in line and were late to board our plane. Then told our plane was delayed. No help was offered while we were in the line only told we would have to wait our turn. Ended up flying into Toronto later that day but missed our connecting flight to Nashville. Thankfully Air Canada paid for our hotel and part of our supper in Toronto. On our return we were on schedule coming into Toronto according to our tickets. But when we had gone through customs and were ready recheck our bags to get the connecting flight to Winnipeg we were told we were too late as the baggage had to be checked in 1 hour in advance of the next flight. No effort to get us on the original flight. Thankfully I had enough time after landing in Winnipeg that I could still drive home. The service we got at the airports was just appalling. Flight attendants were okay. Luckily I was flying for holidays and not for work where time missed could be very costly.

We flew from Frankfurt to Calgary and 3 weeks later again from Vancouver to London. Our first trip was a bit hectic because we had very little time to catch our connecting flight. We had to run to our gate and once arrived there was a big queue. We were assigned 2 seats apart from each other (15 rows in between) so despite the big queue we went to the Air Canada desk at the gate to ask if it was possible to change our seats. The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled. The inflight entertainment system however was even better (latest version) so no complaints about that at all. Overall impression of flying with Air Canada was good. Would we choose for Air Canada again? Probably yes.

YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Outbound flight on new 787. Return on 777-300. The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.

I had booked a trip from Ottawa to San Diego with United Airlines. The flight I had to Chicago from Ottawa got cancelled due to weather conditions and I accepted an alternate route through Air Canada which I regret doing. The airplane sat on the YOW tarmac for over an hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in Toronto. Only good thing I can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed us to get out of our seats while we waited. On my way off the plane in TOR no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure I could make my connecting flight to San Diego which was showing "on time" on the flight board. After passing customs baggage check etc. the flight was no longer showing on the flight board. The AC flight attendants I found roaming around had no clue where to direct me. I happen to find the service desk and was told to get in line even though I said my flight was leaving in 10 minutes and I simply needed the gate number. As there were 4 people in line my flight had left by the time I received "service". So booking another flight to get to San Diego I opted for a layover in Los Angeles that night instead of waiting another 24 hours in Toronto. I was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in Toronto nor Los Angeles even though Air Canada caused me to miss my flight. Staff member told me he could not give me the boarding pass for the next days flight but omitted to say he did not complete the booking and that I was expected to go to the AC ticket counter at LAX to get one. I only got the customer service contact information when I returned to the desk to confirm my flight to San Diego was in fact the next morning at 9.55. After a short night in a close by hotel I returned to the LAX airport the next morning. I went to US airlines who had no trace of my info who redirected me to American Airlines I found out that there was no ticket for me as the booking the TO agent did not complete the booking. The agent in Toronto said he could do nothing for me because the notes on file said I had accepted LAX as my final destination. Told I needed to speak with a ticket agent at LAX to see what they could do for me. I walked from American Eagle terminal 4 to Air Canada terminal 2 and back. I barely made the 11.30 flight. I hate to think what would have happened to my baggage had I any with me on this trip. I received no apologies from anyone at Air Canada throughout this whole ordeal.

LHR to YUL on Boeing 777. Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.

Vancouver to Victoria on 16 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a Dash8-300 connecting from Lufthansa. As I was leaving the Vancouver immigration and customs hall personnel of the Canadian Border Services Agency directed me to the wrong exit. Hence instead of going through a dedicated security line for passengers connecting to domestic flights I found myself in the main airport arrivals area bringing all my checked baggage with me even though it was tagged to Victoria my final destination. I asked an AC staff member driving an electric cart whether there was somewhere to drop my checked baggage or whether I should head for the domestic check-in queues. The airport wasn't busy she confirmed that my baggage was already tagged to my final destination and she had no passengers in her cart; so she took me directly to a separate counter (with its own conveyor belt) used for wheelchair passengers accepted my already-checked bag and issued my boarding card. Excellent treatment by Air Canada staff. (As it was a 20-minute flight it had no food or entertainment.)

### Air Canada customer review
I've been a status flyer with AC for decades and look forward to the day when other airlines are allowed to compete in Canada for AC routes. Recent changes to Air Canada's 'reward' system mean it is much more difficult and expensive to achieve and retain status. I often fly YYC-NRT on AC010. Formerly Tango Plus fares were full status points at a reasonable price and upgradable. This has now changed the 'low cost' Tango fare usually gives you a ticket at a higher price with only 25% of the status points of the former fare and is not upgradable. Customers seeking an upgradable fare must instead book Flex which is a substantially higher price (35-45% higher). Additionally Air Canada will now bill you an extra $750 per leg to book the upgrade. My experience on June 8th was this. Pay extra for a Flex fare in order to upgrade. Upgrade not available so I've paid extra $350 for the Flex fare to sit in a lower priced economy seat available at a cheaper price. An out and out rip-off. If I had received the upgrade the extra costs for this leg would be $350 for the Flex fare class plus $750 for the upgrade itself = $1100. Add to this a flight crew that were disengaged and robotic.

Flew a short flight YYZ to YOW on 29 June in ERJ190. More room both width and legroom than on the BA 787 that I flew on from LHR. Attentive crew. Minimal snacks but then it was less than an hour. Would fly again on the 190.

### Air Canada customer review
Very poor quality service for Canada's "National" carrier. My wife and I travelled economy class Heathrow-Toronto on 9/6/2014 Vancouver-Anchorage on 16/6/2014 (admittedly this route is now down-graded to their low-cistern carrier Air Canada Rouge) and finally Vancouver-Heathrow on 25/6/2014. No problem with aircraft but cabin crew appeared insufficiently trained in a number of aspects incl. seat and window-blind positions for landing. Quality of food was appalling especially the vegetarian option my wife had pre booked and which was served 20-30 minutes before main service -she had finished what little she could eat before mine had arrived! The crowning glory was the offer called "breakfast" served after 8 hours a 9-hour flight and consisted of a small rectangle of dry cake with tea or coffee. How have Candians allowed their nation carrier to drop standards to this degree?

### Air Canada customer review
Cabin crew were ok. Ground crew were overwhelmed and just didn't care what happened. Connections agent did not use any information system to inform us that our flight in 20 minutes had already departed. In fact our connection had been delayed 45 mins giving us adequate time to get to the gate. The connections agent directed us to stand on line for flight rebooking and for hotel accommodation. After 1 hour of waiting all the Air Canada agents went home and told us to rebook ourselves. Its a long story but almost every interaction with an Air Canada representative was poor.

Victoria to Vancouver 4 June 2014 a 20-minute flight aboard a new Dash8-Q400 connecting to Lufthansa. The Dash8 series has never been able to accommodate a full-sized carry-on bag in the passenger cabin either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front. As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination. Passengers were forced to take out from their carry-ons all the items essential to keep with them during their entire trip (laptops prescription medications anything breakable or valuable). My own carry-on is only two-thirds the standard full size and (just barely) fits under the seat in front so I was able to keep it in my possession for my entire 16-hour journey. Travellers should avoid AC flights served by Dash8-Q400 aircraft unless they use smaller carry-on bags not the standard full-sized ones. (As it was a 20-minute flight it offered no food or entertainment.)

### Air Canada customer review
LHR to Toronto. Although I had originally seen a suitable flight schedule with Air Canada my travel agent organised for me to fly with Lufthansa as she said they were a more reputable airline. Turned out it was code share with Air Canada meaning no access to meal choice no seat selection and subsequently general anxiety about the booking. I got to the airport 3 hours before each time. At Heathrow I was patronised at the counter with 'everyone knows that showing up early does nothing anymore'. I was given a seat in the last row of the plane that only reclined slightly. No problem I am an experienced traveller and although I was on the way to give one of the most important presentations of my life I was able to relax and keep calm. At Toronto airport checking in for the Heathrow flight I had to queue a very long time and then was told there was no assigned seat for me. I went to Lufthansa to see if there was anything they could do for me. I asked why I could not check in online. They told me because the code was a Lufthansa code not recognised by Air Canada. They then told me that because I had bought a significantly cheaper fare (I hadn't) that I should expect to be treated like this. I did however notice that my class was Y which is usually on my boarding pass when I travel economy. Finally 30 minutes before the flight they called my name and had assigned my seat in the last row of the aircraft where I could not recline. This was the overnight flight from Toronto to Heathrow and I had to go back to work the next day. I was offered a choice of two meat based meals and had to refuse them as I am vegetarian. No seat choice no meal choice. My advice is to give code share a miss. Lufthansa and Air Canada may well be partners but when you travel Air Canada as a Lufthansa customer you are bottom rung nobody who somehow deserves to be patronised by all.

Flew from Vancouver to Toronto in business class on a brand new 777-300. It had the brand new business class and it was excellent. Great staggered layout and single seats are amazing for sole travellers. Very comfortable in lie flat position and new duvet and pillows great quality. Excellent meal service and lovely staff. Would love to fly on this again.

Flown Air Canada 100s of times and used to like them. Recently flew return Montreal to Edmonton. Paid for the flights because Aeroplan points are now essentially useless unless you book a year ahead. Also paid for extra legroom premium economy seats because of my height. On checking in discovered that we had been bumped to regular economy seats with my wife and I now on different rows! No advance notice from Air Canada regarding this. So I spent between takeoff and landing standing in the galley! Air Canada customer service - absolutely non-existent.

Air Canada used the CRJ705 for this quick 80 min trip from Ottawa to Halifax. And you know what? The first class configuration of 1-2 is perfect. Nearly feels like a private jet! Nearly. Was also surprised that we got full meal service. Well done AC.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada used a small and (24yr) old A319 on this Vancouver to Ottawa route. The first class seats are wide however with not much legroom so you feel a bit squashed on this 4+ hour flight. The IFE kept breaking down so they had to reboot several times during the flight. The service though was good and they had a really great healthy breakfast option that I really enjoyed.

Flew to YQR on June 20 and had a great flight throughout. Declined the lunch and the flight attendant was very attentive throughout the entire flight. Too bad my return to YYZ on flt 1116 on June 23 was not the same. None of the crew bothered to introduce themselves. Declined the lunch again due to health issues and asked for a sandwich instead. Told I would have to pay the $7.00 odd for the sandwich I was brought from economy! It was almost impossible to get a top up of my wine as the crew were safely ensconced behind the tightly closed front galley curtain and could be heard giggling away like school girls (all male crew). I have usually received excellent service in J but made to pay for a chicken roll sandwich was over the top I hope this is not going to be the norm on AC otherwise Westjet here I come.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada - Canada's discount airline! I fly 100+ flights on Air Canada every year and have done so for 10 yrs. It's sad to see the decline of our national carrier in recent years. Operations at most US stations are now run by outsourced contractors who poorly represent the airline and generally have no interest in providing customer service. Air Canada has relocated many of its US gates from main terminals with good services and lounge options to 2nd tier facilities serving discount or charter carriers. The mainline now operates very few flights in North America subcontracting most flights to Jazz Sky Regional and now "Rouge". The product has become so inconsistent that unless one flies AC very regularly it would be almost impossible to now what to expect when you book a flight. Hint - avoid Rouge like the plague! To offer Rouge as a low cost / low service alternative is fine - to discontinue mainline service and replace it with Rouge is not fine! It's good to see that the airline has become profitable however if the product continues to decline and competitors continue to expand their offering and provide a viable option to Air Canada's long held virtual monopoly the profitability will be short lived.

Travelled AC 001-002 YYZ-NRT B777-300. Two class layout with the classic pods herringbone layout. Always love these layouts. Flew round trip June 5-11. Everything was excellent. Always impressed by AC service. Went to bed as soon as we took off and opted for the dine on demand service instead of the regular meal service. Crew made sure everything stayed warm until I was ready to eat. The food was great for 35000ft up. Bar service always great never have to worry about not having anything to drink. Usual breakfast before landing was so so. Only recommendation would be to time the meals for the time of day. We landed at 5PM continental breakfast at 3pm isn't exactly exciting but its better than nothing. Crew were fantastic always attentive asking if they could you anything else. Seats super comfy. Air Canada just introduced a new duvet and pillow with the launch of the 787 and they are super comfy. All in all great product.

May 28 AC 854. June 5 AC 855. For many years I have preferred Air Canada for my several flights a year between Vancouver and London. After a trip on their newly configured 777-300 with 10 abreast economy seating never again regardless of price. The absolute worst seating ever encountered. There are options and I shall use them.

YYZ-NRT on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 15 June. Return leg from earlier NRT-YYZ flight on 31 May. Again another full flight so I couldn't change my seat in the rear. Thankfully for good weather in Toronto that day the flight actually departed early and landed more than 30 minutes earlier at NRT! Staff service was pleasant. Food was again above expectations: the chicken with couscous was great! Unfortunately the plane that day was out of potable water (only bottled water) hence no hot beverages or cup noodles could be served - disappointment. Thankfully in-flight entertainment was better than on NRT-YYZ: volume or sound system was still not reliable - conversation too soft but background music too loud. But the variety of movies was good managed to catch up on old movies that I've been wanting to watch but missed. Kudos also to a particular flight attendant (should have gotten her name she was also serving us on my NRT-YYZ leg) who provided me with Tylenol for my headache when I asked her at the end of my flight. By and large a good flight besides minor quibbles. I sure hope they keep up the good work.

I flew recently from Vancouver to LHR on a new style 777-300ER. The seats are crammed in nine across in Economy with minimal legroom in a way which Mr O'Leary of Ryanair would admire. The problem is that what may work on a short European hop does not on an almost 10 hour flight and the full plane was unbearably cramped. Avoid if you can. The food was terrible the Inflight Entertainment OK and the staff who did their best in impossible conditions friendly.

AC856 YYZ to LHR. June 3 2014. Seat 31K absolutely horrendous. Do not fork out extra $90 for this seat. You are on window side but there is no window. Leg room is good but the exit door bulks out in front of you. It is by the galley and the washrooms so lots of traffic. It is also narrower than normal due to tray table and TV being in the side of the seat. You definitely feel scrunched into this seat. Food was the usual awful economy stodge all carbs no fresh veg or fruit. So called continental breakfast was a slab of cake! Staff were the usual harried and not friendly bunch intent on getting everyone fed and watered in as little time as possible. I wish Virgin flew this route to allow for some competition.

AC 849 LHR to YYZ. June 13 2014. Seat 50K. Do not pay the extra $90 for this seat. It is a terrible seat the only benefit being it has legroom. Everything else about it is uncomfortable from being scrunched into the corner to no window to tray table and TV being in the side of the seat thus narrowing it. Armrests do not lift. It is by the galley and the washrooms so lots of traffic. Staff were indifferent rushed and not overly friendly. Food was the usual economy stodge loads of carbs not much else. I had the chicken which comprised a dried out 2 inch piece of chicken instant mashed potato and 2 tiny broccoli florets so overcooked as to be almost unrecognizable. Dinner tray included a rock hard roll no butter and unidentifiable salad offering. I used to think no airline could be worse than Air Transat but have now found a worthy replacement.

### Air Canada customer review
I am a frequent traveller between Toronto and Orlando (at least twice a month). When Air Canada added this route to its Rouge system I knew I would have a problem. The seats in business class are terrible the food is awful and the legroom is non-existent. However the price for a business ticket remains the same! This is what happens when there is no other way to travel (business class) directly between Toronto and Orlando. The staff are helpful but they know with every flight most passengers will be disappointed. If you are trying to compete with discount airline charge discount prices. I pray that a competitor enter this route in the near future. I will move over immediately!

We flew the Dreamliner from ZUR to YYZ on June 1st. Found the environment in the new 787 to be an improvement but wonder who at AC signed off on the configuration and details. On our flight alone we had a number of "spills" because the earphone cords come out of the forward seatback and cross the table (in both Y and Premium Y). Then there is the issue of the controls on top of the armrest that are constantly being touched either by your arm or the person to your side. Mid section washrooms should have been back 5 or more rows to balance 'demand' front and rear. Cabin staff were well aware of this after a week of operation and blamed Boeing - not their fault as each airline does their own interior. Have been on at least 6 other 787 aircraft from other carriers (AC's first is #160 that Boeing made) and the others did not have these faux pas. AC needs to address these issues ASAP as they have nearly 40 more 787 coming! Food was the worst I have endured in the past 2-3 on any carrier.

Sitting at Ottawa airport one hour after flight was meant to have left. No announcements flight information boards useless. It would be nice if someone would at least let us know what was happening. I have learnt not to expect much from Air Canada but this plummets new depths. Wouldn't mind so much if this was a budget carrier but Air Canada is not the cheapest by any means.

### Air Canada customer review
NRT-YYZ on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 31 May. It was a full flight I wanted to change my seat from the rear but I couldn't. Thought that AC deserved a little more credit amidst all the negative reviews on Skytrax which did scare me a little. I guess in general where delays or problems don't occur AC probably performs fine. Staff service was pleasant (occasionally a little less friendly). Food was surprisingly better than I expected: food looked and tasted decent (maybe it's catering from NRT) we were rather well-fed (2 meals + instant noodles) drink runs conducted regularly. Seat comfort was alright: standard fare comparable to other airlines cant really complain especially when their new 77W product seems so much worse. Quibbles arise from the in-flight entertainment: mine worked fine but the volume or sound system was not good - volume was at maximum but sound was still terribly muffled (I could only hear half of the conversation while watching movies making movies with heavy narration un-watchable). Other quibbles include the (at least 20 minutes) delays on departure and the very shaky ride we had due to turbulence - I suspect my seated at the rear of the plane meant more shaking. Overall I guess there has to be a reason why they're a Skytrax 4-star airline and winner of Best Airline in North America for 4 years in a row? I sure hope my return journey YYZ-NRT remains like this or better.

We booked our flights 7 months ahead of our trip and were rescheduled 3 times by the time we flew. Left Winnipeg late on flight AC 270 and arrived late in Toronto. Staff onboard were great and they asked everybody to wait in their seats until passengers needing to catch connecting flights were off the plane. That is exactly what happened and we and some other passengers were off the plane proceeding quickly to a gate where we were supposed to board AC 876. The connecting plane was still there yet we and some other passengers (10 in total) were not allowed to board. Sent to a customer service desk given hotel and food vouchers and told to arrange new flights ourselves! It took about an hour and half on the phone to do that.

I booked on Air Canada in January. They sent me a revised itinerary in March. They then sent another revised itinerary in Late April just before my flight. I checked the time and saw that the seats I had reserved and paid for were correct. I ended up being rebooked by Air Canada on Rouge. It was horrible. There was no legroom. You can't recline the seat more than an inch. There was an entertainment system that required you to have your own tablet but when you went to the app there were no first rum movies. My initial flight was on a different type of plane so my original seats didn't match up and my husband and I had someone sitting between us. When I complained to Air Canada I was told that they can bump people to a lower class ticket than you purchased and they hoped to see me soon on another Air Canada flight. They couldn't understand why having booked Air Canada I was upset being downgraded to Rouge.

### Air Canada customer review
My partner and I have had sporadic good/bad service with Air Canada in the past and until this year I have been fairly neutral about them. However my partners continued poor service through Air Canada for his work trips since February has made me rethink my opinion on them. He has had multiple flights with AC from Toronto to Newark Intl for work and it seems over the last 4 months the service has continued to degrade. AC has continued to overbook flights. On top of overbooking every flight seems to range between late and very late. This level of tardiness could be explained away in February as bad weather but now with not even a cloud in the sky the excuse has gone to continual maintenance issues. As I type this my partner is still sitting in his now 4 hour delay with no explanation why the crew can't seem to get the plane off the ground. I understand things happen sometimes but the way problems are handled is clearly an issue this airline needs to work on. Not all of our service has been bad but all of the recent service has been rather poor. The additional seat area with more legroom is a very nice option for customers and the little TV screens offering movies and music are also very welcome and help with longer flights. However food options are questionable and as I mentioned tardiness and rude attending staff at the terminals coupled with recent check-in issues (like not being able to print boarding passes online) really sour the service.

Flew Zurich ZRH to Toronto YYZ on new 787 Dreamliner. Good air quality and I felt noticeably great after the flight. Flight arrived in Toronto 1/2 hour early. The food was nothing special for economy but what can one expect. Staff were friendlier than usual but still in their no-nonsense manner. Seats are not wide but comfortable. They have a problem with the position of the controls on the armrest just by putting your hand on the rest activates the staff call button. Was disappointed about the movie selection just a few blockbusters.

Travelled Copenhagen - Toronto on May 30 2014 and return on June 7 2014. Overall one of the best transatlantic flights I've experienced in economy class. The entertainment system is top of the class. Large clear screen and a lot of brand new movies to choose from. Of course you should bring your own favourite headset for an optimized experience. Food was excellent on the outbound flight and mediocre on the return. Seating pitch as good as it gets on economy.

I flew from YVR-HKG and return on the new 777. This is my 3rd time flying this flight on these new 777s. The only reason was to use up my upgrade points for the year and then change to a new airline. This plane is terrible as is Air Canada when it comes to pretty much every aspect (comfort service etc). I am currently in Limbo about which airline to change my loyalty to but there is nothing Air Canada can do to retain me. The prices service comfort etc is absolutely terrible compared to all the other airline choices. I have been Air Canada Elite status for years but have finally come to the point of giving it up for a new airline. I hope many do the same.

### Air Canada customer review
SYD-YVR and YYZ-SYD in May. The only reason these very long flights were bearable was the extra we paid for Exit row seats. I had read reviews about Exit row seats being reassigned but thankfully our seats were in order except they hardly reclined at all. AC probably charges the highest rate for Preferred seats than any other airline I have flown. The flight staff were mostly friendly another stroke of luck I believe. The IFE was not that good even though we had our own headphones the sound was very bad. The food served on both flights was the worst I have eaten on a flight in a very long time. Unappetising fridge cold bread rolls/wraps quite inedible. We had gone prepared fortunately took some snacks with us otherwise a 15 hour flight without eating could well have been the result. Ground staff in SYD were fine VR and YYZ not great. We had issues with carrying Duty free in our hand luggage on the YVR/YYZ sector because staff had not been advised of the change in rules. We were made to open our suitcases to try and fit the liquor in before the staff concerned realised she had made an error. I can say with all honesty I would not fly AC again. Fortunately in this part of the world we have some great carriers.

I was a little concerned about flying with Air Canada after reading some of the negative reviews on here but I should never have been. I flew on flight AC851 on the 18 May 2014 and I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were absolutely great they were helpful friendly and cheerful in their work and nothing was too much trouble. They made our flight enjoyable! Food was good for an airline seat comfort was good and although there were some delays before take off this was due to Heathrow ground staff and no fault of Air Canada.

Great word of caution. AC flight may be "Rouged" in whole or on connections. AC regular deserve from my experience as an Elite flyer their four stars. Notable AC improvements in customer care on-time efficiency crew attitude and wine selection in business. Rouge is another issue entirely. Take away 4 inches of seat pitch remove IFE seat back TV put you on seats that are ultra thin and hurt you take a 3 by 3 narrow seat and put a pillow in the middle seat and call it Premium. Use underpaid Disney trained staff who wear odd hats smile and try to put their best foot forward but are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers on the plane fighting for overhead bin space and how crowded and unhappy they and you have Rouge. For us it was like travelling in a nice comfy car on one leg and then being put on a cattle truck for the next and for the same price! Never been so comfortable on one or felt so tricked on the next. Maybe we should bring our own iPads and a nice folding chair? Since this was an Air Canada ticket you are forced to share it with Rouge (look on-line Rouge has either subsumed all flights on some routes or is interleaved on others). For this review all stars have been cut in half because of our Rouge experience. Mixing the two is airlines is comparing "chalk and cheese" and confounds the star ratings.

YVR-HKG on 777 High Density configuration. Everyone must avoid this 777! Even if this flight was a few hundred dollars less than competition (which it's not) I'd still avoid it. I am Elite Air Canada and would never fly this plane (trying to see if I can change my return flight). Seats are so cramped that it shames low-cost airlines not only you do you not have enough room but the seats are also very uncomfortable the controls are inaccessible (on the armrests) and recline is very limited. Due to extreme high density service is slow and very poor there's no duty free on a 14hr flight! There's absolutely not enough lavatories for the number of people this plane carries. From what I've heard the business class is also horrendous.

### Air Canada customer review
London to Montreal on Air Canada's new high density 452 seat 777-300ER. Check in was quick and boarding was a bit chaotic give huge number of passengers waiting in relatively small gate but priority boarding for business class was OK. Business class seating is new 4 and 6 across in alternating rows. Some seats much better than others so one has to choose carefully. Mine wasn't great with thin armrest on aisle side and was constantly bumped by crew and passengers. Overall business class ambience not great and the cabin felt very cramped given relatively high density of seating. Very large TV screens and good sound reduction earphones. Seats not as good as LH UA BA or pods on AC's older 777's and 767's. Service good by professional crew. Food and wine OK and decent portions and frequent drink rounds. Arrival in Montreal efficient and relatively quick baggage claim. Overall not as good as recent UA and LH transatlantic flights but generally OK.

### Air Canada customer review
Our Detroit to Toronto flight was cancelled after being delayed several hours which ensured we didn't have enough time to find another flight to make our Toronto to Munich connection despite originally having a 4.5 hour layover. Air Canada has no physical agents present at Detroit so after finally getting through to customer service we were able to rebook for the next day with an extra layover. The next day we get to Toronto to find out that they rebooked us on an overbooked flight so we actually found an Air Canada agent there to rebook us on a flight for later that night on a different airline. Coming back from Munich our flight was yet again cancelled after being delayed several hours ensuring we had no time to find a different flight. Of course there are no Air Canada agents to talk to in Munich either and the poor Lufthansa agents were terribly confused. Now I'm sitting here at the airport again wearing the same clothes because they refused to give us our checked bags back waiting for our rescheduled flight watching the agents at the gate try to figure out what to do with all of us who have boarding passes from yesterday currently saying we all need to recheck in which will no doubt delay this flight. I am baffled by the lack of communication and how unprofessional this airline is.

Flew on flight AC 420 to Montreal and AC423 return to Toronto. Customer service is non-existent. Needed help finding jacket left at departure gate even though the gate is directly beside customer service Air Canada employees disregarded the request. Flight return was late 50 min. Sat in plane with no explanation just directed not to use electronic devices or inflight entertainment. Could not even use bathroom or get water?

NRT-YYZ in Boeing 777-300ER. IFE feeling old. Needed a full-plane re-boot in order for it to work although some units still failed to work. Friendly service. Decent food although portions were small. Seat was okay.

AC085 Tel Aviv to Toronto on May 22nd. Plane arrived 20 mins late and was the same leaving. The food was acceptable the flight crew were good and friendly. The entertainment was good and it was a smooth flight arriving 30 mins late. The old 767's are looking a little tired and ready for replacement.

Toronto to Victoria on 22nd May. Flight left on time had a problem with the in flight entertainment system but not a big issue. Arrived on time and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. A pleasant flight on an Airbus 320.

We have flying Ottawa to Calgary for the past 2 years. I have always been able to book my seats in advance cost free. Now we have to pay $31 per seat to do this. We are retired grandparents and we save to be able to go and visit our grandchildren as they are very young. This is another financial burden making it more and more difficult to visit family. Greed is so ugly.

### Air Canada customer review
Toronto-DC-Toronto in mid-May and paid the $25 per bag fee for checked baggage. Too many "economy-minded" passengers didn't want to pay this reasonable fee so opted to bring over-stuffed bags onto the flight as "carry-on"s. One woman with such a bag PLUS a large backpack so large it could not fit under the seat. These people were not directed by AC staff to check their bags the consequence being that there was insufficient in-cabin overhead bin space causing a delay in boarding of over 20 minutes. This caused us to queue on the runway for over half an hour waiting for clearance from air traffic control. The result - we left DC around the time we were supposed to land in Toronto. Contacted AC regarding this irritation and received an email that the wait-time for a response is twenty working days (yes that's a month!) If I phone to make a complaint the wait-time in the phone queue is anywhere from 35-55 minutes. This was my second AC flight and the second time I was delayed by inefficient staff. My Aeroplan miles are going to a charity and I'm slicing up the card.

HKG-YVR Boeing 777-300 New configuration. A nightmare that even embarrasses the flight crew to apologise for it. I am a 100K Aeroplan member and this dreadful experience led me to avoid Air Canada since. With other airlines upgrading their already superior products one is left to wonder why Air Canada has chosen to downgrade theirs. I can only imagine the plight in economy where an extra seat has been jammed into each row. On a positive note I have discovered the advantages offered by the competition - of which there is plenty. There may be a short term increase in yields as passengers are crammed into airplanes but the damage to long standing customer loyalty will sadly endure.

### Air Canada customer review
YYZ-YVR-YYZ this past week enjoyable flights both ways. I am finding myself flying a lot on the 777. The leg room on this plane is great. On my return flight yesterday the airline had to make a last minute aircraft change and we flew home on the 767. This change was handled in a very professional manner. The counter employees were quick to re-assign seats and tried their best to accommodate every ones request. I have flown Air Canada twice in the last 2 months and have had an enjoyable experience both times. People need to realize that we are no longer in the Wardair days and that Air Canada is doing the best they can.

### Air Canada customer review
YYC-FRA and back on the two-class 9-abreast 777-300ER. The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint. Overall I was fairly pleased with the experience compared to my previous experience with Air Canada within North America.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew YVR-MUC on LH and LHR-YVR on AC in May 2014. Have flown BA long haul many times in last year mainly on old 747s. For a while AC had really improved their product making it better than BA. Not any more. The new AC high density 777-300 on the YVR-LHR route is awful In business the Pods are gone. The seat pitch is much reduced. The seat is poorly constructed and difficult to change position. The table is bizarre - spring loaded and very difficult to put back. The lie flat is not comfortable and has no privacy. You have to climb over the aisle passenger to get out. This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks. The staff however were very professional. Overall the experience was much poorer than LH's new business class on the A330. I wont use this plane again by choice. I'll be on BA or VS to LHR.

### Air Canada customer review
Quickly loosing respect for this airline who seem to find or create loopholes to punish passengers for any kind of loyalty. I have status (Star Alliance Gold) and have issues every time I fly - from check-in staff being rude and to lying about seat availability for windows / exit rows on flights that have empty seats in both categories when you actually squeeze into your assigned middle seat and the limits for when food is free / paid for never seems to include delays on the tarmac - even when they are 5-6 hours long. They changed the rules last year to achieve status and after it was achieved... they changed the rules and benefits again so upgrades that were free in January cost $1000 for Europe flights in February - it's like they have no respect for passengers.

April 29 2014 AC 8534 Thunder Bay to Toronto. AC 610 Toronto to Halifax May 2 2014. AC 619 Halifax to Toronto. AC 8545 Toronto to Thunder. I just had the most miserable trip to Halifax from Thunder Bay with Air Canada. I flew from Thunder Bay to Toronto in the most uncomfortable seats imaginable in the back row while the plane was full with Air Canada staff flying in their aisle seats. In Toronto apparently paying for your seat is not enough. I did not have a pre-booked seat so that meant I was a second class citizen due no courtesy or respect from the Air Canada ticket attendant who didn't even want to speak to me until everyone else was on the plane. While I flew in a seat marked "Crew" in the back of the plane in the middle seat again the flight was full of Air Canada staff. I have flown my last flight with them.

### Air Canada customer review
ZRH-YYZ on an A330. Pros: Seat was very comfortable in terms of cushion width and leg room (though I understand the seats tend to be a bit larger on the A330 than other AC aircraft). Flight was on time aircraft was clean FAs were friendly enough. Cons: Food was downright awful - main meal was very dry pasta with red sauce snack before landing was a completely flavorless chicken wrap. IFE had decent selection but played a 2-minute run of advertisements before playing each selection. Comes across as very tacky. Overall a fairly average long-haul economy flight.

YYZ-LHR was rebooked by BA on to this flight as their flight was cancelled due to a bird strike. Check-in very straightforward. Used the Maple Leaf lounge in Terminal 1 close to the E gates. Spacious comfortable lounge but no hot options for breakfast apart from a very sticky oatmeal porridge. Flight was on a B767 with a herring bone 1-1-1 configuration. It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins. Good choice of champagne and 2 whites and 3 reds. There was a choice of 3 mains-all looked tasty. Arrival was shambolic because of the immigration computer glitch-baggage was waiting when I got to the carousel. Generally very impressed with my first experience of AC Executive Class.

### Air Canada customer review
We took two fights one from Calgary to Frankfurt and one from Heathrow back to Calgary. Both flights were fantastic. Staff at check-in and onboard were friendly and courteous. We had many choices for meals black cod and a fatty cut of lamb were not prepared to our taste. The beef and the pasta were much tastier dishes. Thankfully fresh salad/balsamic dressing has been part of the business meal for a few years. Tasty desserts/cheese plates ensure that no one will starve. The pods are a comfortable way to travel and we always manage to have 4-5 hours of sleep. There's ample storage for shoes iPads etc plus a big bin overhead. There was a large selection of old and new movies to watch. The kit with travel amenities is fantastic on the way to Europe but of poor quality on the way back.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew SYD-YVR business class on 777-200. The seat configuration is not great for couples my husband and I sat in the middle two seats and were divided by a partition and the angle of the seats meant that to speak to each other we both had to turn sideways and backwards. I could eyeball the person across the aisle more easily but the distance was such you couldn't have a quiet conversation thus still not satisfactory when traveling with someone. Not a lot of room to place personal items in easy reach during the flight. Service was excellent there was plenty of courteous and helpful staff. Food was nice 4 choices of main course I enjoyed my fish also the entree prawn salad. I have to agree with previous reviewer the head phones disposable foam ear pieces were very tricky to stretch over the phones easily torn and easily lost when taking the head phones off. Flat bed was good but I didn't sleep well sinuses didn't cope well with the aircon. Would use Air Canada again.

### Air Canada customer review
This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the "pods" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities. Use them.

AC138 Vancouver-Ottawa. Usual AC crush on boarding with lots of people with too much carry-on no enforcement of carry on policy and insufficient space in aircraft cabin design for carry-on seems to be a universal feature of AC that you have to fight for bin space. Cabin crew managed to pack everyone's stuff in. 6 row seating and only 2 washrooms for about 160 people no doubt maximizes AC revenue when combined with overbooking - but no room to move in the cabin two people can't pass in the aisles without standing on the aisle seat passenger. Seats cramped. Flight safety briefings are now followed by full volume ads for BMW and credit card products. Inflight service then began by cabin staff selling earphones. Chose not to purchase later realized this a wise choice in view of limited inflight entertainment options. Food service - if you're asleep when they come round don't worry - if the cart doesn't wake you by banging your elbow as it comes by you will be shouted at until you do wake up and a menu card is wafted under your nose. AC wouldn't want to miss a sale just because you're sleeping! Being now awake looked at menu which offers "selection of wines" - turns out this means red or white one brand each. Ordered pieces of stiff cardboard and plastic paid full bar prices. In future AC would have to be the only carrier on a route before I'd fly them again and I would never recommend them. I remember when AC was a lot better than this.

I arrived at LGA 3 hours before my flight and from check in to boarding-all went smoothly. My original flight was AC729 at 1530 H I didn't want to lounge in the airport on a rainy day so the PSA allowed me to take earlier flight (AC7423) to avoid long wait in the airport. The ground crew and the entire flight crew were very nice.

AC855 on 4th November 2013 from YVR to Heathrow London. I returned on AC854 27th November 2013. Breakfast as the last meal on the plane was a real come-down. It should leave passengers with a satisfied feeling glad they chose Air Canada for their journey. Instead a piece of cellophane-covered yellow cloggy sponge slice that tasted of nothing paired with a small sweetened yoghourt. It was such a sad and disappointing closure to my trip. Regarding the holding pattern over Heathrow it was amazingly beautiful but that only made the unpleasant breakfast experience worse! My seat would not move one millimetre but was pronounced broken as soon as I explained the problem. The flight attendants were excellent.

Miami - Toronto - Copenhagen 24th April 2014. AC917 - A321 AC882 - B763-300. My family and I went to Florida on vacation. We flew out with Lufthansa - excellent service. On the way back we flew with Air Canada. I had pre- selected seats close to the wing (row 27) the B763 has 2-3-2 seating setup so selecting 2x2 was perfect for us. When we checked in at Miami airport we were told our seating had changed for the flight between Toronto and Copenhagen. Our seating was now: me my wife and my son (age 10) moved to the middle section in row 35 and my daughter (age 5) placed on row 14. I tried to talk to 3 different staff members in Miami airport none was interested in helping us. One suggested we could find a passenger ourselves to swap with. When we were boarding they realized it probably wasn't a good idea to place a 5 year old alone and swapped the seating. I am shocked about the lack of service. What shocked me the most is that I tried to talk to 7 different Air Canada staff members. On top of that (which just is minor compared to all the other): Their "continental breakfast" was a dry banana cake. Their entertainment system was so good that I could hear both my own movie and the movie of the passenger next to me. Both planes were dirty.

Flight 165 from Montreal to Calgary. The crew were impeccably dressed which can make or break a first impression. I was seated in the economy cabin directly behind business class and was expecting a standard North American carrier style of service but instead received more. The business class flight attendant was sure to make sure my drinks were always topped up and even went as far as to refer to me by name a very pleasant surprise in economy. The flight crew were friendly and present throughout the entire flight. Multiple water runs occurred. Legroom was generous in the bulkhead row and the cabin was clean and fresh. The inflight entertainment system was also up to date with multiple options for programming. I will certainly fly Air Canada again.

BGI-YTO-FRA. Found out upon check-in that plane would be delayed by 2-3 hours thus missing my connection. Was told that I would have to stay overnight in Toronto and was already rebooked for a connecting flight next day. My email address and mobile phone number were given in the booking but nobody from AC contacted me beforehand. Upon boarding I saw a second AC plane on the tarmac. Pilot explained that the plane was grounded due to technical problems 2 days ago and ever since they were struggling to find replacement planes. Also the incoming plane was delayed due to technical problems. But no information prior to check-in resulted in no chance to rebook thus missing an important meeting and wasting 19 hours at YTO. Flight itself ok (nothing special and nothing wrong) but the frame conditions were very unsatisfactory.

### Air Canada customer review
Return flights on new Air Canada B777 High Density YVR-HKG and YVR-LHR in last month. With the new high density configuration Air Canada has lowered themselves to a truly awful class of business travel. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped controls to recline are finicky and require a lot of to and fro'ing to get seat into lay down position. There is no storage space around your seat for storage of pillow blanket or your shoes. Staff are clearly not happy with new service nor are other frequent passengers. If traveling alone do not take an aisle seat on either side of the cabin - the window seat occupant cannot leave their seat without having you get out of your seat. Cathay and BA much better choices as they are either less costly (or the same price) and you get a personal pod. Will not fly AC again there are much better options on this route.

My wife and I booked a trip to the Caribbean in May 2013 to travel in early April 2014. We used a popular online service for our flight reservations. On our return trip back home to Michigan we had to go round about through Toronto switching airlines to Air Canada for our half hour last leg home. We arrived at Toronto to find that We had less than an hour to connect flights and our baggage wouldn't be checked through to our final destination so after waiting 25 minutes for our luggage and a long trek through a huge unfamiliar airport we missed our flight. But instead of putting us on the next available flight the attendant at check-in directed us to call ticket information. After about 20 minutes of being on hold we ended up at an information desk and they sent us back to the check-in counter where we encountered a gentleman who proceeded to blame us for the mix up arguing and threatening to charge us $250US to rebook. This went on for some time then after we had given up and were going to pay (again) for the flight he abruptly stopped rebooked the flight told us he was doing us a favor and we were on our way. What an ordeal after about a day and a half of traveling it was a nightmare.

### Air Canada customer review
We flew LGA-YUL and back on AC. My finance and I flew out separately and returned together. Staff were polite enough in LGA but displayed a consistently lackadaisical attitude. They didn't start boarding the flights until 10 minutes or less before scheduled departure (even though the plane had been at the gate for at least 30 minutes prior) so predictably both flights pulled back from the gate late. My flight then took a 30 minute tour around the taxiways which granted AC has no control over but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started our take off. On the return trip we first ran in to possibly the rudest person working a service job I've ever encountered at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologized for her co-worker. Again at the gate the staff was lackadaisical fumbling around and not boarding the flight until 10 minutes before departure (even though the boarding pass said boarding would start 55 minutes prior to departure and the plane was at the gate for a good 20 minutes at least before boarding started). Luckily it only lead to 5-10 minutes delay on the YUL-LGA trip. On all 3 flights there were no announcements about how or where to pick up baggage when we landed. Overall I feel like we were lucky that our AC experience was only somewhat bad. The general attitude and competency of the AC staff gave me absolutely no confidence that they would have been able to handle any real problems. I'm going back to Montreal again next year and will do my best to avoid AC for that trip and any others I take in the future.

Winnipeg to Toronto - this flight was the same as for all prior trips on AC. Staff were at best lifeless and indifferent. Some were outright haughty. At the end of the trip one is left with the impression that AC staff are taking their frustrations out on the passengers. I don't have the same experience when I fly the competition (Westjet). AC management might try some positive motivation with their staff before they chase away more customers.

YYZ to SYD via YVR in business class aboard 777-200 LR. Toronto to Vancouver leg was standard domestic business class experience. Ok food good entertainment nice service. Vancouver to Sydney was excellent. Nothing to complain about at all. Service was superb. Great meal service and a well stocked galley for between meal snacks. Tried the dim sum chicken breast skewers and fruit - all good. The pod seating is very comfortable. What really impressed was that the washrooms were so clean throughout the entire 15 hour flight. I used them frequently and they were always spotless. Air Canada really stepped it up on their international business class. To give you a comparison I've flown Singapore Airlines a few times and on this long haul flight Air Canada was even better (in both directions). I hope economy class had a good experience as well.

YVR to LHR return. Both flights quite satisfactory even with 100% full plane on return trip. All staff keen and some put out real effort. Two issues: Very poor food on return trip. Not really edible at all and the plane was a few minutes late in LHR with getting a landing slot. We went merrily to the Maple Leaf arrivals lounge for a shower and a bit of food after the flight. We got there at 12.45 and was told it was closed for showers and limited for food. It says it closes at 1.30 and we thought there was plenty of time for both. Staff were lifeless. Very disappointing.

We recently were on a flight from Los Cabos BCS Mexico to Toronto. We departed Mexico just after noon for our 5 hour flight. Not long after take off the staff proceeded to sell food. We were seated towards the rear of the plane and therefore expected to have slim pickings from the menu. We did not expect a total sell out of meals. We had a choice of a few snack items such as chocolate bar chips twizzlers and nuts. According to staff they sold out after 1st class and had to even sell off staff meals. I think it's unacceptable that the airline cannot better predict the amount of meals that are required for a 5 hour flight.

Los Angeles - Vancouver full Embraer E190 was a very pleasant flight despite the time late at night. The service was great and very friendly. Overall the aircraft was good and fairly new with spacious seats arrangements of 2 and 2 and great entertainment system (though the TV's could use a bit of improvement). Onboard cafe was overall normal and the menu selection was good. The terminal's Air Canada operated out of were efficient and my bags came out very fast. Turn around time was fast. Things that need improving the plane needed to be a bit cleaner and the boarding lines need to be organized more. But Overall it was one of the best airline experience I had on a trans- continental flight.

LAX-YYV-CDG on 14 March. Check in good rapid friendly. Boarding take off smooth appreciated the idea of rear passenger loading first saves all the usual hassle why don't others do it after Business of course! Negative was the fact that the "domestic" classed flight from LAX to YYV which takes almost 5 hrs - no food was available most of the snacks neither. Very poor considering I had 3 children and 5 hrs is not short. Later on the YYV-CDG leg food was poor and "breakfast" was a slice of banana bread...do they think we are all monkeys? Poor and the main reason I will avoid AC in the future even the Canadian Air Transat does better. Flight was otherwise ok staff not overly friendly or young; have done this route regular with Air France KLM United Delta and Lufthansa.

1.5 hours late in leaving London to Vancouver. Not a great deal of information during this wait onboard. Seat uncomfortable with recline not working. Entertainment system broke down but was fixed eventually after a re-boot. Food virtually inedible slop. Staff uninterested and unwelcoming. Return Kamloops to Vancouver to London. Ate at Kamloops as had a delay which was just as well as the food was again disgusting on the long haul flight. Have used this Airline to get to Sun Peaks ski resort for the last 10 years as it is difficult to travel with any other 'joined up' airline with times to suit. i.e. Air Canada to Vancouver then Jazz to Kamloops. Value service and catering all deteriorating. Will most definitely attempt to travel with another airline if possible. Very disappointing.

Outward: LHR-YVR (8/3/2014) and Inward: YVR-LHR (16/3/2014). Travelled Air Canada after 7 years and noticed some significant improvements in aircraft interiors and entertainment. Online check-in was simple as was baggage drop. Leg space is below par compared to a BA (for example). Staff service is brusque (no smiles) and food is woeful. How can you serve one hot meal of pasta and then another after 7 hours of just dry cake on a 9 hour flight is mind boggling. Will not fly them if I can help it.

I I am a senior and was told I should have checked ahead to see if changes were made. I guess I will try and fly with a different airline.

LHR-YYZ. On-time departure with arrival 10 mins early in Toronto. Flight crew was friendly and generally efficient but disappeared to the galley for a long period during the middle of the flight. Food was average wine was good. Business class seat wasn't very comfortable and is oriented away from the window. IFE was OK but doesn't compare well to some other long haul carriers (although it has got slightly better).

### Air Canada customer review
High Density 777-300 YYZ-YVR treated myself to an upgrade to Premium Economy and I must say I was extremely happy after seeing the cattle-car arrangement just behind me. PE is great! Seats are huge like domestic Executive Class on A320's A319's and A321's on AC but only if the upgrade is offered relatively cheap. My one complaint is that there should be a curtain divider between PE and economy and the cabin doesn't feel separated or intimate and noise and crowds spill over into PE. AC's new EnRoute system is a high upgrade over the old high-rez monitors much easier interface and improved maps. Seats are large leather arm-chairs same as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic small footrest and small cocktail table in armrest. The economy 3-4-3 is just totally unacceptable to a North American consumer who are typically much larger than in other parts of the world. At baggage claim the complaints were loud people all around me talking of the horrid cramped conditions seats that don't breath and suffering passengers. AC get rid of this product it's horrid!! I will avoid at all costs it's no way to treat a human being. I can only imagine this product on a 13 hours HKG trip.

I am a Million Miler who flies business on long haul with AC. The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider. For those of us in the air a lot this change of equipment downgrade is a real choice maker.

Flew AC 883 CPH-YYZ you certainly get back what you give on AC. I always decide to treat the crew like gold smiles and thank you and you get that back. AC 883 was about half full to very lucky to have two seats aisle and window all to myself. I greeted the crew with smiles and they immediately offered my double food two desserts and about an hour later one member brought me a tray with bread and cookies I immediately went to the back and thanked them again. Flight was an ageing 767 but saviour these old birds as you'll never again get the incredibly comfy 2-3-2 configuration again on the 777's and 787's. My one complained on these old planes is the seating near the exit rows gets extremely cold colder then when these planes were new.

Flew from YWG to OGG via YYC. Air Canada Express leg from YWG-YYC. Gate agent paged me and offered an exit row instead of my originally assigned Y class seat which was beside a mother and infant. Loved that the gate agent was so thoughtful. Last Minute upgrade purchased from YYC-OGG at an additional cost of $700. Enjoyed the flatbed for the 7 hr flight. Service was OK. Once meal service had concluded J class passengers would have to ask for whatever they wanted by accessing the forward galley were the crew congregated. No moving map on either flight however both flights operated onetime. Confirmed with crew that this may be the last season Air Canada mainline operates to Hawaii as Air Canada Rouge will take over this flying which will not offer flatbed seating. Flew back on United from HNL-YWG via ORD as AC fares for a Y class ticket one way was in excess of $700.00. Purchased a First Class ticket on United for $860.00 was served dinner and breakfast and had no charge for checked bags. Beverage glasses were never left unfilled and water glasses were even topped up while passengers slept. No need to venture to the galley to ask for anything.

### Air Canada customer review
My husband and I returned to Toronto from Tokyo on Air Canada yesterday. Our trip to Southeast Asia was with Eva Air. We were fortunate enough to fly Business Class (on points) both ways. The similarity ends there. Eva Air was the height of travel luxury - Air Canada definitely was not. From the so-called Welcome Onboard we knew things were different. With the exception of 2 flight attendants on AC the others were diffident at best one of the flight directors downright rude. It seemed that they couldn't wait to get home. Our flight map didn't work. We were told "too bad'. One of the BC washrooms was out of service from the beginning of the flight. Of course it was helpful to be able to lie flat but the beds were not very comfortable the quilt looked and felt as if it came from Walmart and the travel kit was just okay. The remaining two washrooms were tiny and poorly maintained. As for the food - the lamb dinner was floating in grease the beans were overcooked and the meal was inedible. As for the so-called Business Class service it needs a major overhaul.

### Air Canada customer review
The new business class cabin on Vancouver to Hong Kong is a big downgrade. The seats go down under the armrests of the seats in front of you so you lie in a narrow casket-shaped space - your legs can't move up and down at all but the part of the lid over you chest and face is open. When the passengers put their seats back up it literally looks like vampires rising out of caskets. It's very cramped and there's no privacy. The herring bone pods were worth the money to me - you got a smidgen of privacy. The new configuration is back to 2 across (ex for a few singleton seats that are always gone already) so you have someone breathing at you from a foot away that you have to crawl over to get to the aisle. I will look for other airlines where AC uses this cabin.

### Air Canada customer review
Just flew Air Canada Rouge (Toronto to Montego Bay) for the first time. Had heard horror stories and read the reviews about them so took nothing to chance. We took our own food to eat (which we have done for years with regular Air Canada) and had movies on our laptop to watch rather than the common movie which was being shown on the plane. I had also downloaded their entertainment app on my iPod in advance so could watch their entertainment system as well. Flight down was delayed leaving for about half hour and flight back slightly delayed. Took advantage of their single cart service when it was offered for soft drinks but other than that didn't ask for anything. The flight itself was no worse than some regular Air Canada flights I have taken and we were fortunately we were able to get the bulk head (at an extra cost) so had sufficient leg room. Overall was satisfied with the flight because I expected nothing from them other than flying me to my destination.

YYZ to YYC on Feb 14 and back the following day in economy. Both flights operated by 320 Airbus with plenty of legroom good entertainment and decent enough buy on board. I recognize AC is not everyone's favourite airline but I have rarely if ever at all had any major problems. One thing though: I would fly neither Rouge nor the new 777's with ten abreast seating.

I am a frequent AC flyer. Short-haul between YVR and Edmonton or Calgary. From not happy with them - over the last few years they have improved markedly. On-time is very good and so is customer service. I think they deserve the 4 stars. Last flight was Calgary-YVR. Airport is good shape and new massive addition almost ready Gates staffed with well dressed and smiling (YES smiling) staff. Travelled on a business class upgrade. Flight on-time attendant greeted me by name with great courtesy food service just ok (same two light entrees seem to repeat a lot) wine offerings excellent and served promptly carefully and with a little style. Hot towels very hot seats ok took my coat hung it up and returned before landing.

YYZ-LAX-YYZ AC792. Consistently late departure on this route either with excuses of maintenance luggage having to be removed or loaded passengers tied up in customs weather etc.. This time all of the above except weather. 763 with no space pod seating that is really showing it's age and lack of cleaning. Inedible breakfast mash of soggy pancakes and rubber sausage. Crew pleasant enough but given very low grade product to work with. On return the crew were efficient but perfunctory and the food just as awful. When I asked how well the beef was done the attendant replied that they didn't know as all they were told by the company was to put it in the galley oven and cook for twenty minutes same for all the meals. Very poor product for the money.

EZE-SCL-YYZ. Feared the worst after reading other reviews however must admit I was very satisfied with this flight. Good friendly service regular drinks distribution during the night decent inflight entertainment and acceptable snacks and meals including complementary alcohol which isn't always the case on NA carriers. On time departure and early arrival at YYZ. Glad the older two-class 777-300ERs are used on this route rather than the newer high density aircraft.

### Air Canada customer review
YYZ-NRT in Y class. I take this flight several times per year. It is a convenient direct flight from Toronto to Tokyo. This flight left on time (actually departing the gate a few minutes before the scheduled noon departure time) and we were in the air at 12:09 with no lengthy runaway or taxiing delays. Arrived a few minutes early in Tokyo. To me this flight is a notch above the standard AC product. They seem to be a little more attentive on their transpacific flights and the flights generally have a good on time performance. Service consists of full meal shortly after takeoff snack about 6 hours later (noodle cup/sandwiches) and breakfast prior to arrival. Drinks (including alcohol) are complimentary. In summary a good flight with a reasonable price and good service.

### Air Canada customer review
Zurich to Toronto (Flight 879 on Feb. 13) on a rather ageing tired Boeing 767 - however it was not a full flight so we could easily change our assigned bulkhead seats to two by the window in an exit row - which afforded us great legroom. FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart. Not a commonly expressed sentiment but the crew on this Air Canada flight went above and beyond the call in providing a level of service seldom encountered in the economy cabin!

### Air Canada customer review
IAH to YYZ to PEK to IAH. Flew economy in January check-in at IAH was fine and smooth so was the boarding process. Only one major delay on the last leg of the flight. But during the first flight from IAH to YYZ the FA was incredibly rude to my family when we asked about the drink offerings. While chewing gum she blatantly told us that all we got is soda juice and water. The flight from YYZ to PEK wasn't all that great either. Flight attendants yelled at one of my family members when we tried to put our bags into the overhead bins. The bags weren't even that large! They fit in the bag size check at the gate we checked twice! The only positive experience on Air Canada was on my last leg of the flight from YYZ to IAH. The plane had been delayed for nearly two hours due to weather which was understandable and downgraded to a smaller jet. One of the women on-board turned belligerent when told by a flight attendant that there wasn't any food available to purchase. The flight attendant offered to give the upset woman her dinner but she refused and remained inconsolable. What to take out of my experience: Don't fly Air Canada unless you absolutely have to and use this airline as a last resort. Avoid this airline at all costs.

Just flew with Air Canada Rouge for the first time. I've been a dedicated Air Canada flyer for many years with Status alternating between Elite and Super Elite. Rouge is a big step down for their regular flight service: reduced legroom uncomfortable chairs inexperienced flight attendants. The lady next to me was not able to be served in French so I had to act as the translator for the attendants this was unacceptable! The Entertainment system changed to an App or browser-based system. I'm not opposed to this but it would be much better if they provided a system on which I can mount my tablet rather than staring down at the table-top the whole flight. Moreover if you have an Ipad you will need to download the app ahead of the flight (or have the Google Chrome browser installed) otherwise you won't be able to view movies onboard. TV viewing will still work through the regular browser (not sure why TV and Movie streaming would be all that different but anyhow). They should offer the capability of downloading the require app (or Chrome) from the plane's entertainment system directly. Overall generally disappointed and wouldn't recommend this flight division of AC.

Saint John NB to Cancun Feb 7th and will not fly with Air Canada Rouge again. 4 hour delay in Toronto not due to weather and no explanation to passengers for the reasons for delay. 4.5 hour flight with no hot meal available - experienced the same on the way back on Feb 15. Seats were exactly a coke can and a half between edge of my seat and back of next. I am 5'8" and my husband is 6'0" and we were very uncomfortable. No TV and music unless you want to download app and watch on your cell phone. You can rent an ipad for $10 but my experience on the way down and the way back was that everyone around me had problems with them. I'll pay more next time and be able to move my legs.

### Air Canada customer review
Whilst most elements of the flights we took with Air Canada were acceptable rather than outstanding there were two elements that were really poor. Firstly the entertainment system was not working on one 7hr flight and the first stewardess just said she'd look into it but didn't. The second steward admitted they knew it was broken. The real issue though is that the only recompense offered was 5% off our next Air Canada flight. The second issue was the rude check in staff at Vancouver airport - not conducive to generating repeat business. The sooner the Middle and far Eastern airlines get a firm foothold into North America the better.

### Air Canada customer review
Boeing 777 W (HD) Toronto-Vancouver February 6 in economy. The 10 abreast layout is awful cramped hard and uncomfortable seats I will not travel in this layout again. Leather does not breath. Other passengers in my area voiced opinions that this is not an experience to be repeated. I am a loyal million mile member of AC but this layout and AC Rouge which I have used once and will not repeat for the same reason - too crowded is just too uncomfortable and I will shop other airlines for better seating or just stay home.

AC151 Toronto - Vancouver. The only good thing was the online check-in through Air Canada's iPhone app I was lucky enough that there was one exit row seat (has extra legroom) that no one purchased off at extra cost or checked-in earlier so I got that. Apart from that everything else was quite bad. The staff were not attentive. You ask them something they promise they will get back to you then they forget. When you click the button to call the attendant no one ever comes even though they walk by. As usual no food on domestic flights only drinks. The plane was dusty as usual.

### Air Canada customer review
I recently spent between $3000 and $4000 for 3 seats on Air Canada for a vacation to the United Kingdom for my wife sister and me. It was important for all of us to sit together. When I tried to get seat assignments their computer system did not work. I had to call instead and spent much time on the phone getting it done. We made the flight to London and were served a small breakfast and I was skipped. On the flight home we were shunted from one departure gate to another. On our third different one the computer system would not work and we were told we would have to be moved yet again when it finally kicked in. As we were boarding our final flight the stewardess pulled my sister from her seat and gave it to another person. I protested and asked how that could happen and we were told that a husband and wife who had not bothered to reserve adjacent seats had asked for my sister's reserved seat and they just gave it to them breaking up our family group to do so. We will never fly Air Canada again.

Just returned from Hawaii using Air Canada and never again. We got to the airport in Vancouver to find that the flight was going to be 3 hours late leaving they could have let us know by text or at least by email. The only compensation was that once on board we got the ear phones which usually cost $3 free! The seats I had booked had now been reassigned to someone else no explanation about that so we were cramped up in the last row where my reading light did not work. We took our own sandwiches as I refuse to buy their expensive food. Coming back we did not get anything not even a drink on the flight from LA. Also no blankets or pillows.

Flew Air Canada rouge to Orlando from Toronto Jan 25 2014. We will never use this airline again from now on we will fly into Tampa and drive to Orlando. Flight was delayed to and from while the staff whom could use some PR training assured us they hardly ever have delays such as this. Seating was cramped and uncomfortable and the staff on ground and inflight seemed rude and unprofessional unlike anything we have ever experienced. They even tried sending my 5 year old from the washroom at the front of the plane to the rear as not to disturb the people in so called first class. First class meaning they were separated from the rest of us with a curtain falling down and enjoyed a drink of cola while we had water because they ran out of pop part at the back of the aircraft.

Jan 18 my wife son and I flew to Sarasota. The trip down was ok although we've never encountered such uncomfortable seats as that flight. The trip back on Feb 1 was awful. We arrived at Sarasota early expecting to catch the flight at 6pm-ish back to Toronto. When asked if the flight was on time the attendants answered 'no it'll be leaving Toronto an hour later than scheduled. As time went by it became clear that not only was the flight not going to leave an hour late from Toronto it was actually in transit from Orlando to Toronto. Eventually the flight (1881) arrived in Sarasota at roughly 11pm and after disembarking passengers and cleaning left at roughly 11.30pm. The flight eventually arrived in Toronto by now it's roughly 2.30am and everyone is exhausted. Eventually we reached our home in downtown Toronto at roughly 4am. We live in a digital age they had my email and phone contact details. Did they ever have the efficiency or courtesy to send a text? Of course not.

January 20 out of Victoria to Vancouver. Vancouver to Los Cabos. Return flight January 27 Los Cabos to Vancouver with a connector to Victoria that was cancelled due to fog. It would have been nice for a disclaimer to be printed on E-ticket - no complimentary food. Lovely menu card with only 2 to 3 items actually on the plane. Expensive! Flew Air Canada 12 yrs ago flew again this January 2014 - it will be another 12 yrs before we fly Air Canada again. This was a vacation package that we just returned from - resort part of package was great - flight part of package - not so great.

On 7/1/2014 my connecting flight from Montreal to Brussels was delayed and then subsequently cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. We were made to wait board disembark and eventually to collect our baggage told to sleep in the airport with a thin blanket in freezing temperatures and to check in yet again the following day. As I was in transit this was even more taxing. Air Canada should have provided passengers with meal vouchers/food and hotel accommodation. Before boarding (after 4 hours of waiting) a few parents with young children asked for some water and sandwiches for their children. Their requests were flatly denied. I approached the purser to ask for water and something to eat when we had finally boarded after hours of waiting but I was impolitely brushed off and made to feel greedy even though I had been travelling for 12 hours at that point and was starving. After we were finally informed that the crew were no longer legal and that we had to disembark and spend the night in the airport we were informed that there were no available hotel rooms. I have never encountered such a blasé attitude towards passenger comfort. To add insult to injury there was no vegetarian meal (as I had requested months in advance).

I've flown with Air Canada numerous times and have noticed a general improvement in staff service. That being said my flight from Vancouver to Seoul on New Year's Eve was a little uncomfortable. The sinks were blocked off with aluminium foil and there was no running water. Instead there was a box full of antiseptic towelettes which was thoughtful. However the mere thought of how many unwashed hands went in the box frightens me. Also my inflight entertainment system was not working even after it was rebooted. I could not watch anything during the rather long flight. I understand that technical difficulties happen but this was not the first time.

Got on our E190 took off and they could not retract the slats so we landed after about a half hour flying around over TO. Plane declared unserviceable so they found another which would be ready in a couple of hours which would mean I missed my connection. 34 people headed to Edmonton and Calgary were thrown at Regina with no advance warning to speak of I was first in line at the desk in YQR and got out the next morning on the 0900 flight to YEG but many others were delayed until late that evening because what few flights there were out of Regina west were booked solid for the holiday.

I flew from YYZ-YFC on January 9 two days after the shutdown due to weather at YYZ. The check-in was very busy however there were staff on hand to help out. The plan pushed back on time however a teenager felt sick as we were taxiing to the runway and did not quite make it to the washroom on time. We needed to go back to the terminal to get the cabin cleaned. The delay was about 1.5 hours however I have to commend the flight crew on handling the situation with tact and compassion. I hope if I ever fall ill on a plane I get treated the same way. During the delay the flight crew gave out water and gave constant updates and communication. They performed very well considering the circumstances.

Flew from London Heathrow to Toronto via Montreal - our entertainment system did not work. When I asked a flight attendant for help they replied sharply "We are a travel company not an entertainment company". So I asked another flight attendant who was equally as rude. We were offered a flight with a time of only 50 minutes to connect to our next leg. This is undoable anyway we thought surely? But when our flight arrived 45 minutes late it caused all sorts of stressful complications. On return back to London from Toronto our flight was initially delayed by 4 hours but only pushing in half hour increments. So very frustrating. Short-staffed and totally unhelpful the staff were cleared stressed and it showed. We finally made it onto the plane on which we sat for 3 hours before being told to get off and come back 14 hours later as there was a problem with the plane (they had put water into a freezing cold plane which froze in the pipes expanded and burst). No hotels or food available. Shocking service. I understand that the weather was bad but all these problems could have been simply avoided.

### Air Canada customer review
In Dec-Jan 2014 I flew 4 legs on Air Canada Munich-Toronto-Miami and Miami-Montreal-Frankfurt each of them delayed with a total of 35 hours. All delays were controllable apparently being caused by shortage of staff in airport operations. Being stuck in Montreal airport for 24 hours I got a Holiday Inn voucher but the meal vouchers did not actually cover meals unlike with other airlines' passengers staying at the hotel. Had to stand three hours in a line of five people to get the hotel voucher at the Air Canada counter at the Pierre Trudeau. For a lunch voucher I got a small cup of Pepsi from a tap and water no food. The way the airline struggled with computer maintenance (delay of 4+ hrs from Montreal to Frankfurt) was frightening in terms of flight security. No compensations no apologies but major loss of time and money. Had to buy new tickets for the last leg home.

Toronto - Buenos Aires packed Boeing 777-300 seat 4A. The intercontinental Maple Leaf lounge was very comfortable quiet with an adequate selection of snacks and refreshments. Boarding in Toronto was simply chaos a mob of people pressing toward the jetway. Premium boarding lane was worthless and the 7 visible staff did not appear to have the situation under control at any point. Flight crew in Executive First cabin was inconsistent. Service Director was a gem very gracious. But the rest of the front cabin crew didn't seem to want to be there. Eye contact & smiles were absent and the environment lacked any genuine sense of welcome. We took off after midnight and I opted for the express meal which was adequate but not great. The lie-flat seat with duvet and pillow is very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Unless you plan to crane your neck in strange ways don't plan to be able to see out the window. Why were the pods designed to face the aisle? Plenty of overhead space but minimal storage space around your actual seat. There was a fair amount of trash (newspapers plastic wrappers boarding cards) from the previous flight around my seat and in the overhead bin. The bathrooms were in poor condition. AVOD choices were plentiful and the system was easy to use. In the hopes that this was simply an "off night" for AC I'd take this flight again.

My first time flying Air Canada in a while YVR to LHR and back. First of all my ticket price was the cheapest out of other possible competitors. The seats had comfortable leg room and I didn't feel cramped. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Also the food wasn't bad. I was pretty happy to have got ice cream for the first time on a flight. Drinks were served 3 or 4 times throughout the flight as well. The entertainment was great and had a lot of choices of movies and popular TV shows. The aircraft was clean and left the airport on time.

Santiago - Toronto. There was a problem with my ticket but the airport ticket office agent was sincere and thorough dissolving the stress and resolving the issue with a smile. Air Canada uses American Airlines' Admiral's Club in Santiago which is very pleasant but quite full at night. The gate was crowded and announcements were difficult to hear but boarding was orderly and efficient. The cabin crew was outstanding on this packed overnight flight. And this makes all the difference. Welcoming friendly sincere. We pushed back within 15 minutes of departure time. I opted for the full dinner. While the food itself was average the service was very attentive (this crew hustled!) and the wine selections were surprisingly good. The IFE system had a wide range of choices and was fairly intuitive to use. The bathrooms appeared worn but were clean. The lie flat seat (3D) is very comfortable. Breakfast was a disappointing rubbery omelette but I appreciated being able to sleep until shortly before landing. The breakfast buffet in the Maple Leaf Lounge was very pleasant the receptionists were gracious and there was no wait for a shower room to freshen up before my connecting flight. Bottom line: a very pleasant cabin environment warm crew and comfortable night's sleep.

### Air Canada customer review
I had flights Paris-Montreal-Paris. This is the worst experience in my 14 years of travelling. The leg room and general scope of the seating is just awful and unacceptable. The plane is B777 with new seating capacity 3x4x3 instead of 3x3x3 (previous configuration) with a new black cover. The seats are so narrow that it is impossible to move even fingers. It is so annoying that the trip becomes nightmare. Air Canada has introduced these seats into three B777. I hope that they will re-consider these inhuman upgrades. The food as usually is not eatable. Staff was excellent. Not recommended for Paris-Montreal route.

YVR to YCG (Vancouver/Castlegar) return at Christmas/New Year on DeHavilland Dash 8. Both our flights to and back were cancelled twice not because of Air Canada but due to snow and fog in Castlegar. As a result we missed Christmas there as originally planned. Both flights were surprisingly pleasant with lots of legroom on the plane and fantastic on board service. In fact the service on board this little plane was more attentive than my executive first class flying YVR/HKG return three months ago.

Positives: plane was clean and I arrived safely. Negatives: I have never encountered such rude flight attendants. The food served was inedible. For breakfast we thought we would order the pancakes as it would seem that this would be impossible to mess up. These were inedible. When I checked into our return flight to Sydney I requested an extra bag and provided all my credit card details at the time. Despite this we were charged for an extra bag at the airport. In essence these flights both to and from Sydney to Vancouver were the worst customer service experiences I have received flying anywhere in the world.

BRU-YVR via YUL on 767 and A320 both ways. Service attentive but not overbearing. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but nothing to rave about. Flight 2 hours delayed leaving BRU due to heavy thunder and lighting and I missed my connection in YUL before even leaving BRU. I mentioned this to the FA and when I went to recheck my bag in YUL after customs my boarding pass for the next flight to YVR was waiting for me. On the return YUL-BRU leg the service was a bit rushed and it seemed like the FAs just wanted to get it over with and hang out in the galley. I also noticed a certain haughtiness among Air Canada's FAs on international routes. They're the top of the heap seniority-wise in the company and they know it.

I just returned from a a month long trip throughout east Asia with the major part of trip - across Canada to Vancouver and then across the Pacific with Air Canada. I have done this trip many times in the last few years but this year was particularly bad. I am a tall person and the tiny regional jet to Vancouver was bad enough with cramped seating and small overhead storage but the long haul across the Pacific was particularly uncomfortable. Clearly AC can order their planes with the seating configs they prefer so with 40-50 seat rows they can easily squeeze in another row in by trimming off a 1/2" from each row making leg room just that little bit less. Heading out from Vancouver the food was decent but the movie selection was pretty poor. No major current releases and a lot of older stuff. As a result of travelling extensively in the Asia region I must have been on 6 or 7 airlines and when it came time to head home to Canada I had plenty to compare Air Canada to. When it comes to national carriers like Egyptair (Jakarta to Bangkok) or Thai Air (Bangkok to Shanghai) Air Canada doesn't even come close. On the return flight to Canada the plane was an older B767 with the same cramped seating as before. When I checked out the movies they were the same ones that were listed over a month earlier. This time the food was really bad. I usually eat what the airlines provide given it was such a long trip but this time I had to push it away unfinished. Somewhere during the night they passed out some tasteless sandwich rolled up in a plastic wrapper. It is shameful for Canada's national carrier not to have the best on such a crucial route for international business. I expect to be making this trip again and I will make every effort to make my connections with another carrier.

Arrived at Toronto and was told onward flight to Sudbury was ok so proceeded to hand in baggage for connection. Later we found that the flight was in fact cancelled and they then refused to give our bags bag. We were told by Air Canada to go to Section N. There were people here who had been in the queue for 4 hours not having an idea what they were queuing for and later finding out it was in fact for hotels not flights. After calling redial for 2 hours we gave up got a hotel ourselves and proceeded without our bags. When I rang air Canada they told me to go back to the airport if I needed them urgently. Our return flight from Sudbury was also cancelled and flight to London delayed heavily both without any notice or customer communication from Air Canada. We had also been told that if we required a special meal there was only one meal available on the first flight. I rang once being on hold for an hour the second for two hours and both without response. When I got to Pearson airport I immediately asked if something could be done about it the Air Canada person told me it's too late it has to be 24 hours before. When I told her I had been on hold for the amount she said there was nothing she could do about it. There was not even an incline of understanding from her or an eagerness to help me in any way whatsoever. Will never travel with them again!

YYZ-FRA and CDG-YYZ on the way back. Both flights were flawless superb entertainment choices (IMO the best I've seen so far). On the way out a new 777 was quite nice and comfortable. On the way back to Toronto the older 767 did the job quite well - a great flight nice and funny crew. Check in was fast for both flights. If you have any food allergies/preferences let them know in advance. The lactose-free meals that I received were pretty decent.

### Air Canada customer review
Flight from Vancouver to Brisbane. We paid extra for exit seats to get extra legroom. At Vancouver airport we were given our boarding passes and found we were sitting nowhere near our paid seats and not even sitting together. We complained at the counter and a very rude woman behind the counter said that that was tough luck. Lots of other passengers were complaining about the same thing. I kept complaining long enough so we eventually got the seats we paid extra for. The food on the flight was just horrible and nobody could guess what it was it was just stodge. FA's were rude and unhelpful. The plane was old the seats uncomfortable for a 15 hour flight. It was however cheap. Next time I'll pay the extra to fly with a decent airline.

Winnipeg to Vancouver to Shanghai return trip. Flew this trip numerous times before. Nothing too special until on AC026 from PVG to YVR. The crew did their best to make you feel at home. A couple of shortcomings to mention: 1) AC025 on Dec. 20 the second meal was not fully hot. 2) AC026 on Dec. 31 flight data were not available on personal screen. But all these can be forgiven because the crews were the best I have ever seen in business class.

Took my first flight on Rouge on Dec 27: Toronto to Orlando. It was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken on AC. There is no room between seats - must be designed for short small people not someone who is 6 feet tall. Seemed like everyone on the flight was complaining. If this continues Rouge will be a total failure. I travel 100000+ miles on AC but will choose another airline if I have to take a Rouge flight. Very disappointing.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew from Ottawa Airport today and had to endure an incredible line up at 0600 hrs because of two Sunwing flights which of course delayed the take off time. Add to this a de-icing debacle and on arrival at Toronto found my seat had been given away on my connecting flight even though I was 10 mins ahead of departure. Air Canada are buffoons and to put it short a disgrace to Canada. I will fly any other airlines before Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew on AC554 on 27 Dec. Flight was pretty good: YVR-LAX. My only complaint about this airline is the prices that are almost $1200 o/way for 2 adults / 2 children then $150 for baggage is a bit steep. Make sure your flight attendant doing PA's is able to speak clear English not broken English as it is very difficult to understand what they are saying. I would understand if we were on JAL or ANA not Air Canada. Truly disappointed.

Flew out of Toronto on October 31 arriving in Abu Dhabi on 2nd November. Left Abu Dhabi on 23rd November and arrived 23rd November. After flying Air Canada once I can be sure I will not do it twice. The plane was far from clean at one point I lost my glasses and needed to lift the seat up to see if I had dropped my glasses under the seat I knew the dirtiness of the plane was not a fluke under the seat was filthy as well. The food was awful. Truly disappointed.

Charges for everything automated flight bookings with connections with 1 hour time mixed in with frequent delays hold shorts and breakdowns. Today I flew from Orlando first flight was Rouge with 40 minutes delay. Got to Toronto and ran for my life to get my checked bag and make my Ottawa flight staff were surprised I made it. Flight landed in Ottawa and had to change the gate first stuck In traffic for 20 mins than break problem for 30 meanwhile we had to put up with barking pets in cabin constant bilingual announcements and other annoying derails.

### Air Canada customer review
We flew London to Quebec via Montreal and poor service began before we boarded the flight. We checked in online selected our seats printed our boarding passes checked our luggage in and when we got to the gate they told us we could no longer sit in our allocated seats. We specifically requested the seats as we were travelling with an infant. On the plane the seats are cramped the cabin staff generally unhelpful and rude insisting we take our full meal service even though we had an infant on our lap. As it was it didn't matter as the food was of a very poor standard. The inflight entertainment system clunky and limited choice the touch screen system not working effectively meant passengers behind constantly banging the screens and your seats trying to get the system to work. No seat belts are provided for infants either for take off or landing. This is an airline that seems to be operating a decade behind most others. I will never fly with them again. The trip from Montreal to Quebec was even worse but found out later it was not AC but Jazz.

### Air Canada customer review
Not entirely certain why Air Canada calls itself a legacy carrier. Flew New York Newark to Vancouver and then later on to Los Angeles. Payment for checked in luggage on an international flight is unacceptable. Offering no food (only for purchase) for a 6+ flight is unacceptable. Ground male staff in Vancouver (flight to LAX) was extremely rude and arrogant to most passengers including an elderly gentleman who was confused about payment for luggage. Planes are spotless and its a complete shame since the onboard crew were simply perfect with their service as well as attention to security (far superior to any US airline I used in the last 3 weeks on my USA/Canada tour). No value for money for sure. My future flights will be take in Asian/European carriers to ensure the full service that is expected as a standard.

### Air Canada customer review
Never fly Rouge - I couldn't sit upright. I had to angle my legs for 3 hours because there was almost no space between seats. At check in they ding you $25 per bag so most people try to take it as hand luggage. That causes delays when loading passengers as size rules are not enforced. Plus pay for food and pay for entertainment. Nickel and diming at every turn. I am flying any other airline except this one.

### Air Canada customer review
I fly usual once a year from Toronto via Munich to Izmir/Turkey. All flights have always been enjoyable and the Air Canada crew was just wonderful. Last August the same except: The food was lousy. I rather take my own food in the future. Returning to Toronto the crew did not have enough time to collect the trays and to hand out immigration papers. The crew make a flight a pleasure or a horror.

AC should spend more to improve their food quality on international flights. On a recent trip to India the food served was below international standard on my trip from Germany we travelled with AC partner Lufthansa the food was good very good vs. AC bad. However the entertainment service is better with AC.

### Air Canada customer review
AC Rouge to Samana (Dominican) December 8th returning the 15th 2013. I had never heard of 'Rouge' but was happy that I was flying AC with my 2 boys as they enjoy the TV's in the individual seats and AC is fairly reliable (based on about 4 decades of brand loyalty). I was disturbed to discover that they had taken all the TV's out of the individual seats and we could only access the in-flight entertainment if 1) we had known to download the app before we got on the plane as it won't download on an android phone. 2) Had an I/OS phone or Ipad or 3) rented an Ipad for $10 in flight - which would have amounted to $30 x 2 for the return flight. Staff appeared between about 20 and 25 years old and very immature and unable to make any decisions without asking the 'senior' attendant. They sounded rather robotic and lacked any sense of humour. The pilot never spoke on the way back we had some turbulence and we never heard from him. They offered us 2 free Ipads because I was unimpressed with their inability to entertain people without phones but the system was slow and unresponsive. Flight attendants disappeared for about 40 minutes off the top of the flight - nowhere to be found - very unprofessional. I paid more for my trip to Samana than virtually everyone I spoke to - and they flew other airlines that offered free meals and wine - we got nothing - and only 2 drinks on a 5 hour flight. Plane was delayed at the airport in Samana and then we had to wait about 35 minutes at our gate for a Sunwing plane to move out. I wish I had flown with Sunwing.

Copenhagen-Toronto on a worn out 767-300 though slightly cleaner than the one I travelled on the other direction in May. The 767 has just become outdated cramped and too small for 8+ hrs flights. Adorable lightning in the cabin though. Barely room for carry-on luggage and the wall was freezing! My travel companions IFE did not work (decided to sleep instead). However a few pros as well: Meal was delicious! Staff was nice brought drinks several times. Flight on time excellent connection to LaGuardia (but made it only because of nice AC-staff bringing us in front of the US-immigration line. I have to say the experience on the AC 777-300ER Frankfurt- Montreal in May was somewhat nicer. Wonderful aircraft with lots of space (the "old" 3-3-3 seating in economy) and very nice interior service level fine.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew Vancouver to Sydney November 2013 in a 777. What a great experience. The most space I've had on a long haul flight. Service was efficient and friendly and price was very low. Only slight criticism was the food which was pretty ordinary. All in all though I have no hesitation in recommending Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
This was my first experience with Rouge. My biggest concern and the main reason for the low rating is the training and comportment of the cabin crew. They were all young and obviously inexperienced. The boarding through two doors was completely bungled chaotic because proper procedures were not followed. I heard "boarding completed" reported twice at separate times so obviously there was confusion. They giggled their way through the safety announcements as if they were a private joke. I was left with a very distinct feeling that in case of emergency this crew would be no help at all in evacuation or other procedures. I have never felt that way on a commercial flight before. The Rouge design seems to be on the "hipster" model with banter such as "you will get busted! referring to smoke detectors in the washrooms. Fair enough I guess flights do not have to be sombre to be safe I know from experience. But this needs to be better delivered in the Rouge case. There needs to be an adjustment of crew conduct related a better show of competence. The presence of a more mature (but cheerful!) crew manger would be a big help. I'm sure these are nice deserving young people who work hard and they are trying to make a cramped flight feel lighter. However the balance is not there for me at this point and I just felt generally on my own in case of emergency. I have always felt good about Air Canada and recommended it highly. Rouge needs some rethinking before I can say the same.

### Air Canada customer review
YMM-YYZ-YMM weekly. Usually A319 sometimes A320 seldom E190 high vacation traffic season A321. Check in agents unfriendly Food poor Seats cramped and its always hot on the plane in either direction! Most passengers seem to over do it when it comes to their carry on baggage. This should be policed a lot better. I always only travel with a laptop bag and often there is no room left in the overhead storage compartments. I blame AC for this as they charge for extra check in luggage forcing its passengers to bring on a second carry on. YMM airport waiting area at gates is unacceptable! Pack 125 people in to an area designed for 50 people - standing room only. I hate flying this route but its the best connection to get home. My biggest complaint has to do with the temperature on the plane it is always way to hot to be comfortable. I always ask them to turn down the heat in the cabin but it hardly changes. What could AC do better? Start by asking for feed back from its customers hand out customer review cards to be collected at the end of a flight. Change the menu to higher quality food. Turn the heat down. Charge for the bathroom (Coin Operated) this would reduce the amount of traffic up and down the aisle just after the "Fasten Seat Belt" sign goes out 10 minutes in to the flight. AC has a lot to learn about customer service!

Flew on Sunday Dec 8 Toronto to London Seat 8 F departure 20.05. A worn out seat and the electrical recliner not optimal functioning that requires overhaul. Requested Salmon but sold out however they offered Cod which was not in the menu. Meal quality acceptable. Bread was just not the finest. Desert and Cheese was just poor. Fruit quality just poor quality selected. No sparkling mineral water other than club soda.

I found that the crew were courteous but busy. Service was rushed the seats too crowded and no video unless you knew enough to bring your iPad or rented one. We did not receive any notice that the flight that we originally booked from Toronto to Sarasota on Air Canada was switched to Rouge. It looks like Air Canada is down-grading its comfort items to compete with the low end "vacation" airlines.

### Air Canada customer review
Frankfurt to Toronto. Positive: Customer service was efficient and courteous spacious clean and comfortable aircraft. Negatives: Horrible food - absolutely atrocious - We were served a hot meal shortly after departure and because the flight was booked they ran out of different meal options so by the time they served the back of the cabin not only was the food cold but we were not given any meal options. Apparently there was a chicken dish available but we were served a disgusting pasta Bolognese dish. The roll was stale and the side was some form of potatoes which had been reconstituted from potato flakes. Apparently others on the flight had similar issues with the chicken dish which tasted like rubber and a salad which had wilted. It was extremely disappointing and I did not eat any of it. Later on we were served Air Canada's 'signature' tortilla/wrap by Monty's which also tasted horrible and is worse than a pizza pocket. The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can. I understand that many individuals have varying dietary requirements and allergies but perhaps Air Canada should invest in a dietician or nutritional consultant to encourage healthy eating on the go while meeting the needs of their customers.

Las Vegas to Toronto flight AC1854 and from Toronto to London Heathrow AC868 on 2nd Dec 2013. Just arrived back and I am still so angry with the Canadian staff. Has not left a good impression. 1st flight was delayed which meant transit was a rush and rather than helping all the staff just shrugged their shoulders and rather than helping blamed us! We were sent in different directions and one even told us that we going the wrong way but they would not tell us where to go - just said or more shouted 'read the signs'. The first and last time I will travel with Air Canada. Inflight entertainment was temperamental as well.

Easy connection and on to DFW with AC Express fantastic crews both ways clean and comfortable E75's. Return departed DFW early and into YWG on time. Excellent experience crew were all friendly would gladly travel with AC again.

### Air Canada customer review
Newark-Toronto-Sao Paulo. I was impressed with how punctual Air Canada was on these two segments. In fact it was announced at EWR it would be likely we'd even leave early. Arrivals at both points right on time. Onboard cabin in the E190 felt much more comfortable than the 777-200 down to Sao Paulo. Cabin crew were efficient and polite on both sectors though not particularly warm on the longer overnight. Except for the Brazilian crew member who was all smiles and bubbly. Seat cushioning was a little hard and made it hard to sleep comfortably. Service quick meals average. Crew were present throughout the flight with water runs. I liked that there was On demand IFE even on the shorter segment but what isn't fun is how long it takes to fast forward the numerous ads to get to what you actually want to watch. Coupled with a slightly outdated interface and laggy response - you almost feel like not using the system at all after a while. However the selection was pretty good and varied. Time for an upgrade though - faster and higher res screens would be great.

I was flying Business Class from Ottawa to Montreal with an onward Business Class connection to Fort Lauderdale. For the first time I downloaded my boarding passes to my iPhone. I arrived at the 'bag drop' 45 minutes prior to departure. Admittedly at the point which Air Canada operate a 'cut off' of no more luggage. I had difficulty providing the electronic boarding pass so the extremely unhelpful 'attendant' pointed out my luggage could not be 'checked in'. No attempt to locate the booking at her desk no attempt to help me. Shameful on Air Canada' to employ unhelpful staff who seem to get pleasure from turning customers away. Reassuring for Air Canada and their shareholders that their staff have very little consideration for passengers especially those paying premium cabin fares. I will never fly Air Canada again.

Nov 30th YOW-YYZ. Nov 30th YYZ-SEA. Such a poor service at the check-in counter. They have a couple of staff helping folks to drop off their bags and 3 staff members checking-in passengers and 4 staff members checking-in priority passengers. The regular passenger line was the longest and they took about 15-20 mins to check-in each passenger with 2 check-in bags. I stood in line for 40 mins - I was nervous about missing the flight. I went to priority check-in staff and asked if he could help me as my flight was in 60 mins. He was hesitant but the staff member next to him said "go back to your line" in a rude tone. They should definitely learn to speed up their process better yet learn some manners along the way. We do not expect great customer service but just do the job in the right way.

YEG-YYZ Oct 2013 and YYZ-YEG Oct 2013. Both segments were on-time and overall great experiences. The IFE is top- notch staff service was great and overall a very professional service. But a little frustrating that people that upgrade with points get service before people that pay for the ticket. When I was flying to Brazil it was not this way.

I am currently still at the airport. We were scheduled to fly to Calgary today at 8 am. We arrived at the airport 45 minutes prior to departure. We were told that the flight was closed and that we would have to be put on a later flight. They charged us an additional $150 per person to get on the later flight. That flight was delayed 3 times. We try to find an Air Canada employee several times in order to try to change our travel arrangements but no one was interested in speaking to us. No one was able to tell us why there was a delay. We did not know whether it was weather or equipment related. The level of customer service we experienced today is brutal. Any other for-profit business would be fail if they provided this level of customer service. I will never fly with Air Canada again.

My son/college student booked a 7.30 pm flight from Rochester NY to Montreal QC via Toronto 11/26/13. Arrived at airport at 4 pm found counter unattended told that flight had been canceled. No notification via text/email/phone call. So stranded at airport. After several phone calls - with him calling and waiting over 1/2 hr to be connected then calling me for advice and me in California trying to help him I got on the phone. After 1/2 hr got connected and agent said nothing can be done and that my son's rebooked for next day. They wouldn't rebook on any other airline w/o Air Canada flight numbers even though United and USAir are partners in the Star Alliance. What I'm most upset about is the no notification of cancellation - agent checked and said system shows "text not sent". He talked to supervisor and found out that the system attempted to send a text to my son at 2 pm when the flight was canceled but the text did not go through. For such an important notification as a cancellation and you don't attempt to reach customer.

I have been travelling with this airline since I moved to Canada 13 years ago. The staff remain 'frumpy' 'dealing' sandwiches seats unsuitable for a 6'3" rugby player. Invariably its gates are miles from the concourse. The check-in staff rarely appear pleased to see you. I was flying AC on Black Friday (when power failed on the eastern seaboard). Diverted into Montreal there were the BA and Air France staff marshalling their passengers to coaches to take them to their overnight hotels. Air Canada? When we eventually found someone all they shouted was "get inventive on your cell phones people'. Having slept on the floor the next morning the AC bookings system was down and would be "for 24 hours". I paid for another flight. The food is boring expensive and often stale.

I recently travelled from Calgary by Air Canada. to Salt Lake City through Houston Texas. The flight attendants could not have been more helpful and pleasant. My connection at Houston was tight. Unknown to me they arranged for me to move to the front of the plane so I could be one the first to get off. I was in a wheelchair. The airport worker in Houston dropped the ball and did not take me to my next gate as arranged. As a result I missed my connection and had to wait until the next day to get to Salt Lake City. Air Canada had I felt gone out of their way for me.

Just flew on Air Canada Rouge to LAS. I have to admit I was very disappointed. The service was awful the aircraft was old and dirty. The crew young and the announcements were too familiar and did not sound nice. The flight was 4 hrs 50 and all that was offered was a buy onboard meal and bar. That's it! One time in the cabin 40 min before arrival they offered water and only water. I expected more however you get 10 times better service on Air Canada main line. Given the choice I'd avoid Rouge!

Flew from YYC-EWR-YGK-YYZ-YYC. Flight left on time. It was 60% full mostly people on business but for me it was vacation. Got some apples and some noodle soup. The soup was salty but fine and the apples were surprisingly good. The inflight entertainment system was good and tons of choices. Flight from YGK-YYZ was a 1-1 configuration which was different and no drinks served but only a 50 minute flight and no flight attendant or cockpit door. Flight from YYZ-YYC was an A320 and same entertainment system but the flight attendants gave all the kids on the plane ice cream and cookies left over from the Executive Class passengers.

We have travelled twice with Air Canada Rouge on flights AC1810 and AC811 (A319) to and from Cancun the first and the last time. If you are tall impossible to fit in the seat pitch is the smallest 29 inches only. Being an Air Canada Super Elite members for more than 20 years we were quite disappointed that the usual Air Canada comfort was simply not there. We can accept to pay for food and alcoholic beverages but to be so squeezed that it is not acceptable. If you look to seat pitch offers by Air Canada rouge competitors this is the smallest one. Moreover you have to bring your own tablet for viewing films ans pay 5$ for viewing them! Never again.

Repetitive poor experience with Air Canada flights to and from PHL. Latest issue in regards to canceled flight AC/ZX 7369. It took more than 2 hours for US Air staff and multiple misinformation for passengers (that we will all be re-booked on next flight that they did not have training on Air Canada systems and similar). In any case my spouse had similar issue on the flight from Toronto to PHL in June 2013. So this looks like a pattern. Not impressed and certainly low marks for customer service and customer experience especially with flights from and to PHL.

Toronto-Paris-Toronto. Boeing 777-300 chaotic boarding barely on time doors closed everybody strapped on their narrow pitch less seats waiting at the gate for a quick push-back delayed 45 minutes to reset "the entertainment system" video on demand. Captain apologized for delay promised to everyone in the cabin to step-up on the pedal all the way to Paris to recover that senseless waiting on the tarmac to restore a sub-par VOD programming. Despite the common westerly strong-transatlantic tail-winds captain managed a full hour late on arrival in Paris. Food and deserts distribution in economy as always 10-15 min prior to "drinks" (I must admit "clever" cost-savings). Food quality poor at best including a sort of a snack consisting of a long-expired and tasteless pizza. For years on now they are serving this "successful" pizza wrap. Service in a hurry without any suggested options or alternatives given to passengers reluctance on helping or accommodating passenger requests out of their own- robotic work-routine. On the way back I asked a male flight-attendant what's wrong with featured Flying Map on the VOD that doesn't seem to work at all. The answer: no worries the pilot knows its way to Toronto witty I must admit but that didn't address my request.

Flew economy class from Toronto to Vancouver and back a week later. No free snacks or meal on the plane - just drinks offered a couple of times and some water. Had to pay extra $75 for an overweight bag (over 23 kg) and only allowed 1 bag plus two carry on's. Some servers were clearly not loving their jobs. Rough turbulent approach to Toronto - mind you it was windy. Overall not the best flight(s) and will never fly with them again.

YVR-LAX. Flight AC558 Oct 28 2013. We choose Air Canada to fly to YVR for our 5 days vacation - first and last time. Worst customer service we received. They changed the timing of the plane without notice and when we got to the airport all they could tell us is that they sent us an email and if we didn't get it then it wasn't their problem. Manager was called to help us but after listening to our problem he told us that we could pay $75 per person if we want to go on an earlier flight. First of all they change the flight timing without notice and then instead of help all they show is attitude.

### Air Canada customer review
First trip on Air Canada Rouge Cancun - Toronto October 26. Was interested to see how this new airline looks up close and was surprised at how awful the FA uniforms look in person. The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference! The FA's may be older but they look experienced professional and confident and seem to be enjoying their jobs. I guess it's true you get what you pay for and Rouge is paying peanuts to these kids. The airfare was no bargain either so in future will avoid Rouge at all costs.

YVR-YYZ and YUL-YVR I had a great couple of flights and AC continue to improve their service. Breakfast in the Lounge was great in Vancouver as was lunch in the lounge in Montreal. The FA were a friendly crew and very attentive. In particular a woman serving us on our flight back to YVR was great. I appreciated the selection on the IFE and they made the 5 hour flight go by quickly. I fly AC regularly and the staff seem much happier these days. They even switched aircraft from a 320 to a 321 as they has so many passengers heading to Vancouver.

YVR to SYD Jan 24 2013 Flight was delayed from 23.45 to 02.45 so forked out $50 for Maple leaf lounge which was utterly disappointing. The flight attendants were the best I've come across on a round the world trip. There was a good selection of inflight movies and airshow map was also good. Food was horrible and worse than some low cost carriers. The seat was comfortable and have good legroom. Would fly again.

Flew Vancouver to Toronto after doing a whirlwind trip which included flights on United Hawaiian and New Zealand Airlines as well and found Air Canada to be better than United but nowhere near as good as Hawaiian or New Zealand. Flight attendant was not helpful she wasn't rude but she wasn't any where near friendly. She would just stare at you until you said something then stare at the next flyer not even acknowledge she had heard correctly then started handing out drinks. A simple "What would you like miss/sir? is all that is required but that was too much for her. Customer service is important to me and when it lacks it severely diminishes my views on the product quality of a company.

Flew YVR-HKG return Executive First in September/October. Both flights were really comfortable with flat seats for sleeping. Services were also good on the plane and at check-ins but the food on the plane was really bad. The airport lounges served better food than on the plane! So feed yourself in the lounges before boarding!

AC002 NRT-YYZ. Dated cabin. Rushed service. Indifferent attitude. What can I say? Who needs flight attendants in J class telling you that you cannot have your meal a bit later after the regular service? A crew member in my aisle said no dinner is now. After I politely said that I'd rather eat a bit later (13 hour flight) she replied ok you can wait but it might be cold. She then proceeds to unfold my tray when I am away from my seat. Unfortunately she didn't put my tray completely flat being in such a big rush to keep to her schedule and not wanting to disturb her routine”so on the first use of my knife my entire tray goes flying sending food into the guy across the aisle from me. There I am on the floor picking up bits of food and apologizing to my neighbor. Not good. Honestly when you book a couple days before departure and your ticket (one way) costs US$6200 you can eat when you want. Old outdated audio/visual. Main meal looked like the dogs breakfast. Never again.

Long distance flight to London the TV did not work nor did the reading lights in our section of the plane so we sat for 9 hours in the dark. On the way home we were offered salmon or beef meals but the salmon ran out almost immediately nd the plug on the armrest for sound on the TV was blocked. We were offered 5% off our next Air Canada flight in the next year as compensation. The overall impression is they just don't care.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew to Calgary on Oct 11 with a connecting flight through Vancouver with no major glaring problems. Flights were on time even a bit early. I usually fly with WestJet so I'm used to friendly flight attendants. Boarding this flight was quite a shock. The flight attendant at the front of the plane had a scowl on her face and didn't reply when I greeted her. Later during the in-flight service the same flight attendant asked me if I wanted pretzels. I said "no no pretzels thank you" and she didn't offer me a drink at all. I had to her co-worker for a drink and she looked annoyed that I asked. Cleanliness of the cabin was so-so. The floors were clear and there was no garbage in my seat pocket but the window I was sitting next to was coated in what I assume to be facial grease. Delicious. I'm currently preparing for my flights tomorrow and they have both been cancelled and delayed and now I have a layover in Vancouver for several hours. Even though Air Canada is offering other flights to my destination at an earlier time with several available seats they refused to change my flights. I booked my flights a day early to avoid missing mandatory engagements at my final destination due to many of my friends flying with Air Canada and sharing their horror stories about the service and cancellations/delays. I think its sad that a supposedly professional business can operate in such a manner. Air Canada needs to take lessons from WestJet or CMA on how to manage their passengers and timing schedule if they want my business again.

YYT-LHR 11 Oct 2013 and LHR-YYT 21 Oct 2013. Both segments were on-time and overall great experiences. My only complaint with AC is the lack of legroom in economy (I'm 6'2) but I've come to expect this. The IFE is top-notch staff service was great and overall a very professional service. It was fun to cross the Atlantic in an A319.

Toronto to Varadero. If you are tall 5 ft 10 and over and a little fluffy you will not fit in the seats. I am short 5 ft 4 and not fluffy and I was cramped the seat in front of me felt like it was only 12 inches away from my face. I can not even think of booking Air Canada rouge for my family to fly anywhere as my hubby and son are over 6 feet tall. If you want food entertainment Wifi or a beer all cost and payable with Credit card. My return flight was an hour and half late with no explanation I had a customs form that needed to be filled out and since we left at 11.45 at night it would of been nice to get that form at the start of the flight not at the end of flight when I was woken up and not had my brain intact. The darn seats are cramped for me to purchase again on Air Canada Rouge it would have to be a flight of last resort. Never again.

### Air Canada customer review
Travelled from Vancouver to Asia and back. Transited through Tokyo. In Vancouver the boarding announcements were made in Japanese first followed by Canada's 2 official languages. When I asked at the check in counter they said that the official languages should come first but maybe today was different. Sat in one of the premium seats an exit row seat for more leg room. At 6'3" and 220 lbs I need it. Headphones did not work so pushed button for attendant. Waited a long time and pushed again. The steward showed up and said "You need something" not in a pleasant way but kind of annoyed. Mentioned the problem. He got me another set of headphones they did not work either. His response was to move to another seat and started to walk away as I reminded him that you pay extra for premium seats - he did not care. Service was not good. On the way back the service was better.

### Air Canada customer review
YVR-LAX mid-day on an Embraer 190. Everything about this flight was smooth and efficient. The plane itself is worthy of comment: smooth powerful yet quiet. The newish light-construction seats were very night and afforded me a lot more foot room. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure. It was chaotic with most passengers not certain which queue to join (Check-in Bag Drop Ticketing Self-Check-in) even after they checked themselves in. AC needs to fix this. The fix is easy: have one person out front directing passengers.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada Rouge if this is the future for Air Canada someone else better step up to be Canada's national carrier. The only thing about it that is interesting is the paint job. It was the maiden trip to Cancun and I was actually excited to see what all the promotion was. That died off when I tried to sit in my seat. I figure a man at 5' 11" should be fairly average and thus should be able to fit comfortably. WRONG. The seats are crammed in there there are no electronics in the seats whatsoever so bring a book or be ready to dish out money for old movies or sitcoms. The staff are friendly and polite but some of the 'hip' ways of communicating just don't fit the world of flying. I'm in a plane in the air far above the ocean I want to feel just a touch more professionalism. Air Canada only changed what they had to look at any part of the plane with a touch of detail and you'll see that it's just a gutted plane with very basic changes. The worst part is that by the looks of it Rouge is set to take over more and destinations come 2014. Guess I'll have to drive to Pearson airport so I can fly with anyone else vs using a connector with Air Canada. Sorry but not impressed.

### Air Canada customer review
AC9076 Sep 28 2013. I had a business class ticket from Amsterdam to Toronto hub through Frankfurt. This leg of the flight is operated by Air Canada's Star Alliance Partner Lufthansa. Apparently for flights within the EU there is no differentiation between business class versus economy because when boarding time came this was an absolute 'zoo'. No pre-boarding announcement for business class ticket holders and no priority boarding. So my conclusion is that if you're flying within the EU at least on Star Alliance flights they'll take your money for business class but treat you just like 'cattle class'. Shame on me for expecting something different.

Flew Halifax to Goose Bay on 11 October flight was slightly delayed but time made up. Flight cabin staff good and service good.

### Air Canada customer review
October 14 2013 took flight 847 on 777-300 from Munich to Toronto and then flight 787 from Toronto to Los Angeles later that day. Flight 847 was on a new "High density" 777-300 with 10 abreast seats resulting in narrow seats and reduced pitch to 31". I am 5'10" tall and 170 lbs and the height that aircraft seats were originally made for. It was impossible to reach down and get things from the floor without getting up and bending over. The price of this flight was not cheaper than others and Air Canada did a bait and switch changing the configuration after I purchased the ticket. The cabin crew did their best . The galley for the 400 seats in economy was very small. The food was almost non-existent. Air Canada has the worst food for an international flight I have had. The second meal was a heated wrap essentially a "hot pocket". Inflight entertainment was new system on this plane and was quite good but the second flight had a slow outdated system. Overall service good and AVOD good everything else terrible. Flight 787 was an Airbus A320. Bad AVOD only two bathrooms for economy. Turbulent flight so when not turbulent long lines for lavs. Service Satisfactory everything else not. Hopefully Air Canada will get new 737 MAX equipment with 3 lavs in the rear for these medium haul flights. The Pearson Airport transition with US customs is terrible. Would be better just to have customs in final destination. Canada is not the USA so what benefit is it for the consumer to spend 2 hours of their layover in customs rather than eating and relaxing after Air Canada's horrifying service.

### Air Canada customer review
Air Canada Rouge - Great cabin crew terrible seating space. I flew from Toronto Canada to Varadero Cuba and back. In both directions the cabin crew were excellent and that is where all good about Rouge stops because no matter what these great people do they can not solve issue with lack of space between the seats. Airplane type was A319 and they had 31 raw of seats which basically means no leg room at all. Anyone close or above to 6 feet or 180cm should avoid Rouge flights. Seating pitch on this plane is 29 and this is for flights to Caribbean. After 3.5 hours of flight you will not be able to get out from your seat because of pain in your back and legs. It is so tight between the seats that in my view this is security issue since in case of the emergency people will have extreme difficulties to quickly leave the seat. When it comes to entertainment system there is something called wifi and that has to be paid 10 $ but it did not work so I can say is it worth or not other than this there is no other option. When it comes to food and drinks non alcoholic beverages including coffee and tea are free how ever quantity is limited to one or if you are lucky two drinks at the best. Food and liqueurs can be purchased but for that you will need credit card as cash is not accepted.

YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Both flights arrived on time. Cabin crew friendly. Good in flight entertainment system. Food OK. Check in staff really good. Price better than Air Transat. In short Air Canada staff seem to have ditched their bad union attitude and combined with other flights to YEG and FLL is winning me back.

Flew YYC-YEG-YOW then YQB-YYZ-YYC. Outbound trip was awful. Flight was full of kids and very loud. Staff did absolutely nothing on both flights. On decent to Ottawa flight descended very rapidly flight crew did nothing and there was no explanation for why this happened. Return trip wasn't as bad but still horrible service. Flight was delayed in Toronto for 30 minutes due to crew problems. Plane was a very old A319. Staff were rude and air con didn't work at all. Delayed landing in Calgary by 45 minutes.

October 5 2013 LGA to YYZ. We booked our flights over 3 months ago my husband 8 year old daughter and me. When we arrived at LGA to check in 3 hours before our flight the AC counter representative forced us to check in at the kiosk even though there was nobody in line at the counter! I usually do the kiosk thing but given we had a lot of luggage our child has a broken arm in a cast and we were tired I just wanted to deal with a live person. She refused to check us in at the counter and instead assisted us at the kiosk. She then told us we couldn't have seats together as the plane was full. Not an ideal scenario travelling with an 8 year old child! She said there was nothing she could do. She scolded me for not having checked in online 24 hours prior. I explained to her that was impossible as we were in the middle of the ocean on a cruise and she said oh well and shrugged. What fantastic customer service! Only fly AC as a very last resort.

I flew Air Canada a couple of times recently to Vancouver. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff are very efficient at their work. In serving the meals they are very quick to serve as they have 4 people serving two for the meals and two later for the drinks. After the meal is done we didn't have to wait for long before they came to pick up the trays. I would take Air Canada for long haul flights. Air Canada's service is excellent!

We paid regular fare thinking we would be flying from Toronto to Venice on Air Canada but were on Air Canada Rouge. We will never fly with Air Canada Rouge again the plane was very old there was no entertainment we had to buy our wine and the seats were extremely cramped. We were very disappointed as international flights are usually very pleasant not with Air Canada Rouge.

### Air Canada customer review
Flew in Business Class from FRA via YYz to BNA. A/C from FRA was a 777 already before take off the crew advised that the IFE was not working. They tried a couple of times to re-start it and finally 2 hours before arrival it got done. Things like that happen but no apologies or compensation was offered for a 6000 USD flight. Food was average to low and the crew was rushing through the service with no smile. Bottle of white wine was clearly open for a while the glass was taken away and after my comment about the bad taste no more wine was offered nice way of solving that problem. Transfer in YYZ was easy and good and shortly after boarding the CRJ for Nashville the plane was grounded for technical issues. Had to run to the other end of the airport to get a spare plane 2 hours later and had to wait in a small waiting room with no water or communication on what was going on. AC needs to realise that there is a choice in air travel and that sometimes a smile can make a big difference.

### Air Canada customer review
I fly to Greece twice a year and book on a regular flight going through Frankfurt. But in August of this year had the chance to try Air Canada rouge. I paid the same price as a normal flight and got far less than usual. 1) Plane was old and cold. 2) There was no air control system above the seat. 3) Staff were less than friendly. 4) Cold food tea and coffee. 5) Poor entertainment. 6) I had to interrupt a steward using his phone to ask him to put more toilet paper in the bathrooms. 7) I asked for an extra dinner roll as the pasta was terrible I was told they did not know if they had enough to go around even though the flight was not full I never got the dinner roll. 8) The plane was not very clean. 9) Although I paid the same price as a regular flight I still had to pay for wine. I will never fly AC rouge again. My flight home from Athens was a regular flight and I almost felt guilty with the attention I received. The staff are more mature and know how to communicate with customers. They go out of their way to be available at all times. Their presence is comforting. I will continue flying AC but only on regular flights even if it takes a little longer to get to my destination. By offering AC rouge you have only embarrassed yourself but have taken a few steps backwards in customer service.

We flew Air Canada from Saskatoon to Honolulu via Vancouver. Flight on Air Canada Express from Saskatoon was delayed 1 hour due to supposed thunder storms in the area. Most of the passengers thought it was a faulty red light as there did not appear to be any weather in the area. Flight was very good and we arrived in Vancouver a little late. On both flights the service was excellent. Check in at Saskatoon was very quick and efficient. Flight to Honolulu was one of the best we have ever had. We enjoyed our preferred seating and the Air Canada Lounge in Vancouver.

AC793 Rome-MTL Sep 15th. For the last 12-24 months our many experiences with Air Canada have been nothing but disappointing and far from a world class transporter standard. Both my husband and I are frequent flyers ( I personally take an average of 20 flights a year with Air Canada in North America or Overseas). I don't think it is normal that I have to clean the cabin (remove the cookie crumbs food) off my seat which is filthy stained clean the walls covered with spills and put my blanket on the seat to avoid having to change my clothing when I am heading off to a meeting. Those are things I had to do on my flight from Rome (and the same from Geneva London Paris) The last flight from Rome. The audio system was not working my tablet was broken and the overhead light of our entire row inoperative. We had paid for Business tickets and were standby so I paid an extra for preferred seat so I could have room for my injured knee the leg room was fine but I can tell you that the experience wherever you sit Economy or Business it is always the same: prepare a few napkins and sanitizer so I can have a decent place to sit before the flight. Staff had a condescending attitude!

Air Canada Rouge: Venice to Toronto Aug 24th AC 1907. It is the first time I have ever sent back the main meal. The pasta was rock hard and tasted like cardboard. They wanted to charge for the wine. I complained and the steward gave it to me for free. The service was barely there. Very few service rounds to pick up garbage. The seats were uncomfortable. Do not fly with this airline.

We flew Rouge from Toronto to Athens on Sept 8/13 and returned on Sept 27/13.There was no on board entertainment or controls for airflow. I now know this was disclosed on their web site but this was not disclosed at the time I purchased our tickets. The food was awful. The "hot snack" consisted of a dry wrap in a box which was horrible. There was a large box under the seat in front of me (any many other seats). This meant I had very little leg room and for such a long trip it was very uncomfortable. The washrooms were dirty and there weren't enough of them. The cabin crew were trying to be friendly and did their best but I would not choose Rouge again.

Flew on Embraer 190 from SFO to YVR and have to say that the FA was absolutely the best I have experienced. Service was top notch. Had no problems with the inflight entertainment system either. If you are going to be flying executive first on EM190 try and book a seat on the left side of the cabin since you will have the half of the aircraft to yourself.

### Air Canada customer review
YYZ-KIN-YYZ. Flew Air Canada's discount division Rouge to Kingston. Flight was packed on the outbound and boarding was chaotic due to passengers returning with copious purchases and multiple suitcases and carry-ons. Flight attendants are all new hires and so lack most of the basic skills expected of them. I purchased an extra leg room seat in one of the first four rows. Be aware that KIN check in agents will fill these seats with mothers and babies if you think you're getting a bit of respite. For purchase food selection was missing the healthy items inbound and outbound. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes when customer traveling with parent and 7 relatives including 3 newborns had not made proper arrangements for oxygen and crew struggled to deploy the onboard oxygen using FA manuals to sort out the issues. Lost connection meant 3 hour wait and midnight arrival in YOW. Rouge is not Westjet. Comments from customer below about her YUL to Athens flight neglected to mention that it too was a Rouge flight.

### Air Canada customer review
YVR-LHR. I decided to return to the UK direct rather than via Europe. Plus points: flight left on time and arrived early even with a short hold before landing. Also Air Canada has a 3x3x3 configuration on its 777-300s rather than the 3x4x3 used by many other airlines. Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless. Continental breakfast' comprised a small muffin and a small container of fruit - insufficient for a flight of 9 hours duration. The AVOD was ok with a wide choice available. I may well go to Canada again but will avoid Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
YYZ-NRT-YVR using B777 / A330 in Executive First. Trip started off nice enough but ended in a cancellation and a forced delay of 1 day. I flew off peak hours so I benefited from a quick check-in with a personable agent. The YYZ-NRT boarding was the usual rush of pax. It would be nice if AC moved the priority lane to one side and it was better labelled so people don't accuse priority boarders of pushing in the line. Not a full flight so FAs had an opportunity to take their time and provide decent service. Food and beverages better than usual and overall I have noticed AC has shown some improvement in its food quality in the past year. Unfortunately the wine selection is still hit and miss. The seat showed its age and was well used. The IFE selection was boring and I resent the forced commercials. It was a good flight and I was able to catch a few hours of sleep. The problem was with the return flight. It was cancelled due to equipment issues. It happens but it seems to be an increasing scenario at AC. The AC response to the issue was disorganized and slow. Personnel tried their best. The end result was hours wasted at the airport until AC sent Pax off to a hotel. Communication was poor. The concierge in NRT was professional although it took some time to get an answer. The lady in YVR who assisted was also professional and kind. Unfortunately the replacement flight the next day was also beset by equipment issues as the air conditioning system wasn't working well and the cabin was stuffy and hot for the flight to YVR. However FAs on this flight were the best I have had on AC. I seem to be encountering an increasing number of equipment issues and delays with AC. I have only recently started using the airline again on my long hauls and I am not particularly impressed by this aspect of its operations.

### Air Canada customer review
I rarely take this airline and on September 12 2013 from LGA to YOW I know why I avoid this carrier whenever possibly. Stupid decisions in difficult (weather) situations are not usually typical of A 4 star airline. I travel weekly in North America and I would rate several domestic carriers far superior. Over priced costly flexibility and staff that at times act condescending does not equate to a top rated airline.

LAX-YYZ upgraded to executive class. Number 1 staff in the industry. AC still holds standards high for FA appearance. This crew was most professional and looks the best in North America. Keep it going AC and you will get awards for North-American airline on top of your international awards. IFE didn't function in my seat staff however did everything possible to keep me comfy.

NRT-YYZ on Sep 16. There was a supposedly a typhoon in Tokyo so flight was delayed 2 hours. I think the food is getting worse since my last flight! One of the offerings was a mini sandwich with simply cucumber and mayonnaise. The apples for breakfast did not look fresh. They were brown already so it was not appetizing! Air Canada's IFE is good lots of good movies to choose from! Cabin crew is where Air Canada really need to improve on their international flights! Although at least 70% of the crew were very pleasant there are some of the older ladies who just seemed like they were above it all. One hostess was emotionless when distributing food she just put it straight on our table and left.

Took Air Canada on our flights from Zurich via Toronto to Mexico City and return all business/first: On long haul flights over the Atlantic (both ways). Entertainment system broke down regularly on both Atlantic flights (several restarts necessary for the whole cabin). No coffee or tea on overnight flight for breakfast (customers were very happy about that). Headsets are fixed to infrastructure - cable in my face. Both toilets in business class with no water for handwash after 2 hour flight. Seats and surrounding not very clean. Meals: just the absolute necessity but not an inch more! Compared to Swiss Emirates Singapore or Lufthansa business class: not worth the money and real hygiene problems!

Latest flight YVR-YYZ. Flight was overbooked (as usual) therefore it took awhile before I got my seat. No food despite the fact it is a 4.5 hour flight. Airplane was old seats were not leather. No complaints about the crew. TV screen in the seat in front so that was good. Ticket price - $335 OW if purchased RT - no discount. Barely any legroom.

San Francisco-Vancouver-Tokyo-Calgary-San Francisco 8/25/13-9/7/13. Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. The agent in San Francisco was extremely rude and unfriendly to all the passengers she served including us. The flight attendants particularly on the return flight from Tokyo were also rude to passengers to the point of eye-rolling with polite requests for drinks. I fly often and have not experienced this degree of rude service both on the ground and in the air in many years.

Flight from YYC to IAH in Executive Class was just OK. Food was horrible but the flight service director did his job well. Flight from CUN to YYC in Executive Class was one of the best flights I've been on. The food on this segment was much better but what made is so great was the cheerfulness and helpfulness of the flight service director. Drinks were always topped up and staff made sure everyone was comfortable and asked if there was anything else they needed even though it was a full flight. A pleasant surprise from Air Canada.

### Air Canada customer review
I fly regularly on the Boston to Toronto route and Air Canada always disappoints. On my most recent trip I tried to check my bag in at the gate which I have done many times before) because I didn't want to have to lift my bag into the overhead bin on the plane as I am 7 months pregnant. I was told not to do that since the bag was small and there was plenty of space on the plane and someone would help me. When I got on the plane and asked the steward if he could help me put my bag up in the overhead bin he took a look at my bag and asked 'Is it really that heavy?'. He told me a passenger would help me! Just downright rude. They always seem to set the bar for the worst customer experience whether it has been when I have missed a flight or their policies with respect to gate checking strollers and car seats. They are by far the worst airline to travel with children.

Terrible flight to and from Greece. Freezing cabin and rude stewardesses. Food worst I have tasted. Seats very uncomfortable asked for blankets and was asked if I was sick? We had exit rows and they would not turn down the air conditioning. The entire plane was freezing. Then when we arrived in Montreal to connect to Toronto they said the flights were cancelled and they would have to see what they could do the next day. My son had taken another flight and was left waiting at the airport in Toronto for us. They were not willing to help or guide and people were scrambling to try to get out on a flight that evening to Toronto. Every year we say never again this experience was the last straw.

ADB-IST-YYZ-YUL return in economy on 14 August. First flight on Turkish from Izmir code share. Even though a code share flight they couldn't give me my AC boarding passes and told me my luggage would go through to Montreal but I had to check in at AC in Istanbul. Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices. Bags didn't make it to YYZ Turkish Airlines fault but AC was very good about getting them to me in Ottawa to my hotel 2 days later. Transfer to YUL smooth good short flight. Return flights again on AC from YUL-YYZ-IST on 23 Aug very good great service by caring crew as outbound. Equipment change again in IST to ADB on THY code share seat changed. Flight short and ok. Overall Air Canada has a great product as I have flown this route over the last 10 years using Turkish Airlines Air France KLM and Lufthansa. The price I paid was cheaper then the rest the flight attendants are what made the difference so nice and accommodating as well as good food for economy. I will keep using AC now that they are flight to IST from Canada.

Flew from Toronto to Sydney on 7th September. Flight left Toronto at 8.25pm. We were in transit in Vancouver which was 4.5 hrs flying. What we were offered for dinner when we boarded in Toronto was a snack which had to be paid. Then when we arrived in Vancouver all our cabin luggage had to be taken with us and reboard the same plane to the same seats. This was really inconvenient from the passengers point of view. By the time we were served a proper meal was 2.30am Toronto time. Toronto to Sydney just the flying time was 20 hrs. That kind of a meal service for such a long flight is not acceptable.

YVR-YOW-YVR. Breakfast flight to Ottawa on an Airbus 320. I had breakfast in the AC lounge and it was good the wireless needs to be upgraded as it was very slow and the YVR wireless was much faster. Our FA on the flight was very attentive and the breakfast service was excellent. Delayed 45 minutes landing in Ottawa due to a thunderstorm. On my return journey I enjoyed my stay in the lounge with good food and a glass of quality wine but again the wireless was slow and I gave up using it. The return flight was an Airbus 319. There was only one FA with us in the front cabin and she did the best she could being short handed with a full cabin. She was friendly and otherwise I enjoyed my trip. The meal was excellent and she offered a special liqueur service which was appreciated by many in the front cabin. My other suggestion is that on the IFE you get more documentaries old comedy TV shows and classic films. These must be reasonably inexpensive. Because I travel so much with them I sometimes run out of choices. However for both I paid an executive class fare and I got good value for what I paid.

19th Aug London to Toronto. Flight was fine though staff seemed too few and too busy to deal with passengers. The next leg 5 days later we checked in for online Toronto to Los Angeles we were asked to pay for our cases to check in $75 not expected. The flight though was very poor. Our return trip on the 2 Sep from LA to Toronto was just as bad but the Toronto to London was the worst. Too many people getting on with oversized bags and being allowed too plane was very over crowded. also our inflight entertainment wasn't working in any of our 3 seats the staff just shrugged their shoulders and handed out contact details for customer service. The plane was old and dirty we will not be using Air Canada again.

YXE-YYZ-DUB-CPH CPH-YYZ-YXE in economy. Paid an excellent price for this route. Flight to Toronto uneventful good service flights on time. Air Canada is my first choice for transatlantic flying but after 2 flights in my itinerary I will definitely reconsider especially the one to Dublin. It's not that the flight was uncomfortable the entire experience was just average. Flight attendants seemed uninterested and the plane was probably the oldest in the fleet. The arm rest of my seat had something that looked like industrial-strength foil holding parts together. I think this flight is over-looked since it is a seasonal route. This route is also being transferred to Rouge next year so maybe it'll improve. CPH-YYZ absolutely no problem newer aircraft friendly flight crew. Boarding at CPH was somewhat interesting - over 200 people left to sit in the hallway and departure lounge only opened shortly before boarding. YYZ-YXE late leaving YYZ due to an issue with the cargo door. No problem - safety first. Next time: Lufthansa!

I flew YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. The YYZ-FRA portion was operated by an AC 777-300 aircraft. This was on July 23 2013. I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal came quickly and in general it was a good flight!

AC 895 Dublin Ireland to Toronto. Good check in staff. Flight on time. Booked Air Canada ahead of other airlines. Expected good service as the National Carrier but was very disappointed. Food not up to much and cabin crew did not make much of an effort. They seemed quite bored. Return flight AC894 Fast check in and very courteous. Flight was awful due to weather conditions. Food very boring and small portions. Breakfast was a slice of banana bread and juice / tea / coffee. Planes are very old on this route. Air Canda will have to up their game next year when Aer Lingus start operating! Certainly no value for money.

Flight on 22nd August 2013 Dublin to Toronto and return on 30th August. Cabin crew very grumpy. Food okay on outward journey. Films okay. Interior of cabin grubby. Wasn't expecting that from AC. Return journey encountered bad weather food service was delayed a considerable time due to safety issues so when it finally arrived it was hardly palatable. I noticed a lot of unfinished meals going back. Banana bread for breakfast hardly constitutes a meal. Toilets were very grubby and towel bin held closed with masking tape which eventually fell down. I will not rush out to fly with AC. I will fly Aer Lingus next time.

LHR-Toronto-LHR. Day flight from Heathrow wasn't too bad. Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC. Luggage showed up though and we arrived in once piece and on time so a couple of marks gained there.
