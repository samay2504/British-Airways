### "cabin was nicely decorated"
Bangkok to Yangon with Myanmar Airways. The ticket was quite expensive compared to other airlines on this leg, but paid the amount as I wanted to try them out. Arrived at the airport with literally no line with ground staff asking for details regarding my visa and return flight as I would leave the country via another airline. Flight was delayed by about 40 minutes upon departure. The cabin crew were very friendly and the cabin itself was nicely decorated with some xmas decorations. The legroom however was very very poor and definitely less than most LCC carriers. On board wifi available to use their app and some content on their app, but very limited. Complimentary drink and snack which was passable for a short flight. Luggage took a while to be on belt.

### "a pleasant surprise"
Bangkok to Yangon. What a pleasant surprise. Clean aircraft. Pleasant, professional and efficient crew. On-time performance. Tasty snack for the short flight. Even the pre-flight service was great - email requests for special requests were answered within an hour. True 5-star service.

### "it did not disappoint"
Bangkok to Yangon retjurn in mid-May. This is my first experience with this airline and it did not disappoint. The check-in at the airport for both flights were uneventful, efficiently handled and most notably, having little or no queues, which is always a welcomed sight when there are snaking queues at neighbouring counters for other airlines. The boarding for the outgoing flight started a little after the scheduled time. The planes do not have any seat-back entertainment units but for the outgoing flight, there was onboard wifi which allow you free access to a selection of movies and TV shows on the MAI app which can be pre-loaded onto phones, Ipads, etc. The selection was limited. For a 65-70 min flight, it is impressive that the cabin crew is able to come round with wet tissues followed by a meal and drinks service. The cabin crew were polite and cheerful. The captain made announcements regularly which were spoken in clear English.

### "very nice airline and quick operations"
Flew Myanmar Airways from Mandalay to Yangoon on an A319 on 8 March 2017. Initial flight, which was on an older ATR72, was delayed 1 hours and 20 minutes. I was informed about this instantly when arriving at check-in in MDL. Upon request, I managed to board an earlier flight (a more modern and quicker aircraft) after a bit waiting at check-in. Service impeccable. Less than 20 passengers. Full catering service including food, beer, softdrinks and hot-drinks. Clean aircraft, observant and fast working staff. Arrived 40 minutes prior to schedule with the original flight which was said to be “likely further delayed”. They accept special meals and my seafood meal. The meal was confirmed but I had, upon consent, to forsake it as I took an earlier flight. Very nice airline and quick operations.

### "kind and focused service"
Flew Bangkok to Mandalay return in  November 2016. Faultless, punctual travel on a A319. Huge business class seat extremely wide and well upholstered. We were 5 passengers in business class which had 2x2 seats in two rows. Pre-departure Moet champagne, thereafter frequent drink rounds. Exotic, cultural, intense, truly kind, and focused service. Good food and snacks. FA apologised (!) for the food being loaded in Bangkok and this could not keep fully up to their expectations. Special meal accommodated and reconfirmed by check-in staff. Food good. No IFE. Pleasant trip. Rebooked free of charge on a discounted business class ticket. Misleading info on homepage on Visa on Arrival in Myanmar cost me time and money. Lack of ability to accomplish purchases of business class tickets directly online is a big fault letting me into the arms of OTA’s. This pulls 1 point back. Otherwise 10/10.

Very clean aircraft. The cabin crew were very attentive and nice. Seat pitch was good, aircraft cleanliness was OK, but could use improvement. The inflight meals were sufficient for a one hour flight, I was served a chicken sandwich. The presentation of the food was good, and it also tasted nice as well. Overall, I would recommend this airline to anyone who is trying to visit Myanmar for a cheap price.

NYU to RGN. First told flight would not be direct then 1 hour delay then flight cancelled. They book us on the evening flight with another airline. Story of operational issues with plane seemed less than truthful. Airline needs to improve reliability if they wish to serve and attract international passengers. Airline website lacks any real time flight status. At checking everything done with paper and pen. I noticed a number of passengers whose reservations they could not find. Good idea to print out receipt when you book and have it with you. Staff were helpful as they could be under the circumstances.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
RGN to Mandalay. Airfare considerably less than other airline. Flight was on a new airbus. Check-in while chaotic went well. Lots of airport staff. Everything was done manually with paper and counters. Cabin crew well dressed and pleasant. Flight was comfortable and on time.

Flight RGN-TVY-MGZ on an old ATR. Plane very worn from the inside and outside. Cabin crew very friendly and efficient. Small snacks and drinks offered on each sector. Recommended.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
BKK-RGN all economy flight. Short connection from our late arriving EK flight from DXB was made easier by a meet and greet at the arrival gate to the transit MAI check in. Easy boarding for a 60% full flight changed seat row after takeoff fairly elderly A 319 showing its age light snack and drink on the short 1 hour flight. To our surprise all our luggage made the short transfer and arrived after BHX/DXB/BKK/RGN first on the carousel.

About a 3 hour flight from Guangzhou to Yangon and back. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour with no explanation or apology (as I remember). A friend who regularly flies with MAI on that route told me Guangzhou airport delays MAI every time in favour of Chinese airlines. No delay on the return route. Crew's English varied from very poor to very good but were all very friendly. No inflight entertainment but I would fly MAI again largely thanks to the friendly crew and the convenient flight times on that route.

SIN-RGN-SIN. With the JetStar codeshare I actually ended up on a JetStar plane for the outbound leg for less than JetStar was charging - and this cheaper price included a meal drinks including beer and a checked bag! There were MAI FAs alongside the JetStar FAs providing different levels of service and all in all it was an effective and nice flight only about 2/3 full. On the return it was a fully booked flight operated by MAI. Nonetheless service was just as attentive the food was good enough and the plane was clean and well maintained if a little on the old side. Ground staff boarding and baggage in both SIN and RGN were fantastic all flights on time. I only give them a 9 because of lack of IFE though for a 3 hour flight I may be being picky and do remember you are flying into a country that is still under sanctions. I will definitely take them again.

SIN-RGN-SIN. I found the service really pleasant. The crews are friendly provide decent meals even though it's a short flight.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
I travelled to Bangkok recently. Disappointed with the service provided on both sectors of the flight. The hostess rushed through the service in an unprofessional manner even though it is a 2 hours flight. On the return sector from Bangkok to Singapore the hostess even overlooked and missed serving us the meal and drink! When I informed the hostess about it they just stared at me and offered no apology for their mistake. The service is not up to standard and FA's are unfriendly and need to improve on the service training!

RGN-SIN-RGN in Economy Class. Very satisfied with the whole experience - clean newish plane with Bulgarian Flight Crew. Cabin crew service was friendly and efficient and the food was pleasant. Both flights left on time and were uneventful.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
BKK-RGN and return a few days later. Both flights left on time friendly cabin staff snack and hot drink served on a flight of just over 1 hour.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
YGN-PNH (via REP). Flight was almost full. Meal service on YGN-REP sector - decent meal and drinks service. No IFE but the Mingalabar magazine was interesting enough. Transit in REP was fine straight through to the international departure hall which has a range of shops and internet access. Second leg much shorter although a drinks run was provided. Lounge access at YGN ($8) is total worth the cost. Flights on time crew friendly.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
RGN-REP-PNH-RGN both on Airbus A320 and price was $250. RGN-REP was comfortable and roomy food was a full service meal for a 1.5 hrs flight! However the leg room was a bit tight and the seats small. REP-PNH was also roomy and comfortable with peanuts and cold drinks for a 35 min flight. PNH-RGN was full but again served a full service meal. The cabin crew spoke great english excellent service with full attention to the passengers. Will definitely fly with them again!

### Myanmar Airways customer review
BKK-RGN on A319 leased together with crew from Air Mediteranee. Spotlessly clean plane but the leg space is just horrible so cramped (tall passengers will really suffer)! Luckily it is only a 1 hour flight. Service great and food ok. Plane left on time so overall nothing to complain about.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
I have flown Myanmar Airways several times in the last couple years. I have found the service to be fine on the ground and in the air. The flight which originates in Singapore and flies through Bangkok to Yangon is exceedingly tight and uncomfortable. However flights originating in Yangon are comfortable and roomy. In general prices are lower than for Thai and Bangkok Air making it a good deal.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
Yangon to Bangkok . Although the flight left two hours late we were kept well informed in the departure lounge at Yangon International Airport. The plane was a Druk Air A319 with Bhutanese flight crew and Myanmar cabin crew. The plane was spotlessly clean and the service and meal provided both excellent.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
Bangkok to Yangon return. Departing journey was OK plane interior was quite shabby and needed a refit. The food could have been better. FAs were good at their job very friendly. The return flight was better the interior was better with Air Bagan logos they served a continental breakfast which was very good. There was no problem with weight excess baggage was waived.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
I have flown Myanmar Airways four times and the service is friendly personable and pleasant - but the aircraft are shabby and the Business Lounge really sucks. The receptionist doesn't seem to really bother with the premium class passengers she is supposed to attend to.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
Bangkok to Yangon in November this year and was pleasantly surprised - not really by the condition of the aircraft (B737 ex Turkish Pegasus Charter jet) inside (narrow seats in Economy old outdated seats in Business Class) but by the fact that we were only 6 passengers on this aircraft and the service by the several flight attendants was really friendly and efficient. Food not really good in comparison to Thai Airways but well you cannot have everything.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
As a regular flyer to Yangon airport I can't understand the 3 star rating for the business lounge facilities. If any food is available that day it is of very poor quality - and should you require a drink there's only a very limited selection of non alcoholic beverages. There are no separate business lounge toilet facilities - and the hostess is usually far too busy talking on the phone to be bothered with any form of customer care.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
Flew Myanmar Airways to Yangon from Bangkok. Many people in economy so I upgraded - cost was 31 dollars US. A one hour flight - excellent hot meal very good service - even got my own bus from gate to plane. Beats any US carrier.

### Myanmar Airways customer review
Flew Myanmar Airways for around 3 to 4 times a year. Well a small regional airlines but I would say its services are rather great! The best thing I love about is its exterior designs of the plane. Really colorful and nice. Economy services are okay. But need to improve on the inflight entertainment. There are just books newspapers etc. to read only. Food not too bad except for the flights flying out of KLIA. I wonder why. Cabin staffs are a wonderful bunch of people. For business class I wonder what are the differences between it and the economy class. Just that you get more leg room space and the seats are wider. Above all the airlines is rather great really having the Burmese touch above in the air.
