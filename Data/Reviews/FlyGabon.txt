### "an excellent flight"
Not Verified |  Apart from the usual lateness which one comes to expect from some regional airlines this was an excellent flight. The aircraft was practically brand new and the cabin crew were professional. Between booking and the actual flights it had changed its name from Afrijet to FlyGabon.
