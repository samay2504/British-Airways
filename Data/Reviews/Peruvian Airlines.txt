### \"basically stole my money"
These people basically stole my money. My flight from Cusco to Lima was cancelled at the very last moment, and because I had a connecting flight to catch from Lima to Europe and the Peruvian staff did not offer any help whatsoever to find a flight that would allow me to catch the flight to Europe, I was forced to buy a new ticket with another airline. I did that because I figured risking losing the overseas flight would end up costing me more. But Peruvian staff on site told me that I could ask for a reimbursement of the new flight that I bought through their customer service later on. I have of course done that, and sent them quite a few e-mails in the meantime, but not received any response to this. I get a strong impression that they are very much used to handling customers this way. They are thieves!! This is criminal what they are doing but if you are in another continent it's difficult to persecute them and I guess they know that. Absolute worst, I had two other flights with them during this journey which were both also delayed by at least a couple of hours, fortunately in those cases I did not get into trouble with connecting flights though. In the meantime LATAM flights all seemed to be flying on time so that's who I'll fly with next time I go to Peru.

### "One of the worst"
I had a flight with Peruvian airline from Cusco to Lima in May, (traveling with my one-year-old son) and two international flights, starting from Lima. I had bought the tickets separately each from the respective airline directly, with five-hour breathing room in Lima to catch my international flight. Long story short, Peruvian airline was four hours late. They refused to send me with LATAM that had several flights from Cusco. They lied about the extent they were going to be late. And when I asked them to return my luggage so I could buy a ticket with LATAM, they all went to lunch and didn't return for another 1.5hours. On top of that, the staff was very rude and verbally aggressive. Needless to say, I missed my flight and buying a new ticket last minute, plus an overnight hotel, etc. cost me over $1400 USD. Peruvian airline keeps saying it's not their responsibility. Big warning about this airline. One of the worst, if not the worst on the planet!

### "canceled flight and no refund"
They canceled my flight and no refund. My boyfriend and I booked tickets from Cusco to La Paz for 12/02, just on 07/02 I received an email saying that the flight was canceled. Reason? From that moment on, they were no longer flying to La Paz. We were already in Cusco when I received the email, so we looked for a customer service point. Arriving, we were super poorly attended, the lady who answered us checked the system that was really canceled, was when we knew the reason, and could not do anything. We had to swallow it dry, for to make a scandal was not going to do any good. We returned for our stay and started looking for air tickets again. Great illusion, at that time of the championship prices were very high and schedules that did not favor us, because from La Paz we went to Uyuni where we had reservations that we did not want to have to change them. Anyway, we had to buy same bus tickets and face 14h of travel. We put it in our head that if it was happening this way it was because it was supposed to be like that and in the end we were saving. I contacted them as requested in the e-mail I received advising about the cancellation, to this day nothing, I only receive automatic responses. I already sent to the emails available on the site and also nothing, these nor automatic response I receive. The phones look like nonexistent. I do not know what to do to get my refund.

### "canceled without notice"
Not Verified |  The flight was canceled without any notice. They offer no replacement solution and no refund at all. They are the only airline to link Bolivia to Peru so there was no other way to go to Cusco other than a 12 hours bus ride. I missed my connection and had to pay a thousand dollars ticket to go back home and miss a day at work. This is scandalous, never book Peruvian Airlines.

### "airline is a headache"
Our flight from Cusco to Lima was cancelled without warning because of "weather". It was lightly raining, and no other airlines were experiencing delays or cancellations. When pressed, the agent admitted additional restrictions are placed only on Peruvian Airlines by the government. Their airplanes are all over 25 years old, and they have experienced multiple accidents in recent years, which is likely why they are unable to fly when conditions are not optimal. The airline could not confirm when the next flight would be, refused to rebook us on another reputable airline, nor would they refund our ticket. The website also doesn't allow you to check in from a mobile device. Don't be caught by the low prices, this airline is a headache at best, and dangerous at worst.

### "Avoid at all costs!"
Not Verified |  On 25.4.19 we booked our flight for a 3-day trip to Arequipa from Lima with Peruvian. The flight got canceled due to bad weather - that happens. The "solution" Peruvian offered was a flight 2 days later! No compensation for the lost time, the extra effort, the missed tours, not even a hotel to stay for the night or transport. It was 11pm when the flight got canceled (announcement was Spanish only, just FYI) and midnight until we could leave the airport. Well, thanks for that. Peruvian is a mere joke of an airline,  on behalf the customer. Avoid at all costs!

### "worst airline I've taken"
I chose Peruvian as the main way to travel in South America, we booked 3 flights: Lima to Arequipa,  Cusco to La Paz,  La Paz to Lima. all 3 flights got canceled and for 2 of them, there isn't any alternative flights to replace. The worst thing is they didn't inform the cancellation of the first flight at all and they inform the second and third ones less than 12h. We had no choice to change our travel plan and even had to book another flight back to Lima to catch the flight back to LA. We went to the office trying to get the refund and compensation but all the information we got is to send a mail to get the refund (including their original cancellation mails). On their term and condition, they will proceed the refund within 20 days but my first mail was out more than 20 days, I still got nothing. Two of my friends got an autoreply mail asking them to submit the refund with a URL but that URL doesn't work with any browsers. No one answer the customer service call. It just make people feel they are trying ignore all the refund requests. The reason why they couldn't do the second and third flight is because they had an incident while landing in La Paz but the incident happened on 11/22 and our flights are on 11/25 and 11/29. they don't event try to let the passengers aware the situation to make any changes. This is definitely the worst airline I've taken. I lost my original trip plan, booked transportation, hotel and spend more because of them but they don't event try to comfort us.

### "Will never fly again!"
Peruvian Airlines is the worst airline I have booked with till date. 2 flights have been cancelled in last 5 days without any notification. My Cusco to La Paz flight was the worst thing as there is no other direct option on this route, which meant I had to buy a last minute flight through Lima at a massive cost. Peruvian Airline first offered us to take us to La Paz through a bus which later didn’t happen as they claimed there was a protest in one of the town enroute. Will never fly again!

### "aircraft over half empty"
Cusco to Lima. On October 18 I approached the desk of Peruvian air to ask if I could fly on that day instead of the ticket date, the attendant said there is no problem and directed me to their office. At the airport, I went there and the clerk said there is no problem, she informed me that I would have to pay a 47 dollar rebooking fee to which I agreed. soon after she spoke to a supervisor she ask me to comeback at 2 PM and confirm the flight, I agreed even though I wanted to pay for the rebooking then and there she refused to accept my payment and asked me to come back at two because there was a probability that the flight was going to be cancelled. I came back five minutes to two and waited, finally, after I went the front desk and asked for assistance they told me that the person at the office was late coming back from lunch, so I waited and the clerk showed at 2:25 PM and went in to his office to open the computer site, It took about ten minutes and, mind you the flight was to depart around 3:20 Pm he spent about 15 minutes supposingly checking the flight load factor. He finally told me that the flight was fully booked and there were two unclaimed seats that he could book me on if I pay 151 extra dollars. I paid up. Proceeded to the gate, went onboard, sat in the assigned seat and waited to feel how lucky I had been to get a seat not minding the price I had to pay. Waiting for the door to close and the rest to the people come on board I was surprised that the aircraft was over half empty.

### "Use with extreme caution"
Cusco to Lima. I would not suggest using this airline at all. They will bump your seats or cancel the flight without any warning. There is a lack of communication and transparency. Nor do they have any empathy. Use them with extreme caution as they are not reliable which can interrupt other flights and travel plans which can be very costly. LATAM seems to be more efficient and reliable.

### "caused me so many problems"
Pucallpa to Lima. This has been my worst experience with an airline. I was traveling from Pucallpa on 24th July 2018 to Lima. The flight should have been at 16:10 and I was at the airport more than two hours before the flight. When I arrived together with my friends, my flight was not listed on the departure screens, and when finally the Peruvian staff got available, I was informed, that there was a delay 5 hours. However, I was checked in and knew I would not make my connection flight from Lima back to Europe at 8PM. I was forced to buy a new ticket, which cost me 700 USD. Not only that the new flight got me too late for my work and I lost a customer because of this. At the airport - the staff did not know any information about the flight nor the plane nor even when there would be the departure. Instead, we kept being promised (lied) that the flight will depart another hour later and later on again and again. In the end, the flight departed only at 23:45. This caused me so many problems with no compensation whatsoever, no apology, no support at the airport, no interest in the customer. This was for the last time I used services of this airline.

### "delay and lack of service"
❌ Not Verified |  Cuzco to Lima. Puntualidad y Servicio" meaning punctuality and service? I had neither. My flight was delayed over 1.5 hours and there were no announcements made in the Cuzco airport. Nothing on the screen displays. No online status update, not even the option to check flight status on the Peruvian Airlines website. I spoke to a Peruvian airlines rep in the airport multiple times, in English and Spanish, and she could not tell me what was going on or when the flight was expected to land. I told her I had an international transfer in Lima along with checked luggage. All she could do was give me the "yikes" look and there was nothing else to do. While boarding the flight, the flight attendants took down all of my information and tried very hard to get something worked out ("perhaps Peruvian airlines can reimburse you for your missed flight" etc). The same unhelpful airport rep as previously mentioned came aboard and told me that she sent an email to Peruvian Airlines staff in Lima and that once I landed, they would help me. Upon landing, I went to the Peruvian Airlines desk, and they had no idea who I was and were completely unhelpful stating "I don't know how they do it in the Cuzco, there's nothing we can do. I ended up having to spend $300+ changing my connecting flight, taking a taxi, and paying for hotel accommodations due to this delay and lack of service. I will never fly with Peruvian Airlines again and would not recommend anyone else do so.

### "Worst experience ever"
La Paz to Lima. Worst experience ever. They were late by 3 hours due to 'weather issues', which, we learned later, were just light rain and to really poor organisation. They said we would be fine for our connexion and that they would do the necessary arrangements for us at Lima. But they didn't. First lie. Then they said we would be reimbursed our missed flight. Second lie, we never were! They let us down at Lima with no flight options, no help whatsoever, they just didn't care at all. We had to buy new ticket to get out of there for a high price. I can't believe this happened but we weren't alone, many people were in the same situation as us. This seems like a very well organised fraud. Never ever fly with them if you have other options.

### "horribly disappointing experience"
La Paz to Lima via Cusco. I chose Peruvian Airlines as it was the only flight that suited my schedule. When we arrived at the La Paz International Airport, we queued in line for 1.5 hours even though there was only about 20 people in front of us. Once we reached the front, we were informed that there would be a delay of 2 hours. Having flown Peruvian a few times, this was not unexpected. However, after waiting in the gate area for about 3 hours, a staff member came to inform us that the flight was cancelled and we were to proceed back to the check in counter to claim our luggage. Many passengers, me included, had connections in Lima and needed to reach Lima ASAP. However the earliest flight that they were able to schedule was the next day and many of us were forced to miss our connections as the incompetence of the airline meant that they were not even able to put us on Avianca or Latam flights. Communication was poor throughout this process and the staff even had the nerve to ask me to take a 12 hour bus ride and a flight the subsequent morning from Cusco - even though this did not gurantee any of us being able to make the onward connections from Lima. Overall a horribly disappointing experience and if you have any option other than Peruvian Airlines, I highly recommend that you choose to exercise that option.

### "is a bit of a joke"
Lima to Arequipa. I have to agree with most of the reviews on this website in saying that Peruvian Airlines is a bit of a joke. I booked with them because they were about 20$ less than their competitors but regretted it when I arrived at the airport and confusingly was put on standby (I bought the ticket the week before). The seat was obviously given to another passenger. Lesson learnt. Words of advice: guys just pay the extra 20$ to arrive at your destination as planned. The new flight they gave me was the next day. Luckily I was somewhat flexible but sadly their staff for whatever reason were absolutely unapologetic and basically said it was my own fault-but how? When I informed my Peruvian friends I was traveling Peruvian Air Line they pre-warned me (using language I cannot write here) that the company was very badly organized. Naturally I assumed it would be fine but I would like to warn fellow travelers about my experience and I will also add that the airline is frequently late, the online checkin does not work-even if you download their app, calling to check in before which I also tried is impossible and finally at the airport (which is usually very busy) their staff have zero presence other than at the check in desk. All of the other airlines had a representative on hand. Usually I'm a bit more forgiving but my experience on this occasion was in my opinion completely unacceptable. I have travelled with Peruvian before but do not intend to book with them in the future. Very poor job Peruvian Airways.

### "you get what you pay for"
❎ Unverified |  La Paz to Lima via Cuzco. It's ironic that their slogan is "punctuality is our thing" while the only thing they can never get right is being on time. So if you have a connection flight that same day avoid this airline. In my case the flight was delayed "only" 1 hour so my connection with Copa scheduled 6 hours after the scheduled arrival went without problems, but as a regular user of La Paz airport I have seen flights delayed up to 6 hours(wich makes me a lucky man). The planes are quite old and doesn't look much taken care of, and the leg room is the smallest I have ever seen (and that includes regional jets! ), their staff are ok, as long as you speak spanish(wich can cause problems in the stop in Cuzco and their crazy costums and inmigration proceedings) and the onboard service is ok taking count the trips are just an hour long each leg. Maybe is a case of you get what you pay for as their fares are most of the time much cheaper than LATAM or Avianca

### "staff seemed very disinterested"
Flew Peruvian Airlines from Arequipa to Lima. Departure was only slightly delayed (10 minutes). Plane was old, with uncomfortable seats. This was a short flight and OK overall, however staff seemed very disinterested and even rude (i.e. attendant sneered at me when I asked for milk in my coffee and generally smirked the whole way). The price was also quite high I find for a short trip. For these reasons I would choose another airline.

### "Peruvian Airlines are appalling"
Cuzco to Lima. Peruvian Airlines are appalling. First, my flight from Cuzco to Lima was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting Copa/United flight in Lima to New York City. I was aware this was going to happen, so enquired in Cuzco itself about being put on another flight, but that didn't happen. The Peruvian staff put me on the delayed flight anyway, saying that there were 20 other people with the same connecting flight as me, and that "Copa might wait" (Copa did no such thing). When I get to Lima at 1pm, it takes me over an hour at the counter to wait for a staffer to replace the Lima-NYC flight I missed. Copa/United didn't have flights before 2am the next day, so I figured Peruvian would do better at replacing my ticket on another airline, than I would replacing it myself through United. Instead, the woman handling my case comes back after an hour and sends me off to a hotel to wait for a call at 9pm to confirm my flying out with Copa at 2am on the same flight I had enquired with United about. Come 9pm, nothing happens. I call the number she gave me and received someone on the other line telling me to "wait for their call". I call back again at 11pm, and they said that I will likely only fly out the next day in the afternoon and would confirm at 9am. Call them at 9am, they said they were still waiting for a confirmation from United and would get one by 2pm. By 11am I had had enough and contacted United myself and begged them to let me replace my missed flight with no charge. I got a flight out for 10:30pm that night. Peruvian still hadn't contacted me by 8pm when I checked out of the hotel. This was yesterday, for me and I am pretty sure Peruvian would have happily let me fester in that hotel room for a week while they do god knows what with their time. Bottom line is, this is an airline to be avoided at all costs. They are so incompetent that you are very likely to encounter a delay or lost luggage. I would have happily paid double just to avoid this mess.

### "delays were dreadful"
Peruvian Airlines has a total lack of respect for the passengers travelling from Cusco to Lima, flight 0213. First of all, in Cusco Airport, the flight changed gates from 4 to 1 but every passenger was unaware until some of us saw the flight number in gate 1. The staff didn't even bother telling us about the change. Then, the boarding was delayed for half an hour. The flight was supposed to leave at 6:50 but the screens indicated we should board at 7:22. Once we got on the plane, another half an hour (or more) waiting inside with no explanation at all. When I descended from the plane, I asked the staff to introduce me to the pilot so I could ask what happened. They said he was "busy" and said they had problems with the air traffic control in Cusco, but they didn't say anything when I asked them why they hadn't explained it to the passengers: we were all looking at each other wondering what was going on and no one of the staff was around. The top of the cherry: once we got to Lima, the luggage was supposed to arrive at 9:22 to the baggage belts (we arrived at the airport around 9:05). The luggage didn't arrive at 9:22, obviously, but the biggest problem was that there was only one person from the airline that couldn't handle the situation at all. He didn't know what to say, didn't offer an apology and never explained clearly what had happened to our luggage. We left the airport of Lima at 10:05 with our bags that came with another flight's bags, on another baggage belt (not the one that was indicated) and at more than 45 minutes after we arrived. Not only the delays were dreadful, but also the staff didn't offer explanations and never apologised for all the inconveniences.

### "most unreliable airline encountered "
This airline is unreliable and has ruined two days of our holiday with significant delays. Our flight from Lima to La Paz left 6 hours after the scheduled departure time. The last hour of this was spent on the plane sitting at the gate. They boarded us and did not leave for another hour. Then the return leg from La Paz to Cusco was also 4 hours late and we still do not have a departure time. 2 days ruined sitting in airports. There are no staff to provide updates and calls to the Peruvian call centre do not enlighten the situation. Basically they have no idea themselves when their planes will leave. This is an appalling airline to be avoided if at all possible. They do not care about the inconvenience caused and the impact it has on their customers. Unfortunately we have one more flight with this airline but have already started to investigate alternatives. Without exception the most unreliable airline I have encountered anywhere in the world.

### "communication was terrible"
Firstly the flight time was changed without notification and then the incoming aircraft was late. Then despite other aircraft's taking off, the captain was refusing to fly because of the weather. Then they said we could fly but only if there were 30 volunteers to take tomorrow's flight because the load was too heavy to fly. None of this was communicated by an official announcement. Communication was terrible. Eventually the plane departed 5 hours late. Because my connecting international flight was on 'final call' when we arrived the ground staff promised to send my luggage on to my next airline. I caught my flight just before the doors closed after running through the airport. Now my luggage is missing and I have heard nothing from Peruvian and they do not respond to my communications. Shockingly bad.

### "unpleasant and terrible experience"
❎ Unverified |  La Paz to Lima via Cusco. My husband and I had the most unpleasant and terrible experience with Peruvian Airlines. We booked flight number P9 330 flying out from La Paz, Bolivia at 10.40 to Lima, Peru. We knew the plane would stop in Cusco for about half an hour. We each got one boarding pass and were told at the counter to collect our checked bags in Lima. Our seats were 21E and 21F, at the back of the plane. There were altogether 3 female flight attendants, one was more senior and was alright. The other two flight attendants (one younger, one older) were sitting at the back when the plane took off. We asked one flight attendant at the back (the older one) whether we need to leave the plane when arriving at Cusco. She spoke English, which was not even marginally understandable. She just replied, Cusco, and we could not understand other words that she was mumbling. When that same flight attendant served drinks, her attitude was like she did not want to work and serve customers. When I said "coffee with milk please", she replied "no milk" impatiently. When the plane touched down in Cusco, some passengers were still in their seats while others were picking their bags. My husband asked one flight attendant at the back (the younger one, not the one that served drinks) and said we were heading to Lima and "do we need to leave the plane?". That younger flight attendant told my husband to "remain seated". We therefore remained seated, thinking that other passengers were leaving because their destination was Cusco. Then, after a few minutes, the flight attendant (the older one, who served us drinks and had a bad attitude all along) came to us and said, in a very rude tone, "I told you to go out!". I asked if we need to bring our bags and she replied, without any patience, "take all your personal belongings! Again, in a very rude way, like we were told off! For Christ's sake, we were the customers and I just cannot believe that this was the service that an airline would deliver! I was angry and told her that her attitude could be much better and this was very bad service. She just went back to her seat at the back. We left the plane, and there was a long queue at the immigration counter. No one told us we need to go through the immigration and customs in Cusco (as we only had a very short stop in Cusco and we're heading to Lima). If not because some very kind passengers allowed us to go through the immigration first, we would have missed our flight to Lima. As we only got one boarding pass at La Paz, after customs in Cusco, we did not know there was a new flight number and which departure gate was our flight. We had to ask around before queuing up to board the plane. When we arrived at Lima, we did not know the new flight number and had to guess before we collected our checked bags. Until then, we came to know the flight from Cusco to Lima was flight number P9 218. I am a frequent traveller but this was the first time that I travelled to Peru and Bolivia. It really struck me that the arrangements for such a short (half an hour) stop could be that bad, particularly when one flight attendant asked us to remain seated on the plane while another flight attendant rudely demanded us to go out! This is also the first time that I came across a flight attendant who is so impolite, rude and so bad-mannered. It is totally unacceptable. We are extremely disappointed by the services provided.

### "communication was appalling"
I was deeply disappointed with Peruvian Airlines. So much so that If I can I'll avoid using them again in the future. My flights were Lima to Cusco return. On both occasions flights were delayed. Cusco - Lima over 4hrs. The communication regarding the delays was appalling. As a seasoned traveler I would have been pacified if I knew the real reason for the delays. Unfortunately the information was not forthcoming.

### "switched our itinerary 3 times"
Prior to our flight from Lima to Cusco, Peruvian Airlines switched the departure, which fortunately didn't cause an issue. Now, while in Cusco we received an e-mail telling us that the airline has pushed back our return trip back by 3 hours, meaning we will not make our connection back from Lima to the US. They have switched our itinerary 3 times now, which is not something I've experienced on any other airline. I'm currently trying to switch the flight to return on an earlier flight, so wish me luck! Also, the seats on the plane have the least leg room I've ever seen. It's a joke!

### "very bad experience"
La Paz to Cusco. Very bad experience. The flight (August 18th, planned at 10.40 am) was more than 4 hours late. No explanation was given by people at the desk for check-in, which by the way hardly speaks English (what a shame for an international flight). We were given a voucher for breakfast but no voucher for lunch because it was not confirmed that the plane was more than 4 hours late (4 hours being the deadline for giving the voucher for lunch). Very conveniently for Peruvian Airlines, they did not give the voucher although the plane was more than 4 hours late. Then, in the aircraft, there was not one single apology for the delay. Avoid this company.

### "aircraft was basic but clean"
Despite the numerous negative reviews, we were happy with our return flights on Peruvian from Lima to Iquitos. The first flight was on time and the return was delayed by around 1 hour due to late incoming aircraft, but the LAN flight departing Iquitos at the same time also had a short delay. Perhaps the delays experienced by others were specific to the Cusco route. Aircraft was basic but clean, with no inflight entertainment (to be expected on short routes), Peruvian does not have the newest airplanes, but the interior did not feel particularly dated. Service was fine, we were pleasantly surprised to be served food and drink on such a short flight. Baggage arrived on time. Tickets were somewhat cheaper than LAN or Avianca, because Peruvian (like Star Peru) does not impose a surcharge on foreign passengers.

### "no explanations or apologies"
We flew Peruvian Airlines round trip from Lima to Cuzco. Both flights were over an hour late. LAN Chile flights on same routes at same times ran on time. Aircraft was over 30 years old. Staff and crew were completely lackadaisical about delays. No explanations or apologies were given. Running 1 to 2 hours late seemed to be standard operating procedure. Policies were inconsistent. No carry-ons allows on one flight with unlimited carry-ons on the next, in the same aircraft. There are several other carriers operating on this route. Take one of them.

### "avoid this airline if you can"
La Paz to Cuzco with Peruvian Airlines. The aircraft is 22 years old, everything worn and aged, from chairs to carpet, to window blind, to toilets. The seat was most cramped. One welcoming think is that they still serve drink and snacks even for an one hour flight. My flight was on time but I observed flights were cancelled frequently. For the daily LPB-CUZ route, I found 3 out of 7 flights were cancelled. Avoid this airline if you can!

### "how bad Peruvian Airlines were"
We (a couple in our sixties) had booked a return flight without knowing how bad Peruvian Airlines were. On the way from Lima to Cuzco we were bumped twice and left hanging at the airport with no food, changed gate twice, and eventually left 7 hours later. The excuse was 'weather' but approx 6 flights from even the smallest other airlines continued to fly - it was perfectly clear when we eventually landed and the locals said it was fine all day. So total lie by this airline. No service whatsoever. On our return journey arrived at airport 3 hours early only to find a line of approx 160 people (I did a head count) whose previous flight had been cancelled. Stood in line for over 1 hour with one junior at the desk, not one bag or check in was done. All staff abandoned desk and refused to talk to anybody at all. Crowd was angry and baying for blood. Found out our flight was also likely to be cancelled with no reason. I went to windows and noticed no planes from this pack of idiots anywhere so ran to LAN and bought two new tickets -  yes, more expensive (plus I lost my other airfare) but perfect service. The lady from LAN told me it happens almost daily with Peruvian.

### "the worst flight experience"
We had a 6:00 am flight from Cusco to Lima delayed and then cancelled. We were very understanding and had to go get new tickets at the counter. We waited in a very large line that was completely chaotic. People were cutting, we told security guards and employees and they did nothing. It was so frustrating. Passengers began to fight due to the lack of order and lack of organization. People who cut spent an hour holding up the line. It was the worst flight experience I have ever been a part of, and it was all at the ticket counter. We tried to tell the manager and he wouldn't speak to us. We wrote a complaint and I was almost in tears.

### "never fly Peruvian Airlines again"
I was a victim of Peruvian Airlines too. On March 20, 2016 there was an aborted takeoff of a Peruvian Airlines flight 218 in Cuzco. All flights in and out where cancelled. Peruvian Airlines did not communicate anything to us. Peruvian Airlines checked is in and took our baggage for our flight late in the afternoon despite having "delayed" most previous flights that day. Our flight never made it to any departure board or gate sign. All announcements were in Spanish only and very few Peruvian Airlines customer service reps spoke enough English to answer questions. When we were able to find someone to communicate with, we received incorrect information. We were basically left on our own to follow masses of people running from one place to another as instructed in Spanish. To make a 21 hour long story shorter, after waiting a day in the Lima airport, Peruvian Airlines ended up sending people to hotels for a couple hours with instructions to be back at the airport at 2:30, 3:00 or 3:30am depending upon which Peruvian Airlines representative you talked to. Peruvian airlines could not find our luggage so we had to make due (Most people did manage to get their bags). Peruvian Airlines promised two additional flights for a 4:30am departure. We stood in line for another 5.5 hours and finally had a boarding pass with a departure time in the past (you can imagine my scepticism). We finally make it to Cuzco in the afternoon of the second day. One might give Peruvian Airlines a pass for poor contingency planning in the event of an aborted takeoff, but five days later, we had a similar experience with Peruvian Airlines on the return trip. Another day spent in the airport, flights delayed multiple times, poor communication from Peruvian airlines. Our connecting flight on another carrier was missed after 3 delays of our Peruvian Airlines flight. I am now in waiting in an airport lounge on Easter Sunday, my family back in the US. Thank you Peruvian Airlines! Fortunately United Airlines was able to change my return flight without any additional penalty. Unfortunately there isn't anything anyone can do to compensate me for lost time and stress. I will never fly Peruvian Airlines again. If you do, consider yourself fairly warned and plan for an additional day on each end of your travel dates.

### "choose another airline"
We arrived at Cusco airport at 4:45am for a six o'clock Peruvian Airlines flight to Lima with connections to Chile. The flight was cancelled due to aircraft issues but they never announced the cancellation. Then they booked us on a later flight to Lima and told us we would have to find our next flight to Chile when we got at Lima. Terrible service and the seats are so cramped they are ridiculous. If you want on time service with more comfort choose another airline.

### "don't want to pay us back"
We had a delay for 5 hours with the excuse of bad weather at Lima. But when we where flying back from Cusco they cancelled our flight because of the bad weather, meanwhile LAN and Avianca were operating normally. Apparently Peruvian Airlines doesn't have a sofisticated GPS System that it's used for landing when there is fog. So that's the reason why they always have problems with bad weather. We had to buy new tickets with LAN, because Peruvian told us that we can be stuck in Cusco for a minimun Of 2 more days until they can get us space on a flight. We Had our flight Back to CR so We couldn't wait. Of course they don't want to pay us back the tickets, because they don't refund bad weather issues.

### "there were mechanical difficulties"
Peruvian Airlines motto is punctuality and service and they failed at both. The flight from Lima to Cusco was delayed due to "mechanical difficulties" we were told. A new time was given, which they failed to meet. The same thing happened when returning from Cusco to Lima. Again, told there were mechanical difficulties. This time the delay was four hours. Being given the same excuse twice led us to believe it was a standard line they gave passengers (weather is another). We found out later that what they were doing was pooling passengers. So if several flights were only half full, they bump people until they can get them all on one flight so they can save a buck. Outrageous. Not only that, some of the passengers had their flights changed from noon, to 2, to 3, to 5. Only to be told in the end that they wouldn't have a flight out of Cusco that day. I will never fly with Peruvian Airlines again, and I will tell all my friends and acquaintances of the poor service and intentional delays.

### "seats are very cramped"
Flew Peruvian Airlines from Lima to Cusco, flight was delayed 7 hours. Flight from La Paz to Lima was delayed 6 hours. They appear to intentionally over-schedule and then combine flights as they please, leaving customers stranded at airports with little information and hours of delays. It's incredibly frustrating to watch all other flights take off while Peruvian seems utterly unconcerned about inconveniencing the customers. The fact that their slogan is "puntualidad y servicio" is some kind of joke. Seats are very cramped, and the flights have been shaky (although I'm unsure if that's because of the altitude and climate).

### "was delayed 3 hours"
The worst airline. I bought Peruvian Airlines round trip tickets from Lima to Cusco. Upon flying to Cusco the flight was delayed 3 hours for weather when there was no weather problems at all. All other flights were leaving out to Cusco but mine, and caused me to miss my train from Cusco to Machu Picchu. When traveling back to Lima, the flight was scheduled to depart at 6 am. The crew casually strolled in at 8 am with letting anybody know and didn't leave until 10 am causing me to miss my flight from Lima to the states.

### "stranded at the airport"
Writing this review while stranded at the airport. Was booked for a 6am Cusco to Lima flight today. Saw the cabin crew strolling leisurely to the gate at 8am. Plane did not leave till almost 10am. Reason given was bad weather which is not true. All the other airlines (LAN and Avianca) left around the same time for Cusco. When I checked in at 4.30am, counter staff told me that I will not be able to make it for my 9.30am connecting flight in Lima. It is impossible for the staff to know beforehand how long the plane will be grounded due to "bad weather", unless it was planned. Peruvian Air has 4 flights from Cusco to Lima today. What they did was an underhand method to combine the passengers from the 6am flight and 9.30am flight to save costs. I just checked online, the third flight at 12.30pm is cancelled, but the last flight at 3.40pm is confirmed. I had to pay extra to rebook my connecting flight in Lima. Peruvian Air is not obliged to pay for such expenses because of "bad weather". If the delay is due to aircraft issues, then they are liable to pay. This is not the first time the company has done this. My suggestion is pay extra for LAN or another airline than take your chances with Peruvian Air if you have a connecting flight.

### "do not waste your money"
La Paz to Cusco and I am so angry after my experience with Peruvian Air. They will delay your flight if they did not sell enough tickets to combine it with a later flight. This made me miss my connecting flight where I allowed Peruvian Air to have 6 hours to make a mistake. Afterwards they did not help us with flights for the next day or even a hotel for that night. Due to the fact the "weather" was bad, they said it was not their fault the flight was delayed. For 8 hours!! They would not take any responsibility at all. Do not waste your money and buy tickets from another company!

### "ticket value is great"
Peruvian Airlines, Boeing 737 from Lima to Cusco on an aged plane but clean. We had an hour delay but was not airline’s fault. They had us for 35 minutes waiting with doors closed but the LIM control tower was not giving the go ahead. 3 flights from LIM that we had and all of them were delayed, very unorganized airport. The airline was OK, they served sandwiches and drinks on an 1 hour and 15 minutes flight. Ticket value is great because they do not charge the tax of $85 each way that other airlines charge. Reading the reviews, I was afraid but our experience was OK.

### "never fly Peruvian Airlines again"
4 hours late, horrible customer service! We had a flight from Cusco to Lima with Peruvian Airlines. The agents were disorganized and never bothered to make announcements about what was going on as the departure time came and went. About 1.5 hours after the departure the agents disappeared (without providing any answers) and we had no choice but to leave the secured area and go to the ticket counter to find out what was going on. There we eventually found out that our plane was experiencing mechanical problems and the flight would most likely be leaving about 4 hours late. When we eventually arrived in Lima there was no one there to help the 20 or so passengers who had missed connections. We made our way to the ticket counter where the agent there insisted that she had to take all of our passports into the back room in order to look up our missed flights. She and one other agent would appear from time to time and give us scant answers and then dodge into the back room while the increasingly disparate group barraged them with more questions. We were stuck in the ticketing area for another 4 hours with no access to bathrooms, food, water, wireless or anywhere to sit as all of that was on the other side of the security check. Eventually the agent came out and explained (in Spanish only and disregarding the 75% of us who did not speak Spanish, though we had spoken with her in English earlier) that they were sending us all to a hotel for the night and would try to find us flights to our final destinations and let us know later. At the hotel we asked a waiter and he said that there were people at the hotel almost every day whose travel plans had been waylaid by Peruvian Airlines. We eventually got a note from the hotel reception that the airline had arranged a flight to Miami the next morning. However our final destination was Charlotte. We tried the customer service number but got no answer and we ended up booking a flight from Miami to Charlotte for $950 at our own expense. While leaving the hotel that morning we spoke with a teenage girl traveling alone who had been on our flight. She was trying to get home to the UK and had not received any word from the airline and was desperately trying to get information. Several of the other passengers from our flight were in the same situation. Back at the airport we tried to talk to a Peruvian Airlines agent about the flight to Charlotte and apparently of all of the agents milling around the place the only one who could be bothered to talk to us was a very angry manager who did not speak a word of english. In between yelling at other employees and nearly yelling at us we managed to get the name and email of a customer service person to contact. Once we arrived home I emailed the customer service agent and sent her all of our relevant flight information. A few days later I received an email thanking me for my understanding that flight delays happen and the importance they place on safety which I read as "Get Lost!". That doesn't hold water as their delay was because of their own poor plane maintenance and not a weather related incident so I hold them 100% responsible for our missed connections. After several follow up emails with no response I guess we will not be reimbursed and we will certainly never fly with Peruvian Airlines again.

### Peruvian Airlines customer review
Lima-Cuzco and Arequipa-Lima they offered the best price 190 dollars (for example LAN wanted 530 dollars). Taking off and landing on time on both flights. Flying on board of older B737. In Lima the plane was so smelly it was really a unfavorable situation for both staff and passengers. No explanation no excuse although it was intolerable. Seat comfort average nothing special "conserve style. Staff service was also mediocre a little sandwich cake and a juice but still better than many European airlines. Flight attendants a little bit rude hurried and clumsy. Inflight entertainment non existent. Moreover during the whole night flight from Arequipa to Lima (20.55) the lights in the cabin were turned off. Reading light doesn't help a lot if you read something. I really think that Peruvian should do much more to get the attention and trust of passengers. I hope that their service will be improved.

### Peruvian Airlines customer review
We flew from Lima to Arequipa on one of Peruvian's aged 737-300s. The planes are in an all-economy layout with very tight seats (still in their Southwest Airlines decor). The airline offers no-frills bare-bones service by a VERY attractive group of male and female flight attendants. A free drink and snack box (with an inedible sandwich) is offered. This is the most basic way to travel around Peru. I can't suggest flying this carrier. It is cheap and gets you where you need to go. Don't expect them to run on time either.

### Peruvian Airlines customer review
My flight from Lima to Cuzco was first delayed and later cancelled because of bad weather. They kept us waiting in the airport for over 5 hours. All we got was a horrible little sandwich with a glass of soda. We collected our luggage and were told to come back the next morning. All other airline companies were flying to Cuzco (LAN/Star Peru). We were treated like dogs and thrown on the streets. Nobody even took the time to properly inform us.
