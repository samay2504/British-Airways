### "I was very happy with flybe service"
Flew flybe BE1335 Belfast to Amsterdam on October 12th. Check-in opened 2 hours prior to departure and the check in process was very efficient. Boarding was called 20 minutes prior to departure and the boarding process was also fast and efficient. The onboard cabin crew were outstanding and very helpful throughout the flight, and we landed 20 minutes ahead of the scheduled time. There is not a full catering service onboard, however tea/coffee and snacks are provided free of charge. Overall, I was very happy with flybe service on this Belfast to Amsterdam fight.

### "Same old Flybe"
Same old Flybe - delays, delays, delays. Flight schedule was 1600 from BHD. Arrived to find it was bumped to 1650 then later Departing 1700. Flight departed 1715. It might actually seem quite punctual to Flybe management but it's an annoyance and inconvenient to passengers. It's not like there's much to do at City airport either. As BA was having reliability issues of its own I thought I'd chance it- won't be back.

### " had me taken off the flight"
I was due to fly from Amsterdam to Birmingham but as I was checking in the lady told me the plane was too small and I would have to put my cabin bag which met the dimensions for cabin baggage in the hold as checked baggage. I said that was fine but then she told me I would have to pay extra. I had already paid £120 extra for my checked baggage and the cabin baggage was included with the ticket. I refused to pay extra to put my cabin bag in the hold and told them it should be up to them to cover the costs or allow me to take the bag into the cabin. She refused to do this then the lady sitting next to her got involved and told me they wouldn’t let me board the plane if I didn’t pay extra. I refused to accept this and told her I wasn’t going to pay extra when it was already included in my ticket, she then had a total meltdown. That shocked me and turned the disagreement into an argument. The next minute whilst I was still discussing this with the lady checking me in she called security and had me taken off the flight. I asked to speak to a manager and they refused to call anyone or help resolve the situation. In the end I had to buy another ticket for a different flight. I won’t be flying with Flybe ever again and I would advise anyone thinking of booking a flight with them to think twice as the customer service is non existent and no one at Flybe is prepared to help.

### "very happy with the flight and service"
Flew Flybe on the Belfast to Amsterdam route and was pleasantly surprised on the Check-In, Boarding and inflight service. The inflight service is just Tea, Coffee, Juice and some biscuits, however the overall service was very good. For such a small aircraft there were 3 cabin crew onboard. The overall ambience of the aircraft was very good and clean. The cabin crew kept cleaning toilet after anyone had used it. I was very happy with the flight and service.
