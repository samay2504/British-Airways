### "so unprofessional"
Shocking experience! Old plane and at lunch time, the passenger in front of me reclined his seat all the way back and I had no room to eat properly. I asked the flight attendant for help, she barely spoke any English, and said something in Spanish like I could recline as well. As a rule during taking off, landing and food serving time, passengers should keep the seat back straight. So unprofessional! This is international flight, the pilot never spoke a word of English, horrible food! Never flying with them again!

### "seats were very comfortable"
I took LAN airlines from Santiago to Easter Island. I was in business, the seats were very comfortable and cabin crew were very helpful and kind. The food was good, the flight was on time and the cabin was clean. It was a very good experience with LAN for my first time. Would recommend.

### "lower quality than other airlines"
I normally fly with another airline, but this time had to choose an option with LATAM for Bogota to Santiago (return) and Bogota to Cali (one way) route. Overall, the service was acceptable but of a somewhat lower quality than the other airline. Firstly, the planes are dated and started showing their age. The inflight entertainment system (BOG-SCL) is not very reliable. The touchable screen does not work well while the entertainment system wired control is in the seat, and any wrong body movement in the seat might cause its acting by itself. Besides, there is no power outlet either. Since I am accustomed to use my flight time to work, on this occasion I was disappointed that it was not possible because my computer’s battery died out quickly. On another note, the staff is doing their work but as many other reviews here have noted it is rather cold and not exactly very smiley. Half of my flights had been delayed though apparently due to the weather issue or airport traffic beyond the airline control. Yet, I almost missed my connection in Santiago because the luggage delivery was late, while the airport international arriving area is small and crowded and there is a long line for customs. Only half the time the boarding is done by turns (according to the rows of seats assigned), when it is enforced is very convenient. What stands out, however, is the quality of food provided on the longer legs in economy - quite tasty, with metal and not plastic fork and knife used. Unlimited and good quality wine and other spirits. However, there is not even a glass of water offered on the domestic Bogota to Cali flight. All in all, I will try to fly with another airline next time since LATAM did not achieve to convince me to change my preferences.

### "seats are too narrow"
Sydney - Santiago via Auckland on 787-9. Above average flight with an average meal, very good crew and reasonable IFE selection. However, the 9 abreast in economy is too tight. The seats are too narrow and the aisles are tiny. The meal trolley only just fits through. The tray table is also very small. On the return leg, a passenger fell ill immediately after takeoff. The crew managed this very well. About 2 hours into the flight, it was determined that we'd have to return to SCL. The airline put us into hotels. As a transit passenger through SCL, the airline arranged to pay our reciprocity fee (US$100) to enter into Chile. This was a long process (over 1 hour) but at least they paid for it. The airline wasn't able to arrange a single large bus to take us to the hotel at the last minute and so there was another long process (about 1.5 hours) of getting all of us into separate mini buses. The hotel was excellent and included free food. Back to the airport, this time in a big coach and a very long check-in process. Our bags were checked through to SYD, and we were advised we'd been put onto a Qantas flight from AKL to SYD. The flight was again reasonable - good crew, OK food (definitely not up to Emirates standards) and bathrooms kept clean. Due to our delayed arrival into AKL, we had to overnight there, and again LAN had arranged a hotel, meal and bus transfer for us. Overall, LAN managed this stressful situation which was out of their control quite well, ensuring we had a place to rest and food to eat and made sure we all got to our final destinations. My lower marks are for the standard and quantity of the food and the cramped seating (that almost all operators of the 787 have adopted).

### "excellent service throughout"
Quito to Galapagos with LAN Airlines. Excellent service throughout. Had never encountered this airline before but would recommend highly. Lovely staff with excellent English and nice snacks. Both Quito and Galapagos airports are nice indeed, with easy check in and plenty of space. Aircraft seats are leather and comfortable.

### "plane a little bit dated"
Buenos Aires to Lima with LAN. The plane looked a little bit dated and not completely clean. Seat space is good, fully flat bed but with a lot of divisions on the seat, so in the bed position it is slightly uncomfortable. Weak cushioning. Food was not the best. Amenity kit was Ferragamo in brown colors with Tuscan Soul toiletries, highly acceptable.

### "it was disappointing"
Santiago to Sydney via Auckland with LATAM Airlines. For now the largest airline in South America (LAN merged with TAM to form LATAM) it was disappointing from perspectives of Cabin Crew service attitude, Crew presence, Meal service and choice of liquors on particularly the longest leg (13+ hrs, SCL-AKL). AKL-SYD leg was slightly better crew. The service crew behaviour was cold. The cabin staff disappeared in the pantry for almost 20 minutes - there was no pre-meal drinks service unless requested. Although biz class was only 70% full, they seemed peeved by anyone ordering the standard full meal and breakfast (vs. an express option), the main of veal and semolina arrived cold, only a choice of one of each of whiskey, rum, vodka but the choice of Argentinian or Chilean wine was better. Noteworthy that it is one of the airline's longest routes on a B787 twin-engine, over the South Pacific.

### "flight had been cancelled"
I had purchased a ticket between Buenos Aires Aeroparque and Santiago, Chile. On the date of my return to Buenos Aires, when I went to check in at the LAN ticket counter, a LAN staffer told me my flight had been cancelled and she sent me to be rechecked in a line for a flight to Ezeiza, the airport 45 minutes outside of town. Instead of the exit-row aisle seat I had reserved for the Aeroparque flight, I was placed in a middle seat on a full flight to Ezeiza. However, once I landed at Ezeiza, I discovered that not only had the Aeroparque flight not been cancelled but that it was arriving at Aeroparque 10 minutes after I arrived at Ezeiza. The LAN ticket counter staff never provided an explanation for why I was bumped off the flight I had purchased, nor was I offered an apology for being taken an hour out of my way. All I got was a free transfer into the city. To add insult to injury, LAN has not credited my LANPass kilometers for this flight.

### "the service was fantastic"
LAN is a true premium airline. Flew in their Premium Business from Milan–Malpensa to São Paulo Guarulhos late night and the service was fantastic. Had only hand luggage because it was a short trip. As soon as I got onboard I was welcomed and escorted to my seat by the purser. Immediately I was offered a glass of champagne. Other offers were Pisco Sour and water. Dinner orders were taken quickly and served promptly after the take off. Their business class cabin has the configurartion of 2-2-2 which is good if you have company. If not you might find yourself sitting to a stranger for 12 hours. I had this several times and the comfort was still good. My breakfast order was taken seriously: I got everything I wanted. I need to emphasize this because there are other "premium" airlines who fail to arrange the breakfast according to customers wishes. The crew just seem to enjoy their jobs and you can see that: the service is personal, you get addressed by your name and you pay business class but you get almost first class treatment. LAN is always a great choice and will always stick to them.

### "loved the cabin interior"
Santiago de Chile to Isla de Pascua. Had the opportunity to fly with LAN from Santiago de Chile to Easter Islands, a trip I had been expecting tor a long time. Although the LAN web site indicated that you should report to check-in a whole 3 hours before scheduled departure time, I decided to play it cool and only arrive at the Santiago airport at 7.00 for a 8.30 am. flight, just to see that check-in was still well in progress, without any rush. Upon boarding the Boeing 787 I just loved the cabin interior: very light and roomy with nice LED lights around. When finding my seat, I soon realised however, how small it was. I’m sure is the narrowest airplane seat I’ve ever seen and the legroom was very short for someone of 181 cm. I was happy that I was only going to spend 6 hours and not 12 on this plane! However, I soon found the IFE which offered a great selection of top recent films, certainly far too many for this six hours flight. As I hadn't downloaded the LAN application on my tablet beforehand, there would have been even a greater choice of entertainment available for this flight. Soon after take-off, an excellent breakfast with fresh fruit and an omelette was served. During the rest of the flight, drinks and coffee were served several times. The best part of this flight was however the Chilean LAN cabin crew. The steward serving my section was chatting around, making jokes and asking several times, if I needed something more. This is the kind of service I would have expected in First Class, but here I was, enjoying it in Economy. Well done LAN!

### "crew friendly and attentive"
Recently during April I flew from Australia to South America with LAN on the following routes. Sydney - Santiago (NZ stopover en-route) - Bogota - Medellin - Bogota - Santiago (NZ stopover en-route) - Sydney. Sydney-Santiago LA800 (6 April - Dreamliner) Flight was excellent. Dreamliner is a very nice plane, comfortable/modern/quiet, possibly due to air recirculation system, seats in business class were excellent as was the food. Staff were excellent, professional and attentive, also the replacement crew from the NZ to Santiago leg. Arrived in Santiago and baggage got misplaced (looked like it was going to continue on to Bogota), the dates on the tag stated I would have 2 nights in Santiago. Spoke to 2 LAN baggage handling staff who quickly escalated the matter to their superior and kept following up on this, one went to lunch but they continued to pursue the status of my bag and were always keeping me updated. About an hour later I had the bag and was heading to the hotel. Thanks to the baggage handlers who made an error into a very good customer service experience. Santiago-Bogota LA574 (8 April - 767 I think, older plane). Cabin crew and attendants were excellent, professional and attentive throughout this flight. LAN need to speed up the maintenance/replacement of planes on longer internal routes. Plane issues - Twice before takeoff/taxing the overhead locker dropped open. Upon takeoff the foot locker of an adjacent seat fell open. An air-conditioning section dropped down and had to be taped up with "gaffer tape", I had issues with the electric seat and controls which did not initially respond due to the age of the equipment and gears not catching. I had to replace the headset as reception was scratchy and then when done if I bumped the section where the plug connected with the seat then it would switch the volume to the loudest level. Heaps of small issues due to the age of the plane. Credit and thanks to the flight crew who soldiered on and had to perform duties when the plane is falling apart on them. Bogota-Medellin-Bogota LA3016 Reasonable, smaller plane, On the return flight from Medellin to Bogota the transport from the plane to the lounge, the internal (On runway transport) at Bogota is not well organised. Bogota-Santiago LA575 (23 April, 767 I think, an older plane) Flight was trouble free. Crew excellent, friendly and attentive throughout. Upon landing to the return connecting flight to Sydney was directed to speak to ground crew in relation to location/timing to head to make my directing flight. Upon getting off the plane and inquiring where I was to go, was grunted at by a LAN ground staff member who pointed in the direction of the airbridge and continued her texting on her mobile phone (Job well done). Santiago-Sydney LA801 (24 April, Dreamliner) Very nice flight on this new plane, appointments, take off noise very quiet, good seats and controls. Cabin crew continued on a similar theme from the other flights, all were excellent, helpful and professional throughout the flight as was the crew from NZ to Sydney. Best Points - Quality of the Dreamliner and the flight. Professionalism, friendliness, attentiveness of Cabin crew/attendants throughout all legs. Professionalism of the baggage handlers at Santiago with helping find my bag. Worst Points - Deterioration on the older planes that are being used on internal South American routes.

### "all filled my expectations"
Santiago to Sydney via Auckland with LAN Airlines. I read some discouraging reviews before flying, but my experience was quite different. The check in was swift and efficient, departure on time both legs. I flew both ways with the new aircraft, the cabin crew was welcoming and polite. The toilets kept clean throughout the flight, and entertainment system kept us busy. The downside was the food, during such a ling flight you would expect to receive two hot meals, but for the breakfast we received only a small warm sandwich. It would be nice if during the flight also some snacks will be provided. Otherwise all filled my expectations will fly LAN again.

### "comfort of seats is very poor"
My boyfriend and I went on a trip to Peru and choose to fly with LAN Airlines. From Madrid to Lima we had a 2 hour delay because of technical problems with the plane. When we arrived in Lima, we heard that they had lost 80 pieces of luggage - ours included. A couple of weeks later, we flew back from Lima to Madrid. Guess what? Again technical problems. Again a 2 hour delay and we missed our connected flight because of this. They dont give much information, the service is very poor. The comfort of seats is also very poor if you compare them with other companies for the same price.

### "they did not disappoint"
I've always wanted to fly on a Dreamliner, and LAN Airlines was the cheapest option for me flying from Madrid to Frankfurt. I had done research prior to booking and had high expectations of LAN. They did not disappoint. Boarding was very efficient and we departed 5 minutes behind schedule which wasn't a big issue for me. The IFE is the best I have used. The cabin was airy and you can tell this as soon as you step on board. The crew were very friendly and welcoming. The complimentary snack service was a bonus. A ham roll and a chocolate bar as well as a drink. The seat was comfortable, although I had a slight issue with the back rest. I would highly recommend LAN Airlines.

### "stranded with little help"
Departed on time, just before landing at CUZ we were informed that the airport was closed due to an aircraft incident there. We returned to Lima. We were told the flight would be cancelled until the next day. After 2 hours wait, we were given a hotel and taxi voucher. However, it transpired that the flight would not be re-instated the next day. No seats were available for the next few days. We were left in the hotel, stranded with little help and only one nights hotel voucher. Our South American tour schedule was now at risk. LAN were unhelpful and told us only our booking agent could rebook seats, but there weren't any seats anyway. The only way we got out of Lima was to buy new tickets with another airline. Something that LAN could have done for us. Bear in mind, we already boarded and took off, so technically we were still in transit, we set off but were never taken to destination. The flight and cabin crew were friendly and on board everything was fine, however, the ground organisation of LAN leaves a lot to be desired.

### "will get a very old aircraft"
After taking two more South American flights with LAN after incident reported here with loss of my suitcase etc, I can safely say LAN has a problem. The flight attendants are very friendly and the food is not bad, but ground staff is not helpful, arrogant and indifferent. But what is more worrying is that this airline is frantically buying new planes but sends its very old ones to the Lima, Bogota or Quito based local airlines. So from Lima to Miami I had a very very old 767. From seat 1A the toilet smell was pretty strong and unpleasant. So while you will travel in a lovely Boeing 787 (to USA, Australia, Europe or Brazil) if you depart Santiago, if you depart Lima or Bogota you will get a very old aircraft. The business class seat on the 767 was extremely uncomfortable, one of the worst ever.

### "avoid them if you can"
Bogota to Sao Paulo via Santiago. Do not trust LAN Airlines with your luggage. Good-ish service on board complete destroyed by ground staff who lied when she said my bag was onboard a connecting flight and then by ground staff in Santiago who assured me it was on its way to São Paulo and would be delivered two hours ago. I missed a meeting, I have all my business clothes in there, perhaps lost for good, and I am stuck. LAN would not even give you a toothbrush to cover a little bit for losing your bag. Never ever again will travel with them. I travelled business and I am an emerald card holder of Oneworld (BA) and they treat my bag like this. I can imagine how they would treat someone travelling in economy. Avoid them if you can.

### "overall pleasant experience"
Sydney to Auckland with LAN. Able to check-in and choose seats online, but you would still need to go to the desk for boarding pass even with carry on only. Service was efficient, and frequent flyer privileges (such as express lane) was honoured despite being in economy class ( Often no longer the case in some other One World airlines at SYD). The cabin was lovely and fresh, but the seats were uncomfortably narrow. Seat pitch is tight but adequate for my (below-average) height. Service was friendly. AVOD screens are large and responsive, and there was a good choice of entertainment. The only disappointment was the food - the flight goes right through lunch time (4 hour flight taking off around 11am), yet we were served a small, stale sandwich and a small piece of cake - well below par of most full-service airlines. Nevertheless, an overall pleasant experience. The flight arrived 30 minutes early.

### "friendly crew"
Flew Buenos Aires to Ushuaia with LAN Airlines. On-time departure and arrival. Friendly crew. Comfortable seats. Even though Aerolineas operates on this route more frequently than LAN, the good service and on time punctuality more than make up for the lack of flight frequency between these 2 cities. Would recommend.

### "no better choice"
LAN Airlines from Madrid to Frankfurt. Fantastic price / quality ratio. Check-in, Iberia lounge in Terminal 4S and boarding - all fine. Business Class roughly 70% full, standard welcome procedures with Champagne (Louis Roederer) etc. like an intercontinental flights. The new 787 has all the features you require in 2016. Hot towels are offered before they start the light lunch service. LANs pride is the wine selection - in addition to Champagne there are three red choices, two from Chile, one from Bordeaux, plus two white ones (Chardonnay from Mendoza/Argentina and a Sauvignon Blanc from Casablanca Valley in Chile) plus a Porto LBV as a "dessert wine". For a business flight of slightly more than two hours this is like paradise - at least for the wine fans. The food itself is a cold snack, pleasantly prepared and delicious. IFE available, but I watched only the airshow, so no marks on entertainment. Departure and arrival on-time, baggage arrived relatively soon on the carousel, at least for Frankfurt standards. If the departure and arrival times - afternoon out of Madrid, early evening out of Frankfurt, suit you there is no better choice than LAN.

### "attentive and friendly staff"
Mexico City to Lima with LAN Airlines, and a good experience with this airline. Two checked bags for free. Good food and wine. I got three glasses and a scotch for free. Very nice! Great entertainment options. Tons of movies available. Good attentive and friendly staff. Flight was on time.

### "flight had been cancelled"
Arrived at JFK (New York) Feb 13th at 6.40am from South Africa and went to book-in for my flight to Toronto scheduled to leave at 9.25am (Flight 8730) only to be told the flight had been cancelled. Had wait until 3.30pm to get the next flight out - what an unexpected waste of my time - surely I deserve some explanation and compensation. I give LAN Airlines a zero for reliability.

### "hellish seat standards"
Sydney to Santiago via Auckland. It had been several years since I had flown this route with LAN and it was not a pleasant return. With the new Boeing 787 flying this route there has been a deterioration in passenger comfort with very poor leg room. The food was lousy and for some strange reason the male stewards were very friendly but the females not at all so. After reaching Brazil and catching my local connecting flight with GOL I was relieved to find the GOL domestic aircraft with more leg room than the hellish seat standards that LAN offered up for a 14 hour flight - where I had to constantly contort my legs into a space that literally did not really exist.

### "flight was cancelled"
We were booked to fly on LAN Airlines 4241 on 17 Dec from Mendoza to Buenos Aires. During check in, we were told that the flight would be delayed by an hour. In actual fact, the flight was cancelled. We only found out through fellow passengers after waiting for an hour at the boarding gate. There was no announcement during the time to inform us of the delay, perhaps there were but none was in English! It then took us hours to get the attention of any LAN ground staff member to explain what was happening and what our alternatives were. Guess not being a Spanish speaker did not help us (you would have thought English speaker is a compulsory requisite for anyone working at an airline front desk?) We finally managed to get someone's attention in the end who arranged to put us on an alternative flight (Aerolineas Argentinas) almost 12 hours later the same day. It is worthy to note that as a result of the airline staff incompetency, we have missed two potential flights bound for Buenos Aires while waiting for a response. I have since raised a request via LAN website to provide a written notice to confirm the cancellation. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back from the airline. It took them over 10 days to acknowledge receipt of my request. It will apparently take them another 30 days to assign the case to someone. Last I checked it is 'pending assignment to executive' (and it has been over 20 days). It is shame that this national airline did not do its lovely country any justice. This unfortunate event aside, as first time visitors to the region we were very impressed and appreciative of the hospitality that the locals have provided us. We hope to visit again some day but would definitely avoid travelling on LAN.

### "crew extremely friendly"
I flew Auckland to Sydney with LAN Airlines. It was my first flight on a Boeing 787 and I was impressed by the level of confort. The bigger windows with electronic shadowing is a very good difference. The entertainment is pretty good but they should increase the number of language versions. For example a documentary in the "business" session was only in Portuguese. The breakfast was not the best but fine. The cabin crew extremely friendly and with a positive mood. I would not mind to fly with them on a longer flight to fully test their product.

### "good legroom and comfortable"
Efficient check-in including assistance for flight from Ezeiza to Santiago with LAN Airlines. Boarding was good with priority groups entry onboard. Seats in overwing exit rows with good legroom and comfortable. Onboard service satisfactory to class offered. No issues on arrival and claiming baggage. Onboard team pleasant and approachable. Wifi onboard with possibility to connect with inflight entertainment - great idea.

### "onboard team professional"
Flew LAN Airlines from Lima Jorge Chavez to Montevideo Carrasco via Santiago. Priority check-in offered with efficient service including two ticket check-ins on whole route. Lounge access in LIM and SCL, both with good area to relax and grab some refreshments. Boarding in priority groups. Seats in 1A and 2A comfortable with middle seat free in premium economy (in some of the european airlines this is called business class). Onboard team professional and friendly. Food quality and drinks very good. Wifi onboard with possibility to connect with inflight entertainment - great idea.

### "deliberate, extreme rudeness"
Santiago to Sydney via Auckland. My husband and I have flown internationally with LAN on three occasions, and each time our flight has been delayed - twice by 5 hours, and once by 16 hours! On each occasion, we have found LAN ground staff to be unhelpful and uncommunicative. On the most recent occasion, we were told that the delay was due to the fact that there were 50 more passengers booked on the flight than the plane they were using could accommodate. The ground staff's attempts at resolving the problem were a display of incompetence, and the whole process turned into an absolute debacle. Although several of the ground staff could speak fluent English, they refused to communicate or make announcements in any language other than Spanish (despite the fact that the majority of passengers on the flight were English-speaking Australians and new Zealanders). This has also been the case during our previous experiences with LAN ground staff. When my husband and I attempted to board, we were told to join a queue of 'rejected' passengers and wait for our fate to be decided. When we eventually reached the front of the queue, I asked that we be allocated seats next to each other. This appeared to enrage the staff member allocating seats, as she pushed us aside and proceeded to completely ignore us, continuing to allocate seats to people who had been in the queue behind us. When we tried to get her to communicate with us, she continued to ignore us, and laughed and joked with a person she was speaking to on the phone. By this time, there was almost nobody left in the queue, and I was becoming extremely distressed and anxious. This only appeared to cause the staff member further amusement. Eventually, my husband managed to get the attention of another ground staff member, who came and took over the computer and allocated us two seats within a few seconds. We boarded the by now almost-full plane only to find that the new seats we had been allocated were already occupied, and the only empty seats were the two that we had originally been allocated! I have never before, as a customer, encountered such deliberate and extreme rudeness, nor such incompetence. I would certainly not recommend flying internationally with LAN unless there is absolutely no alternative.

### "fly with LAN again"
Very good product offered on this LAN Airlines domestic flight from Santiago to Calama. No delays despite both flights being full. There are small snacks and beverages served. Beautiful views over the Andes. They have also LAN entertainment offered on this flight which was nice and worked well. You have to download the app before the flight. Flown also on international sector from EZE to SCL in premium economy and again very good product you will no longer get on most European airlines. Will definitely fly with LAN again.

### "never fly LAN again"
A month before my flight from Auckland to Sydney with LAN Airlines I called the Contact centre to order a special meal. I ordered a vegan meal, and then they sent me a new itinerary with the updated information. However when I got it I realised that it said I ordered vege lacto-ovo (meaning vegetarian with dairy and eggs, which is not vegan at all) so I called again and told them they had made a mistake. They denied and said that they did order a vegan meal, so I assumed it was a typo. On the flight they served me a meal that clearly had scrambled eggs, a tub of dairy yoghurt and some dairy milk. I told the crew that I had ordered a vegan meal, but they simply told me that they didn't even know what vegan was. I told them that it was like vegetarian but without dairy and eggs, and they replied that my meal was the best they had. They also looked at my order sheet and told me it did not say vegan on it. The crew were nowhere near as friendly as the crew from other airlines I have flown. They seem to favour passengers who can speak Spanish (which I understand is easier to talk to them, but they literally acted completely different to non-Spanish passengers). I will never fly LAN again, and if their website states they have vegan meals then maybe their staff should know what it is too.

### "families are regularly split up"
In 4 flights over 5 weeks with LAN Airlines from Santiago to Sydney via Auckland, 3 had problems. Space between seats is not adequate, families are regularly split up in the plane. We were bumped off a flight at the gate, despite having a boarding pass and lied to - plane overweight, we were last on (we booked 3 months earlier and checked in on time), we didn't even have luggage. My wife flew the last flight with a broken leg, staff in Santiago directed us to 4 different locations, before we could access a wheelchair. We were asked repeatedly "can't she just walk" She had a broken leg - we were reduced to wheeling her on a luggage trolley. When we did get a chair we were assured she would be collected and delivered to the plane. My children and I left to pass customs, my wife was forgotten by LAN staff. Left in a deserted terminal until she was able to call to a passerby for assistance - 20 minutes after the collection time. Despite cabin staff giving further assurance about organising a chair to greet us on arrival - no such request was made.

### "I was bumped and leant on"
Flew LAN Airlines from Santiago, Chile to Lima, Peru and it was by far the worst flight I have been on. When I arrived at the airport to check-in I found out that they had changed my seat. I'm a taller guy so I need more leg room. They put me in the last seat on the aisle next to the bathrooms. Right in front of me was a teenager that had flight sickness and next to me on both sides were crying babies. At the same time I was bumped and leant on, I asked to be moved to another seat and the only ones available were the business class seats and I had to pay $350 to move. Now I'm back in Lima, Peru trying to fly back to Chile and they changed my flight due to delays (been sitting at the airport for 9 hours) and I attempted to try to get on an earlier flight, which by the way they had available seats, but they wouldn't bump me to that flight. Never again will I fly with LAN Airlines.

### "the reward downgrade for us"
Travelling LAN Airlines back from Lima to London Heathrow via Madrid with the family in Business, the flight had a technical issue so all passengers offloaded. 4 hours later we take off and for the first leg Lima to Madrid no hot food as they have offloaded that as well - 10 hours later they serve breakfast not even sparkling mineral water. On arrival in Madrid missed connection and LAN then rebook us on a British Airways flight - but in economy not in business. So after not having any food for 11 hrs, the reward downgrade for us from our original booking class The best news the luggage had a better journey than us.

### "we wanted to buy better seats"
We tried to select our seats many days in advance in all three LAN Airlines planes we had to take. It was impossible to select or buy our seats in flight 600 to LAX, because the website wasn't working to select seats for this flight. We called LAN and they said they said that the website was working. We also tried to buy better seats on the phone, but they also said that we had to buy them only (which it was impossible). After many communications with them, they checked in for us (without asking for that) with different seats (35B-35C) in the flight LA600 that were different from the ones they informed us on the phone (30B-20C). Finally, we could get better seats at the counter in Cordoba. But their customer service is completely evasive and sometimes rude. Also, we made our reservation some months ago with flight LA952 at 5:00 pm from Cordoba to Santiago, and then the company changed this flight leaving at 12:00pm  which caused that we had to stayed in a hotel in Cordoba and spend 8 hours in Santiago. We bought LA 952 at 5:00 pm because it was convenient for us, otherwise we would not buy that combination of flights! Also, the seats in Boeing 787 are very narrow and short, that is why we wanted to buy better seats!

### "aircraft was clean"
Flew from Juliaca, Peru to Lima with LAN Airlines. The plane was OK. The flight was 1 hour and 10 minutes late due to delay of LIM airport departure. They offered us a complimentary hamburger while we were waiting. The aircraft was clean and the service was standard. Food was only crackers and nuts plus drinks. Staff were standard and tired. Apart from offering the burger the airline was not as expected, the 3 stars does not reflect the service that we had. On arrival to LIM we waited 15 minutes to disembark through the bridge.

### "taking care of all requests"
Business class in a LAN Airlines Boeing 787, from Frankfurt to Madrid. Although they don't have a lounge in Frankfurt, we were able to use the new Air Canada lounge. There wasn't any lack of good food, all kinds of drinks and entertainment. The same in Madrid, using the Iberia one. Onboard the staff were taking care of all our requests. We were served a welcoming drink (pisco or sparkling wine) a very light salad and smoked ham with some of the best chilean wines. The pilot gave information about the flight, landing times, connection flights and so on. I must say I had the opportunity to fly them from Santiago to Easter island, 2 months later, in the same aircraft but this time economy and all I could say it was that except the food, which was average (not the wine and Cafe Juan Valdez) the experience was same as pleasent as the business one.

### "they are too variable"
Easter Island to Santiago de Chile. LAN could be a great airline, but they are too variable to get there. This was our 5th sector in this trip and was probably the best, but it wasn't amazing. I like the hard product despite the business class seat layout being 2-2-2, it's a product like Royal Jordanian. Service is all over the place, but at least this crew tried. It was quite funny. Food is below average but the wines were great.

### "would not use again"
Brisbane to Lima via Santiago. I would not use this airline again. We flew from Brisbane to Lima and experienced confusion at Santiago as we waited for flight to Lima. No one really knew what was happening and we changed gates many times. When we were in Santiago we realised we had a problem with one of our flights. We could not go from Lima to Rio as we did not have a visa for Brazil so we went to LAN offices and asked for some help to change the flight. We were told this was not possible even though we were prepared to pay extra money to avoid losing our connecting flight from Santiago back to Brisbane. In fact we heard for the first time that if we didn't get on the flight to Rio all our ongoing flights would be cancelled. Catch 22 as we couldn't go to Rio as we didn't have a visa and we couldn't not go as we still wanted to return to Brisbane. LAN offered us no help at all and were totally useless at a time when we were in a country where we needed some help. We ended up booking flights with Delta to fly back to Brisbane. Moral is always fly with a decent airline - it is worth the extra cost.

### "excellent cabin staff"
Buenos Aires to Miami with LAN Airlines. On time departure and arrival. Excellent cabin staff, very good service and very good food and drink. No complaints. Will fly LAN whenver I can. Cabin clean, good individual screens and movies / music. Airport checkin was smooth.

### "airline is run by muppets"
Rio to Sydney via Santiago and Auckland. There were two staff at the check in at Rio and it took 2 hours, we had paid and booked our seats in early August for the Santiago to Auckland leg but they were allocated to someone else. The staff member gave us two seats one at the front and one at the back, after asking for a supervisor she gave us a seat one behind the other we were advised the flight was full. When I asked to speak to a manager she managed to find two seats together. We had a hour delay at Rio, a 2 hour delay at Santiago, a 7 hour delay at Auckland, the chaos at both Santiago and Auckland had to be seen to be believed. After 34 hours we finally made it home, this airline is run by muppets and if their technical / maintenance section is as inept as their front line staff they do not deserve to be flying into Australia and New Zealand.

### "never fly this airline again"
We encountered the worst customer service with LAN Airlines that I have ever seen. We arrived over an hour before our departure time, check in went as usual, they took our bags and then someone whispered something in the check-in attendants ear and we were suddenly told we were not allowed on the plane because we were "late". We requested to see the supervisor and right in front of us the supervisor left the building and "went home for the evening". After being passed around from employee to employee it became clear they sold our seat and did not have space for us anymore. They refused to offer us a solution stating were just not going to get to go. They stated all other flights to our destination were sold out for the rest of the week and they would not put us on another flight. The treatment and the way they spoke to us was unbelievable and unacceptable. We have traveled all around the world utilizing a variety of airlines and never experienced anything like this. There was one woman there we encountered who was helpful, efficient and kind. Other than that it was a very disrespectful and abusive experience. We will never fly this airline again.

### "a severe problem communicating"
Papeete to Quito via Easter Island/ Santiago. Based on 8 flight sectors with LAN during November I have concluded that LAN have a severe problem communicating with passengers. Their flights are frequently late in departing (up to 3 hours in one case) and they make no attempt to keep passengers informed. Our luggage went missing on a flight to Quito and it was extremely difficult to get the LAN ground staff to tell us where the bags were so that we could determine our next moves. We had arranged for a 10 day cruise around the Galapagos Islands the following day. They were extremely unhelpful and totally disinterested in recovering our luggage. If you ever encounter a problem while travelling with LAN don't expect them to give you any assistance.

### "lie to customers"
We travelled around South America on 8 different flights with LAN and had the same issues on most of our flights. We were travelling with a 5 month old baby. My complaints about LAN Airlines Staff are rude, unhelpful and untrained at dealing with customers. They don't want to accommodate people with babies. Staff lie to customers. Not once but on several occasions. I needed to confirm 3 times that we would need a bassinet, and were told we would get one (three times). On arrival to the airport they said we didn't get one anyway. Bassinets were available on flight but LA801 (a 13 hour flight) but no one with babies got them. Normal economy people were sitting in those seats. I have never seen babies sitting on parents laps when bassinets were available. It states on their website that we have a right to get a bassinet and it is the safest place for babies. I would like to add that we were talking to other parents with young a babies and none of us got bassinets. One parents weren't even sitting together, one other was travelling by herself and they woul't even make the seat next to her free. They all had the same issues as it. Long checkins, Dealing with rude and unhelpful staff, LAN Airlines saying no bassinets and unable to help etc.

### "a good experience"
Check-In was quick and friendly. LAN Airlines Boeing 787 with a nice roomy feeling, big windows. LAN does not use the mood-light functions like Avianca for example. Not sure why. They just dim the light. 3x3x3 seating is not great if you are a single traveler or a couple. Then the old 767 is better. Flights were on time, cabin very clean, but restrooms dirty during the flight. Seat pitch is ok, but there are no foot rests like Avianca. After I couple of hours I really missed them as my legs and feet began to hurt. Flight attendants friendly and smiling. Food is tasty but portions are small so eat something before you take off. Good complementary wine and several refills were offered. Attendants come through the aisles with water during the night. Very good entertainment system. Lots of movies and tons of songs on big personal screens. Minus is that there is no remote control so you always have to move up to the touch screen to zap around. Just bring your own headset. LAN gives you 2 contact headsets but IFE has only one plug-in so you'll get only mono sound using the LAN sets. Blankets and pillows provided. On the outbound even eye covers and ear plugs. Not on the way back though. No hot towels as I'm used to from European or Asian Carriers. Would be a nice perk. Overall a good experience and I will fly LAN again.

### "wonderful long haul experience"
Wonderful long haul experience with LAN and would choose them again. Crew were attentive and food and wine was better than expected. If I had one small suggestion it would be to offer light snacks or even an ice cream mid way between Santiago and Auckland as it's a long sector for just two meal services.

### "worst airline to deal with"
LAN Airlines are the worst airline to deal with ever. They changed the flights without letting us know from a 8:30pm to 10am in the morning. That left us with a 13 hour layover in Los Angeles - a total nightmare. They never contacted us, and we found out by accident when we checked in to confirm. They then said they couldn't help us and would find a specialist to call us back - but they couldn't do anything. Dont fly with them.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I was travelling with LAN Argentina from Bahia Blanca to Buenos Aires. After the start of the boarding flight was canceled due to bad weather. I had a flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid on the next day and tried to get some assistance from LAN Argentina due to that fact. Hopeless, no assistance. I had to look for alternative flights, táxi, food, hotel, etc on my own. Tried to get the refund from LAN but their site does not allow to ask for it (displays error message. Contacted airline via mail several times but never got even an answer not to mention the refund that in spite of insisting was neve done.

### "excuse of an airline"
Flown 8 legs on a S American trip, on this excuse of an airline. Other than the inflight service, LAN Airlines is a disaster, from the poorly functioning website, to extremely chaotic boarding(eg making people line up by their seat #s, than changing the lines three times, and finally setting up wrong signs, leading to utter confusion), to the dirty planes, to absolute incompetence in communication (there were no English announcements made on the plane, not by the pilot nor by the attendants, and the flight was going to LAX) to broken IFE..Not to mention 12 hrs delay at Lima airport where 2 staff dealt with 150 transferring passengers, only to have them return 12 hrs later with no one knowing how and where to deal with the returning delayed passengers. A horrid experience.

### "extraordinary, total incompetence"
I arrived at Cusco airport on the 17/09/2015 in good time to catch the LA2032 to Lima and then my KLM KL744 flight to Amsterdam. However, the flight was delayed due to unknown reasons, no reason was every given. The staff at the check-in were, I cannot find words in the English language to do their, utter, extraordinary, total incompetence justice. There were only two on the desks with queues stretching out for some distance. Yet there were many staff members chatting to each other, or on radios or mobile phones and when they felt like it interrupting the members on the desk and the people on the desk talking on their mobile phones, disappearing to a back office, at one point there was know body sitting at the desks, I could go on. I could hear people in the other queue shouting that they would miss their flights. When I finally got to the front desk I was informed that “don’t worry the flight is delayed 20 minutes you will not miss your flight” meaning the Cusco flight to Lima. I finally got the flight to Lima, only to be informed by the pilot mid air that the flight was an hour delayed. I arrived at Lima only to be informed that my connecting flight had long gone. I entered a very long queue called “missed departures” the one and only member of staff on the desk made the staff at Cusco look like members of MENSA and NASA!! That one person it appeared could not stick to one task, she continually let other members of staff interrupt her, disappeared, you get the picture etc etc entertained a small group of people who forming an unofficial queue, it was a total mess, I stood with other for over two hours, with no refreshments, no information, nothing. When it was my turn the lady said I could wait for another 24 hours and get the 20:05 KLM or she could put me on an Air Europa flight to Madrid then Amsterdam then Manchester. I said no I wanted to go to either Amsterdam, Manchester or Madrid, Amsterdam as that is what I had paid for. This sent her into confusion, with much tapping of the keyboard and phone calls both land line and mobile. Then she said “yes the flight goes to Madrid and then Manchester. I asked her to confirm this that it did not go to Amsterdam, no she said Madrid then Manchester, no Amsterdam. She then after many interruptions booked me a Hotel for 5 hours and a Taxi, she also gave me a code that I should show at the Air Europa check-in. I returned to Lima Airport went to the Air Europa check-in handed in my code. There was a few phone calls and then the lady tapped on a calculator and showed me a large number. I asked if that was the ticket number, no it the cost of a new ticket. The lady at the missed departure line the day before had only made a reservation and had not booked any flight tickets at all! So another trip to the other side of Lima airport to talk to another LAN Airlines member of staff. You guessed it many mobile calls, land line calls, tapping of keyboards etc etc. Then asked to wait for 5 minutes, I asked what was happening he could not tell me, and proceeded to deal other people. Then, after some time, he calls me back and tells me that the tickets are booked, Lima to Madrid, then Amsterdam and then Manchester. I could have screamed, but I just wanted to get out of there and so took the tickets. Little did I know that Air Europa is a very poor substitute for KLM. I paid for a quality service and received through no fault of my own a sub standard service. I was 24 hours late getting home.

### "need to improve customer service"
LAN Airlines onboard service may be great, but counter service at Santiago, Chile is simply awful. The people at SCL Airport should be doing anything else but customer sevice. Online, you cannot update your information. It does not happen. Accessibility to customer service is poor. If you manage to find their phone number, you will be given assistance that goes nowhere. Even the reference number they give you on a request (like updating your information on line) disappears. Nobody knows anything. Reservations - watch out! They will change your assigned seat with no problem and when you check in you have a surprise. When you show them your reservations, counter people do not why. You are left with whatever is available. Upgrades - do not try it. They will look at the purchase date of an economy ticket and then the price of a business on that date, and give you an upgrade for the difference. So, even if they have empty seats on business, they will not upgrade you for a reasonable fee as most airlines do. They need to improve customer service.

### "plane dirty from previous flight"
New aircraft but there ends the positives. LAN Airlines website is very poor and online check-in clunky. I would suggest that LAN scraps its poor website and keeps up with the rest of the OneWorld alliance. At present it is a poor relative. Bag drop was not a pleasant experience; rude staff who were not interested. Boarding was shambolic also. Plane dirty with food from previous flight on tray table. Food and drinks service was also pretty hit and miss. Getting off the plane also took an age.

### LAN Airlines customer review
A LAN Airlines long haul flight from Santiago to Sydney via Auckland that was surprisingly good. Once I worked out how to use flight entertainment, it was easy. Seats were comfortable although somewhat squeezy. Food surprisingly good for airline food and real glass, ceramic dish and metal cutlery were provided. Flight attendants were polite and helpful. Toilets were kept in check.

### "ground staff extraordinarily incompetent"
I was supposed to fly LAN Airlines from EZE to BOG via LIM. Departure time was scheduled for 0755 with a quick connection in LIM for a 1530 ETA into BOG. Flight was cancelled due to unknown reasons (indicated mechanical issues). LAN's ground staff was extraordinarily incompetent, and uninterested in providing answers and solutions. The LAN staff at the VIP lounge tried to help but were instructed by a "supervisor" to send us all to the check-in area as no one else could help us. All pax were forced to "enter" the country again and were submitted to immigration and customs procedures, to go back to the check-in counter to "see if there were other flights" to offer. We were sent to hotels to spend the full day as, In my particular case, my new flight was scheduled to 2100 via SCL for an arrival into BOG of 0500 the next day (13 hours later than scheduled).

### "plane is a torture chamber"
LAN Airlines Boeing 787 was a nice aircraft and the flight crew were good, but an extremely poor seat configuration in economy - resulting in a tortuous flight for a lightly tall person (183 cm). I could not sit straight in my window seat and could not stretch my legs at all. My knees jammed into the seat in front even with the seats upright and became very squashed when the front seat was reclined. I have flown this route many times (10 over the last 10 years) and this was my first flight on the Boeing 787 and it was a huge disappointment due to the cramped seating arrangement. I heard many others on the flight saying it was the most cramped they had ever been! Other flights with LAN's previous aircraft on this route were always pretty good - this one was not! This plane is a torture chamber for a long haul flight! My next flight to Chile will be with Qantas.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LAN had the best times for my travel needs. Flights were on time, plenty of legroom in coach, very comfortable recline in seats, ample personal entertainment on TV, decent food options, attentive staff, a bag on each seat with blanket/pillow/eye mask/ear plugs/water. I managed to get a decent amount of sleep on the long haul leg between JFK and Lima. All of my baggage arrived without trouble. I only speak a little Spanish and I would attempt to communicate; staff also speak English and were friendly and helpful. I will add this tip, and it is more about the Lima transfer than LAN : when you transfer in Lima, you must collect baggage and recheck it for continuing flights. You need to exit the airport, re-enter (just around a corner), and navigate a maze of lines with little indication as of the correct line. Make sure you have ample time between connections. I had 2.5 hours and it was just enough time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
The plane was late both ways from Cusco to Lima and return also. We were at the airport for over 5 hours and we missed connecting with our party to take the tour which cost us additional money. They had a flight to Cusco, which was scheduled to leave after our flight, but they did not put us on it. No reason given. You are never told when you will be able to leave, they leave you waiting without any communication.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew from Santiago de Chile to Easter Island and back and from Santiago to Frankfurt, Germany in Business Class on Boeing 767 and Boeing 787. On all of the flights, announcements in the boarding area were in Spanish only, even at an International flight. Inflight reading material (Newspapers, Magazines) as well only in Spanish. Flight to Easter Island was very poor service, for almost 6 hours flight - 1 Omelette and that not of any decent quality. No additional offers of anything. Cabin crew enjoyed apparently their free time. On return flight and the intercontinental flight, service was good.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LIM-SCL Economy. Overbooked flight some of us were left out. No LAN lounge at this airport using the airport one. Good options for snacks and drinks. Boarding by rows by they left us almost 20 min on the bridge waiting to board. Plane ok good legroon in economy nice FA and service on this 3hr flight to Chile. They serve a full meal and drinks. Movie on the overhead screens. Once in Santiago bags short on belt.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew on LA801 from SCL to SYD on 2/6/15. On the outside LAN's 787-9 is a beautiful aircraft! On the inside though it is too cramped for a long haul service. The 3x4x3 configuration is reasonable however the seats are too close together. Pax taller than 1.8 metres and longer legs suffer all the way. Larger pax also do not fit in the narrow seats comfortably. For dinner in the absence of a vegetarian option I was offered Ravioli with nothing inside and very little tomato sauce for breakfast a cold ham and cheese sandwich accompanied by a cup of cold "coffee"? No cheese only sandwich a suitable vegetarian option was also not available. Someone spent so much money on the latest aircraft and forgot to put together a decent menu to feed its cramped passengers. What's the story with Spanish speaking South American crews - no humour I thought this was isolated to Aerolineas Argentinas but LAN's crew suffers from the same thing. Flying Emirates next time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LA501 connecting to LA750 on 10 May - MIA-SCL-GRU. Both 787's (actually was the same plane for both flights) in good shape and excellent flight. Flown LAN many times and this time the crew was good but lacked the warmth I had on other flights. They did one drink run (as stated in a previous review) but if you needed anything just ring the call button. They come immediately and happy to get you what you want. Dinner was excellent - delicious soup and cheeses entree of shrimp and veggies. Slept thru breakfast so can't comment. LAN Biz seats are the best - I always can sleep 5 hours easily on them. Quick 1 hour connection in SCL - security check took a minute if not less. Almost 3 hour flight to Sao Paulo - 1/2 filled cabin. Friendly service and they left you alone to sleep if needed. Tasty breakfast and good movies to watch. Had an aborted landing so landed a bit late - bag was last off the plane (even with priority tags) but was just glad to get it. Overall a good trip - I would just say I wish their TV shows were more than 1-2 episodes; for a 8-10 hour trip you would enjoy to see 6-10 episodes available. Too bad they don't fly from ORD directly.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Mendoza to AEP. Got to airport early and invited to go on earlier flight if we wanted to - even though on a fixed ticket. Within half an hour of check-in we were in the air! Flight 99% full but cabin staff still managed OK. Arrived on-time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AEP to Mendoza via San Juan. Efficient and friendly check-in modern airbus comfortable seats efficient cabin crew on-time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AEP (Buenos Aires) to Puerto Iguazu return - a very pleasant surprise. Excellent check-in nice modern airbus comfortable seats take-of and landing on-time snack and drink. Pleasant and efficient cabin crew. AEP pretty good airport with security much simpler than in Europe or USA.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Just flew RT on new 787 aircraft from LAX to Lima. Business Class seat was very nice great to be in a new plane. My wife and I were really surprised how lousy the service was from the cabin crew. Our outbound flight left at 2pm and we arrived in Lima about midnight. The flight crew offered a Drink only once on a nine hour flight (in business class). While on nearly any airline you can end up with a crappy flight crew the same thing happened on the return flight. I was shocked how lazy and borderline 'frosty' the cabin crew were.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LA800 26 Apr SYD to AKL. Airline food reached a new low when I flew from Sydney to Auckland. Stale panini type bread enclosing ham and cheese. When I complained about it I was told it came from New Zealand. Why and when? The flight originated in Sydney so should have the bread and baked that day. This tasted at least two or three days old. What are they thinking? They are competing with Emirates on the same route. On the way back I flew with the latter. There could not have been a bigger contrast. I will not fly with this airline again if I have a choice on this route because of the food alone.

### LAN Airlines customer review
27th March 2015 flights Brisbane Australia to Buenos Aires Argentina. Flight Brisbane to Auckland by Qantas / Emirates 27th March 2015 departed and arrived on time. Then transfer to LAN flight LA800 to Santiago with transfer to Buenos Aires. Informed at transfer desk in Auckland to collect our bags and go through customs then report to check in desk on the ground floor. At check in desk we lined up again and were then informed the flight had been cancelled. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to a hotel for overnight accommodation then return for an 8am departure the next morning. On return to Auckland airport were advised our bags would be sent to Buenos Aires though we would need to go to the transfer desk at Santiago and rebook for our onward flight to Buenos Aires. Auckland accommodation with night meal and box breakfast + transfers was supplied by LAN though no assistance would be supplied for us to contact our travel agent or booked hotel with transfer in Buenos Aires. On arrival the next day at the departure gate we waited with all the flight crew for the plane to arrive at the gate after a late boarding of the A340 we taxied for take off only to get to the runway and return to a stand off area of the airport for 1 hour of more repairs to the aircraft. We were delayed 17+ hours in Auckland information or assistance from any LAN staff was not forth coming at any time. On arrival at the transfer desk in Santiago then lined up for over 1 hour as LAN did not have enough staff to rebook for the delayed near full flight of passengers needing to go on to other destinations. As we had 3 weeks in South America + a total of 8 flights with LAN (+ 5 flights with other airlines) we thought the worst with Lan was behind us how wrong could we have been. Every flight was delayed minimum 30 min to 17+ hours. LAN never kept anyone informed of the situation at any time. Lost prepaid accommodation in Buenos Aires costs for international phone calls cost of WIFI at Auckland hotel etc.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We traveled from LAX-LIM LIM-SCL and return. Several flight attendants were friendly but a couple wouldn't make eye contact or smile. I don't have a huge issue with those that don't smile or are too troubled to say hello but the following was certainly unacceptable: The seats are below average in legroom. I'm 5'5" and thought that it was tight legroom for me! The flight attendants were on a mission to complete tasks and be done with attending and I can give several examples. On a 3.5 hr leg we flew Premium Business and the attendant didn't come through until she had finished prepping the meal - no drinks were offered beforehand. She came through in one swoop returned once to retrieve and another final offer of service. On a 9hr day flight the service was similar swooping through to be done. We had 5.5 hrs of absent flight attendants. An overhead compartment opened mid-flight and remained open for 1.5-2 hrs until a passenger closed it. This not only a safety issue but just another plain example of the laziness that seems to omnipresent with flight staff. On this flight we had to get up 2-3 times to get water from galley and they flight attendant couldn't be bothered to poor the water into the glass. He motioned to the water bottle on the counter and seemed annoyed when I asked for ice. Again the minimum work. I'll be taking AA or United down to South America next time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I flew economy from JFK-EZE through Lima and MVD to JFK through Santiago. The long-haul segments were on clean comfortable 767s with personal entertainment in the seat back. The South America legs were on A319/A320 without personal entertainment but fold-down screens showing local TV and or an American film. Long-haul flights served dinner and breakfast which were decent enough and came with complementary wine. The flight crews were friendly and responsive. All four flights were on time smooth and relatively comfortable. Return flight from Santiago to NYC was relatively empty so passengers could lay down across three seats in the middle row. LAN will be my first choice for future South America travel.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We flew from Santiago to Sao Paulo in Premium Economy and had a very good experience. We departed a little late however arrived on-time so no concerns there. After reading some earlier reviews I was a little apprehensive about the service however found the staff to be efficient and friendly and the meal was very good… I would go as far to say it was far better than Qantas (also in PE) from Sydney to Santiago.

### LAN Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew LAN/TAM from JFK to Sao Paulo and returned from Santiago in February 2015. LAN's facilities at JFK are way below standard and they can't handle the slightest problem. While there were weather issues on both ends of our trip they did not justify the poor handling of flights by LAN. On the outgoing flight there were 3 planes loads of passengers waiting at one gate at JFK. This is close to 1000 people all expecting to fly out. It appears LAN only has one gate at JFK. Also they seem to be dependent on American Airlines to service their planes. When something goes wrong like the weather American will of course service their own planes first. The counter staff continually lied to everyone about the situation. The only truthful statement they made was that the flights were not cancelled. When our plane finally was ready to board 7 hours late all 1000 people were trying to figure out what flight was boarding because the lighted sign was wrong and still said all flights were on time. Finally someone taped a paper sign over the lighted sign to say what flight was boarding. Our flight was first of 3 and we were 7 hours late. I have no idea how long the other folks waited. On the return flight the Captain proudly announced we landed at JFK on time. However we sat in the plane for 2.5 hours on the tarmac because there were no gates. Finally to avoid being fined (after 3 hours) they unloaded us on the tarmac and bussed us to the terminal. Why didn't they do that 2 hours earlier? I will never fly LAN in the US again. They don't have the facilities and depend on American which itself is another story. Our experience in South America has been much better. Take American to South America and then fly LAN between cities there.

28th October 2014. Flew Madrid to Lima. Flight delayed 1hr. This did not affect me as I was served drink and savouries. Excellent staff and wonderful seats. Flight departed aporox 1am. Slept for approx 8 hours. Awoke flying over Ecuador. Excellent breakfast. Will definitely fly again with LAN.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I flew from JFK to MVD via SCL on Feb. 14. We were scheduled to depart at 8pm from Terminal 8 (American/One World but Air Berlin plane still at our gate). It had snowed earlier that day so flights were being cancelled or delayed however the LAN flight was still being shown on the departure information board as being on time. The young lady from LAN also told me that the flight was on time. We finally took off at 11pm after being de-iced. In the air LAN was very good in the past I used American to MVD from New York (via Miami) and the difference between the two airlines in the air was like night and day. The FA's were friendly young and interacted with the passengers. Missed connection in SCL but LAN had rebooked me on later flight to MVD and also gave me a voucher for food as my flight was not until mid afternoon. Flight to MVD on A320 the seats seemed to be wider than on the 787 and also a bit more leg room. Coming back from MVD to JFK everything was OK until departure from SCL. We were scheduled to depart at 11pm but due to full load plus many families with kids we did not take off until midnight. Again service and food in the air was excellent (2 entree choices at dinner and breakfast). We were scheduled to arrive at 8am into JFK as we began our descent the pilot announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather and we were being diverted to EWR. We landed at 9.30am waited for an hour to get a gate in Terminal B went through Immigration and then waited an hour and a half for luggage. Only staff from LAN were the FA's on our flight and they knew as much as we did. I finally left the airport at 1.30pm. LAN was great in the air but not so good on the ground.

### LAN Airlines customer review
The customer service on LAN varied greatly. At the check in desk staff went out of their way to be helpful. Flight attendants on the flights from BA to Lima to JFK were awful. I asked for a glass of water it never arrived. Later I asked if we could get a bottle of water I was told no. When I asked for ice during the drink service only 1 or 2 cubes were provided. A flight to JFK will include a certain number of Americans who don't prefer warm drinks. The cabin in row 14 was extremely warm i.e. uncomfortable. When using the restrooms I noticed the rear of the plane was quite comfortable. I went to ask flight attendants if something could be done of if they could look into the temperature. They acted like it was a crazy request. A few hours later after my hands and feet were uncomfortably swollen a flight attendant stopped by to see if anyone had answered the call button. This I'd pressed about an hour before. This is lousy service. This flight attendant was marvellous. This new attendant however said that the pilot controls the cabin temperature and in fact it was quite warm in our area. She said she'd discuss the issue with the pilot. Half an hour later the temperature was beginning to come down and there was some airflow in the cabin. While we appreciated this one flight attendant and the check in desk service greatly the rest of our experience with LAN staff was miserable. Maybe re-training is in order.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Just returned from a package tour to Peru flying with LAN. After reading previous reviews I was not looking forward to the flight. I need not have been concerned as everything from check in at Heathrow to returning via Madrid was excellent (apart from the final leg with Iberia). The inflight entertainment was vast food good by airline standards cabin staff attentive helpful and smiling. There was two short internal flights complete with included snacks and drinks.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I flew LAN on Feb 14 from JFK to MVD via SCL. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8pm. However it snowed (not heavily) that afternoon. Arrived at JFK with plenty of time. Flight shown on departure board as being on time. I was at the gate at 7pm and the flight still showed on time however there was an Air Berlin plane at our gate. According to the agent the flight was still leaving on time even though the plane was not there. We finally left the gate at about 10pm and had to wait to be de-iced. Took off at 11pm. Plane was a Dreamliner and other than the having little room between seats was great. Food service on LAN was much better than on American which I usually use to go to MVD. Flight attendants were young enthusiastic and had good rapport with the passengers. Dinner was a choice of beef or pasta and I chose the beef which was quite good. LAN still uses regular cutlery for meal service (no plastic ware) and glass for wine (no plastic cup). Breakfast was also a choice of two different meals cheese sandwich or eggs and sausage which I chose. The eggs and sausage came in s ceramic dish. Far cry from American's minuscule continental breakfast. Arriving at SCL all transit passengers went to transit area LAN had already printed boarding passes for connecting flights and also provided voucher for food while waiting for the connection. I don't think that any US carrier would do that nowadays. Flight from SCL to MVD was on A320 which was more comfortable than seating on Dreamliner. LAN offered snack service (sandwich and beverage) on 2.5 hour flight which most US carriers do not do any more. Return from MVD to SCL was also on A320 boarding pass issued at MVD showed Gate 5 however departure board showed Gate 4 (which was correct gate). Again LAN offered snack service to SCL. SCL to NYC was a nightmare. We were scheduled to leave at 11pm but did not depart until midnight. The plane was full with families with children onboard many of whom cried screamed at night. Perhaps airlines should keep a stock of pacifiers on board. After take off dinner was served and again the offerings were much better than American's. We were scheduled to land at 8am at JFK as we began our approach and landing gear and flaps were down the captain announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather conditions and we would go to Newark instead. Landed at Newark at 9.30am and waited for an hour on taxiway for gate to be made available. Disembarked at 10.30 and by 11 was through passport control. Then we had to wait for 90 minutes for the luggage to start coming onto the carousel. Left the airport at 1pm. LAN had no one there for assistance except some of the flight attendants who did no have that much information. LAN was great in the air but terrible on the ground.

For a 5.000 dollars business class ticket from Santiago to Papeete what did I get? A broken seat no lounge access neither in Santiago nor in Papeete and not even at the stop in Easter Island sparkling wine that they tried to sell as "champagne" no moisturizer (for a 10 hour flight + stop) no newspaper in English and the window seat I had secured when I bought the ticket had been changed to an aisle one on the return leg. To sum it up an economy class service at a business class price.

Flew from MEX-LIM-GYE-UIO. First flight 6 hours delayed arrived at 4 am missed night in hotel which was non refundable. Second flight delayed by 2 hours and had to rebook for final leg. Terrible customer service. I am emerald in One World and will never fly them again. Avianca-Taca is a better option for Latin America.

Flew in economy from Santiago (Chile) to Punta Arenas on Jan 28 2015 and from Ushuaia to Buenos Aires on Feb 4 2015 and from Mendoza (Argentina) to Santiago and from Santiago to Montevideo (Uruguay) on Feb 8 2015. A very consistent product. Always honored my AA Platinum status with early boarding and marked our luggage for special handling. All flights on time seat pitch varied on their 320's from generous to cramped. Snack and drinks always served. Staff friendly and helpful available throughout boarding to assist and throughout the flights. Even offered headsets for the flights longer than two hours and had adequate programming. Very impressed.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Service on this airline is of the poorest quality not up to international standards. My family and I were flying from Peru to the US. We purchased American Airlines tickets but the flight was operated by LAN - apparently LAN and American have a going partnership. I am a frequent AA flyer and thus enjoy their Advantage priority check in. When checking through LAN's priority queue which BTW was empty I was informed that they could only check me in but not my wife and daughters - LAN wanted to split the family. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I only received very rude treatment. This has never happened to me before while flying with other major airlines. So I guess the moral of this story is if you're an AA frequent flyer and expect to be treated as such avoid LAN at all costs.

### LAN Airlines customer review
FRA-GRU and GRU-LHR. Flight departed on time. Nowadays there is not much differences between the main airlines and LAN offered what is expected in Economy Class: Two full meals (somewhat more basic than on main European carriers but portions a little larger) good IFE system and professional service from the staff - less personal but on European carriers but nothing to complain about. Main complain was the hard narrow seats on Boeing 777-300ER as in other carriers using the 3x4x4 option seats are much less comfortable than formerly and make long-distant flights something of a challenge but TAM is not alone here.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Jan 9 2015 flight #530. My flight between Santiago and Lima was excellent. The plane a Boeing 787 was spacious and new and flight attendants were the best I've seen. They were extremely accommodating respectful and sharp. I will recommend LAN.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We flew to Sao Paulo from Heathrow and then onto Buenos Aires with LAN/TAM in Nov. Good flight and impressed with the amount of legroom in economy and reasonable film choices - neither myself nor my husband can sleep on planes - so that is important. Unfortunately when we returned from Santiago to Madrid we were on an Iberia flight. Again good legroom but horror of horrors no individual screens! The flight was interminable - 3 very poor films were shown back to back and so for more than six hours there was not even any flight information available. Would not want to travel with this airline again because of the links with this airline - which is a shame as the seats were far more comfortable than BA. Didn't feel that the cabin staff were particularly attentive - soft drinks had to be requested rather than being offered through the night on the return journey.

### LAN Airlines customer review
FRA-MAD-SCL: cabin and seats looked like new. The comfortable seats could be folded flat and we slept very well. The meals and beverages were well above our expectations as the service was.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew LAN from Santiago to Atacama and then to Easter Island. New plans on all the Chile flights and flew a 767 to Easter Island. Excellent service good food and IFE on a 2-hour flight! Particularly impressed with the Easter Island Service. I wish BA would learn from them. Not so impressed with LAN Argentina - older planes not so punctual and chaos at check-in (Buenos Aires to El Calafate). But no real issues and would recommend anyone holidaying in South America to fly them.

### LAN Airlines customer review
BOG - SMR. LAN needs to invest on their entertainment which is really outdated. The space between seats was very tight only a few centimetres between each other. The good things were the food and beverages onboard the staff were very nice and courteous.

Flew Premium Business SYD-SCL on LA 800 in the A340 Seat 1A. I have flown this route over 20 times in the past 10 years. Fast efficient check in able to relax in Qantas Lounge in Sydney before flight. Slept most of the way to NZ. However flight crew were cheerful and helpful. Auckland to Santiago was an extremely pleasant flight. Meal quality and choices were excellent could have gone back for seconds thirds of the smoked salmon with mango salsa for entree. This was followed by a lovely lamb rack with sweet potato mash all washed down with a fine selection of Chilean wines. Seat coverts into a lie flat bed offering a comfortable sleep of which I got 7 hours. Cannot comment on the IFE as I did not use. Flight arrived 40 minutes early. Overall again an excellent experience with LAN - highly recommended. Cannot wait for the B787 Dreamliner to commence operating on this route from April 2015.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-MVD-SCL booked in premium economy but happily placed in the business cabin of their A320s that are used on these sectors perhaps because of my Oneworld status. LAN provided a good on-time service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as I'm not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking. As they are part of Oneworld they will be getting more and more non-local speakers on board so they should focus on language skills even on regional and local routes. Otherwise quite a good experience.

### LAN Airlines customer review
In November we embarked on a 3 week trip to Chile and Easter Island. I was quite excited that the most significant legs of our trips (NY-Santiago and return) would be flown on the Boeing 787. It turned out to be about the most uncomfortable that I have ever had on an airline. The seat configuration was 3-3-3 and the seats were very narrow and cramped. I am not a large person and it was impossible to sleep due to the closeness of the seats. The food on the flight down was basically inedible a pasty gummy pasta with a flavorless sauce. On the return flight as breakfast was served a couple hours before arriving in NY they had run out of breakfast omelettes by the time that they had reached our seats (and we were only in the middle of the main cabin.) We passed on the ham and cheese sandwich which was the only thing available. Domestic flights from Santiago to Punta Arenas Calama and Easter Island were no better. All very cramped and on the return flight from Easter Island two of the four lavatories in coach were not functioning and could not be used. The only redeeming aspect of the flights is that they provide free headsets on every flight. I know that when flying to South America there are not a lot of choices but I will attempt to avoid LAN if at all possible on my next visit there. It is a terrible airline to fly in coach.

### LAN Airlines customer review
My partner and I travelled with LAN from Australia to South America return and internally within South America on a LAN pass. I was so pleasantly surprised by the level of service and friendliness of the cabin crew. I had read prior to our trip mixed reviews so was somewhat apprehensive when it came time to travel. Past reviews couldn't have been more far of the mark! The cabin crew were really friendly. My partner is a very nervous flyer and on every leg we flew with them the cabin crew kept checking in on him to make sure he was okay. On our way home flying into Auckland we were told there was bad weather and one lovely cabin crew member even offered to sit by him as we landed. The food was nice and not too heavy and on the long haul sectors cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisle with drinks. The inflight entertainment system was fantastic and I would put it on par with Emirates ICE system! Any negatives? The only thing I could say is that the seats were a little uncomfortable but then being over 6 ft I get the same problem with other airlines. On the whole a most enjoyable experience.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Iguazu-Buenos Aires in an A320 operated by LAN Argentina. Quick and efficient check-in. The seat had a lot of legroom and was quite comfortable. A small snack of biscuits and a drink was served (the service was a little brusque). The plane operated right on time and baggage came to the carousel quite quickly.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LA800 to Santiago was cancelled and passengers waiting in Auckland were requested to return to the airport on Sunday. At the hotel received at least five different notices on departure time that ranged from early morning on Sunday to late evening in random order. After more than five hours given boarding passes to Santiago despite the fact that tickets were to La Paz and told them that that was all they could do and that someone in Santiago was taking care of the following flights - a lie. At Santiago regrettably things were not any better. Given boarding passes to Lima still not La Paz on a plane departing from Santiago at 10pm which meant another eight hours wait however it would not have been the main problem which was arriving into Lima too late to catch the flight to La Paz and needing to wait at the airport for the next flight in the morning - this was not explained and no guidanc on sleeping or hotels. Eventually they managed to find space on the earlier flight at 8.00pm which made possible for them to connect to La Paz the same day landed on Monday at 5.30 am - suitcases of course didn't. In the last six trips a member of my family flew LAN four times and the flight was either cancelled or delayed. The lack of competition means that no matter how badly passengers are treated LAN feels customers will not walk away.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Sydney-Santiago and back from Buenos Aires via Santiago. Overall very pleasant flights particularly due to the friendly efficiency of the crews. Good food and drink and efficient service. On the transpacific routes the A340 has two business class cabins. The rear one (rows 6 and 7) is very cold and apparently the temperature cannot be adjusted so avoid these rows if you can. They are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers (including us) out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin (rows 1 to 5) where we were much more comfortable. However we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from Sydney to Auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm. We greatly enjoyed our flight in the LAN Dreamliner from Buenos Aires to Santiago. It's a much more comfortable plane than the A340. The lounge in Santiago is quite basic. It's narrow and in a basement but offers some chance to relax. The lounges in Buenos Aires and Auckland (Qantas lounge) are far superior.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Santiago-Lima in Premium Economy then two internal flights in Peru and Lima-Havana all in Economy. All flights operated on time and the service was friendly and efficient. Pleasant meals and snacks were served. The plane on our first sector was a bit old and tatty inside the others were all fine though the seat on the 5-hr sector from Lima to Havana was rather tight for such a long sector. Check-in boarding and luggage delivery were all efficient and all flights arrived on time or early. The Premium Economy seats are Economy seats with the middle seat left empty. A Business Class meal was served on our international Premium Economy sector. One sour note was the way the entire crew (including the captain and first officer) pushed past their passengers in Havana to get to the front of the immigration queue. Not a good look.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Santiago-Punta Arenas-Mount Pleasant (Falklands). On time and managed to get comfortable exit row seat. Typical LAN efficiency but the food service is inadequate for what is in total a 6 hour journey on a domestic A320. Just a choice of 'nibbles' on the 3.5 hrs down to Punta Arenas and the same on the 1.5 hours to MPA. Quite interesting landing at MPA which is a UK military base.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SMR-BOG late evening flight coach (they no offer business in Colombian domestic flights) on time departure fairly comfortable seating in a rather old A320. Good beverage and snack service at least better than Avianca's. Quick baggage retrieval upon arrival in BOG new domestic terminal which offered a nice experience given the day (Sunday) and arrival (8pm) time. Overall a nice flight.

We travelled from Melbourne to Rio De Janeiro within Brazil Argentina and back to Melbourne via Santiago. 6th October-29th October with a total of 12 flights. There was a problem in Buenos Aires which meant we missed our connecting flight home from Santiago. We were tired and unwell. We were so grateful for the excellent assistance and kindness we received from airline staff in Santiago.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I have just returned from a 3 month journey through South America. Initially on the 29th July I flew Emirates BNE-AKL (food very disappointing dirty cabin cabin crew uninterested in their clients although in abundance) then LAN-AKL-SCL. I had a degree of trepidation in relation to flying LAN after reading some negative reviews. Flight across was fine. Comments in relation to food seating decor and cabin crew appeared consistent with what I have read. However having flown with LAN on 12 internal flights whilst in South America my respect for LAN's efficiency great timekeeping friendliness of both ground and cabin staff excellent facilities has increased. The flight SCL-SYD on the 16th October was great. Food service and cabin staff were all very good. The new crew on the AKL-SYD leg was by far the warmest I had encountered in terms of hospitality and service level. I am planning a return trip to South America and I would have no hesitation in recommending this airline.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I travelled to 5 countries in South America during July and October. Whilst travelling I flew LAN on 13 occasions: SCL-LIM-CUZ JUL-LIM LIM-SCL AEP-IGR (return) MVD-SCL SCL-IPL (return) SCL-LIM-LPB LPB-SCL. Throughout all flights I was greatly impressed by the efficiency of LAN. Ground and cabin crews were friendly and helpful. The LAN boxed meals on (one class) short flights was consistent. Cabin crew warm and welcoming. Trolley service by cabin crew was excellent despite the fact that the majority of flights were fully booked. The one sour point was that the inflight entertainment (IPL-SCL) failed in my section of the aircraft. However having had a tsunami alert whilst on Easter Island in the early hours of my departure day I relished the chance for a sleep. This flight is treated as an international flight. Hence a pillow and blanket was provided. Notwithstanding this fact I would have no trouble in recommending LAN.

LA 2589 UIO-LIM on 12 October. A320 and very good flight. Boarding was a bit of a mess but that seems typical. Flight attendants so friendly and spoke many languages. Seated in exit row so lots of leg room. Flight was smooth and nice views of the Andes - snack box provided and landed on time. Always enjoy flying with LAN.

LA801 AKL-SYD. 2 Oct 2014 06.00 Flight time. Just a short flight to Sydney traveling on A340-300 LAN Chile. This is my second flight with LAN. It was an ok flight. Nothing to rave about. The interior was dated inflight entertainment was also very dated. The food was average and only offered refreshments once. It got me to Sydney on time so I was happy.

### LAN Airlines customer review
JFK-LIM-JFK in economy. I was very impressed with the in-flight service but I still had a rather negative experience with this airline. I was booked on their direct flight from NY to Lima. On the day of my flight I was shocked when I discovered that there was a 12 hour delay! After spending hours on the phone I was finally re- routed via Miami and ended up rushing out the door to catch this new flight. I was lucky to end up making it to Lima on time. It's a shame that I spent extra money to have the direct flight but ended up having to make a stressful connection (with a very long layover). Inflight service was excellent and two hot meals were provided but I can't say that I would call LAN reliable.

Flights 801 and 800 return Auckland to Sydney. Definitely value for money did not expect something to eat on an economy flight. Pleasant staff and will definitely be travelling with LAN again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-LSC short hop to La Serena very friendly and polite crew. Seat pitch ridiculous luckily just an hour flight! I usually never have problems with pitch but cramped 174 (non slim) seats in a A320? That's almost what you would get on a low cost carrier. Otherwise seamless flight. The ground staff lacks knowledge of English and could have a bit more of a service attitude! Cabin crew excellent though!

### LAN Airlines customer review
I don't normally write reviews but after several flights with LAN and the continued problems with special meals it is becoming a persistent problem. Every time I fly I specifically request vegetarian meals when I book a flight. When I had 3 connecting flights from Chile to New York the first 2 flights I was provided with a vegetarian meal however the third and also the longest flight for some reason I was not provided with a vegetarian meal. On my last flight from Chile to Australia my flight was changed by LAN a month prior to the date. Whilst on the phone with a LAN representative I requested a vegetarian meal again to make sure after the last flight I would not have a reoccurring problem. It was assured to me that the meal was requested. The day of the flight I rang LAN to make sure that I had a vegetarian meal unfortunately however in the system it appeared that I had not requested it. The frustrating thing was I requested the meal over a month ago when they called to change my flight. Normally in situations like this I would not bother me to much but on long 14 hour flights with not provided meal it is a real inconvenience.

I would never recommend LAN Airlines to anyone contemplating using them I was due to fly from Sydney on 7th June to Rio with them they changed the flight departure with less than 24 hrs notice I was due to arrive in Rio on Saturday 8th June at 9 pm but instead arrived on Sunday at 8pm my luggage arrived the following day! Terrible service on the flight from Sydney to Auckland the food was cold and inedible cabin service was slow and poor also I asked for a gin and tonic and received the reply "we don't have any gin". Am dreading having to fly back to Sydney with them in a weeks time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We have booked to fly from London to South America return and LAN has issued the tickets. We upgraded to business class but on one of the 4 sectors we cannot choose our seats - totally unacceptable when paying for a business class ticket. None of the flights are actually operated by LAN though all the flights have a LAN codeshare. LAN customer service is completely useless when it comes to resolving this issue. LAN have good prices but it seems the downside is poor customer service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Mayhem on flights from Auckland to Sydney! Was scheduled to fly from Auckland to Sydney (with ongoing flights to South Africa) at the end of May 2014. The flight came in from Santiago. Our first inklings that something was wrong was when the flight did not start boarding on time. They only announced about half an hour after the flight was meant to take off that there was something wrong with the plane which meant that the flight was delayed for about 3 hours. The communication from the ground staff was almost non-existent. They merely told us our flight was delayed and made little to no effort to keep us updated or get those of us on ongoing international flights on re- routed flights. The counter staff albeit very stressed understandably were not very helpful. We were given some coupons for food but it honestly took around 2 hours standing in the queue even to get a coupon for a coffee because the counters had one or two staff for a line of around 200 passengers. I had to beg at the counter to try to get a re-routed flight through Hong Kong - a suggestion I had to make! After finally getting re-routed LAN refused to release my baggage to my new carrier (Cathay Pacific) even though the aircraft had been sitting on the tarmac for about 7 hours by the time my new flight departed - a fact that seemed completely unacceptable to Cathay Pacific who tried very hard to get our bags on the new flight and said they had repeatedly asked LAN to release the bags to them. I eventually arrived in South Africa a full 14 hours later than I should have but thankful to be there at all. In talking to some of the other carrier staff on the ground in Auckland before I left (and after I returned) this was not a once-off occurrence and LAN is regularly delayed in Auckland.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We took LAN from Sao Paulo to Lima from Lima to Cuzco (return) as well as from Lima to Iguazu Brazil. All four segments were good and on time. Food and drinks served were ok. Staff were friendly and cheerful. Typical south American hospitality. If you are flying LAN as a foreigner once you buy more than 3 segments online you are automatically put on LANPASS and enjoy substantial savings compared to flying just one route or two. Only buy tickets using the South American pass if you want the change of date/time flexibility as the cost will be substantially higher for such flexibility. I bought the tickets through the USA website and they allowed me to cancel FOC within 24 hours I lost only the currency conversion as well as processing fee. Planes are normally quite full. Ask for window seats if you want to see Lake Titicaca on daylight flights.

Flew LAN on a QANTAS /TAM ticket from Auckland to Rio return connecting through Santiago (16 May return last Sunday 8 June). LAN seem to have major operational issues with their A343 flights to and from Oceania. Being kind one could say they are erring on the side of caution but significant punctuality issues where flights are frequently either delayed or cancelled does not inspire confidence (retrospectively checked flightaware.com to verify my suspicions). LAN800 delayed ex Auckland by over 1 hour which proved QFs text message received the night before to be correct. Contacted QF on receipt regarding my 1h20 min connection as was travelling on to Europe from Rio same day. Told to contact LAN directly. Did so and LAN adamant that no problem with connecting as flight on time. Phooey! Encountered same circus at Santiago on arrival from Rio enroute home. Went to allocated gate to snare some snooze time for the 4 hours transit only to wake up to 2 gate changes (from gate 11 to 14 then finally 17B) one flight status of 'cancellado' and one of 'atrasado' (delayed). All for the same LAN801. Amazing. Flight eventually left some hours after scheduled 2320h take off as a replacement crew then needed to be called up. Insult to injury was the dinner served around 4-5am. Food masquerading as beef is not worth being kept awake for. Real shame as inflight the crew are pretty charming and attentive. I would expect these shenanigans from AR with whom I've previously travelled to Argentina. Had hoped LAN would be superior. On the positive side the flights between Santiago and Rio were pleasant. Just wish there was a reliable alternative or LAN just got its act together.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Bogota to Santiago in Business Premium. Some of the most friendly flight attendants I have come across. I think they were Bogota-based at this flight was operated by LAN Colombia. The flight departed at midnight and arrived in Santiago at 6.30am next day so food option was a quiche for dinner and a muffin for breakfast. I personally expected something better and I did not eat anything in LAN's beautiful lounge at Bogota's airport before boarding. Most people went straight to bed after taking off. One would have to be extremely tired and sleepy to be able to sleep. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. They are very hard and narrow and there is not space to store anything apart from in the literature pocket in front. Do not leave stuff on your side as they will be swallowed by the seat when it is put in the bed position. The wonderful crew took ages to retrieve my glasses that simply disappeared.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I've had good and bad experiences with LAN over the years but recently found they have very much improved their customer service. I was on LA801 SCL-AKl on 5 June which first was delayed and then cancelled. At all times we were kept informed and once they announced the cancellation we were taken to one of various very good hotels for the night. The next day a LAN representative came to the hotel around lunchtime to update us and announced that the flight would finally be leaving 23 hours after the original planned departure time. We were well looked after up to boarding time. I also found that the cabin crew spoke much better English than in the past and were very attentive. I was in economy but as on other trips I found their meals to be excellent. All in all a much improved airline.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Lima-Sao Paulo. Poor Premium economy service no meal provided. I had to request a glass of orange juice personally when I saw the cabin crew. Starving on the 5 hours flight crew with no smiles at all. No choice to fly with them as the only airline in South American that covers most destination.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AKL-SYD. Business. The worst service ever. LAN called the evening before to inform me of three hour delay which I explained was problematic due to a two hour connection in SYD. Reservation staff assured me they would put me on another flight back to LAX in the morning at airport when I checked in. That was a complete ill truth as check- in was handled by Air NZ whom did nothing and quite rude. Was then booked on Qantas which was fantastic whom made sure I made my connection. Would never fly LAN.

Buenos Aires - Santiago de Chile - Montevideo. All sectors on time. Check in usually fast and easy. The boarding is ok by rows or priority if you have it. Once on board nice FA.

### LAN Airlines customer review
BOG-CTG Quick hop between Bogota and Cartagena one way for about £60. There's always a slight issue when flying internally from the capital's airport as neither airline or airport websites taxi drivers nor some employees seem to have consensus on which terminal anyone flies from. The issue with this is that the old terminal has no physical connection to the new so transit between is a bit of a bother. Thankfully all LAN flights currently go from the new El Dorado terminal which is clean and modern. Even though it wasn't that busy it still seemed to take around 45 minutes to get to a check in desk - large numbers of employees chatting rather than working seemed to be the problem. Once checked in quickly through to domestic departures which has a few bars and shops. Warm welcome onboard a brand new A320. Very comfy seats with decent legroom. Minor altercation as we approached the runway as a gentleman behind me had brought a chicken onboard with him unnoticed by the crew - or indeed by any security personnel on the ground. Incredulously the captain elected to take off anyway. Smooth flight with complimentary tea coffee and juice as well as a small snack box of chips and cookies - nicely presented and perfectly adequate for the 60min flight. Landed on time and bags off swiftly. Good flight only slightly marred by inefficient ground staff and live animal policy!

### LAN Airlines customer review
The flight was LAX to Lima to Cusco great seats new plane. Free entertainment in back of seat. Two meals and snack on short Lima to Cusco flight. US airlines too stingy to go old school. Uber friendly flight attendants. Only weird thing is 10lb limit on carry on. When checking in bag I also had a normal rolling carry on and a small purse. The rolling back weighed 12 lbs and my purse 3.5? They made me rearrange my carry ons so the rolling bag was not over 10lbs. You know once I walked into airport I changed it right back. Flight from Lima to Peru didn't even ask to weigh and it was much smaller plane. They also do not accept TSA pre check at Bradley terminal LAX very disappointing.

### LAN Airlines customer review
The reservation system and agents is not good. I had to make a couple changes to a business class flight to and from the US to South America. It was a nightmare. Communication in English was difficult and the changes took forever. On the return I simply inquired about changing my departure time. The agent misunderstood and released my seat. I had to take a different flight and was charges the fare difference! In flight personnel were good though but watch out if you have to make changes.

I arrived in Santiago yesterday from Sydney and Auckland only to find my connection flight to Sao Paulo had departed. After a very long time at the LAN desk in Santiago I was put on a flight to Buenos Aires to connect to Sao Paulo. Unfortunately the girl at the LAN Santiago desk did not book me on the flight she told me I was booked onto. The flight was full and I found out about this when I got to Buenos Aires. They managed to find me a seat on a packed dirty TAM plane in Economy class. My ticket was for Business class. My flight originated in Melbourne I'm an old Qantas frequent flyer customer and I was extremely disappointed with the service. To top it all up my 2 suitcases did not arrive. The LAN on-board service and flight attendants were extremely good but the ground staff were very poorly equipped to deal with arriving passengers. Chaotic would be a better description for the situation!

### LAN Airlines customer review
Bogota to Quito via Medellin. Flight on time and full. Only coffee or water on internal flights offered and no sense of urgency considering flight time. Other airlines manage to serve food and full bar service on such a flight sector. Transfer in Medellin not recognised had to exit and go through the tedious security before sent back to check in since no hand luggage tag given since previous check in at Bogota! No lounge facilities at both airports even though to Quito it was international. Process in Medellin unacceptable. Service inflight to Quito with limited drinks and no alcohol food or even snack offered. When asked to have a beer was told they would check in the back but the crew never returned. No food at all during the 90 minute flight and in the end no drink! The crew were more interested passing through the cabin announcing duty free sales and shopping. Ghost pilots with no announcements and could hardly understand the English from the crew! In my humble opinion a terrible airline lacking service and consistency. This taking into consideration the relatively expensive ticket for such a short journey with lack of service despite being a Oneworld Emerald member.

LA2707 Madrid-Lima March 10 2014. LA531 Lima-Santiago March 13 2014. LA4544 Buenos Aires-Sao Paolo. Business Class except Buenos Aires-Sao Paolo which was Premium Economy. We first flew LAN 3 years ago were very satisfied then and it didn't disappoint this time. Would have preferred completely lie-flat beds though like we had Madrid- Santiago in 2011. Food excellent well-chosen wines and very cheerful and attentive cabin staff. We also used LAN for 3 internal flights in economy and had no complaints there either. The flight from El Calafate to Buenos Aires was two hours late but our agent was informed and departure from our hotel delayed so we weren't hanging around at the airport. Special mention for Lima Business Class lounge - a smoker's paradise! Open to the air so no tobacco smell and comfortably furnished. My non-smoking companion preferred to sit there with me than to use the air- conditioned non-smoking section and it looked as though quite a few other non-smokers were of the same mind too!

LAN 933/500 - Mendoza to SCL to Miami. Coach to SCL and Business to MIA. A320 out of Mendoza departed on time and was a quick 40 minute flight. Beautiful flight over the Andes mountains - the pilot came on to point out a few mountain tops in Spanish and English. Not even a drink service - I've been on other 40 min flights that at least had water offered. But good flight overall. 767-300 from SCL to MIA - excellent! Purser came to my seat and thanked me personally for being Emerald One World - very nice. Food as always on LAN is great - had an express dinner and then slept 5.5 hours on one of the best Biz Class seats in the air. Arrived on time and bags out and through immigration/customs in 30 minutes after deplaning.

Flew BA Aeroparque to Mendoza on 9 April. A320 was to leave at 5.50pm but delay of inbound flight. Not an issue but the gate agents never made any announcement about a delay. Line forming so I went to ask and she said leaving at 5.55pm. We didn't even board until 6.15pm through buses - agent had said we would board through a jet bridge but anyone who has flown LA from AEP knows Aerolineas Argentinas uses the jet bridges and makes LA use stairs on the Tarmac to board. Bussed to aircraft - friendly attendant greeted passengers at both front and rear doors. Pilot apologized for the delay. Quick take off and 1 hour 40 minutes to Mendoza. Snack box was appreciated but mostly sugary cookies - not healthy at all. Flight landed and bags off quick. LAN is a good airline but sometimes leaves little things to be desired. Flying them 12 April Mendoza - Santiago-Miami so will see how that goes.

I was flying from Buenos Aires to San Carlos de Barioche on March 28 and LAN announced an 'unanticipated' maintenance work on the plane. This caused a delay of about 90 minutes leaving close to 10pm. There were no vouchers for a snack and ground personnel didn't even know how to use a pay phone to call someone who was going to pick me up. On my way home flying from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo on April 9 LAN again has an 'unanticipated' maintenance work on the plane.

Flight was scheduled to leave at 12.40pm from LIM and go to LAX. At about noon it was announced that the flight was delayed due to technical issues and to return at 2.00pm. At 2.00pm it was announced the issues were not resolved and to come back at 4.00pm. At 4.00pm it was announced that the flight was delayed until 7.00am the next day. Passengers passports were collected to get the exit stamp revoked when passports were handed back 2 hours later it was done in a nerve wrecking fashion. I asked one of the staff if there was another flight that night to Southern California he said no. Later I see someone getting onto standby and I learn there was another flight that night. I waited on standby and did not get a spot. I took the appointed taxi to the hotel I was given to stay at. At the airport I get my new boarding pass. I get to the boarding gate and learned that the flight is delayed again. Throughout the whole process staff would make important announcements only in Spanish. I would ask for a translation and some of the staff were unable to give it. Hours later the flight finally got off the ground. A delayed flight is forgivable but the way the ordeal was handle was unacceptable.

Mendoza-SCL to Madrid in economy. Ground Crew in MDZ gave me an aisle seat (36H) for the long haul trip SCL-MAD I cross-checked in SCL on arriving everything ok. At boarding I was given a window seat in another row ground crew unhelpful and incompetent. They said that the flight crew was to give me another seat. Onboard I contacted the purser. She managed the problem in a completely efficient and graceful way contacting me several times during the flight even offering a drink to me and the people who had to go back to their original middle and window seat thus sharing space with me: very professional service. Rest of the crew very polite helpful speaking several languages. A very pleasant experience for a flight in economy very recommendable. Good food (even breakfast which can be a big problem with other airlines) good drinks excellent IFE in a new 787. Seats ok I am 1.75m and not very broad. It seems the seats are narrower than on other planes I managed to get some sleep anyway. Anyway you should not store anything in the seat pocket before you space gets cramped and you feel something like a steel rod on your knees.

MAD-FRA. Excellent business class offer: 225 euros ow only 100 euros more expensive than economy. Very relaxing flight which started in the nice well equipped Iberia lounge in T4S at Madrid Airport. I was about the only one in biz. Comfortable seat nice inflight entertainment tasty meal and friendly crew. The purser introducing herself was a nice personal touch. 787 Dreamliner is a great silent plane and I like the coloring of the windows instead of blinds. Price was less than one third of Lufthansa and Iberia fare. And with a real business class in stead of a free middle seat. Highly recommended.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew LAN on 4 flights around Peru. The flights themselves were fine. Clean planes good crews and largely on time. It's their systems that are a big problem starting with the fact you can't reserve seats in advance until check-in is available 48 hours prior to departure. I find that problematic and then tried unsuccessfully to get seats and check in online 48 hours prior to the flight only to get a message saying I had multiple destinations and needed to call them. Not acceptable nowadays. One of my flights had a time change of an hour and I was never notified and only found out when I got to the airport. Finally one of my segments was from Iquitos connecting in Lima and then on to Cuzco. My bag was the only one on the flight to Cuzco that did not arrive. OK that happens but they handled it horribly. They really need to get their systems and customer service up to current standards particularly as you pay a premium on LAN over the other domestic Peruvian carriers.

EZE-SCL. Transferring to LAN from Lufthansa in EZE. Although not in the same alliance LAN representative awaited transferring LH passengers at LH gate upon arrival checking that their transfer baggage number were in LAN's system providing them with boarding passes or escorting them through security to LAN counter. Very professional! LAN lounge in EZE one of the best I ever encountered. Even dulce de leche ice cream was offered. Flight on A 320 was uneventful. Aircraft in good shape decent snack and drinks. Even some IFE (in Spanish). Baggage delivery very fast. Baggage question in preparation of trip was answered via Facebook fast and correctly. Would recommend without hesitation.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Compared to some airlines LAN had a decent amount of legroom and the international food and beverage options were decent. However LAN is terrible when it comes to customer service if anything goes wrong. We were at our gate two hours early and followed the signage since we didn't speak the local language. The signage was all wrong and our flight left without us. We were literally standing under a video screen with our flight information that said pre-boarding and that the fight was delayed and it turns out the flight left from a different line somewhere. Ok so is there another flight we can get to the destination from anyone at this airport? No they said. Only a flight at the same time the next day which would have defeated the purpose of our trip. We investigated ourselves and found out they just pulled that out of nowhere because there were several other flights from other airlines that day. So we booked one of those flights and made arrangements with LAN to pick up our luggage when we got there since it was on the missed flight. They said they had called and arranged for our luggage to be taken to the luggage office and to pick it up when we got there. When we got there LAN had gone home for the day and locked our bags away. No bag for us until the next day. Never again will I fly LAN airlines. Absolutely unacceptable customer service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
My experience with LAN was excellent. I used these forums extensively before booking for a return trip Australia to Sth America so I'm writing to give some balance to the negative reviews. I travelled with an 88 yr old relative who went Business Class and I went Economy. Only one of our 6 flights was delayed and only by 35 mins. This caused a missed connecting flight which was sorted out seamlessly baggage transferred all good. LAN made sure I could be close to my relative by putting me at the very front of Economy each time. I was also allowed to use their lounges as I was flying with someone in Business Class. The only lounge which wouldn't let me in was a Qantas one in Sydney at the start of the journey even though my relative had a guest pass for me and I'm a Qantas FF. They apparently share the same One World system as LAN. Cabin crew were great seats were good food fine selection of films huge - cost way less than Qantas halfway between the Qantas price and the Aerolineas Argentinas price. Glad we went LAN I recommend it.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Very disappointing experience flying LAN last night - essentially harassed by an incompetent and poorly informed check-in crew at AEP in Buenos Aires. Flew LAN 480 last night from AEP to Santiago - check-in crew insisted that Chile reciprocity fee needed to be paid before they will check us in - ran around the airport for an hour to figure how/where to pay could not find any I online location embassy website said pay on arrival in SCL - but 4 ladies at the check-in desk refused to accept and kept insisting for payment before check-in. Asked to see supervisor and was told supervisor was in meeting and would be available only after flight departure time. Finally rep from Salon VIP came to the rescue and convinced the crew to get approval and check us in. The actual flight was ok. Landed in SCL to find that Chile does not collect reciprocity fee anymore! Highly unlikely to fly or recommend this airline in the future. Very disappointing.

SCL-SYD Feb 3 2014. First time with LAN International code shared with Qantas. Very good flight all round; very attentive smart cabin crew dinner and wines good. We ate lightly as this flight left around midnight and the pasta dish was delicious. A larger steak meal was offered. Lie flat bed and comforter allowed many hours sleep through to Auckland. IFE was basic considering the aircraft looked fairly new (A340). Two breakfasts - one into AKL and one leaving AKL to SYD. Tip: have a continental for the first and enjoy a cooked one for the second. Would fly LAN again based on this experience. Better experience than QF flying over to SCL.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-AKL. An A340 with the new LAN flat-bed seats. Selected a middle aisle seat so that no-one would have to climb over me at night. Pushing back was delayed but arrival was on-time. Dinner wine and cabin service were excellent but breakfast nothing special. LAN now offer a very similar product to Qantas. Lounge at SCL was fine. Had to wait 30 mins for a shower but it was very good when I got to use it.

### LAN Airlines customer review
EZE-SCL. Although this was only a 2.5 hour flight in a 767 we had the new LAN full-size flat-bed seats. Tremendous views crossing the Andes with no turbulence. The disappointment was the dinner. Just a cold chicken sandwich and desert with no choice. Although I understand their desire to avoid service during the potentially turbulent Andes crossing I thought LAN could do a bit better than this for international business class. Wine and cabin service were excellent though.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-MAD January 2014. I flew back with LAN from a recent trip to South America having flown out with Iberia. I was pretty impressed really. We were on a new 787. The entertainment system was good with a touch screen and lots of films. Only issue was that my system crashed twice but staff were happy to reset this and then it worked fine again. The food on board was also pretty good for airline food I had a nice salmon dish with mashed potato (luckily this is what I would have ordered as they'd run out of everything else by the time they reached the back of the plane). Breakfast was an omelette amongst other things. They were very generous with the drinks too offering several top ups and also a whisky when they cam round with the coffee trolley after dinner. I thought the staff on board where really good as well attentive and always quick to respond if you called for them. All in all a good experience and better than my Iberia flight on the way out.

### LAN Airlines customer review
They've been canceling and delaying all flights between Santiago and Sydney and vice versa. On the flight from Sydney to Santiago the flight was canceled 10 hours before boarding I had a Qantas staff member calling and telling me that I had to rebook for the next day with a Qantas flight. On the return flight they put us onboard the airplane after 2 hours they told us to get back to the airport and the plane would only take off at 4pm the next day. I will never fly with LAN again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flying with LAN on the B767-300 in Business from Bogota to Santiago de Chile. Comfortable plane and seat. Full flat. Little bit narrow to lay down. But all in all ok. Service did not start after one hour in flight. So sleep. No normal breakfast at arrival just a dry muffin.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I flew LAN both Internationally from SYD to SCL and SCL to LIM; and domestically around Peru. From Sydney to Santiago with a stop in AKL (and vice versa) I flew on a A340. This plane was defiantly one of the oldest planes in the LAN fleet however it was still comfortable onboard. The seats on the plane were old and overused and the back support wasn't good however I did find I had the best sleep ever (and I have flown a lot). The cabin crew onboard this flight were polite and considerate but their English wasn't up to scratch. The IFE system had all the latest entertainment however the system it self was outdated (screen resolution bad and buttons missing on controller). The food onboard the flight was fantastic. I have read previous reviews about this airline and I don't understand why they are complaining. To improve LAN needs to be operating their 787 along this route as it would benefit passengers considering that it is the longest route LAN operates. Domestic: Positives: Staff were polite got 'upgraded' plane was clean. Negatives: Dry food only. No hot or substantial meals just a box of biscuits and a drink.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LA913 from MVD to SCL and LA532 from SCL to JFK (with an emergency stop at MIA). This was on Jan 2nd and 3rd. For the money I paid this was not a good experience. The staff were unfriendly and inattentive didn't seem to have a clue of what to do at times and spoke very little and very bad English (for passengers who didn't speak Spanish). The aircraft although clean and neat was quite uncomfortable both the aisles and the seats were too narrow which made it difficult to walk to the bathroom without hitting anyone and impossible to go anywhere if there was already someone standing up. Trying to get any sleep was also hell as there was almost no legroom and if you were unlucky like me to get a seat next to a fat guy there was even less room to move around and seat comfortably. I endured both a short flight and a 10-hour one with this airline and both planes suffered from "the size issue". Certainly no more LAN for me in the future.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I flew last night on LAN's 787 Dreamliner - SCL-JFK (LA0532) and can only say that the aircraft is impressive. Business Class is comfortable and very well designed. Service was very professional and extremely warm. The departure was delayed by over 1.5 hrs and the not very informed not very courteous LAN employees at the gate made the wait experience quite uncomfortable. The crew could have not being nicer and more professional to help passengers find comfort and a chilled glass of champagne or a refreshing glass of water. The service once airborne was excellent and the food very good. I was in seat 1H which is inconveniently located at the entrance to the service area and at no time was I disturbed. This was my best long-haul flight in a very long time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Have just flown Santiago-Madrid on a LAN 787 in economy which was absolute hell. These were the smallest seats I've ever experienced even on the worst budget airlines. Not only that but the magazine holder in the seatback is wired so you have a hard piece of metal digging into your knees - painful after 2 minutes let alone 12 hours. And it loses you another 2 inches of legroom. I don't know how anyone over 5'5" could bear it. Never ever will I fly LAN long haul again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flown LAN many times over the years beginning when it was a one class airline flying old 737s. Never had a bad flight bad meal or bad treatment. I've purchased tickets 30 minutes before departure and have been granted discounts on the spot based on published discounts. The Fly Chile pass is a great bargain. I have only flown coach so I cannot speak to the other classes. One flight La Paz Bolivia to Santiago after a back packing trip found our group 300 pounds over weight. They waived the charges. That flight which stopped in Iquique for customs served a full meal with wine (45 minute flight). I do miss the wicker baskets full of warm bread. Travelers inside So America should understand that the Chilean breakfast is bread cheese and sliced ham though that's probably changing.

First time traveller with LAN what a wonderful experience business class return SYD-AKL return. Great value superb service fantastic food and champagne. This airline beats all on the Trans Tasman route. Crew are the best always attentive and work with a smile. Beds are comfortable. Entertainment system up with the best. Look Forward to flying again with LAN.

This is my second time return from SYD to AKL in Business on LAN. I have to say that this airline is superb. Cabin Crew are the best friendly and helpful. Always a smile! Food service is excellent. I have always been a Qantas and Emirates customer but now will choose LAN when flying to NZ wish they went on to Europe. Only draw back is the departure out of AKL at 6am but the high standard of the air crew is worth it.

Purchased tickets to Lima Peru for my honeymoon. My wife and I were greeted at the ticket counter by rude and incompetent staff. We were unable to board the plane when asked why the supervisor at JFK airport told me my flight was cancelled because I was a no show even though I was there more than 2 hours before my flight. I have spent many hours on the phone with LAN airlines with nobody willing to help me. My flight was cancelled my return flight was cancelled and my 2 domestic flights in Peru were cancelled all without a refund or possibility to reschedule.

BUE-SCL and SCL-LIM in November 2013. Both flight legs in Business Class. I have been very impressed by the inflight service offered by LAN on both flight legs. Impeccable Boeing 767-300 cabins with comfortable seats (lie- flat on the SCL-LIM flight leg). Very attentive friendly cabin crew good drink and food options and on-time performance. Good inflight entertainment system and inflight magazine. Excellent lounge at Ezeiza. Many other carriers could learn from LAN.

Have been flying LAN since 1985 on JFK-SCL route. Most recent trip JFK-SCL 11/13/13 flight 533. Worst experience ever. New B787 is a torture chamber. High density 9-accross seating and pitch reduced from 32 to 31 inches plus narrower seats. This is unacceptable for a 10+ hour flight not to mention that food quality has taken a dive. No more LAN for me.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We had two flights booked with LAN Peru in Nov 2013. Both were cancelled with hours notice. The first caused a 10 hour airport stay in Lima. The second almost caused us to miss the last flight out of Lima with no notice. This would have resulted in us missing connections to Calgary. The local travellers believe LAN is cancelling these flights to consolidate numbers at alternate times but it is very poor. Had great success with Taca and will book with them as they are cheaper as well. Very poor effort by LAN Peru.

LAX-LIM Lima to Cusco Cusco-Lima-Quito Quito-Lima-LAX. Flew both domestic and international. Food kept getting worse and worse. Seats we had reserved were not honoured and we were stuck in the last passenger row on the plane. Very noisy and airline attendants used the two seats behind to sleep. Needless to say we were constantly woken up each time the attendants moved to get their turn at sleeping. The plane was dirty with other passengers garbage being left in the pockets. Food left on seats so that one got food stuck on their clothes. Leg room in economy is the pits.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew Santiago to Auckland - worst long haul airline experience. Problems were with ground staff and integrity of information. The staff that served us in the air were good. Flights booked by NZ travel agent including connecting flights on Air NZ from Auckland to Wgtn. Turned up on time and were asked if we wanted to volunteer to stay another night as flight overbooked. It later became apparent that this was a requirement not an option. Later learnt that a huge number of people were bumped from the flight and that some had been bumped several days in a row. Received inconsistent stories from different staff about various aspects of package to stay. Staff spoke English until asked difficult questions then claimed to not speak English. Staff were rude and at some points simply walked away while being spoken to. When using our Chilean host to translate two different stories were told within the space of ten minutes each limiting our rights more. When a passenger produced proof of an earlier conversation he was yelled at. When we got to hotel various details of our package were not passed on. Half the group had no transfer to airport the next night and had to fight for an hour to get compensated for the taxi. Domestic transfers were missed and LAN rebooked NZ airlines for some. However when the documents LAN produced were reproduced at Auckland bookings were bogus and no record of booking existed. Passengers had to sort out bookings themselves. My seat was adequate although head rest was broken. Staff were nice on the plane but cold eggs for breakfast and no meal for vegetarians. Movie selection very small. Would avoid at all costs. Heard from frequent travelers that flights within South America are usually fine but long haul often problematic. Unfortunately our LAN experience was of being dismissed and fobbed of with lies and false promises when queried the walls just go up.

AEP-IGU. Very nice crew and treatment as an OW Emerald. Given seats in the second row and allowed to board first. While the seats are not supposed to be Premium there was no one in the center seat and they did widen the seat (had no idea they can do that) and only three other people sat in the first four rows. Nice little snack too. Would fly them again anytime!

SCL-IPC-SCL. Comfortable seats excellent entertainment system perfect food. Even in the economy class you get a feeling of special treatment. They have real glasses and stainless cutlery which is nearly chic in our plastic world. Although a return flight to Santiago was delayed it caused no dissatisfaction with LAN since the delay was due to weather condition.

LA 501 from Miami to Santiago on 19 October. 767-300 in Business Class. Check in was fine - standard greeting and bags tagged priority. Security line fast and to the lounge - average lounge with some cookies and fruit some soup and sandwiches. Boarding organized with families with children first - must have been 40 people who boarded with this - a lot of kids! Welcome on board and sat in seat 3J. Excellent seat! Flight attendants really friendly and all smiles. Nothing was too much to ask. 10 minutes early departure and smooth flight all the way. Food was excellent - king crab appetizer was really good. Slept 3.5 hours on a fully flat seat - inflight entertainment has plenty of movies and shows. Only let down was priority bags came out last but I didn't care. LAN did a great job!

### LAN Airlines customer review
I have done a lot of long haul economy flights over the last few years. This time round I flew with LAN both long haul Madrid/Lima return and also domestic flights within Peru. Seat size is OK but if the person in front reclined their seat back you just had no space at all in front. Toilets were constantly kept clean. Food was worst food I have had on any economy long haul flight. No choice of vegetarian. Although I'm not vegetarian I tend to eat vegetarian food on the planes. If you are vegetarian you have to request vegetarian food when booking the flight ticket. Other economy airlines haven't required this as they always include a veggie option in the menu but not LAN. I had to have a meat dish and when I bit into it the food was stone cold in the middle and lukewarm on the outside. Clearly the food had not been warmed up properly. Inedible! On my return flight I risked the food and paid the price for doing so. Staff during my flight out seemed pleasant enough but on my return journey they were unfriendly and sullen. Entertainment system restrictive. Worst and smallest choice of films I've encountered in economy long haul. However all short domestic flights within Peru were actually very good. No delays the snack offered wasn't bad and all staff served you with a smile! So recommend for domestic flights but don't recommend for long haul.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AKL-SCL. Business Class - very spacious cabin however when bed was fully extended my feet touched the seat in front. Bed was reasonably comfortable otherwise loved the comfy duvet. Cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive very impressed. Drinks service was good however the Louis Roederer was in short supply and ran out within the first hour. Dinner was delicious but breakfast was a little disappointing with the fruit yoghurt being replaced with natural yoghurt and no sign of the requested pastry. The coffee was beyond awful - insipid and lukewarm. Would be nice to see LAN cater for those who appreciate good coffee.

### LAN Airlines customer review
While they are in the air they are up to average expectations though seat belt checks and cabin baggage safety a bit casual. Flew Australia to Peru return and we called them "late again" lines though that could be airport ground staff problems. We had one of our flights cancelled with 10 days notice so had to stay an extra night in Lima and return late for meetings at home. Airline not interested in your extra cost and inconvenience despite our numerous representations. In summary safe enough but allow for delays and absence of customer service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We flew 4 internal flights in Peru with LAN. The planes were surprisingly smart and clean but cabin attendants were not friendly not confident and approachable which did not fill me with confidence. The pilots' communication with passengers varied greatly from one who did not talk at all the whole flight not even to tell the cabin attendants to get ready for landing to one who spoke a lot but was difficult to understand. No notice was taken of the instructions to turn off electronic devices - one guy was sending and receiving texts in plain view the crew didn't seem to notice even when they were walking up and down checking that seatbelts were fastened! They did not stop people moving around the cabin after the seatbelt signs were lit and just disappeared after they had distributed the same old snack boxes that we got on every single flight. I would not use LAN again unless I had to.

### LAN Airlines customer review
My family arrived at the airport in Quito Ecuador in plenty of time for our flight to Miami connecting in Guayaquil. A few minutes before the flight was to board it was announced that there was a delay and then a short time later it was announced that the flight was cancelled with no explanation given. Many of the passengers had connection with cruises or other flights to Europe that they missed due to this cancellation. This is not the first time that LAN has done this and there doesn't seem to be an affective way to hold the airline responsible for its actions.

GRU-LIM-CUZ-LIM-SCL. Long queues and impolite staff at check-in in every airport. They only allow you to print your boarding pass in the machine before baggage drop. Yet the machine only operates in Spanish. Service on GRU- LIM and LIM-SCL was horrible perhaps due to red-eye flight. Cabin crew the worst I have seen and when I asked them for a cup of water they told me it was self-service. LIM-CUS return was better. Seats are ok. Food just cold sandwiches or snack box. TAM deserves a better rating than LAN in service. Value for money as I paid so little for the flights.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I fly regularly from Sao Paulo to Sydney so used some of the points accrued for a trip to New York. You can also use these points (OneWorld) on American Airlines and as such our flights were SAO-LIMA-NYC rather than AA's SAO-NYC direct. LAN recently purchased Brazil's TAM and they are yet to fully integrate their systems. This caused us a huge problem as we landed in Peru with 'tickets' from LAN (but no boarding passes) for a TAM flight to Sao Paulo. Had to wait 4 hours (with a 2 year old) before any TAM staff showed up. When TAM finally arrived they didn't have our booking and the flight was fully booked! 8 hours after landing and numerous discussions later LAN finally agreed to put us on the next available flight (4pm - Taca) rather than wait another 16 hours for the next LAN/TAM flight. A few more discussions had them give us a hotel room for the additional 8 hour wait as 'complimentary club lounge access' doesn't mean much to a 2 year old child! The whole exercise simply rammed home my previous experiences with LAN - the in-flight crew comfort and service is excellent but the support staff at airports and offices are inefficient rude and arrogant. Flying with LAN is fantastic as long as nothing ever goes wrong and you have no need to rely on crew other than those serving you in the air.

AKL to SYD and return business class July 2013. Airbus 340/300 with 2 business class cabins. Although both flights were late the product itself was very good. Nice flat beds (on a 3 hour flight was a bonus but this flight begins/ends in Santiago/Sydney) and good service nice food and extensive entertainment. All this was helped by the fact that business class was by no means full. In fact on the way out I was the only person in the smaller business cabin. Aside from the time keeping (some of which was made up) this was a very good experience and I would think that soon they should be a 4* if they show this standard elsewhere.

Flew FRA-MAD return on a 767. Very spacious seats I believe it is 18-inch with great service. Food is served on this 3-hour flight but just a cold (but very edible - not stale or dry) sandwich with a chocolate bar and drinks. Flight was super empty so I got seconds. As a fifth-freedom flight it priced around the same (around 120 Eur) as a LH or IB flight but with LAN you can get a long-haul aircraft. IFE was also really good - touchscreen with great selection of movies.

We flew long haul from London to Lima with LAN Airlines. The flight was excellent with no delays staff were polite and helpful good entertainment package with individual screens per seat and yes believe it or not the food was lovely (I am a very fussy eater) chicken with roasted vegetables and rice. For the price of the tickets and compared to other airlines we have travelled with I would say LAN are one of the better ones.

Flew MIA-SCL with the new red business class seats. I believe they are much too narrow and the tray system between the seats further increases the feeling of being cramped. It is very easy to tip over drinks and such. It would really seem necessary to have only five abreast seating instead of six. I would suggest that on long haul trips a drink and canapé service be offered prior to meals this would be more consistent with their Premium Business denomination. Crew was very professional and friendly and lie flat seats were very comfortable once extended.

EZE-LIM-JFK return. Food on the way up was loathsome a sandwich with one piece of cheese and processed meat to Lima and the same to New York. Asked for water when I got onto the plane and was told to wait until meal service. After an hour I walked to the back and a flight attendant reading her magazine put her right hand out with water. On return I went to JFK 7 hours before flight in an attempt to get emergency row seat. Told I had to wait until 4 hours before flight. LAN rep arrived told I had to make that request upstairs hours ago. There is really no interaction between crew and passengers save giving out meals and forcing you to put your seat in upright position half an hour before landing. I was told to 'sit down' when I had to go to the bathroom 40 minutes before landing in Buenos Aires. This was not a full flight. There was real food from New York to Lima the same ham/cheese sandwich. Staff appear disinterested in any engagement with passengers. Flights were okay but the staff are somewhere between sullen and nasty.

Flew Santiago - Rio then Sao Paulo-Santiago-Auckland in economy. All ok Santiago-Rio. Plane took off from Sao Paulo then had to go back due to a never-identified 'system' problem. Circled for 2 hours stuck on tarmac and hour then in the terminal then back on plane then cancelled. Ended up in shabby hotels at 2am in middle of Sao Paulo. Disorganised rebooking. Ordinary service back. Communication poor. Food ordinary Staff not well trained. Would be reluctant to go with LAN again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
JFK-SCL in Economy. Fairly new 767-300ER with 777-style interior. Upon boarding a Chilean newspaper was available in the jetway. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive although some didn't appear to speak much English. Economy seating was standard with 32" pitch/18" width adjustable headrests usb outlets PTVs with AVOD. At each seat was a package containing a pillow decently thick blanket eyeshades and ear plugs. Departure delayed slightly due to ATC but kept updated. Cabin announcements in Spanish and English. Dinner was quite good. Of note LAN used real silverware real glassware for the wine and a real dish for the entree even in economy. I had red wine which was Chilean and quite good. A refill was offered. After dinner coffee/tea and cordials were served along with M&Ms. IFE featured over 200 on demand movies including many South American films as well as games map function extensive music tracks and destination information. Screen was large and picture/sound quality was good. Content was slow to load at times but otherwise the system was excellent. The in-flight magazine was very thick and contained interesting articles. There was a cup holder on each seat back a nice feature on long flights. Lavatories featured moist towelettes and hand lotion a couple of extras not found on US carriers and were cleaned several times throughout the flight. A full breakfast was served 90 minutes prior to arrival which is better than the American carriers which only serve a snack. Beverages were refilled afterwards and sweets were provided prior to arrival. Overall I found my first long-haul experience on LAN to be thoroughly enjoyable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to friends.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Reading other reviews it makes you wonder what people expect these days. I have flown LAN within Peru many times to different destinations and have nothing but praise for them. They run new fleets of the airbus 319 and 320. I have had more legroom on these internal flights than some long haul from Lima to Europe with other airlines. Most flights within Peru are only an hour long so don't expect amazing food just a snack and a drink.

Bogota to San Paulo flight was on time and service was excellent. Good food and wine with refills if you wanted. Staff friendly and entertainment system was very good once they got it connected . Much better then the dreadful old fashioned Iberia.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Business class (MEX-SCL-IPS return). I found the service to be consistent crew friendly aircraft clean and in good condition (767) and food tasty. The inflight entertainment worked and a good selection. The on board service did seem to take a bit of time to get going and the seat did seem a bit narrow around the shoulders when reclined into the flat bed. Other than that the flights were great. Check-in at all airports was easy lounges comfortable no lounge in Easter Island but I didn't expect that anyway as its such a unique airport and flights were on time. Frequent flyer miles were added to my BA account within the week and I had no baggage issues.

### LAN Airlines customer review
EZE-SCL-EZE. Both flights were delayed. Outbound 7 hrs and the return 3 hrs. The crew behaved as though they were doing you a favor and food was just ok for the short flight. Not worth the money there are better options for this route.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-EZE. Connected in SCL from SYD. New 767. I was immediately impressed when I boarded and crew acknowledged me as I walked through the cabin. All cabin crew were immaculate and the service was good. I did not expect a meal on this short flight we got a sandwich and a drink. Flight left and arrived on time. IFE was great too as it was available shortly after the safety demonstration I managed to watch a film. I would fly LAN from SYD next time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flight between SCL to Madrid. Bad service very bad food and regular seat. LAN is going down every time I fly much better options available. The staff don't help much. Avoid.

### LAN Airlines customer review
UIO-GYE-UIO. Machine check-in at UIO airport didn't find my reservation proceed to counter: courteous and fast service. Boarding: ok but buses were old and not handicapped friendly use stairs to board aircraft. Onboard service regular: robotic attitude and one candy no water round. On arrival: fast disembark and baggage retrieval. Returning portion: same as UIO for check-in and on-board service upon arrival: stairs used for bus to take us to terminal baggage: wrongly announced carrousel. LA has declined it service in recent years and not one agent at arrival at UIO to inform us anything.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LAN Flight 801 - Santiago to Sydney via Auckland 16 March 2013. When I arrived to check in at a connecting flight in Buenos Aires - I was told that the flight would be leaving 12 hours later. This is was despite the fact that I had already checked and they did not attempt to contact me by email or by mobile phone. When I arrived at Santiago we were given accommodation and were told to be ready by 8.30am for a 12 Noon departure. All passengers arrived at the Departure Gate - however there was no aircraft and much to our dismay no LAN Staff to explain what was happening. Eventually the flight departed 24 hours late and terminated at Auckland not Sydney - so continuing passengers were forced to stay overnight in a hotel at Auckland Airport - to make things worse the airport bus broke down and we eventually checked in at 2am. The service from LAN Airlines through this event was appalling - and not once did anyone apologise to myself or any of the other passengers.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Over a 3 week visit to Peru and Ecuador from England we had 8 flights with LAN booked through our agent. 2 of these flights were approximately 12 hours long. All the flights were booked with request for a vegetarian meal but on every flight I had nothing to eat. We checked with our agent who confirmed the booking and each time we booked in we ask about the vegetarian meal but none arrived. On one flight out of Quito the hostesses smirked to each other and just continued on. Why should I pay the same price and not get any food. So if you require a different diet try a different airline.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We flew Auckland to Santiago to Lima return in March 2013. I was pleasantly surprised by the flight over. Return flight was a disaster. Arrived at the airport at Santiago at 4pm for a 10.30 flight and was told by LAN staff that we could not book in until 8pm. Made inquiries at 6.30 and was told the flight had been cancelled. They provided us with accommodation and meals at Santiago and Auckland but you had to go looking for the information it was never just offered to you. Flight was ordinary to Auckland. We were in the last row and every time the Flight Attendant pushed the trolley out of the galley she hit my wife's seat so sleep was off the cards. More offers of water during the flight would be a good start. We had one good flight and one bad one. Finally when we were given seat allocation we were not sitting together. As it turned out the last 3 centre rows had 4 couples in them and no one was seated together. How hard is it to allocate seating together when tickets are made on the same booking? If you want to be an international airline then start looking at making visitors and tourists welcome.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I had booked the first long-haul flight for my husband and I from LAX to Lima Peru. What I found was a pleasurable experience and a 9 hour flight that did not feel like 9 hours. We flew through the daytime so on-board entertainment was key. Boarding was easy and we flew a 767 in economy class. Seats were very comfortable the entertainment excellent the seats had USB ports for charging or electronic use and the food was good airline food. Wine was served with the meal and staff came around refilling glasses. Staff very happy and helpful smiling a lot and were excellent bilingual speakers. Not only were we served dinner (or lunch) but at the end of the flight at 8 pm Pacific time they served breakfast. The on-board entertainment included first-run movies TV shows games music. I would definitely recommend LAN and hope that our return flight from Santiago Chile is just as good.

### LAN Airlines customer review
A340-300 AKL-SYD. Not bad seat pitch is 32' with adjustable headrest and the IFE screen is of the large variety. Choice of programmes was also good. There is no power or USB outlet though. Seats was fine for 3 hours don't think I would have like it long haul though. Staff were helpful and polite. Only major letdown was the food wouldn't normally comment as I tend to eat before I board but to be offered for breakfast a tiny ham and cheese sandwich 2 small crackers with a frozen tub of butter and a fruit bowl which consisted of 3 slices of apples and a lonely looking grape is really not acceptable. Even the guy that served me apologized when he saw the look on my face.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew in Business Class multiple legs from MIA to Santiago/Montivideo. Then Buenos Aires to Lima and Lima to JFK. All flights were on 767's. All flights were on time with clean aircraft extremely spacious and comfortable flat bed type seats excellent white duvets and pillows and an adequate VOD system. Catering was a bit skimpy and of decent quality. The main negative for this airline is the pleasant but almost consistently lazy and indifferent attitude of the cabin crews. The flights to Montevideo were with LAN Chilean crews and they were ok but beyond serving meals and a very long wait for drinks with no refills their presence in the cabin was seldom noted the MIA-SCL leg being 8 1/2 hours. The Peruvian crews on the BUE-LIM-JFK flights could generally be found congregated in the forward galley reading magazines and playing on their computers. They never almost never patrolled the cabin soliciting requests even on the 7 1/2 hour flight between Lima and JFK. However the great seat duvet and on time performance made up for me the poor slow cabin service and mediocre catering.

### LAN Airlines customer review
In my opinion this was the worst long haul flight that I have experienced in terms of seat comfort crew service food and facilities. Seats were hard and narrow. Food choice ran out before trolley reached us and the only food left was ghastly - wine serving was paltry. Inflight entertainment malfunctioned. One toilet was out of order before we even took off and the 4 functioning toilets were inadequate for a 13+ hour flight. Eye masks thin. Worst was the attitude of crew who were surly and unhelpful throughout and spent most of their time huddled in their galley. Flight was so late we missed connections but Iberia were helpful and efficient at re-routing us.

Santiago - Easter Island (Business Class) Boeing 767. Great seats lovely breakfast and great service. Flight left on time and arrived almost an hour early! How can that be if flight timings are correct?

### LAN Airlines customer review
Easter Island - Santiago (Business Class) Boeing 767. Great seats pretty poor food for business class and awful service (even had to 'ring' for coffee after dinner!). Flight left over one hour late yet managed to arrive on time! How can that be if flight timings are correct?

### LAN Airlines customer review
LAX-LIM overnight flight. Having flown with LAN many times in the past I found this flight to be not up to par with other LAN flights. Crunky unhappy in some instances straight forward rude crew. Shouting "sit down" at a paying customer is unacceptable. What happened to the word 'please'? Meals were served during the first hour after take off after which crew disappeared for the entire flight. Individual mini bottles of wine with your meal have gone. Now you get just a 'mini glass' that holds a sip of wine. Morning service was abysmal - no hot drinks reheated scrambled eggs were disgusting and again - unhappy crew what showed you in all possible way that you were a nuisance in their otherwise bright day! Though LAN still wins against their North American competitors I will think twice if I have to fly with them again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Booked LAN Chile through codeshare with Qantas. Flew SYD-AKL. Confirmed I had dietary meal requested ok with all Qantas flights I had but on board with LAN they offered me a regular meal. The FA said they didn't have the request and all the dietary meals on board were taken. No extra meal supplied.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Lima to JFK. Staff at check-in counter friendly and helpful. Very pleasantly surprised by 767-300ER plane. Very neat and new interior with comfortable seats installed. Personal TV monitor (touch-screen) is very new with high definition. Decent selection of movies and TV programs. Flight attendants are polite and friendly. There were two kids traveling alone sitting next to me and the flight attendants took good care of them. Meals are not outstanding but decent enough. Overall it's a very good experience and I am impressed.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Recently did return MIA-GYE (Ecuador). Long check-in lines (hr+) chaotic procedures inept desk agents and a computer system out of the 1990's were standard for all flights. Things like overbooking the plane double booking seats for numerous passengers refusing to assist with rebooking missed flights on partner airlines passing the buck to the next shift the next airport stonewalling running out the clock and rudeness - it was unbelievable. Never again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
To and from LAX to Lima plus internal flights to Cusco and Puno/Juiliaco. Most flights not on time and only explanation was that there was congestion and problems with communications. Originally flight from LAX ran about 30 minutes late so unable to make next internal connection to Cusco. Told that flight already left even thought it was not scheduled for another 30 minutes+. Told to come back to the counter in 50 minutes then may be given a standby ticket to wait in another line with all our luggage. Offered vouchers for lunch - turned out the only option was at McDonalds and then only for two meal choices.

### LAN Airlines customer review
EZE-SCL. Economy. LAN expect you to be at the airport 3 hours before departure for international flights. They are not joking. Passengers like me who had already checked-in and printed their boarding cards were made to wait outside the cordoned off check-in area. We were admitted after airport security complained about the queue getting in the way of other passengers. After 50 minutes waiting it was my turn but the agent just held his hand up and got out his mobile phone. He was still chatting after I had finished leaving my bags with another agent. Boarded in strict priority of cabin class frequent flyer status and row numbers - then all got on to the same bus! Cabin crew too busy having coffee to check the boarding cards. Crew surly with no smiles or good-byes. Usual economy class type snack. Arrived on time with fairly quick bag return. My experience on this flight was that LAN staff are all well turned out check-in areas and aircraft are clean and appear almost new but just scratch the surface and you may find a very different airline to the first impression.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Undertook 2 international flights with LAN - both of over 18 hours duration and 6 internal flights. Would be reluctant to travel LAN again. Ground staff were courteous and helpful if not friendly. I found the onboard crew to be surly and not willing to help with a request for a glass of water or a passenger who had a nose bleed or helping in re-seating family groups who had been separated. We worked out the seating ourselves and in the end I moved twice to enable family groups to sit together. If travelling on an internal flight ensure that you eat and take a drink with you beforehand. Offered either a lolly or a box which proudly proclaims 'the contents of this box contain no preservatives. Please consume within 48 hours. However when you open the box there are 3 packets of biscuits which are laden with preservatives. Some planes used on internal flights were not clean.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AKL-SCL SCL-AKL. Both flights satisfactory. I found the service very good the cabin crew were polite and professional. Food was plentiful and good. Offered drinks in between meals mainly water. The interior was lovely and clean they supplied everyone with a blanket pillow and headphones IFE very good plenty to keep you entertained. Leg room was decent. Thoroughly enjoyed both trips and will be flying LAN in the future.

Flew from Santiago to Los Angeles on B767 Dec 2012. Very pleasant flight much nicer than commercial US airlines. Free food and wine of good quality. Would try to fly this airline where available.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Impossible to book a seat even though the plane showed plenty of available seats on the web page and the web interface pretended it was allowing the booking of seats. I was traveling with my wife and 4 year old boy we ended in separate areas of the plane. The rest of the services similar to other airlines in the same route so not booking again with LAN. Unfortunately there is no score for the booking services that can be rated here.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I have logged 23 flights with LAN the last one being SCL-PMC-PUQ. Impossible to choose a seat during online check-in (all seats taken even though I was the 3rd person to check-in). On some other routes I paid a higher fare (2x the normal one) to be able to pre-book a seat but my seat was changed by LAN. Rude attendants at the counter in SCL. Service from flight attendants vary wildly: on this flight one FA was extremely friendly but the other one seemed annoyed. Food beverages and IFE all OK.

Madrid to Lima on B767-300ER. Able to use Iberia VIP lounge at Madrid which is excellent. Flight left on time. Business cabin feels a bit cramped on 767. Seats very comfortable for sitting but too narrow when flat - I'm not very tall and struggled to lie on my side. Food and wine good.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Just flown LAN on a return trip via Santiago to Buenos Aires. No complaints about this airline. Check in was smooth at all points and the staff pleasant and accommodating. Planes left on time and the announcements were clearly made when in English. My only problem was they did not issue an arrival card on the return sector even if napping it could have been placed in the seat pocket as others have done. Would also like to have been offered more fluid while airborne.

Santiago [Chile] to Madrid 15/11/2012 in seat 31C. Enough leg room for a tall person. FA's attentive and friendly. Good meals and plenty of drinks throughout the flight. You would be better flying with LAN than Iberia on this route as the 'plane was in good condition and seat choice is honoured.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew PPT - SCL - BUE - IGR. Once airborne all 3 flights were good. Check in though was chaotic each time with at least 1 hr waiting [2 hours in Papeete]. Flight from Papeete to SCL (ETD 2350) was 15 hrs late due to weather in pacific. Only advised at the airport 1 hr prior to scheduled take off. Check in staff handed us with a letter advising due to weather conditions not their responsibility and told us to find our own overnight accommodation and check with them at 0800 the next morning. Abysmal customer service. Also specific seats booked and confirmed in advance were never ever the ones available when checking in.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-GIG A320 Dec 3rd. Seat 20J. Extremely messy check-in. We arrived 2 hours before take off. The line was huge all international flights together. As our e-tickets were TAM ones we were not allowed to web or even pre check-in. It took us 1hr 20 mins to be checked in to find our seats had been taken and we were separated. Food on board was not sufficient for a more than 4 hours flight. Beverages were good and crew offered them many times.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Travelled SYD-AKL-SCL-LIM-CUZ-LIM-IGU-AEP-SCL-SYD over 3 weeks in October. All flights on time aircraft clean and comfortable. Food and service very good calm and efficient. In flight entertainment on international legs is great with a wide selection and domestically the pop down screens show a comedy sketch that kept everyone entertained. I would recommend this airline for all flights to and within South America.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Santiago to Sydney one hour and a half of waiting at the business class check in counter (with no explanation) then flight delayed. Almost nothing to eat in the lounge. Customer Service sent me the same letter of excuses they would use for any type of complaint. Add to that that the IFE is very poor and you understand that the fact that the rest was ok is not enough to compensate the lack of service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Buenos Aires to Santiago on new 787. Nice cabin and great IFE but when all is said and done its just like being on any other aircraft (apart from electric window blinds which despite being fully dimmed still let a lot of sunlight in). Crew were pleasant snack and drinks served. Overall a good experience plus arrived 20 minutes early. Only negative both my British Airways Gold Baggage tags were missing when I reclaimed my baggage and it was obvious the cases had not been treated with much care.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Our flight was late from Cusco to Lima causing us to miss our connecting flight to Iquitos. They put us on another flight which departed 5 hours later and gave us vouchers which they said could be used for a free meal at any of the restaurants while we waited. We had lunch at a cafe near our gate and when presenting our vouchers we were told they were not valid because we did not present them before we ordered. A LAN associate was called over and told us there was nothing they could do and we were stuck with a $60 bill on top of being delayed 5 hours. I will never fly this airline again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew CUS-LIM on a A319 then LIM-GYE on a B767. While the A319 was fairly full the B767 was only about one third full so plenty of room to spread. Leg room reasonable and seat fine for two hour flight. Soft drinks provided along with better meal than we had expected. Good range of Audio Albums available - much better than I have had on some long-haul Business flights.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew GYE-MAD on a B767. Excellent service but I wish they would not serve the meal just after take off. While some people may want to eat and settle down I prefer to relax a little first. Food good but all served at once which means the main course was cooling by the time we got to it. Same with breakfast - the omelette was tepid by the time I eat it. Plenty of room with a fully flat horizontal bed but I must admit this was not very comfortable. I did sleep but not that well.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We flew out to Lima on 15th Oct (LA2706) and back 2 weeks later on LA2706. On the way over our entertainment system worked only for a couple of hours and then seized up. On the way back neither mine nor my husband's systems worked. We complained and after trying new headphones the problem was not solved. FA shrugged his shoulders and said he could not do anything so we sat with blank screens for 13 hrs. At breakfast not served any tea yet passengers on the opposite side of plane had tea. FA's were rude. My husband also alerted one of them to a plumbing problem in the toilet but instead of trying to look into the problem she just seemed unconcerned. The food on board was tasteless and cold. Our luggage on one internal flight did not arrive with us and came few hours later on another flight yet no explanations was offered initially. I will never want to use LAN again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
GVA-MAD-GYE in Economy. Flight on time plane was new seat was ok but nothing special. Cabin crew not particularly friendly inflight meal have become poorer since last year the quality and quantity of food is not the same as in the past. In between meals no one shows up with some drinks to offer you can stand up and grab a drink yourself after walking down the plane until your reach the galley where the cabin crew were reading and chatting. Inflight entertainment is great. Had to pay for extra baggage because only one bag of 23kg is included in the Economy ticket. The price LAN charge me for that extra bag was double than Iberia charged me in the GVA-MAD-GYE leg and that price LAN charged me is in my opinion too high.

My friends and I were going to Peru from Miami. At the last minute we were told the flight from Miami to Lima was cancelled. We were taken to a hotel and checked in at 12.30am but had to be in the Lobby at 3am for a 5am flight. When we arrived in Lima we were told our connecting flight to Cuzco had also been cancelled and were again taken to a hotel to be up at 4am for a 6am Flight. The result was we lost a full day our trip and when we finally arrived in Cuzco we were exhausted. The worst part was that we later learned that 2 airplanes full of passengers had left Miami we had just been bumped!

Flight from Madrid to Frankfurt June 28th. Plane was coming from Santiago. In the morning I received a phone call and sms announcing the delay of the plane (about 3 hours delay). Nice. Nevertheless once in the plane when getting to Frankfurt the pilot says we're running out of fuel and Frankfurt airport is very busy so instead we are to land in Dusseldorf to refuel. There we were. After refuelling he informs us there's a curfew for our plane to take off. So instead we will be spending the night in a hotel and that there would be buses waiting for us to take us to the hotel. It took us a while to get our luggage nearly 11 pm. No buses waiting. No company people to inform us (I understand LAN has no personnel there but what does oneworld serve for then?) Just got a train from Dusseldorf airport at 2:40 am and arrived in Frankfurt at 7am (on a personal choice and after paying it myself obviously). Air hostesses were nice food was ok and individual screen was good but I'd rather use Lufthansa or Iberia next time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I travelled from Auckland to Santiago. It was a 12 hrs flight and I received only one meal. No offer of refreshments throughout the flight. All these to arrive in Santiago and find out that my connecting flight to Lima was cancelled. I paid a lot of money and expected good service. Lan did not provide it.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Economy from Wellington to AKL-SCL-LIM-Cusco return. Flights were on time lanes modern and well maintained seats comfortable onboard personnel friendly and helpful. The only problem was the NZ part of the trip. LAN was let down by its codeshare agreement with Qantas who book domestic flights on the budget airline Jetstar. Our Jetstar flight outbound was delayed and the return was cancelled. We were unable to check luggage through and had to carry our suitcases from domestic to international terminal and back. Jetstar refused to hear our complaint and Qantas refused. It became our problem and our extra cost to buy an Air new Zealand ticket to ensure we made our flight plan. Qantas does not honour the codeshare agreement with LAN and fails to provide adequate customer service. This is unfortunate because unlike Qantas LAN provides a high quality service at an acceptable cost.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew LA from SYD to SLC via AKL on a QF codeshare ticket. Flight was a clean A340-300 that was well maintained. Was assigned a bulk head seat with the seat next to me empty. Flight very punctual. Cabin Crew were excellent and well presented. Good Quality Entertainment on Demand. Food was good but nothing extra ordinary. Beverage selection on board was good. Good selection of snacks and drinks available on demand. Value for money and well recommended.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LAN has the worst food and drink service I have ever experienced when traveling locally within Chile. I don't understand how a OneWorld airline can provide you for breakfast/lunch/dinner with the same mediocre snack: biscuits cake/brownie and almonds/peanuts no matter where you fly and for how long. International flights are ok. Staff are nice and helpful.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AKL-SCL-LIM-CUZ return. First time flying with LAN and overall pleasantly surprised. Good legroom and seat comfort friendly FAs decent IFE and food/drink really well-organised boarding processes. On the return leg we had a bit of a problem - we missed our LIM-SCL connection due to a scheduling change - but LAN staff in LIM couldn't have been more helpful. Booked us a really nice hotel paid for lunch dinner and breakfast and provided a private car and driver for us and put us on a flight out the next day. We could have done without the delay but overall I was pleased with how it was handled. Will definitely use LAN again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Took four LAN short haul flights on 767 A320 and A319. Very impressed with flights IFE and service offered. On one flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires I experienced my first missed approach and must commend the pilots and crew for their professionalism during some anxious moments. Passengers were kept well informed in both English/Spanish. LAN are not that far off Virgin/Qantas levesl for short haul although they could improve their inflight snacks through having the chocolate dominated boxes at more appropriate times.

### LAN Airlines customer review
JFK-SCL-BOG in business class. First time on LAN. Very solid in terms of service and all around offering. The layout in business class is 2x2x2 in a 767 with ample seat pitch. Lie-flat seats are very comfortable for sleeping. Food was good and service attentive. IFE needs a little work in terms of selection but more than enough for a 10 hour flight.

SYD-AKL-SCL. Boarding in SYD at 9.20am - all passengers seated on board and the captain tell us they have to change a computer card and that will take 30 minutes. Finally took off at 10.20am. Arrived into Auckland at 15.20pm boarded the long haul leg of the flight at 16.30pm the plane pushed back then again an issue in a door sensor - after 1 hour on the tarmac we are towed to disembark and taken to a hotel. Left Auckland at 10am arrived in Santiago at 6am the same day. The food and service onboard was good. Qantas next time - bigger plane and much better inflight entertainment system.

Was meant to be travelling BOG-CTG-BOG-ADZ-BOG. The night before the first flight while in Colombia I received an email stating the flight from CTG-BOG was now 3 hours later than the flight I had originally which meant I would miss the next flight BOG-ADZ. They only offered to put me on an alternative airline CTG-BOG which would give me 50 mins to disembark reclaim my luggage change terminals and then check in for the next flight - ridiculous. I ended up having to take a full refund and book with another airline. This was the third schedule change to this booking and it was only by luck I checked my email and discovered it the night before - as nobody contacted me by telephone. If you're itinerary is fixed don't book LAN!

AKL-SCL on A340-300. Boarding procedure very good and the plane was in good order although we noticed the inflight magazines were very tatty. The seats were fairly comfortable IFE was pretty good with some blockbusters but when the person in front reclined it became very hard to use. I am going to rate the food as average the drinks were warm and although there were a number of water runs it wasn't cold enough. Cabin temperature was on the warm side throughout the flight. FA's gave a workman like performance although some very friendly. LAN is a good airline that can improve but has a little way to go before they are four star.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-JFK and SCL-MAD/FRA routes often. I got Premium Silver LanPass category and I feel the difference. Better seating business check-in service excellent. A couple of UPG during the year makes you feel a very VIP person. Entertainment is excellent lots of Movies TV series and music. Seats in economy are fair enough (could always be better of course) as the food does. Premium Business is almost perfect. Full flat bed is comfortable perfect for long routes. Hope to get a Premium Economy class in the future for Long Haul flights.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Sydney to Santiago. Flight was good. Flight attendants were fine seat comfort good and inflight entertainment was also pretty good - not as good as the Qantas flight I took back but still kept me occupied on the long flight. It's just the small things LAN don't do which put them a peg below the likes of Qantas things such as menus quality of food etc.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Lima and La Paz-Lima-Frankfurt. For the first flight everything went smoothly but for the return IGR-AEP EZE-SCL and SCL-RIO all flights on time new nice planes with comfortable seats. Food was average - on the first national flight (1 hr 55 mins )we got small box with sweets and on the second flight (2 hrs 5 mins) we got a not so good small sandwich and drinks. On the third - 4 hours flight from Santiago to Rio de Janeiro I was expecting a normal dinner but instead we got sandwich fruits sweets and drinks.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I recently flew Santiago Chile to Los Angeles with a stop in Lima Peru. Our flight was on an A340-300 which offered a generous seat pitch and fully flat beds. LAN served 3 meals on the flight. Dinner/Late night Snack/Breakfast. All meals were excellent in content and quantity. Inflight staff were constantly at hand. The wine selection was very good.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Lima and La Paz-Lima-Frankfurt. For the first flight everything went smoothly but for the return flight we were subjected to constant time schedule changes and we did not get the connecting flight to Madrid at Lima which had been advanced by one hour without information. We were charged more than 5000 USD as penalty for extra-tickets in Economy class to Frankfurt. The tickets had hardly been issued when the time schedule was again changed and the connecting flight Madrid-Frankfurt was not guaranteed anymore. We had to spend a night at the airport and to board Iberia flights to get back to Europe. Again employees tried their best to find a solution and cared for my son who was sick. However LAN does not seem reliable with no customer service available outside Chile to try and solve such problems.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Sydney to Auckland return on clean well maintained A340s. The IFE was excellent and the flights both left on time and arrived early. The fare was also extremely competitive for what was on the whole a very comfortable experience. LAN however is slightly let down by the indifferent attitude of its cabin crew and its average catering. These however were relatively minor shortcomings on what was a very positive experience.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Recently completed 7 internal and 2 international flights (Sao Paulo/Santiago return) in Economy Class. On each of these flights we have been provided with the same small snack box consisting of peanuts/biscuits and a piece of cake. This is disgraceful inflight service from an international carrier. All of these flights took place during a meal time when something more substantial would have been appreciated. No wine offered at all (even on international flight).

### LAN Airlines customer review
My trip back was much better than my trip to Ecuador. Return trip to New York was in the afternoon compared to midnight on outbound NYC-GYE. Food was also much better coming back to NY than outbound to Guayaquil. Unfortunately when you travel with lap infants you really have no choice with seats as you are forced to sit in the middle rows as they are the ones that have the extra oxygen mask - you don't get the opportunity to upgrade to business class because you are travelling with a minor unless you are willing to pay the full price for everyone travelling with you. The choices as far as movies and TV options are decent.

### LAN Airlines customer review
JFK-SCL. Smooth easy check-in. Flight departed 20 minutes early despite being full. Boarding efficient and cabin crew polite and professional. Excellent product in Economy with better leg room cleaner newer cabins and AVOD that is far superior to what any US carrier offers. Food is pitiful in portion size but is nicely presented and flight attendants come around a few times with more wine water and after dinner drinks. Bathrooms cleaned throughout the 10 hour flight and restocked. B767 has the B777 interior architecture making it feel larger and more open. Regrettably LAN has to codeshare with AA and is at the mercy of its less than helpful ground staff at JFK.

### LAN Airlines customer review
On a flight from Argentina to Miami we got dinner and breakfast which were inedible with one tiny cup of coffee and one glass of water (no refills offered on drinks) and the cocktail arrived long after the meal. Flight attendants were unfriendly and the service was grudging. After food and drinks were cleared the staff disappeared for the night. When I requested something the attendant was rude. It was almost impossible to understand any of the announcements.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Auckland to Sydney. Booked economy class but was upgraded to business class and I was most impressed. Seating was extremely comfortable the inflight entertainment was a pleasure and the staff service was excellent without being intrusive. Ground staff were pleasant and helpful and the flight departed on time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I flew Premium Business from LIM to MAD on 20th Jan (having been re-booked by Iberia due to a pilots' strike). Seat had a mind of its own: seat back and foot rest kept operating on their own! Seats next to me were reserved for crew and despite my polite complaints I was not moved. Food was abominable and despite registering a complaint with flight attendants and online I have heard nothing.

### LAN Airlines customer review
AEP-BRC-AEP. Both flights with 1 hour delay. 2 hrs 20 mins flight and catering is a joke (small box with mini snacks). The cabin was dirty in Bariloche for the flight back. My seat was covered with napkins and crumbs. It seems that they don't clean the airplanes in destinations outside Buenos Aires.

### LAN Airlines customer review
UIO-GYE-UIO. First leg: Web check-in worked perfectly. Only took hand bag so directly to security and gate. Boarding performed by line order but not reinforced so result was chaos. Onboard as usual only one candy not even a water round. Flight attendants polite and courteous. Departure and arrival ok and on time. Second leg: Web check-in worked perfectly. Boarding not performed by line order again pure chaos agents had no interaction with passengers. Onboard if a passenger asked for water they honoured the request. Flight attendants polite and professional but a robotics attitude zero smiles.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LAX to Santiago was good and so was food and service. LA ground staff were weak and uncoordinated. Arrived in Santiago to see our connecting flight to Buenos Aires had been cancelled. Left on another flight but had to wait for our bags in Buenos Aires. Flight back was OK on the ground and lounges for first class were very nice. Long flight from Lima to Los Angeles attendants were good but food was pathetic. Cold ham sandwiches for dinner. Not anywhere near the value of a first class flight.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Lima-Easter Island-Lima Business class. Extremely poor service in Business class. Flight attendants with very poor attitude trying to avoid and ignore passengers' needs. For the steep prices they are charging this is unacceptable. Bag was not checked to my final destination and the check-in agent couldn't give me a reasonable explanation. Catering poor without even offering a coffee before the early morning arrival. No additional drinks service and should you dare to ask for something else it is brought to you by a very irritated staff. No lounge at Easter Island airport 200+ passengers are crowded in a tiny departures hall with no air conditioning. Really hope then will get some healthy competition on this route soon.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Terrible service in premium business booked originally a MIA-SCL in economy but using my mileage on LANPass I was able to upgrade - service was awful staff disappeared shortly after dinner service and reappeared at breakfast service was truly unprofessional and quick. I think that the mileage I paid was too much for such a poor service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
GRU-SCL SCL-LAX in business. Decent lounge at GRU. Flight was delayed about an hour with no explanation. 767 long haul with flat bed seats for the 3.5 hr regional flight. Service was so-so. Flight attendant would not give me extra water even though I repeatedly asked her. Good IFE light menu option was nice. SCL-LAX - premium check-in and dedicated immigration was fantastic. A340 pretty good hard product but service was weak. Flight attendants slow and were nowhere to been seen with extra drink requests. For a $5000 ticket I think the water should come automatically and freely. Better than their US counterparts but a long way to go.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew business on 767 from Lima to Madrid. Seats reasonably comfortable plane clean and in good condition. Service however was extremely poor! Total disregard from 2 flight attendants. Dinner served slowly then crew hid in galley. I wanted some more wine waited till the steak was cold before they answered the call button. I didn't even dare ask for desert. Filled out the detailed breakfast order card which they collected and went to sleep. Got up several times went forward to stretch legs - no food or drink crew chatting and ignoring passengers. Woken up by crew asking if I would like breakfast - I said not yet. Crew hidden behind galley curtain after 20 minutes pressed the button and finally crew turned up asking if I had filled out the form - I said yes but he didn't find it and asked what I wanted. Slow service again long wait for coffee gave up on extra bread. All in all total disregard for passengers worse than coach on most airlines.

### LAN Airlines customer review
GYE-MAD. Although we had a 3 hour delay due to weather problems at Lima airport the flight was excellent. We were correctly informed during check-in about the delay. Crew in Business Class was very service orientated and personal good wines and food that was fine. Great seats in Business Class they are full flat and was able to get a good night sleep. IFE system with big LCD screens and enough choice of movies. Only minor thing that went wrong was that our bags were the last ones on the belt. Priority labels do not seem to work. Would definitely fly them again when travelling to South America.

### LAN Airlines customer review
On the ground LAN are hopeless. We arrived in Santiago on December 31 only to find that our continuing flight to Buenos Aires didn't exist. Trying to find a customer service agent in the terminal was fruitless as there is no service desk in the departures area at SCL. Eventually I had to call the US office to get us transferred to a later flight - 10 hours later. Tonight I tried to print boarding cards for our return to JFK our requested seats had already been taken and a 30-minute call to customer service resulted only in the advice to "get to the airport early.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SFO to Lima. During the flight the call button was never acknowledged. When I flagged someone down to ask for a beer as I saw others receiving them the flight attendant rolled her eyes shook her head and said "no there is none" and walked away. I saw other attendants serving beer so I asked another FA who brought one. When I to the restroom attendants were telling jokes and chatting while people were walking to the back to ask for water as call buttons were ignored. Cusco-Lima-Quito. Air traffic control were on strike so things were running behind. We exited in Lima in a panic I found 2 LAN employees chatting and asked where my gate was - they stopped talking to each other one walked away and the other turned her back and got on her cell phone. I asked again and she turned around put her finger in my face and yelled one moment at me in Spanish. I ran to the gate where boarding had closed 4mins earlier. I persisted and she finally let me on. However due to the air traffic control strike we sat with the airplane door open for the next 3 hours. Bottom line they have the worst possible customer service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Various internal flights in Chile and then SCL-EZE. Service on the ground and in the air was excellent. Comfortable aircraft and good leg room.

### LAN Airlines customer review
September 24th from Los Angeles to Lima and then Lima Buenos Aires. Both flights were on a 767-300 economy class is very comfortable. The entertainment system was varied but the same for both flights. Dinner and breakfast delicious and crew friendly every time I asked them for something they quickly brought it to me. An enjoyable flight.

### LAN Airlines customer review
JFK-GYE-UIO Dec 9th Business Class. Flight departed on time. Business class seats are comfortable cabin clean and inflight entertainment good. Dinner service on 6.5 hour flight departing at 11.05 pm and no breakfast or coffee served before arrival. Dinner was decent and wine list excellent. Cabin crew professional but no smile or efforts to welcome passengers. Sour faces and attitude when request to refill my wine glass. The nightmare began when I arrived to GYE. Two more international flights arrived at the same time and it took more than an hour to collect my bags. Priority tags placed on my bags were no help. It took another hour to clear customs and when I left customs area I was informed I needed to go to the second floor of the terminal and drop my luggage to make my connection to Quito. When I arrived at LAN's counter I was informed my 7.30 am flight was closed and had to wait until 3 pm to go on the waiting list. LAN representatives at GYE airport were rude disrespectful and arrogant. After begging for 1 hour I was able to obtain a seat at 10 am I had to check my bags again and arrived to Quito 3 hours later. My inbound flight to JFK was decent. The cabin looked dirty and once again some crew members were serious and annoyed. Food was ok and all flights on time. Overall LAN service from JFK-GYE-JFK in business class is satisfactory service could be better though. If you have a connection with LAN and you are in transit to Quito good luck.

### LAN Airlines customer review
UIO-SCL on Airbus A319 operated by Lan Ecuador. Night departure from Quito 10.30 pm with stopover in Guayaquil. Food served then duty-free sales and lights off from 2.15 to 4.30 am. Seats hardly reclinable rows very narrow. Seats one row in front and behind emergency exits were rigid. Virtually no sleep was possible. Crew was polite but not helpful. English languages announcements were virtually incomprehensible. Poor airline and crew service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Nov-Dec 11 - JFK-GYE-UIO return. I only flew LAN Ecuador so cannot comment on other LAN branches. LAN has an excellent business class hard product especially for Latin America. The business class cabin is roomy and feels open the seats are very comfortable. The IFE is good plenty of movies and shows enough to keep me busy on a 6-7 hour flight. The food is very good I had fish both ways very nice meals. The problem I experienced both ways was with the service. The attendants are courteous however attentiveness drops significantly when you do not speak Spanish. On both trips it was very obvious Spanish speaking passengers received somewhat better service. All attendants seemed to speak English they were simply not keen on practising it. I would expect flight attendants on an international route to provide consistent service to all passengers. To sum it up despite this small annoyance LAN was an excellent value for the money I would recommend without hesitation. Lounge in GYE is ok but nothing to write home about.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew LAN in September from Santiago to NYC in business class having changed from an American flight due to my schedule changing. As a 2 million mile AA flyer I always default to AA and this was the first time I had flown LAN. Great service charming staff that were pleasant and served you rather than bark at you food that was a big cut above the AA food. 180 degree real flat beds unlike the slanted concoction AA still has. Same fare but what a feeling of upgrade. Business on LAN is better than First on AA. Entertainment about the same quality.

### LAN Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew from Cusco through Lima to Miami in economy. After having flown to Peru on American Airlines this was a very pleasant experience. The 767 looked new the seats were comfortable the food was as good as could be expected for "airline coach" food. Individual entertainment systems worked well with many choices. Even though we had a restroom behind us the seats "reclined" by virtue of the seat bottom sliding forward. American was shabby in comparison.

### LAN Airlines customer review
MEX-LIM-CUZ return flights were outstanding. Food free and very good quality. Cabin crew made constant rounds through the cabin on both of the long legs. The shorter legs were OK for 1 hour flight. All flights on time. Baggage always arrived. Seats were a bit stiff and lacked lumbar support however the inflight entertainment was excellent.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Los Angeles to Buenos Aires on Boeing 767-300. The plane was clean. Flight on time good entertainment system with good selection of movies and shows meal bland and cold Flight Attendants wouldn't speak English I didn't see any smile on their face.

LIM-LAX in Economy. Afternoon flight non-stop (8+ hrs) had moderately clean a/c interior each seat with a pillow and blanket. Good inflight entertainment system on time departure/arrival. Meals were bland and poor quality and the wine glass was the size of a large shot glass. Flight crew were cold and indifferent and held no conversations with passengers. During the 8 hr flight a meal was served almost immediately then crew shut down for 5 hrs. No drink cart service for 4 hrs if passengers wanted water they had to go back to galley. Crew did not respond to attendant call button in fact the chief purser when pushing the cart trying to sell duty free items walked right past the attendant call light and ignored our request. 6.5 hrs into the flight a small ham sandwich and the second beverage cart appears. Arrived at LAX hungry and dehydrated but on time.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Premium Business SYD-AKL-SYD. Lie flat seat a major bonus given the early flight times. Crew pleasant but not outstanding. Food far below the standard offered by other carriers. However LAN is far cheaper they use the Qantas Business Lounges in SYD and AKL. I found both to be extremely bland and lacking in ambience. Would I fly them again - yes for the $750 return fare they are well worth it.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-IPC-SCL and SCL-PMC-SCL all Economy class. The IPC flight on 767 was top class once onboard latest generation IFE system decent hot meals free wine and beer and friendly staff. The domestic flight was good also snacks and drinks considering the weather conditions. My only negative comment is that as mentioned elsewhere 2 of our 4 flights had a schedule change which cancels the reservation and luckily I had easy Internet access to fix the issue. If you don't speak even basic Spanish you are at a disadvantage compared to the other passengers. In short - great once in the air but scheduling is somewhat messy.

AEP-IGR. Online check-in in Belgium was not a problem. Baggage drop was fast and without any complications. Full but clean plane friendly FA. Snacks and drinks. Flight entertainment easy and fast luggage clearance. Only thing no lounge no special things for frequent flyers.

UIO-GYE-UIO. First leg of trip - web check-in worked perfectly and bag drop excellent at UIO agent polite and helpful. Boarding was chaos as no row boarding performed for a 50 minute flight onboard service has dropped a lot only one candy offered and no beverage service not even water. Flight attendants polite but robotic. Second leg of trip - web check-in worked perfectly but bag drop at GYE took 30 mins as there were only 2 agents that performing check-in agent polite but not interested in helping. Smooth row boarding onboard service exactly as first leg. Is incredible how LAN has deteriorated its onboard service and reduced airport employees you feel now this airline is very cheap.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Santiago to Easter Island return two long flights and both very good. We had excellent service from attentive pleasant staff and a varied inflight entertainment system that was better than what many airlines have in Business Class.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I arrived at the airport with my daughter standing in line an attendant told us we weren't flying that day. We were supposed to fly MIA to EZE non-stop. Instead we flew MIA-SCL SCL-EZE. At the desk we were given the wrong gate number so our luggage had been sent on the wrong plane. Thankfully a flight attendant helped us out and gave us a new boarding pass. I was refused a refund even though I flew a connection flight at the price of a non- stop.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Arrived at MIA to a long line waiting to check-in for to Santiago and then on to Valparaiso. Two hours later we were checking in but found out our 9am flight was not leaving until 3am. This was the w/e of the Tsunami watch hence the delays. Staff were courteous and organized. Without any fuss we were offered a choice of staying at the airport or going to a hotel. Onboard service was excellent. Good leg room spacious seat nice staff and full size stainless steel cutlery.

### LAN Airlines customer review
MIA-LIM LIM-SCL. Friendly staff short waiting time at check-in. Onboard service and food variety ok for the length of the trip. Inflight entertainment quality and variety were good . Second leg of the trip was done in Economy with a good level of service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Very disappointed with the reliability on their schedules. On my last two trips I ended up travelling on two different airlines due to last minute cancellations. No advance notice given to passengers agents are never on the same page regarding reasons for the cancellation. Nice aircraft's but poor service.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Trujillo to Lima to Madrid to London (Iberia) they cancelled the Trujillo flight less than 12 hrs before take off and did not notify passengers by phone or email. They cancel afternoon flights from Trujillo to Lima if the plane is less than half full and put passengers on the evening flight. I missed transfers and arrived home 16 hrs late. They refuse to pay compensation.

### LAN Airlines customer review
We took LAN several times from Mexico-Lima or Lima-Madrid. The service is ok and the room is plenty enough in Economy. The thing that I am not able to understand is the arrogant behaviour of the flights attendants. Whilst at the airport in Mexico we witnessed the crew behaving quite rudely towards airport staff. This attitude is poor and next time we will fly another company.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I pre-booked a baby cot for our son who was approx 6 months at the time. I had to really look hard to find any cabin crew as seemed they hide from customers to avoid providing help. When I finally did find them at the back of the plane rather than saying yes I will get one for you they wanted to know why I needed one. On the return flight the staff refused to get a baby cot so on a flight from Santiago-Sydney they wanted us to hold our son all they way back home. When I complained they suddenly did not understand.

### LAN Airlines customer review
GYE-MAD. Economy class on LAN Ecuador. Modern aircraft clean cabin comfortable seat. Friendly very caring and professional cabin crew. Food and beverage service is very generous in Economy quality of food is good. The individual inflight entertainment system is absolutely one of the best I have seen on an Economy Class: plenty of movies (more than 50!) lots of music a really big choice. In my opinion one of the best airline if you fly from Europe to South America. For sure I will fly again also because often LAN has very competitive prices.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Syd-Santiago-Lima and return via Papeete as well as several internal flights throughout Chile and Peru. International Economy cabin staff did the bare minimum regarding passenger assistance. To get a glass of water was an imposition and to be told to "go down the back and get your own water" was aggravating when you were confronted with at least 3 attendants sitting flicking thru magazines. Food and liquid was dished out in such an off- hand manner that twice myself and adjoining passenger were doused with water and soft drink. And the flights were not always full or demanding. The other gripe is a small or pleasant look on flight attendants faces would have been a welcome relief. So never again International LAN unless there is a distinct improvement with cabin staff. On a positive side the smooth flying and early arrivals to cities was a bonus.

### LAN Airlines customer review

### LAN Airlines customer review
Sydney-Santiago via Auckland in Business with multiple domestic flights within Chile. Business class cabin excellent. Service friendly and efficient with great food. Lie flat bed offered plenty of room. Inflight entertainment was easy to use with a choice of English and Spanish. Stopover in Auckland in both directions was a chance to stretch the legs and use the showers in the lounge. Domestic flights often left late no meals served even during flights over traditional meal times - only provided with a snack and a drink. Announcements in English and Spanish. A standard domestic economy flight experience.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Buenos Aires to Córdoba. Plane clean and staff correct. Simple snacks served no possibility of choosing food. Beverages can be chosen. Big drawback is that they use buses to take you to and from the plane despite the availability of gates for direct boarding (both in Aeroparque in Buenos Aires and in Córdoba Airports).

### LAN Airlines customer review
Rio de Janeiro to Miami via Sao Paulo and Santiago de Chile. Cabin spotless on boarding in Rio but on the 3:30hrs flight from Sao Paulo to Santiago only a cold/small ham and cheese sandwich was served with complimentary wine and whisky. In Chile things started derailing : the flight from Santiago to Miami (an 8-hour overnight segment) was 3:30hrs. late. This meant we were from 10pm until 1.30am without any water or food offered by the airline. Onboard flight attendants were friendly attentive and professional. Seats have decent width and legroom with above average recline.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I agree with Ms Goodwin on 10 April. LAN have a serious issue with scheduling. We have just completed an extensive tour of South America in which we had 13 flights with LAN in all cabin classes. 5 of those flights were re-scheduled at short notice 1 was cancelled at long notice and 1 was cancelled at very short notice (less than 12 hours). 7 of 13 flights cancelled or re-scheduled. I would caution travellers to check with the airline 12 to 24 hours in advance to ensure their flight is actually flying. Ground staff respond to courtesy and friendliness aircraft excellent cabins spotless and everything functions as it should. The cabin crew are pleasant and helpful.

### LAN Airlines customer review
MIA-SCL-GRU-GIG flights on B767-300 wide seats above average recline and tasty food. LAN provides free wine with meals and free headset. Cabin staff professional attentive and friendly. Combined with competitive fares make LAN a very attractive option.

JFK-GYE-UIO and back. Nice flight attentive crew comfortable bulkhead seats which where assigned to me after double Knee replacement surgery. Crews offer charm grace and hospitality. LAN could use a few English speaking staff at GYE changing planes and paying the departure tax was a bit trying since our Spanish was limited. But wherever you travel in Ecuador there is at least one Ecuadorian willing to help a frustrated Tourist.

Auckland to Sydney had to check-in at around 3am for 5:10am departure. The cabin crew were very pleasant indeed and helpful towards older people and families with babies. A reasonable if modest breakfast was served and good IFE. A340 is comfortable and seats with good legroom.

### LAN Airlines customer review
EZE-SCL and SCL-GIG with stopover in GRU. All flights on time aircraft clean and crew friendly. Seating was tight and legroom was just ok for segments of 2-3 hours. Service consisted of sandwiches and free drinks including beer and wine. Overall a good experience. Also contacted customer service once via email and got reply within 24 hours.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I did nine flights with Lan as part of an extensive South American package and found them to be very good. They were far superior to Qantas. While selling as a LAN business class package there are actually no business seats for flying within Argentina or Chile so business is only for the International component. Flight attendants generally did their job very well and were friendly. The pisco sours from Lan were the nicest I had and food was always of good quality. The problem and this is a big one is with the scheduling. LAN schedules daily flights Santiago to Auckland but seem to cancel them quite easily. Our flight on the 21st March was cancelled and I believe a second flight was also cancelled that week. Obviously this causes major inconvenience and although we had plenty of notice we still had nothing else to do but spend time in the Santiago Airport holiday Inn. Some of the Argentine regional airports could have used a third check-in counter going (El Calafate Ushuaia) as there were long queues. A large tour group was allowed to effectively push in front of us at one of these airports which I wasn't happy with.

### LAN Airlines customer review
FTE-AEP via Ushuaia  check in long lines very strict on hand luggage weight (7kg) on flight to Ushuaia drink service. On flight to Buenos Aires just a drink and some cookies too little for a 6 hour trip with a high price - disappointed.

Sydney-Santiago-Sao Paulo. An uneventful flight with a good crew on board. I was fortunate to have the only spare Y class seat on my flight next to me. Food good drinks good but the wine glasses were thimbles. IFE is fantastic! I needed assistance at the SCL Airport transfer desk and LAN staff seemed a little overwhelmed but did their best to resolve. Appreciated the English - and I tried my hand at Spanish with good result!

Lima-Easter Island-Lima. Lima departure was delayed for more than 2 hours but enjoyed the flight on new clean airplane with large selection of movies attentive and courteous flight hosts. Return flight more than 2 hours late again got emergency exit row seat so extra leg room same clean airplane but irritated crew probably from the previous flight from Santiago. When I approached one of them was bluntly told she didn't speak English.

Santiago - NY Economy. Very neat B767-300 clean interior. Surprising and very comfortable seat pitch. Tasteful dinner menu with free wine and breakfast. Reasonable entertainment selection. The most attentive crew in a long time. Compared with American LAN is by far the best choice.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I have never been subjected to so little customer care. LAN twice delayed our flight from Lima so that it was just short of 24 hours late. They could not give me accurate information on my flight whether I was actually booked and what would happen with my connecting flight from Madrid to London - which was already a problem with an overnight stay planned with the delay from Lima. The line to speak to someone in the LAN department was 3 hours long and no organisation. Unless you wish to ruin your business or pleasure trip avoid this airline. It's not that they had the problems it's the fact they have not dealt with them at all. The only good thing about this whole episode is that I have now managed to book another flight home with a more reliable carrier.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Sydney - Ushuaia. Business class to BA then economy to Ushuaia. Food great large variety of choice. Auckland - Santiago about 12 hours and flat sleeper was definitely worth it. Staff make an effort with English. Customer service at the airport was polite and efficient. Oneworld lounges at several locations are well stocked but they pack you in. Can get noisy. The aircraft all seem in good condition and despite the length of the trip were value for money and the business class comparable to other major airlines.

We booked a flight from Cusco to Arequipa on Lan. The plane flew only to Juliaca. We found out that Lan knew they were not going to Arequipa because of bad weather but decided I guess that the passengers didn't need to know. We were dumped off in Juliaca with no help in figuring out how to get to the destination we paid for. We took a long bus ride to Arequipa and arrived there at 3am. Lan did not compensate us did not help us did nothing. I would not fly this airline again.

GRU-LIM-SFO. The cabin is classy and seats recline to flatbeds. Service is quite courteous and entertainment (15in AVOD screens) is top-notch. However this is not the best flight if you want to rest. The problem has to do with flight times. The 5hour flight from GRU to LIM is too short to sleep and if you are coming from Brazil the 12am departure from LIM means that after meal service it's already 4am according to your body clock.

LAN airlines will not even let you complain. Traveling with two small children and speak very little Spanish from Santiago to Lima then Lima to Los Angeles the plane broke in Lima. I understand that planes break sometimes but the staff from LAN should communicate with passengers what is going on. After two hours of no information I noticed that everybody got up and either got in line or were leaving the gate. After asking several passengers I found out that the flight was not going to leave for 12 hours and we were supposed to go to the hotel. No one said what hotel or where it was located. In tears and clearly upset I followed other Spanish speaking passengers and 2 hours later was outside the airport getting on a bus that looked like it was going to break down without my luggage. No LAN staff members were around to tell us anything on the bus the driver communicated in Spanish that we were headed 1 hour 40 mins away to downtown Lima in rush hour traffic. It took two hours to check into the hotel where one of the passengers passed out and needed medical attention just so we could leave three hours later to travel back to the airport where they made us stand in line again to check in for the flight. I encountered around 100 LAN staff members and not one was helpful. I would ask a question and they would say they had to find out the answer and disappear. Nobody helped with connections everybody was on their own. Submitted a complaint to customer service and the response took almost three weeks and was in Spanish go figure! I will never fly LAN or any of their Oneworld Alliance carriers ever again!

Calling reservations office from USA - usually on recording for 1/2 hour or more if they answer at all - last time I gave up after 45 minutes with no answer at a non-peak calling time. I also received conflicting information on several occasions - reservations office appears to be staffed by only 2 or 3 people - problems with lan.com website are not addressed - cannot get Lanpass number through web site and if you call reservations you are told to do it on line. Agent said to send information to email address that turned out to be bogus - if you can use an agency you probably should because reservations office is incompetent and unprofessional.

SCL-TEM PMC-PUQ-SCL. First 2 legs were fine friendly service decent IFE considering they were short flights. First leg on a pretty new A318 2nd and 3rd on new A320s with comfortable leather seats. Final flight was delayed in PUQ for 3 hours 1 hour delay communicated at checkin counter afterwards no more communication. Food vouchers handed out. Once in the air another 3 hour stop at Balmaceda airport. Food vouchers handed out again. Service on the plane was good friendly FAs on all flights. Communication could have been better. Finally arrived with 6 hours of delay.

YYZ-JFK-LIM-CUZ-PEM return. The flight to JFK was fine seats leather comfy service fine. JFK flight 4 hours delayed for no reason apparently. LIM-CUZ seats still had crumbs on them and pockets still had other peoples trash in it. Seat was spacious snack provided service fine. CUZ-PEM fine with a snack. Long journey back staff at PEM airport don't speak English fair enough. But Flight attendants on the LIM-JFK don't speak English? Not even basic English like when I asked "do I have a choice of meals? she didn't understand.

Round trip Quito to Medellin as well as Quito to Miami. The flight on B767 from Quito to Miami was superb. The seatback entertainment offering music and video was excellent and it was wonderful to fly a widebody aircraft.

### LAN Airlines customer review
BOG-MIA two hours delay for technical problems on the plane. Although we did pre check-in our seats this was changed to different seats along the plane. The line for check-in was so long and slow.

### LAN Airlines customer review
MIA-LIM flight was delayed two hours had to wait for incoming flt from LIM. Old B767 very poor cabin service LIM-based crew no one acknowledged it was New Year's Eve (it struck midnight on flight cabin crew members went to Business galley for a toast but passengers got nothing). Once they are done with the scarce meal service FAs vanish until 15 minutes before landing. There is a noticeable difference if you fly LAN to or from SCL with Chilean crew and A340 aircraft. Everything tends to be better. LAN Chile should watch more closely the poor service that LAN Peru and LAN Ecuador deliver.

### LAN Airlines customer review
MIA-UIO-SCL-MIA. MIA-UIO and SCL-MIA in B767 planes new and quite comfortable in coach. Entertainment selection great. Check in at Miami and Santiago was fine. Food adequate and flight service good. Quito-Guayaquil-SCL leg in tired and uncomfortable A320. Seat pitch 30 inches at most - totally unsuited for a 5+hour flight.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Santiago to Buenos Aires booked a window seat (2L) but was given an aisle seat at check in probably because my FF preference is always aisle. Only thing that spoilt the whole experience was the flight attendant refusing to let anyone use the washrooms half an hour out from Buenos Aires. Claimed we were landing but I suspect it was because she wanted easy access to the coat locker. Immigration in Buenos Aires was chaotic and rude and bags took forever. Business certainly did not come out first.

### LAN Airlines customer review
If you fly from Zürich to Latam do not use LAN Airlines! They sell you codeshare flights with Iberia through Madrid but in Zürich airport you can only get the boarding to Madrid (LAN does not have office in Zürich). In Madrid you have to exit the boarding area go to the LAN counter and get the boarding pass to your final destination. Moreover web check-in is not allowed in these flights. I will avoid LAN in the future.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I have been flying LAN for years and it's quickly becoming the worst airline I have ever dealt with. I work for a travel company and fly within South America and between South America and the US frequently. Their call center and 40% of the time either the representative or the system hang's up the call. If I do get through the agents are rarely can solve any issue. My current problem is a flight from Buenos Aires to Lima via Cordoba. My wife has a flight with my LANpass point awards and not only was this ticket almost impossible to get they also don't want to offer any solution to issues that come up. We looked to see if we could change a date and 3 weeks before the return flight there were no spaces within 2 month of the originally scheduled flight. Next for the 2nd day she finds herself at the airport with a "cancelled flight due to weather" in Cordoba. They are finding no solution other than putting us in a position where I have to pay for an upgrade. I have lost all patience for this airline especially their terrible service in Argentina. I have never seen worse service anywhere by far the worse airline I've dealt with. As I write this I've been waiting on Hold for 25 minutes with the LAN Call Center.

### LAN Airlines customer review
I would suggest spending the extra money even if it amounts to a few hundred dollars to fly an airline other than LAN to Argentina. After purchasing our tickets four months ago my wife and I have not only had our itineraries changed four times but we've been placed us on separate flights after we've repeatedly requested being on the same flight. Furthermore their justification for placing us on separate flights ended up being completely false and likely motivated by their overbooking our flight. Our flight leaving Buenos Aires had a layover in Santiago Chile. I was told that I had to have my flight changed because I would not make my connecting flight. My wife who also left on the same flight from Buenos Aires was given a non-changing flight that continued back to the US after the stop in Santiago. The fact that we both originated on the same flight but she was given a continuation and I was told I had to board another flight makes their reasoning behind placing me on another flight completely false. The only rational is that they overbooked the continuing flight and they were attempting to remove people from this flight to accommodate additional passengers in Chile. In trying to get them to rectify this error they simply removed both of us and placed us on earlier flights with an additional stop in another country after a six hour layover. They have no regard for their customers and do not try to honor their contracts. I understand a few changes in a flight but they have changed our flights multiple times with little or no regard to us as customers or the plans we've made. They are very inaccessible as well.

LAX-SCL Business new 767 on one leg and refurbished 767 on another. On time good food service comfortable seats. The only drawback is the side pairs of seats. The window passenger cannot get out unless they disturb the aisle. One of the two middle seats in the best choice.

### LAN Airlines customer review
LAX-LIM then LIM-SFO. Los Angles to Lima uneventful - took off from LAX they served drinks then a meal it was tasty enough but small portions. Cabin crew disappeared until about 2 hours out from Lima then served drinks and supper. Good IFE. B767-300ER looked in reasonable condition for 8 hour flight. On the return leg checked in at Lima took a long time-the agent who did not have good english had to get a supervisor to explain that the flight to LAX was delayed and I would miss my connection to Seoul - so they rebooked me to San Francisco and onwards to Seoul with United. However they did not re-issue my e-ticket which led to some complications at US immigration in SFO.

EZE-SCL-LIM return business class. Buenos Aires-Santiago A340 Santiago-Lima B767. All flights on time aircraft seemed to be refurbished with full flat bed seats which I found comfortable. The welcome onboard the first sector was warm and friendly thereafter a little less so. The meals were appropriate for time of day and plentiful. All in all my first experience on LAN was very positive.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Flew 4 times within a space of 6 days with LAN in Argentina and Chile. The first flight was cancelled and we were only informed on arriving at the airport. The check-in staff were very unhelpful and told us to go to the ticket office in the centre of Puntas Arenas (a 20 minute taxi ride away). The staff there weren't much help either and couldn't find space on an alternative flight so we eventually went by bus (14 hours) the next day. We did get our money back though. Flights 2 and 3 were fine. The food was pretty dire - 3 biscuits one of which contained Ham. Puerto Iguazu to Buenos Aires landed at the wrong airport in BA (not the one that was scheduled. Luckily we didn't have a connecting flight. If you did have a connecting flight then you had too get a taxi which you had to pay for. Overall not a good airline but there isn't a huge selection in Argentina and Chile so you would struggle to avoid it.

UIO-GYE-SCL. If I can avoid it I wouldn´t fly this airline again. Check-in in Quito was a nightmare - about 15 pax ahead of me took them 1.5 hrs. My seat was dirty first drinks were offered over 3 hrs after take off in Quito food was okay but no more water or other drinks were offered during the flight.

SYD-AKL-SCL A340 SCL-AEP A320. Check in at SYD airport was easy staff very friendly. Onboard the food is not that great but I didn't mind. SCL-AEP was a short flight at AEP it took only 5 minutes to get the case and get out from the airport!

Los Angeles to Santiago Chile. We found LAN via Alaska Airlines to Seattle and Los Angeles and LAN direct to Santiagoi for less than $700 per person. No charge for meals pillows blankets all the comforts in economy class and service that we do not see on Canadian airlines.

SYD-AKL-SYD Business class on A340-300. Flights on time. Priority check-in at both ends with fast-track through immigration and security at SYD only. LAN uses the Qantas lounge at both airports. Priority boarding honoured. Seats are very comfortable for sitting with excellent pitch and good width - fully flat for sleeping and extremely comfortable with good padding. IFE was on-demand but selection of latest releases was limited. Onboard catering was nothing to write home about. FAs friendly and efficient. Aircraft and cabin was clean and well- maintained.

NYC-LIM-EZE Business Class. Great staff and very comfortable seats on both legs. On the overnight trip to LIM the seats went completely flat and enabled us to get just under six hours of sleep.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Madrid to SCL0. I do this route on a regular basis and one of the more pleasant long hauls you will find in economy class. This flight benefits from extended darkness which reduces cabin activity from most passengers right until the last hour or so. Cabin crew efficient and attentive and have the extraordinary nature of working in total silence when dealing with requests for drinks. Self service for snacks in economy a real bonus and plenty available. Water and juice rounds plentiful. The best to South America.

### LAN Airlines customer review
MEX-SCL-EZE return. Very good inflight service. Check-in at MEX and EZE was quick and efficient. Both legs relatively empty so had two seats for myself. Pitch decent; seats with PTVs and food was OK. Coffee and water offered continuously. Staff well groomed and attentive. EZE-SCL legs operated with new A319s leather seats and filling snack. Very competitive fare and good service when compared to American carriers serving South America. Terrible website. My credit card was charged twice and had to contact the call center to finalize my booking. Luckily the problem was solved before my trip. The return flight to MEX was delayed for 1.5 hours and had to run to make my connection. Boarding at EZE is a nightmare; airport staff unprofessional and rude.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Premium Business Class NYC to Guayaquil. The flight from New York was fine nice plane on- time departure. Return flight a mess. The flight was cancelled and even 30 minutes after it was supposed to depart LAN had not announced that the flight was cancelled. They delayed check-in until the only other flight that morning (AA ) had left. They refused to put us on the AeroGal flight that left an hour after our original departure but after much to do bought us tickets on TACA (still out of network but I guess less of a competitor). I don't think LAN ever planned on flying this flight and thought they could just combine it with the less full 11pm flight. I will never fly LAN and will avoiding flying them again.

### LAN Airlines customer review
Frankfurt - Santiago - Arica Calama - Santiago - Frankfurt. Good aspects - new airplanes clean cabin comfortable seats leg room a mite above average excellent entertainment program reliable baggage delivery good snacks on domestic flights and on Frankfurt-Madrid section. Average aspect : some flight attendants friendly others a bit indifferent especially on long-haul flight altogether not as service-oriented as flight attendants on some Asian carriers. Poor aspect: vegetarian dinner and breakfast. Although I ordered VLML LAN seems to assume that all vegetarians not only refuse meat but also all dairy products sugar spices and wheat. The result were very dry and bland meals.

### LAN Airlines customer review
SCL-IPC-PPT return in Premium Business. Both flights on time with cabin crew that surprised me well with their service and care for details. Good meals (tasty lunch and snacks) very good French and Chilean wines. Seats and IFE system that are among the best. Flight attendants speaks Polynesian and French better than English though.
