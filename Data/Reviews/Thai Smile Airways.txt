### "friendly cabin crew"
Short domestic flight. Flight on time, well coordinated boarding, nice snack box, friendly cabin crew, good leg room, arrival in Krabi at an airbridge, recommended!

### "staff are very professional"
The staff are very professional. Providing the best services in such a short flight. Keep on the good work, guys. Food are nice, seats are comfortable.

### “I was a full 2 hours late”
Usually, Thai Smile has been reliable transportation for my wife and I. However on this occasion, Thai Smile WE 009 was late arriving. To Thai Smile’s credit, the morning of the flight, Thai Smile did message me and made me aware of the delay, but that was the last intelligent thing Thai Smile did. Where Thai Smile went wrong. 1) Thai Smile is over 90 minutes late to one of the largest connection hubs on the planet. HURRY UP. Don’t coast down on descent with the engines barely engaged (to save on fuel costs). People are going to miss their flight. Go as fast as possible. A missed connecting flight is Thai Smiles Fault 2) Why is Thai Smile accepting a parking Spot farthest from the terminal. Pay some extra money, pull some strings, trade with another Thai Smile incoming flight’s parking spot. Your passengers are going to miss their next flight because of you. Thai Smile needs a person with brains running the show here. Because Thai Smile knew from early that morning they were going to be delayed; they messaged me and told me. So I know they knew long in advance. If Thai smile knows that far in advance, then somebody at Thai Smile needs to have some brains and ensure that the parking spot is at the terminal so passengers that have connecting flights have the best chance of making it. A.) because we were at the farthest parking spot at the entire airport, we had to take a 10 minute bus ride to shuttle us to the terminal. This is a waste of time when I’m trying to make my connection. B) because we were at the farthest parking spot at the entire airport, it took the bags at least 15 minutes to start arriving at the carousel. By the time I walked out of the domestic arrival area, I was a full 2 hours late, and made my connecting flight by a mere 10 minutes. I was dead last and almost missed my flight to India.

### "Great service overall"
Great service overall. Timely departure after very organized boarding procedure. Aircraft clean and well air conditioned for boarding. Staff very friendly and professional. Good meal service with table cloth, tableware and drinks in glasses. Good infos from cockpit. Would surely fly Thai Smile again!

### "Efficient and helpful service"
Not Verified |  Efficient and helpful service from reservations, to ground staff and cabin crew. You feel like you matter as a customer and are very accommodating with any changes. Food and Beverage selection on domestic route is fantastic nice to have that surprise option. Would I fly again of course yes. Well done Thai smile airways staff and crew.

### "Sad it will merge with Thai Airways"
Great service, safety standard met. Comfy seat and nice snacks. The staffs, in all aspects, are very kind and very helpful. Sad it will merge with Thai Airways.

### "seats are not clean and old"
We took this flight from Bangkok to Phuket. The maintenance of the equipment is very poor. The seats are not clean and old. Seats are broken so you can't sit straight up while landing or take off. Flight attendants who were rude in my opinion and didn't care much about their customers and I speak Thai myself because I am half Thai. Boarding is also very chaotic. It was not clear which group should board first which resulted in angry passengers. I wont recommend this airline if you want to have a chill holiday. I hope Thai Smile will sort this out in the future. 1 positive thing is that you get a free bag with bread and drinks.

### “Best domestic airline”
Not Verified | Best domestic airline on the globe. Nothing else need be said but I will. Thailand not famous and more infamous for service quality but this little gem of an airline ticks every box and its exceptional quality is unequalled in the industry for any airline let alone a budget one.

### "Very very embarrassing"
Not Verified |  The check in queue at Suvarnabhumi was a disgrace. No orderly queue and not enough staff. People jumped from self serve to other queue. No staff to control. Very very embarrassing. Took over 1 hour to get boarding pass Then extra cost for golf clubs when passengers taking massive amounts of on board luggage was not fair at all. No check on hand luggage and yet 180 baht for each kilo over

### "service with hospitality"
Thai smile offers convenient service through their app and self service at Suvarnabhumi Airport with staff support. The time of flight is in time. Staff gave service with hospitality.

### "very happy with the service"
Not Verified |  I am very happy with the service on this flight and the attentive cabin crew. I am flying Thai Smile about 6 times per year and they are excellent. I am flying smile plus class. Check in goes fast, cabins are clean, service is good and the crew mostly nice and helpful. I can only recommend.

### "Highly recommended"
Not Verified |  Nice and smooth flight, on time, easy check in. No delay, The flight is great. Friendly air crew. Highly recommended. Would be much better if the airline could provide a free lounge

### "Flight smooth and on time"
Ground staff can answer my question. There are about 5 lines with staff, besides self-check in kiosk option. Flight smooth and on time. Cabin is clean, good odor and music before landing.

### "seat is very comfortable"
Service at ground and on the aircraft is very good, flight on time, cabin seat is very comfortable and clean, leg space is enough, snack is delicious.

### "their smile can make your heart melt"
First of all, I think the overall experience of flight with Thai Smile was great. The boarding procedure was smooth and the staff was nice. Cabin crew was great with providing good services. And I think their smile was really good which can make your heart melt, that's why it named Thai Smile. Overall hygiene of the flight was good. The seat was comfort enough. It's departure and arrival time were on time. And the time of getting our baggage was fast.

### "overall great experiences"
Thai smile airline is my first choice for travel trip, and I been chosen many times. It's always an impressive, overall great experiences.

### "Very poor service for the price"
The fare is much higher than Business fare on any other airline. Thai Smile being a budget airline compromised on service and comfort. Very poor service for the price charged. Seat cushions are as hard as rock

### "such arrogant ground staff"
Not Verified |  Ground staff was very rude. Although I have valid visa for Laos and supporting documents, At the boarding counter, one Grounding staff was very rude, behave unprofessionally I have told him that Check-In counter and Immigration already checked by passport and other details, He still insist, how much money I carry, threatening that if I not tell him will not permit me to board in. After I told him that I have more than USD 2,000 Then demanding me to show the money I'm a frequent travel to Thailand from Laos, working & living more than 18 years in Laos This is my first time faced such arrogant ground staff.

### "price for additional baggage drastically increased"
Not Verified |  I am very disappointed firstly that the price for additional KG baggage has drastically increased since December, secondly both complaining at the kiosk in Udon Thani and calling the help line ended with totally unhelpful and unprofessional advice. My wife and I have taken 10 flights to various destinations in Thailand in the past 12 months, and have paid the excess baggage each time. This time has put me off using Thai Airways and Thai smile. My business will be with your competitors in the future. It’s a shame if Thaismile gets the same reputation as Thai airways

### "Ground Service is good"
I fly with Thai Smile again and again. Ground Service is good I can request in seat Emergency door on the plane, comfort and sleep over flight.

### "happy with their crews"
I always fly with Thai Airways or Thai Smile. I trust and happy with their crews and the Service is excellent. Also, we have benefits of frequently flight to be able to redeem or upgrade my next flight.

### "the temperature too hot"
Very unsatisfying, the air-conditioning was low and the temperature too hot. Furthermore I was asked to turn off ipad even though it was in flight mode. All tourists around me used mobile phones with Bluetooth but I was denied use my ipad with Bluetooth. People should be treated equally this is not acceptable.

### "had to take a bus from the airplane"
Not Verified |  Flight was about 30 minutes delayed. Staff were fine and friendly. Snack was nice and the flight itself was smooth. A bit of a hard landing, but otherwise fine. Main issue is that on landing, we had to take a bus from the airplane to get to Suvarnabhumi airport, adding 20 minutes. This is very disappointing for the country's flag carrier and what is supposed to be a modern airport.

### "Staff are less friendly"
Not Verified |  Flight was 30 minutes late. No reason given. Staff are less friendly on this flight. More focused on their own lunch in the back behind the curtain than on passenger service.

### "staff are very helpful"
Very excited to fly with Thai Smile Airways with my children. The ground staff are very helpful and very friendly! The flight attendants are also greeting with nice smile! The flight take-off and landing are very smooth! If I have a chance definitely will fly with Thai Smile Airways again.

### "it was a fantastic experience"
Not Verified |  I recently had the pleasure of flying with Thai Smile Airways, and I must say, it was a fantastic experience. The check-in process at the airport was smooth and hassle-free. As a member of the ROP, the ground service, they provided excellent assistance in securing a seat at the exit door with extra legroom. The staff members were friendly and accommodating, ensuring that passengers were comfortable throughout the flight. The in-flight service was impeccable. The flight attendants were polite, courteous, and attentive to passengers' needs. They served the meals efficiently and with great attention to detail. The food itself was delicious and served promptly, enhancing the overall dining experience. The restrooms were regularly cleaned, and I always felt that they were in pristine condition whenever I used them. The commitment to cleanliness and hygiene was evident, which added to the overall satisfaction of the journey. During my international flight, the connections were seamless. Everything was on time, and I felt that Thai Smile Airways valued punctuality and ensured a smooth travel experience. I was thoroughly impressed and satisfied with Thai Smile Airways on this trip. I will definitely choose Thai Smile Airways for all my future domestic and international flights without hesitation.

### "Worst service ever!"
Worst service ever! First time I ever met such a break during passenger line-up for chcek-in. Without saying a word or even sorry, she just close the counter seeing me standing in front of her counter for almost 1 hour, and there is only 1 counter open for internet/mobile checked-in at that time (only 2 counters for mobile check-in, one is closed, and another one is just closed in front of me), at least she should have waited until she got her team to take turn, right? Even I have asked her that for now it’s only my group remaining in queue, could you please just have it done? She just not care and say: Madam, it is my break time! Oh My goodness, if I have missed my flight just because of this worst service attitude, will the company take responsibility? I really never ever see this kind of service provider, management should has improved on this point, it is really ruin the image of the airline and of course so disappointed! Just one time is enough, good bye Thai Smile! Your name is really ashamed compared to your service!

### "Impressed with the service"
Impressed with the service from the staff from ground to in flight. There is 20 kg baggage allowance with no extra charge. Light snack served is delicious.

### "Thank you for accommodating smooth and fast"
I have traveled from Toronto, Canada and connect flight in Frankfurt, Germany. But unfortunately flight delays and behind schedule 40 minutes. I arrived late in Suvarnabhumi international airport. I had only 35 minutes for check in. When I run to counter Thai Smile Airways they helped me to check in very fast and contacted the gate for departure. All processes fast and I got on board on time. Thank you for accommodating smooth and fast. Highly recommended.

### "Overall service was good"
Overall service was good. Following may be changed to improve the service: 1. The customer care number works only through IVRS and no human contact is there which makes it boring and no solution is received. I tried a lot and wasted my half an hour but, could not succeed as I wanted to confirm travel protocol while returning to India but, could not confirm anywhere 2. Though many counters at check in Bangkok were free they could have started to check in passengers even before three hours that is before 5.30 to avoid congestion and queue, the staff waiting passengers to suffer and make long queue. I reached there at 3.30 but, was advised to come at 5.30 pm and actually, counter started at 5.40. 3. In board catering could be improved with some time lag in all the services, viz. welcome drink, dinner and Tea/coffee. All things were served without any time lag. As flying time was about 4 hours, they could have first served welcome drink after half an hour, then dinner and lastly tea/coffee.

### "well worth the money spent"
The service quality ground and cabin is well worth the money spent. Quality of food is good with 2 choices. The airline is punctual.

### "flight crew very courteous"
Not Verified |  Booking very easy and simple. Follow up correspondence was excellent. Totally hassle free check in. Boarding seamless, flight crew very courteous, efficient and friendly. Overall an excellent experience. Maybe Qantas executives should fly with Thai and learn how customer service should be delivered.

### "I had a horrible experience"
I had a horrible experience leaving the plane. We  booked what was called Thai smile Plus. When we were leaving the plane, everyone in economy just push each other and rush to the front of the plane. For someone with kids sitting in 3rd row, we couldn't even get out of our seats until half the economy cabin go out. It's was unreal, how does the staff not let the business passengers out first? There was only Thai smile Plus.

### "On time, good service"
On time, good service and the crew smile. Drinks are offer with coffee or tea and water plus every passenger received a bun. They encourage passenger to recycle their plastic water bottle by remove sticker and the crew collect the empty bottle.

### "First and last time Thai Smile"
Not Verified |  Delayed, missed my connection. My 13:00 flight took off at 14:45. Told staff at the counter who assisted in only priority tagging my bags. Landed in Bangkok at a bus gate right next to my connecting flight aircraft closing the door. Ended up having to purchase new ticket to another city just to get home. First and last time Thai Smile.

### "Check-in for premium class took 45 mins"
Check-in for premium class took 45 mins and is even slower than those who queued at economy class. Priority tag luggage are sent after general economy class luggage. The only comfort is you are seated at the front of the plane and is served with proper food. Other than that really don’t see a point of getting the air ticket that is 3 times more expensive.

### "professional cabin service"
Not Verified |  Great and professional cabin service. The free baggage is fantastic. The service at Suvarnabhumi airport check-in counter is not quite good. They do not have enough staff.

### "I felt dissatisfied"
The table in front of the seat was dirty, flipped down, and there was a mess of snacks from the previous passenger. Indicates no cleaning  Makes it uncomfortable to use the table in front of the seat, feel disgusted  The vomit bag was crumpled like it had been passed by several hands. The flight was delayed too much, it was delayed more than 20 minutes, and I felt dissatisfied that the airline was not punctual.

### "only serve a small bun and water"
Full service, but they only serve a small bun and water. Bangkok Airways from Phuket to BKK serve full meals with option beverages. For service they good take care.

### "luggage damaged three times in a row"
Ground service is okay. Cabin environment is okay, Crew attitude willing. Beverage and food normal. The bad thing is delay of flight. And the worst thing is about baggage service. My luggage were damaged three times in a row.

### "doesn’t get any better than this"
I booked the Smile Plus fare, which provided extra legroom and the middle seat of 3 blocked. As it turned out, I was the only passenger in this zone so had all 12 seats to myself! Priority check-in. Boarding by bus at this airport, so no Priority Boarding. All staff were great; counter staff and flight attendants. Before take-off, the Cabin Manager introduced herself, and offered me a choice of 2 main courses to be served after take-off, and took my drink order as well. The meal (a prawn pad Thai) arrived packed in a leakproof cardboard box. It was delicious! Also on the tray was a small salad, and a piece of cake for dessert. Drink was served providing me with the whole can of soft drink I ordered. It doesn’t get any better than this, anywhere in the world, for a flight of just 0:58 minutes! Worth every cent! !

### "They handed out a nice snack"
The cabin crew were very courteous and knowledgeable about the safety features and when they finished praised passengers for taking note of the explanation. The staff who made the presentation spoke impeccable English! They handed out a nice snack, which on previous flights during Covid we didn’t receive.

### "Great service all around"
Pleasantly surprised to be given a bottle of water and a Danish pastry just after take off. Especially considering it was a very short flight. Just over an hour. After enjoying the snack the stewardess quickly came back with fresh hot tea and coffee. Great service all around.

### "Never flying with these guys again"
Not Verified |  Terrible by the book handling of clients. Absolutely refuse to bother with understanding the situation (passport at the immigration, the immigration won’t give a confirmation letter). Never flying with these guys again if I can help it.

### "friendly and professional staff"
Very friendly and professional staff, quick and easy service. Even snack water and coffee on a short haul flight. Flight was smooth and almost on time.

### "Cabin crew is very nice"
Cabin crew is very nice, Comfortable seat, domestic flight take about 1-2 hrs. they provided snack during flight Seat section no additional charge. and free 20kg load.

### "The service was superb"
I am quite impressed with the quality of aircraft as well as the quality of service of the staff in the aircraft. The service was superb and the air hostess were amazing and friendly. I will fly again with Thai Smile.....with a big smile.

### "I was made to check my bag"
Not Verified |  Kudos to the flight attendants who served a meal during this 40 minute flight. My seat in Smile Plus was comfortable. But check in was not okay. First of all, there was a family with some issue ahead of me. I was kept waiting for 15 minutes, while Smile economy passengers and Online Check In customers were promptly helped by several agents. You do not leave your premium passengers waiting longer than economy passengers. Then I was made to check my bag because it was over 7 kg, but many other passengers brought huge, heavy bags onboard without anyone stopping them. I know, because I boarded early and watched everyone else on the flight board. Why were so many people allowed to bend the rules?

### "a fine domestic, low-cost airline"
This is a fine domestic, low-cost airline. Service on the ground and in the air is excellent. The planes are comfortable with fairly generous leg room. Snacks are served during the flight. The staff on board was excellent and worked hard to make the flight pleasant. Moreover, 20K of luggage was permitted at no cost. The fee for extra luggage is reasonable if one books it online, but not so reasonable if one pays at check-in. Another plus: seniors are given a 5% discount. All in all, an efficiently run, low-cost airline that hits all the right marks.

### "Friendly crew, on-time departure"
Friendly crew, on-time departure, staff are very willing to assist, crews provide light meal and beverage throughout the flight. I request flight attendants to take photos of an empty cabin after flight they are very happy to show me.

### "the usual good service when flying Smile"
Excellent low cost airline which goes the extra mile in service. Baggage & in flight service included in the price. Senior Citizen discount is always welcome too. Check in was easy online, however long queue for bag drop at BKK. (Maybe due time of day.) On time flight with pleasant in flight crew. Baggage delivery within 10 minutes of entering terminal at destination. All in all the usual good service when flying Smile.

### "Reasonable ticket price"
Not Verified |  Delay flight. Reasonable ticket price with luggage fee. Not clear check-in available time. Quite slow process at airport after landing. Quality snack.

### "exorbitant cost of baggage"
Not Verified |  The service and capability of Thai Air is always very well done and pleasant. The crew is always affable. My issue is the exorbitant cost of baggage over 20kg as they now charge 180baht/per kilo. It had been 90baht/kg. I also question the accuracy of their scales. It certainly made my flight MUCH more expensive than originally anticipated. In fairness, I will note that the luggage check-in attendant did give me a small break on the overage price.

### "Very efficient and friendly service"
Not Verified |  Very efficient and friendly service. Check in was smooth, boarding and disembarking well managed, cabin crew are friendly and worked very hard. I felt safe and relaxed. I would recommend.

### "What a delightful flight"
What a delightful flight, we were very impressed, nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew, and they made us feel so welcome. We will be definitely flying with you again, my son (who lives in Thailand recommended your airline) Thank you

### "service not as good as it should be"
Not Verified |  The snack served on flight was pretty cheap comparing to another airline which serves a whole meal. The service was not as good as it should be. I did not feel any warm welcome for the flight attendants. Flight’s also delayed. Kept change departure time twice.

### "The taste of the snack was too bad"
Not Verified |  Almost all things are good except the snack or light meals in flight. The taste of the snack was too bad. Other services in flight were good. Ground staff and flight attendants are kind with a warm welcome to all customer.

### "Communication from staff was insufficient"
Flight from Suvarnabhumi airport to Krabi. The flight was 45 minute late. Communication from staff was insufficient. No refreshments were proposed while we were waiting on the ground. Disappointed.

### "Fix it urgently!"
Cabin crews service mind is in a critical status. Fix it urgently! Compared to Thai Vietjet Air cabin crews service mind, Thai Smiles is much worse.

### "over 1 hour to check-in"
We waited in line at Thai plus for over 1 hour to check-in. When we got to agent he said check-in for us flight was closed. When i protested how some people had been promoted without going in line and taking a long time to process he then made a phone call. The plane was late and he managed to print passes for us. The place was full and they had 2 only check in agents to handle the customers. There was another agent working but only did 1 group and closed down.

### "Very pleasant and helpful staff"
Very pleasant and helpful staff both ground staff and cabin crews with clear understanding English. Aircraft was clean. Cabin crews worked quite effectively considering the short time flight.

### "Thai Smile Airways is not punctual"
Not Verified |  Thai Smile Airways is not punctual, many times up to 1 hours late, the ground staff in Phuket are rude and inflexible. The cabin crew is fine.

### "I had no complaints"
Just what one would expect from a short haul flight. I am more than happy flying with Thai smile but there is not a lot to say apart from I had no complaints. Cabin crew very friendly.

### "old planes, no entertainment"
Had selected hindu veg meals on booking directly on thai smile website but never provided, upon talking to Flight Attendant, they said sorry it doesn’t show up at my end. I had someone overlook the selection when booking. Overall flight was average, old planes, no entertainment, uncomfortable seats. Leg space was okay so that is plus. Check in counters were minimal so took longer in flight but staff was friendly there. Thai smile website didn’t have good english translation and technical issues, for example, even if selected meals as Hindu Vegetarian for both passengers, it never was assigned to me. Upon talking to fight attendants no help was offered and was not able to eat both ways.

### "I frequently fly this airline"
I frequently fly this airline for domestic flights (or international flight if possible) to avoid annoying regulations of others budget airways which were specified about seat selection, drinks and meals providing, luggage allowance etc. This airline provides all those.

### "Terrible check-in experience"
Terrible check-in experience. The flight WE588 was scheduled for 7.45am departure. I arrive at the airport and straight to check-in counter Row G since 5.30am. However, there was already a very long line of passengers to check-in for the morning flight for international route while only 3-4 counters were opened. One counter for online check-in counter was opened with very short queue of 10-15 passengers. Unbelievable, it took me 45 minute to reach that counter to have my passport checked and receive boarding pass. There were staff sat at the closed countered but only for passengers who nearly miss the flight because of waiting too long for check in. This is irresponsible of airline management. They do not care about passengers at all. The boarding was late as usual for Thai Smile. Take off time was more than 15 minutes late. In-flight service was nothing special. Food was unacceptable as usual. They still serving pie with sloppy, soft, and moist pie crust which should be flaky pie crust. Also they over-used packing. To serve a small piece of bad pie and 100 ml of tap water, they use 2 thick paper boxes.

### "service was great from every step"
The service was great from every step. The check in process was easy and the attendant was patient and polite. The flight attendants were welcoming and prompt. My ticket included checked luggage at no additional charge. I will consider Thai Smile in the future when flying.

### "Punctual departure time on both round trips"
Not Verified |  1) Punctual departure time on both round trips. 2) Boarding efficiency were high and orderly. 3) Even though they were domestic and one hour flights they could complete services in time ie; snack, drinks, tea or coffee. 4) No additional hidden charges when booked, such as credit card fee, luggage charges etc.

### "recommend this airline"
Gaya Airport checkin was fast. Boarding was smooth and the flight ook off on time. The cabin crew was friendly and the meal was delicious. I will recommend this airline.

### "served with a great mood"
I bought this flight as a round-trip from Bangkok to Kaohsiung. Timing according to the flight schedule. Service including ground staff and flight attendant are also served with a great mood. Food on flight is OK including snack, main dish, water, coffee or tea, and dessert too.

### "Excellent full service"
Excellent full service, including light meals on board. Comfortable seat. Nice and friendly staff with enthusiasm. Appropriate time schedule and destination.

### "Nice clean cabin"
Not Verified |  Nice clean cabin. Good service from the crews. Meal is a OK. In terms of safety, everything looks right. The flight was smooth all the way, probably good weather.

### "Good value for money"
Not Verified |  Good value for money and excellent service, I can truly recommend Thai Smile Airways both for leisure and business travels and I’m am sure going to fly with them again!

### "Old and tired plane"
Not impressed. I was supposed to get a discount (as advertised) for joining their loyalty program. Never got one as they claim their software is unable to honor the offer to anyone who doesn’t have a local Thai phone number. How many international travelers use this route? On top of that they never even answered my corresponding question/complaint to customer service. On the date of our flight it was delayed multiple times absent proper communication. Got in hours late. Old and tired plane.

### "The cabin service was good as always"
We flew this airline again. This time from Bangkok to Phuket. The check-in was smooth and takes less than 10 minutes. The flight was on time. The cabin service was good as always. We were served with Orange Pie and a bottle of Mineral water. However, the arrival was delayed due to airport congestion. Otherwise excellent.

### "Do not fly with them"
Horrible. Delayed plane. Once landed extra long wait to deplane. Baggage delay of over 1 hour or more. Horrible. They leave you no reason to smile. Do not fly with them.

### "Service was great for short flight"
Service was great for short flight. So many check-in options available. Boarding through bus gate was not convenient. In-flight snack and drink selection really need to be improved. Thai Smile always serve chicken pie with drinking water with extra option of coffee or tea, even for night flight. The chicken pie with originally crispy flaky crust served moist and soft.

### "well looked after in lounges and on plane"
Not Verified |  Flew to Chiang Mai, paid the extra so we could use the lounges and got very well looked after both in lounges and on plane. Food was excellent, staff polite, bags fast - nothing wrong with anything. 15 mins delay coming back plenty of room with 2 seats out of three. Well worth the extra money for the first rate service, also got points on my Thai royal orchid

### "Smooth all round"
No issues. Flight left on time which also meant the flight arrived on time. Seats comfortable. Snack and water was given out on the flight. Smooth all round.

### "they are cutting cost"
Had booked tickets in advance to get the best rate. Booking process was easy and simple. Had also booked meals, however there are limited options to choose. I have travelled several times before on Thai Airways and their meals have been tasty. However this time the meals were not up to the mark. The drinks were offered after the food and if you ask for a coke, rather than giving a can, they will pour half a can in a glass. Looks like they are cutting cost or cannot afford. The staff was in a hurry to serve and would not bother to even listen at my query. I had ordered vegetarian child meal for my daughter, however was served chicken. She had to just eat bread and butter. Overall Thai Airways standards have fallen drastically and will think twice before booking in future. The check in staff at Bangkok airport was very rude and unhelpful.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service by the cabin crew, food menu was simple and decent, on time departure and arrival, no hurdles, no nonsense, economical and smooth flight journey.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service, starting from check in to inflight service. Seats are quite comfortable with reasonably good leg space. Cabin crew are very polite.

### "my seat was set to center seat!"
I had booked the ticket with aisle seat. But after checked in, the boarding pass mentioned a center seat. I didn’t check it when I received it because I believed the seat is to be the same as what I booked online. Then just before boarding I found my seat was set to center seat! So, you should not believe the staff at counter and must check it when you receive it.

### "Good inflight service"
Not Verified |  Good inflight service and best service mind from cabin crew. Cabin is clean not found defect equipment onboard. Ground staff quick response on solving any problems from passenger.

### "crew on board are very nice and friendly"
We flew Thai Smile airline again. This time from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Check-in and boarding is smooth. Ground service is very good. Crew on board are very nice and friendly. We enjoy Hot drinks (Coffee & tea), snack (toddy palm pie) which is very tasty and a small bottle of water. The flight is delayed for 10 minutes due to bad weather (thunderstorm). Overall the flight and service are excellent.

### "considerate and pragmatic Purser"
I encountered some difficulty with the seat that was assigned by the check in staff but the considerate and pragmatic Purser on that flight managed to solve my difficulty. Thus, I arrived at the destination feeling safer and with more comfort.

### "Excellent in flight"
Excellent in flight, brilliant crews, yummy food and beverages, also clean seat. Attentive staff who were well trained. I recommend to fly this airline even though a short flight. Please make the reservation in advance, you will find the very good deal or lower than budget airlines.

### " a very enjoyable experience"
Thai Smile Airways  have copied the European-style ghastly business class, that's just an economy seat with the middle seat blocked. At least Thai Smile instead of calling it 'business class', branded it 'Thai Smile Plus' - Premium Economy. My flights from Bangkok to Chiang Rai and from Chiang Mai to Bangkok however were pleasant enough to give it a thumbs up. There was a separate check-in desk for premium economy passengers, and my boarding passes gave me access to the Royal Silk Lounges. Priority boarding was not announced, instead, a small placard was held up high for those in Premium Economy to board first. And boarding on both flights was very smoothly handled and the outbound flight actually departed 15 minutes early. Interestingly, at Bangkok Airport, the runway from the air jetty was incredibly close, so much so that we taxied for just one minute and then took off. On board, the cabin crew, in their bright orange attire, greeted me politely with a 'sawadee ka' greeting, and despite their face masks, I could see a smile. The premium cabin with just 12 seats was in the usual Thai Airways colours. The seat pitch was an inch or so more than economy, and for an hours flight, it was fine. Before departure, a flight crew member took the meal order from each passenger, with a choice of two items - rice or noodles. On the outbound flight, I chose the chicken with rice, which came piping hot, so much so that the vegetables were in fact overcooked! On the return flight, it was noodles with shrimp. Small potions, but tasted delicious. No alcohol is served on domestic flights. Both flights were uneventful, on time, with nothing to complain about, and were a very enjoyable experience.

### "a very safe and pleasant flight"
Thai Smile as always before, was a pleasure to fly with. I can only recommend this airline to everybody. On time, if it lies in their hands! Reliable airplanes. Perfect Covid measures. All together a very safe and pleasant flight. And calculating the 20Kg luggage included, a very reasonable option.

### "Good airline and service"
Not Verified |  Good airline and service, clean, comfort, standard and punctual. I’ll choose this airline for the next time again and will suggest to others as well.

### "Good safety and clean aircraft"
Appreciated for Good service and Politeness of all ground staff and cabin crew. Good arrangement for passenger who need to transfer to next flight during flight delay circumstance due to heavy rain before take off. Good safety and clean aircraft

### "very good service"
Flight Bangkok-Khon Kaen. Lovely staff, smiling, bright, very good service, clean plane. The flight was on time, no delay, when landing, it landed very softly. Impressed. Will definitely use the service again.บินไฟล์กรุงเทพ-ขอนแก่น พนักงานน่ารัก ยิ้มแย้ม แจ่มใส บริการดีมากๆ เครื่องบินสะอาด ไฟล์ทบินตรงเวลา ไม่ดีเลย์ ตอนบินลง ก็ลงนิ่มมากค่ะ ประทับใจ จะกลับมาใช้บริการอีกแน่ๆ ค่ะ

### "all went very smoothly"
First time flying Thai Smile and all went very smoothly. Flight was on time, and we landed a bit early. A nice light meal was served on board. Deplaning was fast and transportation from the plane on the bus was quick. Flight attendants were efficient and nice.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Always a pleasant experience from the on-line booking process to arriving at my destination. Reasonable fares including small discount for senior citizens, which is greatly appreciated. Check-in, ground staff & flight crews very friendly and helpful.

### "Excellent Inflight service"
Excellent Inflight service. Wide leg room. Clean cabin. Flight 10-minutes early. Cabin crew gave attention to passenger - no rush feeling. So-so inflight food.

### "service on the plane is quite complete"
Everything was on time and quite comfortable. But in the lounge there will be a lot of users that make me feel uncomfortable. But the service on the plane is quite complete and worth the price.

### "The service is excellent"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Very good and reliable airline. The service is excellent. My flight was enjoyable. Overall, I like it. I will fly Thai smile again in the future.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
The crew did not serve any drinks, soft or alcohol. When I asked for a glass of wine they said they don't have any. Only beer, but that too after the meal! I said usually drinks are served before or with the meal and she replied "it is company policy". When I protested they reluctantly brought a beer. This is unacceptable from a full service airline charging 40% more than low cost airlines flying the same route such as AirAsia, SpiceJet etc. Have never seen this before on an international flight including Thai Airlines. I will never fly this airline again. Forget about beer and wine - they did not even serve any soft drinks or juices at any point.

### "worst airline in terms of customer service"
Thai Smile is the worst airline in terms of customer service. I landed in Phenom Penh for vacation and after waiting for 30min I had to go to lost and found desk just to know my luggage along with other passengers who flew from Bangkok is missing. Their was no one from airline to help or compensate customers. Reaching their customer care is a next level challenge all together. The airport authorities sitting at lost and found counter will never respond or reach out to confirm the status. God bless people who travel via Thai Smile airline who makes sure their customers never leave smiling.

### "I liked the ground handling"
I liked the ground handling for this airline. I was expecting an on-time departure, but the flight departed and arrived late. One thing that is going good for them is the legroom situation and the meals they provide for a short 1 hour flight. Boarding was chaotic, but I don't mind. In-flight entertainment is limited to a few monitors showing some Thai Smile commercials. This was understandable as it was a short domestic flight. I would fly with them again if the fare is reasonable, but another full-service domestic/regional carrier that flies the same route but with more benefits might be a better option. Its just that the flight time for this route fits my schedule for Thai Smile.

### "not clear whether it's just poor service"
Not Verified |  while generally a very good budget airline, the check in and ticketing procedure out of Suvarnibhumi is appalling - it's not clear whether it's just poor service or a deliberate strategy to extract more money from passengers

### "the worst experience"
Probably the worst experience for a so called premium airlines. No gold card lane, no access to lounge, (while told otherwise), and no counting for miles. So please, stop using star alliance branding to fool your customers into flying with you.

### "waiting for the luggage more than 3 hours"
The stupid service waiting for the luggage more than 3 hours, and still not have any staff come out to solve and give the reason. This is terrible service, since we have to fly again at next day 9am, waste our time for take rest.

### "Thai Smiles however does not respond at all"
Not Verified |  We flew a code shared flight from Austrian Airlines. It was operated by Thai Smiles. The flight itself was okay. We came from Amsterdam (via Vienna and Bangkok) and discovered at arrival in SGN that one of our bags was damaged. We got to the baggage desk and had to fill in a form. They took photo's. After returning from holiday I wrote an email to Austrian Airlines who pointed me to Thai Smiles. Thai Smiles however does not respond at all.

### "The airplane was clean"
It was easy to book the ticket and change flight online. The counter check in was convenient. The flight was on time. The airplane was clean. Appropriate price, cozy, not too crowded. The air hostesses were very polite.

### "The service is excellent"
I made a reservation in April 2022, but there was a reason to postpone the ticket to July, causing me to pay 500 baht for the tax, but I don't have any problems with this because I understand the airline system. The service is excellent, including the ability to load 20 kg of luggage. When I got off the plane, I received a small snack from the airline that impressed me. On the way back, I was surprised because I was seated in a premium seat (I still don't know why I got the premium seat). Before getting off the plane, I got a box of late night food which impressed me. Thank you very much for giving me the experience of boarding this plane and all the staff are very good and attentive to customers. I will always remember this experience and will return to use the airline in the future.

### "lack of professionalism"
Flight TG337 from Bangkok to Chennai. Since the beginning, before the take off, I discovered that my monitor and audio didn’t work properly. I asked the hostess for assistance, she told me that I had to wait 1 minute. Than she sit down for the take off that happened many minutes later. After take off nothing happened, I asked again and she said 1 minute again. After a few minutes I asked and she said 10 minutes. After 10-20 minutes nothing happened, then I decided to move to the empty seat in front of me. After a few time I was told that I had to come back because I didn’t pay for the extra space of the seat (that was the one beside the emergency exit). I explained that my video and audio were not working and I was told told they were fixed. Then I moved back to my original seat and the systems were not working at all! Then I moved again to the place close to the emergency exit, I had dinner, and I was told more times that I had to come back to my place. I was treated as I was trying to get an upgrade without paying but actually I was the one who payed for a service that was not working properly. I asked to double check again because I wanted to be sure that I was moving seat for the last time and they confirmed. Then I moved one more time, at first the system was ok then it started again to jump the audio and video making impossible to watch the movie. I’m very disappointed by the total lack of professionalism and politeness that I expect from hostess and mainly from a crew supervisor. At the end of the flight I was tired, frustrated and I could not watch the movie due to the frequent interruption by the crew and system not working. I’m a frequent traveler for both business and tourism reasons and this is the first time I get so disappointed from a so weak and rude service. I won’t travel Thai anymore and I’ll suggest my company and everybody I’ll speak with to avoid such a bad service.

### "a positive environment"
Absolute best experience I’ve had flying. ThaiSmile was a positive environment, staff were very helpful, and we were even given a full meal even though the flight was less than 2 hours. They said the goal was to have us smiling the whole trip — they definitely succeeded.

### "reliable with reasonable fares"
Bangkok to Hat Yai. The most safe and reliable with reasonable fares low-cost airline in Thailand. Low incidence of delay or cancellation. It should be better if airline lounge is available at Suvarnabhumi airport.

### "So not impressed"
The staff service was alright but what’s not alright was that my luggage was broken and all I got in return was an offer of 500 Baht (less than 15 USD) or let them fix my luggage which would take around 3-4 weeks. Honestly, it would cost me more than 500 Baht to fix the luggage and in case if it cannot be fixed I couldn’t even buy the new luggage with the given money. =The ticket is more expensive than other airline but the responsibility is not as high as the ticket price! If this is how they handle your luggage, think about how they will handle other important stuff. Highly not recommended. So not impressed.

### "No food service in-flight"
Good ground service. Baggage fee included. No food service in-flight. Just snack box to-go after landing. Require food service because Thailand pandemic is end now, not an excuse for no providing food and drink service.

### "Punctual and reliability"
Very good service. Punctual and reliability. Staffs are well trained and also friendly to all passengers. Food and service are good. I generally use Thai smile for works every week or two depending on Covid situation especially for meeting on one day trip from my hometown to Bangkok. It is so convenient.

### "most reliable domestic airline"
It is the most reliable domestic airline in Thailand. They take a good care of their gold member and offer valuable benefit. I fly with them often. Their cabin crew & pilot are competitive.

### "a pleasant experience"
Clean cabin. Efficient and courteous crew. Excellent service both on ground as well as in-flight. The atmosphere was very welcoming. Overall a pleasant experience.

### "Amazing service"
Amazing service, from check in to boarding to landing. It was amazing. My daughter also forgot her tablet on the airplane and we received it back within two days! Which is amazing!

### "excellent service by ground staff and flight crew/cabin staff"
This was my 3rd flight by Thai Smile Airways. Their ease of booking at airports, excellent service by ground staff and flight crew/cabin staff make Thai Smile my first choice when flying within Thailand. Return flight from Chiang Rai to Bangkok will be by Thai Smile on 16th June.

### "flights with Thai Smile were not satisfactory"
The flights with Thai Smile were not satisfactory. Being a Thai Airways company, I expected the same kind of service, which I didn’t see. The food on the first flight was okay, on the second we were handed a take away bag with a sweet, leaving the airplane. That did not really make any sense to me. Would have been nice to get something to drink during the flight. No screens on board and the announcements were barely audible. Also, both flights were delayed, which was quite annoying.

### "received low cost airline treatment"
Not Verified |  Paid full service price and received low cost airline treatment. The airline staff commanded that all my carry-on be weighed. Altogether they were 12kg and can fit overhead compartment. I understand they exceed 7kg limit but other passengers of the same size of carry-on were allowed so this is unfair treatment.

### "afraid missing next flight"
It is more like LCC. Free luggage, small snack given. Allow to select seats after blocking many seats, saw it all vacant finally, why? Self service to get water no serving. Delay, saw history of operation, delay every day, unable to plan with 2 hours transit, afraid missing next flight. Ask me to get the luggage at my final destination but pass immigration when I transit, but luggage arrived international side, so we had to walk to another terminal to get our luggage.

### "Clean cabin and seat"
Clean cabin and seat with strictly on flight time table, feel safe when flying with them and comfortable on everything. Ground and air cabin crew operation is standard.

### "Good service and polite"
Good. It would be better if the flight time is more punctual. My flight is a little delayed. Anyway the staff are really nice. Good service and polite.

### "Excellent service quality2
Excellent service quality. Professional people from ticketing to call centre to handling flight changes and flight cancellation to ground staff to cabin crews as well as cabin cleanliness. On time. Recommend.

### "flight experience is very pleasant"
The overall flight experience is very pleasant. The seats are clean, comfortable, and spacious. The flight crews are very hospitable and efficient. The safety measures are well-practiced. The disembarkment procedure is clear and efficient.

### "the crew were nice and helpful"
Although no service on flight due to Covid the crew were nice and helpful. Captain landing at SVB was smooth and not a bus gate, wonderful flight will fly with Thai Smile again.

### "I recommend to try other airlines"
Overall was fine except flight delayed observed very often for this particular flight. As it’s almost the last leg of the operating aircraft. Noticed delays as a consequence from previous legs always. I recommend to try other airlines.

### "Good flight, on time"
Good flight, on time. But check-in was very slow because not all passengers had their documents in order. A small snack was served, it was tasty. However blanket was not available and the cabin was somewhat chilly.

### "Excellent service"
Excellent service with COVID-19 situation. The best width seat in economy class airlines. Flight attendants wear plastic cover and hand gloves with great service.

### "efficient and helpful crew"
The process of check in to boarding was good. Aircrafts are neat and clean. Managed by efficient and helpful crew. Keep up the good work.

### "Great domestic airline"
Great domestic airline, staff is responsive, Covid-19 measures are in place and all is fantastic. We love the experience using this airline.

### "It was a good experience"
Everything as it should be. No delays, very pleasant and helpful staff, aircraft quite new and in a fine condition. Check-in fast and unproblematic. It was a good experience.

### "Cordial staff with smiles"
Well organized and very systematic boarding and unboarding. Cordial staff with smiles. Simple internet booking and special discount for senior citizens that touch the heart.

### "check-in is a disaster"
The check-in is a disaster. Due to the fact, that I have 3hours connection time in Bangkok, my luggage wasn’t checked through as it would leave me enough time to do this myself in Bangkok. My connection was with Thai Airways and the poster at check-in states “connecting you with Star Alliance”.

### "poor passenger announcement service from both pilot and crew"
New aircraft but poor passenger announcement service from both pilot and crew. Especially when flying the PA system in the aircraft was made in very low volume. I couldn't hear any information of the flight from pilot at all. No food and drink serve in flight during COVID19. They prepared only a little piece of snack and drink for passengers before disembarking at the destination airport.

### "cancellations to be dealt with more efficiently"
Check in at airport counter to be reviewed and expedited. Refund on cancellations to be dealt with more efficiently due to airline cancelling flights on the given date.

### "Very comfortable and great service!"
Not Verified |  Managed to get a promo. Excellent value including 20k luggage. Would definitely with this airline again. Very comfortable and great service! Highly recommended.

### "whole experience was so good"
Not Verified |  My flight back from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Ubon Ratchathani on 28 February with ThaiSmile was possibly the best flight I have had – a near-new A320-200, more leg room than I have had before in Economy Class, helpful and happy cabin crew carrying out flight procedures. Masks on the flight and no meals, but a lovely little parcel of Danish pastry and water for all as we disembarked. The whole experience was so good!

### "disappointed that the window was dirty"
Not Verified |  Flight was comfortable, but I’m a bit disappointed that the window was dirty and I cleaned it up. As you know, one of the pleasures of travel is the view from the airplane windows, so I expect Thai Smile Airways to be thorough when cleaning up.

### "service is up to standard"
Not Verified |  Very good service but check-in took some time, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants are quite friendly, seat is quite comfortable. Overall service is up to standard.

### "Highly recommend Thai Smile"
Great airline. Love the music and cabin staff are lovely. From check in to landing it was a pleasure from start to finish. Highly recommend Thai Smile.

### "online check-in system too difficult"
Uncomfortable to enter aircraft you must ride the bus. And in the waiting room it was very bad smell because the engine pollution from bus came inside waiting room. And online check-in system too difficult it just 24 hours before departure it would be better if 72 or 48 hours.

### "Meal was not good enough"
Meal was not good enough. Only, water bottle (small) and 1 piece of bake (basic). However, due to Covid situation, seat should allocate properly. Beside that, cabin crew services, cleanliness and others was good.

### "Airline personnel were very professional and helpful"
Not Verified |  We found it easy to book directly with Thai Smile website. We needed to book some overweight bags and that was easy to do by buying tickets in category Smile Plus. Cost about $100 usd (3200 Baht) for a one-way ticket). There were 3 flights from BKK to Udon Thani each day, which was convenient. The airport was not very busy and the Thai Smile check in counters were well staffed and the wait time was very short. Airline personnel were very professional and helpful. Safety measures were enforced and we felt safe flying. Our tickets included a meal that we did not eat on board, but the crew packed it up so we could take it with us, that is a nice touch. One final consideration is there is a fee for canceling or changing a ticket if your plans change. Some airlines allow changes with no fees.

### "prices are reasonable"
Easy internet booking, quick check-in, check-in and on-time flight. The reception is perfect and the prices are reasonable. Good flexibility in the event of a flight modification. Reservation par internet facile, enregistrement rapide, check in et vol a l’heure. L’accueil est parfait et les tarifs sont raisonnables. Bonne souplesse en cas de modification de vol.

### "Was an excellent trip"
Was an excellent trip. Boarded on time, departed on time, arrived 5 min early. No food & beverage service in flight but small snack provided to you when you deboard the plane.

### "Boarding done smoothly"
Not Verified | Flight on time, both at departure and arrival. Boarding done smoothly. At arrival, passengers were advised to leave the plane according to their seat numbers, that was very orderly and efficient.

### "Very cheap and reasonable fee"
Very cheap and reasonable fee. Very comfortable, convenient also free to sit if that seat available and not much crowd each row.

### "good support on cabin crew"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Hat Yai. The cabin are very clean. Very good support on ground staff. Good meal and good support on cabin crew. The seats are comfortable.

### "Very careful regulations"
Very careful regulations for prevention of COVID-19 infection, i.e. spraying door handles of lavatory for each passenger after they've finished using it, including spraying the handles of each storage or overhead locker.

### "we felt super safe the whole way"
Not Verified |  Definitely worth paying a little extra to get the Thai Plus flights. 30kg of checked luggage on domestic routes, airport lounge with great service and yummy food, lovely cabin crew with even more tasty treats, very clean cabin and very helpful staff all the way through from our check in. Very organised with Covid and we felt super safe the whole way. No issues with our luggage. Will make Thai Smile our preferred carrier from now on.

### "World class services with professional cabin crew"
World class services with professional cabin crew. High level protocol and procedure for Covid-19 situation which adds a lot more confident to customer. I enjoy flying with Thai Smile every time.

### "service was comfortable"
Thai smile never delayed for me. The service was comfortable. I love baggage up to 20 kgs, and a passenger who can select seat by themselves. A snack beverage so delicious as especially "Pa Thong Koe".

### "All the staff are friendly and helpful"
The service is very nice. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Check in counter very fast. In this corona time the airline conducted the safety system very well. They provide a snack box in the bag after you landed. The food was very good.

### "COVID-19 measure is implemented throughout"
Seat is comfort, great service. Snack box is provided on-flight. COVID-19 measure is implemented throughout the service. Best of all is all flights are on time. Ground service staff are good old friends from Thai Airways with great service.

### "The seats dirty"
Hat Yai to Bangkok. The seats dirty, a lot of the scrap of snack on the seat. Window near the seat also dirty. And now COVID-19 still happening in Thailand but Air Hostess seems not care.

### "good services by Thai Smile"
Efficient boarding, crews provided good services indeed, captain made and provided adequate announcement. Baggage came out quite quick. Overall is good services by Thai Smile Airways.

### "staff on board were in a good mood"
The airport is relatively quiet. Many stores are still closed. My airline had a good service. The staff on board were in a good mood, smiling, and service minded. Economy seat is comfortable enough for me.

### "I think its service reaches the standard of Thai Airways"
This is not my first time flying with WE. For me, I think its service reaches the standard of Thai Airways (TG) in just a smaller cabin. Price: reasonable. Ground staff: helpful and efficient. Cabin crew: good looking, service-minded and caring. Snack box: delicious and reasonable. Overall: I like everything when flying with both WE and TG.

### "crew give excellent service"
The cabin crew give excellent service. The cabin is clean and confort. Ground staff check-in is fast. The flight is on time. The price is affordable.

### "Comfortable seat with reasonable legroom"
Comfortable seat with reasonable legroom. Good quality meals. Booking via website was quite easy but the function of adding e-ticket to Apple wallet was not working. However, the link received via email did the job of adding e-ticket to Apple wallet like a breeze.

### "No social distancing"
Not Verified |  Khon Kaen to Bangkok. The inflight service is not so good. No social distancing (there are many empty seats). I can't change my seat, why?? The position of the seat is not appropriate for my back, sometimes I have got back pain.

### "There was no food for the kid"
There was no food for the kid and when we ask the cabin crew, she just told that we need to request for it when we make a reservation. In my opinion i think this is not right coz when we book the ticket the airline have all the information of the traveller. They should prepare it according to the information that they receive. Or otherwise the airline should prepare something as the option for the kid if they not going to check their passenger list. Phuket to Bangkok, the food on the flight is kua - gling (คั่กลิ้งไก่) which is no way the children can eat it.

### "messages through super loudspeakers"
Boarding via a bus gate- Despite the covid, social distancing measures are being encouraged haphazardly by Thai Smiles and other relevant Thai authority, ground staff just packed the buses, literally other passengers are breathing over your neck. I was on the first bus, that included all premium cabin pax and top tier frequent flyers. And what will sequential disembarking do to help prevent spreading of COVID, if the crew just send the passengers to be packed in the bus ride to the gate? The much talked-about Chinese Donut was served with custard dipping. It was handed out on tray with the donut in a little paper box. All without wrapping or covers, and it was served with no cutlery. Again, this is very insensible, given the fact that just a few days ago, there have been reports on recent surges of new locally infected sars COVID cases in Thailand. And certainly not everyone enjoys greasy and oily donut dipped in just sugary carb rich custard. PA on board is obsessed with PA by both crew and recorded messages blasting through super loudspeakers. The PA are redundantly made by crew, and again by pre-recorded messages- in TH, EN and CH. Most of WE flights are between 50 to less than 90 mins. PA before take-off, inflight, pre-landing and arrival blasted very loudly throughout the flight! I would say it is just too much annoying.

### "Service is good"
The flight was on time. The ground staff took care us. The passenger room was clean. The air hostesses said sawasdee and guide us about seat / security. They follow up about security such as belt, seat and window. Service is good.

### "not provided free 10 kgs plus luggage"
Hat Yai to Bangkok. They’re not provided free 10 kgs plus luggage for Royal orchid plus program (I’m a silver member) even on the website of them still show this benefit.

### "comfortable seats and very pleasant crew"
Thai Smile schedule reliable and on time. Cabin clean, comfortable seats and very pleasant crew. Although it’s budget category, check-in baggage 20kg is included in the fare. Seat reservation is free too. And snacks and drinks are served even for a 1-hour flight.

### "flight attendants are nice and helpful"
Bangkok to Khon Kaen. Thai Smile is my first choice when I travel by plane. The seat is comfortable, more leg room. The flight attendants are nice and helpful. Smooth taking off and landing.

### "Everything was delightful"
Very efficient, courteous, pleasant and professional from check-in to the gate agent, to cabin crew and finally when the baggage arrived at baggage claim. Everything was delightful. I would gladly fly THAI Smile again.

### "Cabin staff service is excellent"
Friendly ground staff, convenient, easily access check in point. Cabin staff service is excellent. The cabin is very clean. The snack is delicious. Take off time is punctual.

### "I'm not impressed"
I'm not impressed. At the check in counter, staff said they don't have a direct flight and asked if I came to wrong airline. So I showed her my ticket in an email. I was told that the flight was canceled but I didn't receive any email, call or message. After that there was one nice staff member who came to help me redo the ticket but it was a  connecting flight, my only choice that I have to wait in Bangkok for 3 hours and I had to cancel my spa in Phuket. I am really disappointed that I just noticed when I came to check-in, and I had to change my plans on that day immediately.

### "Cabin crew are polite"
Cabin crew are polite and great service on short flight. In cabin very comfortable and clean toilets. Ground staff are service minded with clear answers.

### "not like anything about this airline"
Bangkok to Phuket. The only reason I flown with Thai Smile was that Thai Airways has not yet resumed its operation. But I do not like anything at all about this airline. There is some hiccing-up every time I fly with them.

### "The cabin was not cleaned at all"
Not Verified |  The cabin was not cleaned at all. I couldn't understand why there was a large amount of waste of used and dirty tissue paper in the seat pocket even though under COVID-19 hygiene management at this airline is only superficial, and the true nature is not understood. When I complained to CA, there was no apology, it was just garbage collection. Furthermore, they sprayed disinfectant on me, which has nothing to do with garbage. It is unthinkable that the safety of passengers has been ensured by providing such services that are impossible under common sense. Flight No. WE282/1 Nov. Seat No.50H.

### "Excellent airline to fly"
Excellent airline to fly with. I like all the services they provided with the price of their Economy level. The booking is easy and this airline offer special price for senior citizen at 20% discount of its fare.

### "Very good service"
Phuket to Bangkok. Very good service even it is a short flight. The flight attendants are professional on both safety and the flight service. The snack is good even though during COVID.

### "cabin staff and ground staff service good quality"
Flexible, comfortable (big) seat, low cost, service minded, free seat selection and free Snack. Free luggage service, cabin staff and ground staff service good quality.

### "An excellent service"
An excellent service provided by Thai Smile Airways crews. They always smile. A short flight only 50 mins but delicious snack and drink provided. The welcome announcement made very clear by captain including time to be landing and weather forecast. I will continue fly with Thai Smile Airways.

### "comfortable and enjoyable flight"
Flight departed before time and arrived much earlier than planned in Bangkok. Boarding and disembarkation was speedy and efficient whilst maintaining social distancing guidelines. Plane was very clean, whilst the cabin crew were friendly, polite and efficient. In-flight snack was good and made use of environmentally friendly utensils and packaging. All in all a very comfortable and enjoyable flight in these challenging circumstances

### 2Good service and light snack"
Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani . On time performance. Good service and light snack. Feel comfortable during flight. Cabin Crew are smiling while they do service to passengers.

### "everything was perfect"
Cabin cleanliness is outstanding. Onboard refreshment is ok when compared with the flight duration. I expected nothing more. Crews were working professionally when having to deal with the covid-19 situation. 20kg Luggage allowance is notable when compared with the same range flight fares of competitors. Overall, everything was perfect.

### "Great inflight services"
User-friendly ticket booking website. The fee already included 20 kg luggage allowance. No hidden cost. Check-in was simple and smooth. Great inflight services. Clean and well-maintained interior. Free light meal: Japanese rice with teriyaki grilled Mackerel and a bottle of water. Free drinks choosing from tea, coffee, or orange juice. Seat was comfy. Nothing to complain. Great flying experience overall.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Flight left early - about 10 minutes. Flight crew were very efficient and observed all the COVID-19 mandates. Food was very good - sausage and egg omelet with a bottle of water. And, I have been flying for over 50 years and today was the first time I have seen organized deplaning - buy about 2 rows at a time. This was so nice that getting off the plane was as organized as getting onboard. Prices are very fair and competitive and I really appreciate not having to pay extra for checked baggage. Other airlines charge 300-400 Thai baht for 20 kilograms. All in all, a very pleasant flight with an early departure and arrival.

### "nice cabin crew"
Bangkok to Hat Yai. Perfect service with nice cabin crew. Very nice support from ground staff. Flight on time and early departure. Food packaging is quite clean and food is good quality.

### "good service from staff"
Khon Kaen to Bangkok. Good service from staff and a nice snack. Cleanliness and nice service onboard. Free luggage loaded. Comfortable seat and room for legs.

### "A wonderful flight"
A wonderful flight during the Covid-19 pandemic in Thailand. They surprise customers after the flight landed by gave us a snack and drink before we leave the airplane. For the cabin staff, they are very happy to give us the best services.

### "Poor baggage handling"
Efficient check in with social distancing. Smooth boarding procedures. On time arrival. Poor baggage handling at Phuket Airport by Airport Authority of Thailand. The carousel stopped as soon as the last baggage showed up on the belt. Didn't bother to let them roll to allow passengers to pick them up. Many people had to scramble to walk to luggage to pick up off the belt.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Phuket to Bangkok. Comfortable seat with pitch and width, free to choose your seat, supportive and friendly cabin crew, fly on time, have a lot of slot to choose flight,

### "attendants were helpful and polite"
It was a domestic short flight for about only 1 hour. Due to Covid-19, no food was served on flight, but there are snacks and water bottles which passengers can pick up before leaving the plane. When entering the plane, all passengers are provided with face masks etc. in sealed packages. All flight attendants were helpful and polite. The seats are more comfortable with wider space than other domestic flight within Thailand.

### "Excellent service"
Udon Thani to Bangkok. Excellent service at a very fair price I always chose Thai Smile for my domestic flights and highly recommend. Baggage allowance included, not like some other airlines.

### "manage very bad for me"
Bangkok to Khon kaen. I booked flight to kkc WE044 on 1 apr dep 13:35 This time I selected seat no 55C but this flight has been canceled. But I have new flight WE042 same day dep on 11:05 I changed seat and selected seat again seat no 39A, but when I checked in my boarding pass seat no 57K. If I selected already but the airline change my seat not fair. It’s very far from exit doors - if the airline need to change must change seat better than I have right. I understand airline seat management by omitting 1 seat in the current situation. But when I booked seat 39A the seat 39B and C still available I must sit on my seat but you manage very bad for me.

### "gets better and better"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. I have been flying with Thai Smile for 5 years. The service always improves and it gets better and better. Moreover, the cabin crew are helpful, friendly, warm and industrious to deliver a passenger professionally. The food usually changes, which depends on the period of time you fly as well. The meal is free of charge that means all class passengers (even if you fly in economy, you will get food onboard). A passenger who books in Smile Plus (Premium economy) can access Royal Orchid Lounge from Thai Airways for free. I would definitely recommend this airline to anyone. Thai Smile Airways is a subsidiary of Thai Airways, so the quality of service and food quite similar but I think Thai Smile is better than the mother company.

### "cabin is very clean"
Bangkok to Hatyai. Customer-friendly service, Excellent, the cabin is very clean, the cabin crew were nice and friendly. The snack is very good! I felt safe flying Thai Smile Airways during the COVID19 period.

### "Enjoyed the trip"
Not Verified | Bangkok to Khonkaen. Enjoyed the trip. The staff provided hand soap gel and announce that they did clean the plane before we were on board. Snack and tea were good also.

### "attendants were nice and relaxed"
Bangkok to Krabi. Nice plane. With tv show and ok food. Drinks are good and it's comfortable for 1-hour travel. The flight attendants were nice and relaxed. The price of travel is good.

### "I strongly recommend"
Bangkok to Ahmedabad. Thai Smile Airlines is best Airlines I had flew. Very good ground staff,  good crew members, neat and clean aircraft, toilets clean. Very good food, I booked fruits platter and I surprised to get many kind of fresh fruits and very delicious. Another good part they allow 30 kg for check in luggage and 7 kg cabin luggage it's really very good thing for all travellers. Just my request to provide good quality of Scotch whisky on board. Otherwise each and every thing is excellent. I strongly recommend to fly with Thai Smile.

### "a magnificent journey"
Bangkok to Siem Reap. It was a magnificent journey aboard Thai Smile Airways. I already get breakfast on 1 hour flight. Flight attendants were friendly and kind. After this experience you will love aircraft, airline and Thailand.

### "Very nice flight"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Phnom Penh. Very nice flight early in the day. It was a short flight but they still provided a tasty hot chicken curry and noodles snack. I also appeciated the flight attendant at the cabin door with a hand sanitizer dispenser. Bags arrived quickly on arrival. I will fly again with Thai Smile Airways.

### "efficient and friendly staff"
Not Verified | Khon Kaen to Bangkok. The low-cost arm of Thai Airways International. 20kg baggage, free seat selection and in-flight meal included in the ticket price. No annoying add-ons. Very efficient and friendly staff from the check-in to the flight and cabin crew. Aircraft cabins clean, bright and airy. Seat comfort average for short flights.

### "Nothing to complain about"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Chiang Mai. As ordinary as any other flight, no delay, no problems. Nothing to complain about. Snack on board was not good this time (sandwich liked), pastry preferred.

### "Good value for the price"
Bangkok to Narathiwat. It was a pleasant fight. Good value for the price paid which included 20kg free allowance for checked-in baggage and complimentary meal in flight. Flight time was ideal in the day.

### "Excellent service"
Bangkok to Ubon. Excellent service both from airport staff and cabin crew. Flight was very smooth and right on time. Food was lovely and plenty of legroom Very reasonably priced I will fly with them again.

### "service is very good"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Air hostess service is very good. Beaming And the captain when taking the plane down The down is very soft. If having the opportunity to use the service again.

### "feel easy and comfortable"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. I've been flying with Thai Smile for the past few years for every flights in Thailand and aboard where destinations available with Thai Smile flights. The service are always prompt, the flights are always on time (if there is ever a delayed there is an option to change flight and responded very well), the snacks are decent (sometimes even get a nice treat if you fly on a spacial occasion such as Valentine or Christmas!). I always feel easy and comfortable flying with Thai Smile. Hope they will expands more destinations in the future.

### "staff were polite"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Vientiane. The trip took place in compliance with the times set by the timetable. The check-in service was smooth and the staff were polite. On board the trip was quite comfortable and the hostesses were available and present for every passenger request. Upon arrival, the outflow from the aircraft was quick and orderly. Planes are small aircraft for small but comfortable routes.

### "seat allocation was not customer friendly"
Khon Kaen to Bangkok with Thai Smile Airways. Check in was ok, seat allocation was not customer friendly. The aircraft was not fully booked but the passengers were allocated to sit very tightly to each other. I was sitting in the middle of 2 big men. Cabin was old. Damaged luggage, company unable to compensate after a few calls.

### "On board service friendly"
Bangkok to Khon Kaen. Only airline on the route. Mostly on time. On board service friendly & very efficient. Crew work fast to complete snack & drinks service on a 45 minute flight.

### "best short route flights"
Phuket to Bangkok. I flied with Thai Smile three times this february in Thailand. Thees flights were the best short route flights that I've had. The staff is so kind and helpful. They serve to all passengers a bottle of water and a snack. The seats are very comfortable. I will fly again with Thai Smile.

### "packings are from recycled materials"
Bangkok to Khon Kaen. Kudos to the Airline for its attempt to become green. All snack packings are from recycled materials except for bottled water which is made of recyclable PET plastic. Services from check-ins, inflight, and luggage retrieval are perfect.

### "the flight went smoothly"
Phuket to Bangkok. We checked in online, less than 24 hours before the flight, very easy, also to change seats (we had two bookings), no fees at all, and 20 kgs included. We came early to the airport, and we checked in, in less than 2 minutes. We left 20 minutes left from Phuket, mainly because passengers brought their suitcases on board, instead of checking them in. A family, two adult and two kids = 4 suitcases, maximum size, the father had to place them in different places. When we arrived in Bangkok, he jumped up as the plane stopped, to collect his suitcases. If all passengers act like this, it will be chaos. Anyway the flight went smoothly, more than enough space between the rows (i am 183 cm). We were served a roll, water and coffer/juice, included. The crew worked very fast and efficient, no thai smile though.We landed 20 minutes late in Bangkok, and had to wait another 20 minutes for our checked in bag. I must say i am surprised positively about Thai smile, and we will look for them, when we will book tickets in the future

### "crew service is excellent"
Bangkok to Khon Kaen. The flight is arrive before time. The crew service is excellent. On board entertainment is good although it is a short flight. Ground service when check in is fast and efficient.

### "best domestic airline"
Bangkok to Chiang Rai. This is the best domestic airline in Thailand which you can enjoy both an inflight drink and load your luggage up to 20 kilos. Moreover, you can select your prefered seat without extra cost. So try it like me, your travel will be happy with a smile.

### "flights proved to be smooth"
Vientiane to Krabi via Bangkok. On the flight from Vientiane to Krabi, I had only 1 hour to switch planes in Bangkok and was worried that that is not enough time. However, the flights proved to be smooth with no issues at all. Friendly, professional service and I was surprised, they even served food on these short 1 - 1.5 hour flight. Food was delicious, too. The connecting flight was delayed by 30 mins, but we were able to catch up and arrive on time.

### "always a reason to smile"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Phuket. Thai Smile is always my first choice for domestic flights within Thailand. Friendly staff, clean airplanes, mostly on time, For me always a reason to smile!

### "the entire journey was miserable"
I suggest anyone avoid Thai Smile if you're flying in a premium economy class or above. On my flight from Bangkok to Penang, the entire journey was miserable. There is no line for priority boarding as they allow economy class passengers to block the PE class passengers and travelers with children to board first. Thai Smile Airways never use a boarding bridge for this flight and making the entire boarding process a heavy mess. The seat of a PE and normal economy class is the same so if you wonder if there is any difference, the answer is no. No in flight Wifi and inflight entertainment as well. The food service is the most horrible part I have ever faced in my travel life, as I was given only 3 minutes to finish the full meal and the flight attendant insisted and took away my food while I was eating halfway. This is an absolute disgrace because I saw the attendant just want to finish the service quickly. There were still 80% journey to go! What a shame on you Thai Smile!

### "Good leg room"
Bangkok to Chang Rai. Better than European low cost airlines. Good leg room and food provided on a short distance flight. Enough space for cabin baggage and friendly approach of the staff.

### "Another delayed flight"
Udon Thani to Bangkok. Lack of communication for late / delayed flights. Another delayed flight. I had international connections. Another no notification of delayed and the ground staff could not provide an estimated time for the delay? Then a bus journey from the plane to the terminal in Bangkok to add more delays.

### "left near on 1 hour late"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Udon Thani. Would have been awesome except for the fact we left near on 1 hour late. Service was good, travel was comfortable. Travel this route every 3 weeks, tried Thai Smile for a change and was first time being late. Not a good start.

### "Usually on time"
Udon Thani to Bangkok. Very good Airline. Usually on time. Clean planes and Friendly crew. I fly 4 times a year BKK-UTH and UTH-BKK and my wife 2 times a year UTH-BKK and BKK-UTH.

### "most flights were Late"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately most flights were Late, current and in the past. On the Return flight in November 19 from Khon Kaen to Bangkok there was no bus ready to drive to the Terminal. We had to wait longer than 20 minutes. This is Not Professional. Many locals do not Check in their luggage, but bring several bags, backpacks etc. as hand luggage into the cabin, although only one hand luggage is allowed. Die to the stowage of the additional hand luggage, Boarding takes a lot longer because everyone is standing in the aisle!

### "Don't be a minute late"
Bangkok to Phnom Penh. I knew i was going to be late even though i started my way to the gate 30 min before the flight. I rushed to the fast track lane and requested to enter through as i was running out of time. Fast track guys told me to go through normal passage. I excused myself and rushed through people in que and arrived at the gate about 6 minutes before the flight. The staff told me I am late and that gates close 10 min before the flight. Going back to their counter they just told me I was late and I need to buy a new ticket and that they are not responsible for anything - at least a little sympathy would be handy. Don't be a minute late, these guys dont play around.

### "stunningly poor safety procedure on landing"
Phuket to Hong Kong with Thai Smile Airways. I had been fairly impressed with this airline in terms of punctuality, seat comfort and service. However, a stunningly poor safety procedure on landing has changed my opinion! The passengers across the aisle from me boarded with takeaway meals and drinks bought in Phuket airport, and declined the meal that was served by the flight attendants shortly after take-off. However, a few minutes before landing, one of them asked for the hot meal he had missed and this was handed to him by cabin crew. This was after the seat belt sign for landing had been turned on. He then proceeded to eat his meal during landing, the tray on his lap. His hand baggage was scattered on the floor by his feet, not under the seat in front of him. In fact, the cabin crew did not check that all passengers a) had seat belts fastened or b) hand baggage was safely stowed. This doesn't give me much confidence about the cabin crew's capabilities if there were an emergency of any kind.

### "Decent experience"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Checkin at separate counter, very fast and efficient. Premium economy ticket gives you free entrance at Thai Airways' Royal Orchid Lounge in BKK terminal A. As it is before security control, you have to leave it latest, early 40 minutes before the flight is leaving. - Late incoming airplane, so take off delayed about 40 minutes, being a delay of 15 minutes when landing in Chiang Mai. Priority boarding for premium economy customers and ROP Gold an Platinum tier holders. Product on the plane equivalent with a European continental flight business class, having a bigger pitch and leaving the middle seats of the 3-3 seating free. A purple iced tea was served as welcome drinks. After take off a lunch was served, maki rolls and Teriyaki chicken breast, a small salad and a chocolate cake. Uneventful flight and priority baggage (32kg allowance) on belt first. Decent experience. Getting 402 qualifying miles at ROP. Other Star Alliance programs doe not credit any miles. On short flights in Thailand itself a good alternative to Thai Biz class tickets, costing just a little more than half.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Thai Smile Airline, Khon Kaen to Bangkok, economy class, September 2019. Overall a very pleasant experience, better than its low-cost competitors, but the with the same competitive price. Waiting area prior to boarding with AC, coffee and snacks. Airline Crew welcoming and helpfull. Recent A 310, cabin and seats in excellent conditions. Seats with good legroom and width (more space than its low-cost competitors). Snacks and drinks offered on board. 23 kg luggage free + cabin bag. I strongly recommend Thai Smile Airways.

### "The service was minimal"
Bangkok to Phnom Penh. The plane was old. No personal TV, so zero entertainment. The service was minimal. Cabin crew rushed through everything. One cabin crew didn't even wait for me to take a sugar for my tea.

### "efficient, friendly and professional service"
Thai Smile is miles ahead of its competition in the Low Cost business model. This was my second flight experience with them and it was as enjoyable as it was the first time. Thai Smile operates an all Airbus A320-200 fleet. This flight was operated by HS-TXK an aircraft that operated it's first flight on November 15, 2013. The aircraft is named 'Ranong', one of the southern provinces of Thailand on the west coast, along the Andaman Sea. Ranking is the least populous of all the provinces of Thailand. Check-in was a breeze and the counter staff was friendly and warm. Since I did not have any check-in luggage and had filled in my API earlier, the staff member took only a few seconds to print my boarding pass and I was able to proceed through security check and immigration immediately. Thai Smile does not offer lounge access, but for the price, this is hardly anything to complain about. At the gate, boarding was efficient, but this was hardly a full flight. Departure was ahead of schedule. The crew welcomed passengers on board with a warm Sawasdee Ka and were friendly and professional. They handed out Laos Immigration forms as passengers embarked. My only beef here with Thai Smile is that they insist you switch off all mobile devices for both landing and take-off. No 'flight mode' here. The seat is quite comfortable for a short haul flight and unlike most low cost carriers offered me the option to stretch a bit. The seat pocket had a Thai Smile magazine and a promotional magazine of "One Tambon One Product", an initiative by the Royal Thai Government to promote the skills of indigenous craftspeople. The aircraft was clean and bright with the gorgeous colour of the seats. Since this was the first flight of the aircraft for the day, I think it had had a thorough scrub down before the flight. I did not get to use the on-board washroom. In spite of being a low cost carrier, Thai Smile offers a hot snack even on the short 1 hour flight to Laos. The meal arrives in environment friendly boxes, proudly proclaiming, "Thai Smile Saves The World". I wish they'd do away with the plastic cutlery though and use bio-degradable options. On this flight, they served an excellent hot Cheese Pizza bar, with a packaged orange juice and a serve of three slices of fruits, a glass of water was also served. The meal box also had a refreshing towel in it. The crew made rounds with tea and coffee. No headphones were provided on this flight and I wasn't able to locate any headphone jacks on my seat. Entertainment was screened on overhead screens and featured episodes of Laughs for Gags, which is ideal when you have no headphones. Arrival into Wattay International was on-time and the cockpit crew should be complimented for what was one of the smoothest landing I have experienced. The cabin-crew offered a warm farewell. Included in price of the ticket was 20kg of luggage, a hot meal, free seat selection and I earned 500 miles, the same that I would earn on a Thai Airways economy class flight. That reflects good value for money. With efficient, friendly and professional service and a few value add-ons better than other low cost airlines, Thai Smile is a winner for short haul low cost flying.

### "staff was nice and friendly"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani. The airplane looked new and was clean. The cabin staff was nice and friendly and for the fifty minutes journey they gave us drinks abd snacks, and there was some IFE screens also. No delay, no lost bags and the price was the same as low cost aielines.

### "no issues at all"
Udon Thani to Bangkok. I have flown Thai Smile numerous times on this route with no issues at all. The staff for this flight were friendly as always and did two soft drink/juice refills on a short 1 hour puddle jump to Bangkok. Toilets are clean and they serve coffee/tea unless its bumpy. Had an ice cream treat to go along- could have used one of their sandwiches for a mid afternoon flight though! Since they have competition with the other budget carriers, the price is reasonable. Would gladly take them anytime as they fly into the main airport instead of Don Muang.

### "a pleasant trip each way"
We have been flying the Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani route with Thai Smile Airways since 2013. Before that, the route was operated by Thai Airways, who we flew the route with from 2000 to 2012. These days Thai Smile must compete with 3 other local budget carriers. Competition is fierce. Despite that, we had a pleasant trip each way. Journey time is only 1:10, with time enough to serve drinks and a light snack. No hot beverages were on offer. Cabin crew were bright, young, well presented and friendly. Our sole complaint is the temperature of the plane when on the ground at UBP. The cabin was too hot when we boarded the UBP-BKK flight. It soon cooled down once the engines started. Otherwise, great service. Great flight. Good price.

### "Thai Smile is great choice"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. I have been flying with Thai Smile for a long time and nothing changed this time. We had a departure time change but I still enjoyed it. Great efficient service, flexible and friendly staff. if you are looking for reliable short haul service, Thai Smile is great choice. Maybe the sandwiches could be a bit bigger.

### "unpleasant late night flight"
Bangkok to Jaipur. Extremely unpleasant late night flight. Delayed about half an hour pushing back from the gate in BKK. Announcement was made that it was due to loading a “cargo item” and claimed the delay would only be ten minutes. Food looked pretty unappealing so I did not accept it. Most of the flight attendants were pleasant, except for one who was quite brusque, which is pretty uncharacteristic for a Thai airline. The seat cushions were not particularly comfortable, and even though I got an emergency exit row seat (I’m 190 cm tall and always try to get an exit row seat), there was no appreciable difference in legroom compared with a regular airline seat. Quite uncomfortable after a few hours. The absolute worst part about this flight, though, was the cabin temperature! Far too hot! I brought this to the attention of the flight attendants who promised to do something, but the heat remained oppressively high throughout the entire flight. Unable to sleep at all, ended up just spending the four-hour flight sweating in my cramped, uncomfortable Thai Smile prison. An extremely unpleasant experience. Arrived in Jaipur around 2:30 AM feeling absolutely awful. Thank you, Thai Smile! (I’d flown this same route with Thai Smile several weeks earlier, and the cabin temperature was much more reasonable.) I will go out of my way to avoid this airline in the future. Nok Air and Bangkok Airways are far superior choices if they’re available.

### "you can't earn any miles"
Bangkok to Chiang Rai. Thai Smile started as a budget offshoot of Thai Air, but has become a mess. Staff seem angry (unusual in Thailand), service was poor, food and drinks non-existent. Worst of all,  you often do not have much choice but to fly them. And for the terrible experience, you can't earn any miles. Never, ever again.

### "attendants were very friendly"
Ubon Ratchathani to Bangkok. Booked this flight a few months in advance, but was about a month in advance rescheduled to a later time (by about 90 minutes later). While I would have liked to arrive earlier on the time I booked, it had fortunately no consequences for me. The flight attendants were very friendly, however the legroom provided with Thai Smile is significantly less than LCC carriers like AirAsia & Nok Air on this leg. A complimentary snack was provided too and was quite tasty. Unfortunately due to an international departure of our specific plane, we had to deboard the jetbridge via stairs to a bus to be shipped to the domestic terminal which was rather a long ride. Luggage took another good twenty minutes too to arrive.

### "didn’t like the food on board"
Generally, I prefer to fly on Thai Airways within Thailand, this is due to the fact that they use larger aircraft (widebodies) even on domestic routes. I flew Thai Airways up to Chiang Mai, but due to schedule requirements I needed the first flight to Bangkok so I chose Thai Smile who are fully owned by Thai Airways, but operated with a different style. At check in, there was no exact sign showing where to check in if you’re star alliance gold, but they still checked me in using the business class counter, and very kindly gave me a full row to myself. The lounge opens at 5 am and the flight departs at 6:15. I arrived at 4:50am and was told to wait near the reception (inside the lounge) by a janitor and a receptionist arrived and took my gold card and boarding pass. Do note that only Thai Airways’ own elites have lounge access, as Thai Smile is a Star Alliance Affiliate, not full member. I was first to board the aircraft after people needing wheelchairs, and was directed to my seat. The flight was 80% full although as promised they gave me an entire row. The seat itself is identical to BA on their short haul fleet, except for the fact that the backrest is fabric and not leather. It’s comfortable enough and much better than most slimline seats. Service on this flight consisted of something very weird, one sandwich was full of meat and no vegetables, whereas the other one was mixed veg with mayonnaise. I didn’t like the food on board, but I already ate in the lounge. I definitely feel sorry for the 120+ other passengers on the flight. They do come around with a drinks cart, and I asked for Coke Zero and they gave me a can, whereas they normally just pour it from a large bottle. One thing Thai Smile does well is the packaging in which the food comes in, it’s very chic and practical after the flight, appealing to millennials. I find that the flight attendants on Thai Smile are in the beginning of their careers and the airline itself is very age-selective, so the crew may not be as experienced as Thai Airways or other companies. Nevertheless they will absolutely serve you with a “Thai Smile” pun intended. With a smooth arrival and an actual gate (normally they use air stairs) it was gate to kerb in 10 minutes including a bathroom break. Overall, Thai smile works as an airline, and their route network is quite large regionally and I think they are comparable to airlines like Silkair or JetBlue in the US. I would still avoid them unless Thai airways doesnt fly to the particular destination I need to get to.

### "Absolutely appalling service"
Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai via Bangkok. Absolutely appalling service. Flight way delayed for somewhat reason and I had to miss my connecting. Not only did Thai didn’t want to put me on another available flight, they forced me to accept a midnight flight and wait for 12 hours for it. I was put in what I believe to be a motel with dripping water sound, cockroaches and disgusting sheets. After 2 hours I asked to be sent back to the airport. Thai Smile did not offer to provide any form of compensation for their mistakes and just simply force you to take whatever they think it’s sufficient.

### "worst customer service"
Bangkok to Mumbai. One of the worst customer service encountered. I left a small baggage onboard the flight and I called to ask if I could get the baggage from the airport I arrived in. They said yes and I went there to collect it and it was not there. Umpteen calls and they told me that it was now in Bangkok Airport. I contact them to get more information on it and up till now I still cant get my baggage. I called contact centre and they refer me to customer service, who hung up on me when I proposed that someone or another manager could help out in resolving this issue.

### "I wish to show my gratitude"
I flew from Penang to Bangkok on 26 sept 2018 for a golf trip. Upon arrival at Bangkok airport I realised that I have lost my wallet on the plane. My tour leader quickly helped me to contact Thai airways office for lost and found to locate my wallet. With the help of Thai airways Malaysia KLIA office, we managed and found my wallet and I collected my wallet at the Thai airways lost and found office. I wish to show my gratitude to Thai Airways staff for quick recovery of my wallet, their efficiency and honesty. Thank you Thai Airways.

### "seriously fool their customers"
Bangkok to Yangon. I booked my flight via Thai Airways Website and received a Thai Airways ticket and flight number. As I took this flight already several times (back then operated by Thai airways itself) I did not check about the flight operator. I only found out that the flight will be operated by Thai Smile, when the check-in agent at Vienna airport told me, she cannot check through my luggage from Bangkok to the final destination Yangon. So, I took my luggage into the cabin on the long haul flight to avoid the immigration procedures at BKK airport for collection and checkin of my luggage again at Bangkok Airport. After my arrival in Bangkok I found out that Thai Smile Airways has got no Transfer counter. Worse than that, its mother company Thai Airways also rejected to issue me a boarding pass, even though, the ticket was bought from Thai Airways. This ment I had to clear immigration and customs in Bangkok, approach the Thai Smile (better Thai Cry) checkin counter, queue up for 30 minutes, get the boarding pass, do security check again, go through immigration again which took altogether one and a half hours. Luckily I had three hours connection time, so I finally made it to my flight to Yangon. No Star Alliance benefits, even though I had a Ticket bought from Thai Airways. Great Job, Thai, and Thai Cry Airways! Your going to lose plenty of customers to the competition. My flight back (Yangon to BKK) is with Myanmar National Airlines. Brand new aircraft and I check through my luggage the entire way via BKK to Vienna without any issues. Never again Thai Cry Airways- I'll also think twice before booking Thai Airways in the future, as they seriously fool their customers and refuse to support them at BKK airport.

### "attempted to change my flight"
I have flown Thai Smile many times and have had a generally positive experience until today. I had a flight booked for the 6PM flight on Thai Smile from Bangkok to Ubon and attempted to change my flight to get back to Ubon on the earlier 2PM flight. I knew there might be a small rebooking fee. But I didn't realize how ridiculous Thai Smile's policy really was on changing your flight. Thai Smile wanted to charge me the full last minute ticket price. I am extremely disappointed in Thai Smile and will think twice before considering using them again.

### "his return flight cancelled"
Bangkok to Udon Thani. My whole family flew from Bangkok to Udon Thani on separate flights. My eldest son had his return flight cancelled (with no notice to him) and put him on a later flight. As he had a connecting flight to Vietnam he was forced to cut short his holiday one day and the cost of a hotel one night so he could connect his flight. If not for his travel agent trying to assist he would have been very stressed. My other son (whose wedding we all flew over to see) also had his return flight with Thai Smiles cancelled with no notice given to him or his wife - who were on separate bookings. Because they were planning a honeymoon in Koh Samui they also had connecting flight in Bangkok. Thai Smiles were rude, unhelpful and very disrespectful to them. They went to Udon Thani airport many times to try and get a connecting flight or get Thai Smiles to get them on a later flight from Bangkok. They were not interested in helping in any way. My son then had the cost of a night in Bangkok and had to purchase another ticket to Koh Samui. Very disgusted with Thai Smiles - they tried very hard to ruin our family holiday. Wonder how many people were affected with the early morning flights cancelled without notification to anyone, and also no help in any way to get connecting flights. My son's wedding should not have had all this stress and holidays shortened and have to pay extra for flights they had already paid for.

### "better food than on Thai"
A branch of Thai Airways. Unfortunately no web check-in was available, and therefore a long line at Airport. They do not accept Star Alliance status and privileges, which is very weird. On the other hand, much more pleasant ground and flying attendants, better food than on Thai, a larger choice of drinks, and a brand new aircraft.

### "Small snack and drink included"
Flew Thai Smile Airways. Saturday morning equates to many people wishing to leave Chiang Mai to Bangkok and beyond, including my own flight. Check-in a little chaotic but well managed with a number of staff on hand to deal with issues as they arose. No impact on departure which was 10 minutes ahead of schedule, as was arrival BKK. Small snack and drink included within price. Overall service rather let down by a lengthy bus journey from the plane to terminal and tardy delivery of bags, not an issue for me.

### "flight is such good value"
Bangkok to Phuket. The price of this flight was excellen , so my expectations weren’t too high. The aircraft was spotless, seats comfortable. I managed to have a spare seat in the middle, was happy I didn’t book their premium economy product the only difference being you get the middle seat free and an upgraded meal service, but on such a short flight it seems wasted. We were served a bottle of water and a dire chicken sandwich (which I felt unnecessary for a flight of such short duration). The all female crew I thought were quite aggressive in their manner, but when your flight is such good value this is a small grumble.

### "broker is charging additional fee"
I want to warn travelers who are buying ticket via one of the search engines like Gotogate, Tripsta, Budgetair that by doing this according to the airline you incapacitate yourself so any further changes can be make only via your broker. I made change on their web site (which was not blocked), paid for it by my CC  and nothing happen. They took the money and did not make change directing me to the broker I bought flight. Than I found out that the broker is charging additional fee ($100) for the change so you pay twice for the service accomplished by yourself on their web site. I have lost more than $300. Contact with customer service is pointless, they simply stop responding. Flight from Bangkok to Phuket was OK, on time and without issues.

### "made it to the flight just in time"
As a STAR status member I booked the flight with the Thai Website and under a TG flight number. On the confirmation I read that the flight will be operated by Thai Smile, a subsidiary Airline of Thai Airways. We booked the longhaul flight with Finnair and we had a 4 hr stopover at BKK Airport. We asked the Finnair check-in agent at Heathrow Airport to check-in the bags on to Luang Prabang, which she did. We arrived at BKK Airport where we were met by an Airline representative, who told us that our bags could not be checked through to Luang Prabang and this was a mistake by the agent in London. We were asked to clear immigration, claim our bags, checkin our bags with Thai Smile and clear immigration again, as Thai Smile doesn't have an interline agreement with Finnair. (They only have one with Thai Airways) Everyone who has passed through BKK Airport knows that this can take more than a 2 hours. Our bags of course didn't arrive on the Finnair flight luggage conveyer belt. We asked the ground staff to locate our bags, which of course took ages again. Presumably they had been sent to the LPQ flight after all! In the end we made it to the flight just in time. The meal on this flight consisted of a juice and some sort of wrap. The staff appeared to be very young. Not to mention that the flight was nearly empty (20 passengers or so) and you don't get any miles or lounge Access although it cost GBP 140. Never again.

### "I do not like Thai Smile"
I flew from Bangkok to Phnom Penh with Thai Smile. I am a citizen of Kazakhstan and I am required to pay 2000 Thai Bhat (around 60 USD) for Thai Visa on Arrival if I want to enter Thailand. However, I arrived with Air Astana flight from Astana to Bangkok Suvarnubhumi airport without baggage (I had only hand luggage with me). Then in the international zone I approached the Thai Smile desk and I told them that I want to transit to Phnom Penh. Since the Thai Smile does not allow online check-in for international flights, I kindly asked the transfer desk to issue me a boarding pass. They refused me. They told me that I had to get Thai Visa On Arrival before I can get my boarding pass in the airport's departure zones. Again, I kindly explained that I did not have any luggage and, thus, I would appreciate if they allowed me to get boarding passes. Again, they refused. Then I had to spend 2 more hours going through Thai Passport Control and Customs and I paid 60 USD for Thai Visa on Arrival which I did not need since I left right away to Cambodia! I do not like Thai Smile Airways!

### "a decent airline"
Flew Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Flying the first time Thai Smile and liking in general the product. They sell a Premium Economy product on the three first rows, where the middle seat is blocked, you have priority boarding and 30kg priority baggage, lounge access as well the possibility to reserve your preferred seat. During the 1 hour flight a three course (starter, cold main and desert). So actually you get what European airlines sell as Biz class. Only set back is that they do not accept Star Alliance Cards even though when booked on a TG number. In the rest a decent airline, about 35% less expensive than it's mother Thai Airways.

### "disappointed flying with Thai Smile"
Bangkok to Vientiane. I have been very disappointed flying with Thai Smile. I am Star Alliance Gold member (Senator 2 stars) since more than a decade and I have been surprised when I was told (at the check in desk) that I had to move from Thai Airways Gold check in to Thai Smile Economy desk, losing significant waiting time at checking which was not expected - I had then to rush to the boarding gate. Up to very recently, the line Bangkok to Vientiane was operated by Thai Airways (I travel on this segment very often), with all advantages offered for star alliance gold members. Now, for approx the same price, you travel on a kind of "low cost" company. In addition, I booked on the Thai website, and there is nowhere a clear statement that you do not book a Thai airways flight (the flight code remains TH). If this had appeared I would have flown Bangkok Airways instead which is from far a better company than Thai Smile. I consider this practice very unfair and damaging for the image of Thai Airways as member of Star Alliance.

### "please review your bag transfer"
Kuala Lumpur to Khon Kaen via Bangkok. I checked in KLIA and counter staff issued me two boarding passes, one to Bangkok and another for Khon Kaen. To be sure I asked how will my luggage arrangements be, it was confirmed that it is checked in all the way to KKC. I also received the luggage tag for it KKC. However to my disappointment upon arrival in Khon Kaen at 2pm, my luggage was not there. Lodge a complaint & finally got my bag before 9pm. Thai Smile, please review your bag transfer.

### "I was denied lounge entrance"
Bangkok to Penang. As Star Alliance Gold having bought my ticket online from the Thai Airways site, I expected to have lounge access that I usually get when flying on Star Alliance flights. But when I went to the Thai Airways lounge (in the Gate E area) at Suvarnabhumi Airport, I was denied entrance, because Thai Smile is not a Star Alliance member. I received the same refusal when I tried the EVA Air lounge. When we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (at a bus gate, departing about 30 minutes late), I noticed that the Thai Airways logo is printed on the side of the planes (in addition to the name Thai Smile). I thought other readers might want to be aware of this issue when making their plans. Advantages: there were lots of empty seats on the flight, so I had a row to myself. Food (a snack only, of course this is a short route) was OK but undistinguished. The price was not nearly as low as other budget airlines (I had chosen Thai Smile precisely because of its Star Alliance status--I thought!). This airline might be a good choice for leisure travelers (if they can get a better price than I did; this was a last-minute trip) as the cabin service was fine and the flights leave from Suvarnabhumi, not the understaffed Don Mueang airport (which is another reason I chose it). But for a business travelers in my situation, it was not.

### "will only allow 40 kg"
Penang to Bangkok. Thai Smile does not offer larger seats on their premium economy class, and do not accept the same luggage allowance as Thai Airways. If you are allowed 50 kg on Thai Air, Thai Smile will only allow 40 kg. When checking in, it has happened a few times that I am told they have not received payment from Thai Air, so checking in is always interesting. In the air you may experience that cabin crew does not speak English and today they had not ordered enough food, so they could not offer me any. Thai Smile are a subsidiary of a Star Alliance member, but you do not get benefits such as points, lounge access, etc.

### "Cabin crew were brilliant"
Flew with two relatives for a couple of days in Chiang Mai, from Bangkok. Thai Smile are an absolute joy to fly. They might be the low cost branch of Thai Air but there is nothing cut price about their service. Online check in with free choice of seats, 20 kilo baggage allowance. We ended up checking four bags in even though there was only three of us without any problem at all. The seats were comfortable with plenty leg room. Flights took off on time. Return leg landed a little behind schedule but that was down to air trafficcontrol in Bangkok. Cabin crew were brilliant. Happy and living up to the brand name, smiling throughout. Sandwich provided, which is something a well known high price British airline is unable or unwilling to provide these days. Will have no hesitation in booking Thai Smiles again.

### "Crew very professional and pleasant"
Flew Bangkok to Khon Kean from Thai Smile Airways. Seamless service from check-in to leaving at the end of the flight. Cannot really fault them and I am quite critical at times as I expect the service I paid. Booked through Thai Airways site as it was a little bit cheaper. Used web check-in to avoid the queue. Boarding by bus. Seat pitch was adequate for a budget airline unlike AirAsia. A snack was provided. Crew very professional and pleasant. An enjoyable flight. Would definitely fly this airline even if it meant paying more.

### "I missed my connecting flight "
Due to this airline I missed my connecting flight back home. Staff members lied as to departure and I was told that I would be reimbursed for travel expenses. Once I got to my destination I was greeted by a staff member and told that my tickets for connecting flight were paid for and booked. I was told to go print my boarding pass and check in. Once I got the check in line, I was informed that staff member lied to me and I had to pay an absorbent amount to get home. The rep from the airline was nowhere to be found. Awful experience and will never  recommend this airline.

### "food and drink was good"
Phuket to Bangkok. Check in staff very polite and courteous explaining small details. Had to wait in line for short time as the gate changed from direct boarding to a bus service. Onboard food and drink was good for a budget short domestic route. The only complaint was that I had to wait over 40 minutes for the bags to arrive upon landing at Bangkok.

### "Recommend this airline"
Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Phuket. On time departure and clean aircraft. Friendly crew, seats were good in terms of seating and comfort. The only downside was that it took very long for the bags to arrive on the belt. Flight time was about 1 hour and 30mins. Recommend this airline for internal flights.

### "Bring back Bangkok Airways"
Bangkok to Udon Thani. Why no interline baggage? I flew from Hong Kong to Bangkok on Thai Airways, why is it so difficult to transfer baggage to wholly owned subsidiary Thai Smile Also. I was refused entry to Domestic Thai Lounge, even with Star Alliance Gold card. This approach does not encourage customer loyalty. I note that Thai Smile staff still wear Thai Airways uniforms, hardly "Uniform quality of service". If there was a choice out of BKK I would use the alternative. Bring back Bangkok Airways!

### "inflight magazine was still the February issue"
A business trip from Bangkok to Phuket on 01/03/1 with Thai Smile. The internet check in does help expedite the process despite the fact that I had luggage. Boarding is fine but again confusion about seat allocations could arise since they are announced as crew/announcer-centred, i.e., A/B/C on the right and H/J/K on the left. It should rather be passenger-centred. Despite it being March the inflight magazine was still the February issue. The tuna sandwich snack was fine and the snack packet was mostly paper-based and should be praised for being environmentally friendly.

### "baggage claim slow service"
Penang to Bangkok with Thai Smile Airways for my visit to Thailand. Check in counter service poor and very slow. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Baggage claim slow service, however, inflight service is very good.

### "up to my expectations"
Bangkok to Narathiwat return for a business trip . Both flights are fine and routine. Snacks were served and tasted fine. Cabin crew were pleasant and professional. All were up to my expectations.

### "same menu on both flights"
Bangkok to Chiang Rai return domestic flight. Our reservations were made using Thai Airways code-share flight numbers. The internet check-in helped us expedite the process but does not work at Chiang Rai. Despite internet check-in boarding passes obtained we were told to go through the queue like standard check-in passengers. After discussion with the staff we were told that such internet check-in is not available at Chiang Rai. So what's the point of having internet check-in? One of my travelling companions who is the premium (above Gold level) Star Alliance member cannot use the lounge facilities at both airports despite that we purchased the Thai Airways (not Thai Smile) code tickets. We were told that Thai Smile is not a Star Alliance member so the lounge is not accessible. Because of the holiday season, fruit cakes from the Bangkok's elite "After You Café" were served on both outbound and inbound flights. They taste good but I encountered the same menu on both flights out and inbound.

### "the service was impeccable"
Siem Reap to Bangkok. Thai Smile is a wonderful airline and one that many other airlines should learn from. The crew were very professional and friendly. The service was impeccable, especially for such a short flight (less than 40 mins). We were given an excellent meal served in a fabric wrapped box (it was like opening a Christmas present). There were overhead TV screens displayed showing the American TV series "Just for Laughs". Upon disembarkation the captain was standing by the cockpit saying goodbye. I was very impressed with this excellent airline. Can't believe it's meant to be low-cost. It had higher standards than its parent company Thai Airways!

### "seat comfortable, snack was good "
Back from my business on a return flight Khon Kaen to Bangkok on 2nd December 2016. The internet check-in does expedite the process with my luggage checked. I don't think that I heard about instructions for those seated in the emergency exit rows as mentioned in my review about outbound flight. But to be fair, since I was in business class it is possible that instructions may be given at the seats. The seat is comfortable. The snack was good despite that my choice was not available because I was the last one to be served. The rest are fine.

### "up to the standard"
BKK-KKC flight via WE048 on 30/11/16. The boarding procedures are near perfect with a few suggestions to improve the services. The boarding announcement is crisp and clear both in Thai and English. It also includes instructions for those seated in the emergency exit rows (something that I've never heard of on Thai Airways). Small confusion could arise since the announcement refers to the seats A/B/C as on the right hand side when in fact they are on the left side. Again, this confusion happens to the H/J/K serts as well when they are announced as on the left when in fact they are on the right side of the aircraft. This happens because the crew refers to her position when announcing. This kind of references makes no sense when most passengers are seated. Please consider. The snack and services are up to the standard.

### "absolutely terrible experience"
Absolutely terrible experience Phuket to Bangkok. Thai Smile changed the schedule all of the sudden and informed me that my flight will take off 4 hours later, which screwed my connection flight from BKK. They offered a refund which is not enough to purchase another ticket on that date because the prices gone up since I bought my ticket. Refused to change my flight to an earlier Thai Airways (which owns Thai Smile) on that day, instead suggested I pay 100USD extra to change it myself. I now have to fly 1 day earlier, cut my holidays 1 day shorter, loosing 1 night paid at the hotel in Phuket plus paying extra for 1 night in BKK.

### "a very good experience"
Short flight from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, but first flight with Thai Smile Airways. A budget airline but with the advantage of hold allowance of 20kg. Bording at CNX was quick and orderly. Comfortable seats for a short flight (using old Thai Airways aircraft). Flight included a snack, passable but not pleasant. It was good to have a free drink of water during the flight. Arrival at BKK was good. Overall a very good experience on a budget flight and would use again. Another advantage is that Smile fly to Suvarnbhumi airport rather than Don Muang used by many other budget airlines. It is then possible to catch the Skytrain link into the city centre.

### "food surprisingly good"
Two very pleasant flights Bangkok to Penang return with Thai Smile Airways. Good service, smiles from cabin attendants, food surprisingly good for low cost flights, seat pitch adequate, flights on-time. However, two big minuses which I hope Thai Smile can rectify - I travelled Manila to Bangkok with Philippine Airlines (PAL) but found there is no luggage transfer facility between PAL and Thai Smile at Bangkok. This is despite the fact that Thai International (the parent of Thai Smile) does have a luggage transfer service in Bangkok as Thai International also flies from Manila (but are more expensive than PAL). I was told to go to the transfer desk at Bangkok where the inconvenience would be resolved. There are two transfer areas at Bangkok but Thai Smile only has a desk at one. So if you arrive near one area and it there is no desk, there is a 800m walk to the other. As Thai International is at both, why not Thai Smile? In the event, I had to go land side, immigration, luggage pick-up, queue at Thai Smile check-in.

### "great for a short time flight"
Phuket to Bangkok Don Mueang. Thai Smile makes you feel as you fly Thai Airways but in low cost version without lose the know how of quality service. Younger cabin staff, nice orange uniforms and more smiles for sure. Anyway they must improve, the priority baggage service and special counter (at least at Phuket Airport) as the Plus counter is always occupied by groups. I checked in after 35 minutes. My flight was nice, seats ok for premium and landed on time. Meal classic Thai Airways style in other words great for a short time flight.

### "crew were simply amazing"
Boarded the flight from Hat Yai to Bangkok with Thai Smile Airways. The crew were simply amazing. The flight attendants were demonstrating the safety procedures with a Thai like dance. As its a small aircraft there was little leg space for a tall passenger like me. But because there was no passenger next to me it helps to stretch my legs. Unfortunately I did not book a special meal but the crew went to find some food for me which I appreciated. The dessert was delicious.

### "food was cold, But fresh"
Flew Bangkok Suvarnabhumi - Chiang Mai in Business class with Thai Smile. The price of this ticket was approx. the same as a Thai Airways Economy class flight. I paid 500 Baht to upgrade to Business class, and cabin was 90% full. The Thai Airways lounge is pretty worn, but still has its ambience. Boarding was chaotic, with no Business class priority line. One thing about the seat, it's still very hard, unlike other airlines that have cushioning. No middle table separator as advertised and seen on other aircraft (Avoid HS-TXE/TXN) and I used the middle seat as storage for my laptop bag. Food was cold, But fresh. It tasted like an economy class meal, and there was only Coffee, Tea, Soft drinks and water, no beer. Deplaning less chaotic with baggage delivery within minutes. For the price paid, I would say it is just "Premium Economy" service.

### "aircraft new and very clean"
Bangkok to Chaing Rai. Feel good with the journeys. Check in fine, agent at Chiang Rai out perform their Bangkok counterpart in term of problem solving. On time departure and arrival. The aircraft for both flights are new and very clean. My seat in the last row is a little cramp and does not recline, catering service for the meal time flights were recently upgraded from cold bakery items to hot savory snack, in our case, some kind of tasty Pizza Roll. Flights between mealtimes get somewhat cold and bland sandwiches. Drinks service also upgraded from bottled water to include soft drink, tea and coffee.

### "cannot sit in the exit row"
Chiang Rai to Bangkok. Boarding very efficient, smiles and usual politeness. Catering out of BKK gives you a warm, delicious wrap, while the return trip a cold Danish tasting like frozen butter. Deplaning efficient and professional, but one thing: Why without a seat reservation, can I not sit in the exit row!? I am 5'9' and fit into the seat perfectly. Entertainment better than other airlines (TV shows) and usual magazines in Thai and English.

### "smooth and efficient"
Short flight on Thai Smile Airways from Chiang Mai to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. The ticket price was really cheap but quality more than low cost carrier. The ground stafs and the cabin crew were nice, extremely helpful and polite. From the check-in until post flight, the process was smooth and efficient. The flight was on-time. During one-hour flight they provided snacks and beverages for passengers.

### "an excellent choice"
BKK-KBV return on A320. Both flights were on time. Originally my flights were with Bangkok Airways but because of "technical reasons" the flights were operated by Thai Smile Airways. The aircrafts were new, the young FA's very helpful and always with a smile on their face. Food was ok, a light snack with coffee or juice, which was ok for a short one hour domestic flight. Even though one of my checked bags did not arrive with my flight, the airline sent it to my hotel four hours later, which was very nice. After my experience, I can say Thai Smile is an excellent choice for the regional flights in Thailand.

### "good service onboard"
Very good service onboard from very nice Thai Smile Airways FA's. Shortly after take off on this short 50 minute flight was served a free snack and water, coffee and orange juice. Aircraft was very clean and new, only a 50% load factor so had 3 seats to stretch out. Definitely would recommend this airline for the cheap fares - it only cost me approx GBP33.

### Thai Smile Airways customer review
The ground staff at Chiang Mai Airport was polite and managed the check in procedure quickly and without any hassles. Boarding the aircraft you were greeted by the flight attendants with a smile, who were helpful and did their job in a polite and professional way. The flight itself was on time and uneventful. Shortly after take off you were served a snack and water. The aircraft was tidy and clean with standard seat configuration (3-3). The seats were a little bit cramped due to a quite narrow seat pitch but for a short flight (about 55 minutes) it was yet sufficient. In fact there was nothing to complain about the flight itself. In my opinion you get value for money as the (mostly reasonable) ticket price is all inclusive. Which means you get a free 20 kg baggage allowance, free seat selection, a free snack and beverage as mentioned above and also don't even get charged extra when paying by credit card. And this is a bliss compared to other so called budget airlines in the region which tend to be very inventive and eager to squeeze the unwary passenger as much as possible by creating various extra fees. Nevertheles near the end of Thai Smile's Internet booking procedure you should check if you really need a travel insurance that seems to be added automatically but can be deselected without problem. But apart from that you are not confronted with extra charges. Last but not least it is also worth mentioning that Thai Smile operates the majority of its flight to/from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport which offers far better transport options onward to the city (and other destinations) than Bangkok Don Muang Airport. If you plan to travel inside Thailand you should consider giving Thai Smile a try.
