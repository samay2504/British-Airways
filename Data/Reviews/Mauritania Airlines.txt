### "hard product is pretty new"
Nouakchott to Dakar. The new Nouakchott airport is about 30 min from the city and opened only 2 years ago. Pretty efficient airport, not crowded and only 7 gates. The lounge was surprisingly good! English spoken, fast WiFi and a decent selection of food and beverages (Mauritania is a dry country). The plane was less then a year old but very poor maintained. The whole seating arrangement was mixed up. Seat itself was old and relatively clean. No welcome drink, amenities or In-Flight magazine. Hot meal was served on a 40 min flight. Only coffee was served, no other options. The toilet had no soap nor towels. Many passengers eat their meal with bare hands. Crew was friendly but didnâ€™t speak English. Not flag carrier worthy airline, but for African standards pretty cheap and the hard product is pretty new. Service in business class to Easyjet economy.

### "never been on such dirty planes "
Freetown to Dakar via Conakry. My second time flying this airline, and both times a similar experience: filthy planes, terrible food, but very punctual departures. I have never been on such dirty planes - it would appear that they are rarely cleaned, even when flying from their homebase. Seats generally don't recline - most of the buttons no longer work. The food generally consists of a variety of dry bread-like items, and are best avoided. I think it is the only airline where crew don't have a uniform - rather they seem to purchase their own, similar-coloured clothing. However, all flights depart and land on time - a rarity in West Africa.
