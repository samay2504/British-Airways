### "best low-cost airline I have used"
StarFlyer is by far the best low-cost airline I have used anywhere. Price was low, about half of what Shinkansen bullet train would have been, and included luggage. On board the plane you have stylish leather seats with IFE and good legroom. Drinks are also included in the price and flight attendants made sure everything is ok and in general were very friendly. Ryanair and Easyjet should learn from them, in fact StarFlyer is better than many full service airlines

### "extremely friendly and quick"
We flew the wonderful StarFlyer aircraft from Kansai to Tokyo Haneda. The check-in staff was extremely friendly and quick and their security line had nobody in it. The boarding was speedy we timed it and we got on and took off within 25 minutes. We were dissatisfied by the fact that we could not redeem United miles as the airline is partly owned by ANA. overall the flight was above and beyond.

Cabin was clean. Personal screen was big enough and a lot of entertainment programs were available. Seat was very comfortable. My personal area was spacious. Tully's Coffee was offered with tasty chocolate. Flight attendants provided quick and responsive service. Everything was excellent!

### StarFlyer customer review
Tokyo-Osaka-Tokyo. Starflyer has the best cost/performance ratio of the market: very comfortable leather seat in A320. Easy to get emergency exit at check in when requested but still at least 34 inch legroom. Drink service PTV footrest for 1 hour flight and professional attendants. At a unbeatable rate when booking a bit in advance (even less than the Shinkansen). The only drawbacks are the lack of frequency for Osaka comparing to JL or NH still OK with 6 flights per day.

KIX-HND : a stylish airline. Cabin staff service efficient. Cabin which is coordinated in white and black elegant and personal monitor is easy to use. Seats are made of black leather and seat pitch is enough.

### StarFlyer customer review
This airline has impressive cabin staff and a very efficient ground staff - never need check in more than 20 minutes before my flight even in Tokyo.
