### "no staff, no explanation"
Not Verified |  Flight SA 1779, scheduled to leave Johannesburg to Gaborone at 18.40, on Sunday 8 December 2019. All of a sudden, the  departures boards show 20.25 departure. No explanation given. Okay, I thought, I will wait. It is now 20.40, we are still waiting at Gate A28, there is no staff, no explanation, no bus ... nothing! We have just been left at the gate, I am not sure if SA Express wants us to guess if we will leave or sleep at Gate A28! Why this kind of treatment?

### "upset and disappointed"
Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. After a 22hr flight back to SA, just wanting to go home, I was told my flight has been cancelled - didn't even get any notification about this. I am deeply upset and disappointed.

### "customer service is no existent"
Not Verified |  This morning the 06h00 flight from Cape Town to Bloemfontein was cancelled due to aircraft issues. The airline knew this was a possibility yesterday already and did not take steps to ensure that passengers were notified and rebooked on Mango at 09h30. When arriving at the check in counter 109, passengers are sent to SA Airways reservations. You are then informed that SAA no longer does the rebooking for SA Express. Thereafter you are sent to flight control at counter 30. From there you are sent to Mango at counter 101. After walking from one end of the terminal building to the other, you are then asked to come back at 07h00 as the SA Express office in Bloemfontein needs to change the booking to Mango but they only open at 06h00. Surely this should have been anticipated and planned for yesterday evening for the latest! Emailing customers services is of no use as the only response is the automatic email reply with a case number. Don't bother emailing the customer services manager as he just doesn't bother replying. My advice to anyone who wishes to use this airline .... book on an alternate airline as SA Express really is unreliable and their customer service is no existent.

### "given no information, reason, apologies"
Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. My original flight was booked for 15:30. Arrive at the airport to be told that flight has been canceled, you are now on the 17:25 flight. If that was not enough of an inconvenience, that 17:25 flight is delayed till 20:50! We have been given no information, reason, apologies whatsoever. I was told by one ground staff that you don’t have enough planes that can fly so you have to “rotate“ them! Why do you sell tickets on flights that you can not provide? Shocking service SA Express. Would never fly with you if I had a choice.

### "No reason given for flight delay"
Not Verified |  Flight details changed from 15.30 to 15.00 without notification. Then to 16.30, then to 17.15 then 17.50. Huge inconvenience as had to connect to King Shaka which meant changing my connection flight to 21.25 whereas I was originally supposed to have flown to King Shaka at 18.45. SA Express is the worst airline ever. No reason given for SA Express flight delay.

### "inefficient operations"
Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. A taxi rank operates 10x more efficiently than this airline. SA1003 scheduled departure 08h00. Actual departure 09h45. SA1014 scheduled departure 16h55. Actual departure 19h30. What kind of service is this? Don't try to excuse this by telling me that flights are sometimes delayed, because in your case twice in one day is evidence of poor management and inefficient operations. I paid for convenience and what I get is camping at both airports for my departure and return.

### "at 0550 the gates were closed"
Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. My flight was due to leave at 0610 but when I got to the boarding gate at 0550 the gates were closed. I went to SA Express counter but there was no one there to assist. I was the told by the check staff that I had to purchase another ticket.

### "told to book another flight"
Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. The service i got at Bloemfontein airport was horrible, I'm not happy at all. I arrive at the airport at 9:15 and they told me i can't check in for a flight that departs at 9:40. Every time their flight gets delayed i dont complain but when i arrive at 9:15 i was told to book another flight.

### "excellent customer service"
Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. This review is more for compliment for one of your service staff at domestic departures. I had a connecting flight from CPT to Bloemfontein via JHB. I flew Mango to JHB and SAA Express to BFN. There was only 1 hour between arrival in JHB and departure to BFN. The baggage claims for Mango took way too long and l was going to miss my flight. Without my bag l ran up to the SAA express check-in counters for assistance. Staff really went over and beyond to assist me and make sure l didn’t miss my flight. He assisted to check me in and help to carry my bag from baggage claim up to the check-in counter and safely on the correct plane. All in time. Without is quick response and help l would have surely missed my flight. Well done for excellent customer service. Thank you.

### "I don’t see why they are still flying"
It was a Sunday afternoon when I got to King Shaka airport and I was flying to Port Elizabeth that evening. The flight was supposed to depart at 17.40 and land at 19.00. But instead the flight got delayed until 21.00. I’ve been flying this Durban, PE route on this airline since 2015 and most of the flights I’ve flown have always delayed by an extreme amount of hours. They give me the same excuse everytime I ask them why is there a big delay and they say technical issues with the plane. This flight that I took, they changed the time to 21.00 which meant that we were going to board at 20.30. It was 21.00 and I was still in the terminal building, we only left Durban at 21.50 and we got to Port Elizabeth at 23.00. The crew that flew us to PE came from Bloemfontein via Johannesburg. When I got to PE I saw many SA express aircrafts in PE, they also got delayed from Cape Town. Most of their planes have been sitting at OR Tambo International airport and then with all the excuses of technical issues, I question the safety of their fleet. I don’t think it’s worth flying with SA Express anymore, too many delays. The amount of delays I’ve heard from this airline I don’t see why they are still flying, if they going to provide service they must do it to the best of their ability.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
After already flying From Dubai to Johannesburg we are meant to be connecting to George, our final destination, flight was meant to depart OR Tambo at 15.50, it has been delayed to 18.30. Now we have already been waiting 5 hours for the connecting flight after already having flown 8 hours and waited 2 hours before the first flight, only to be told the reason behind the delay is a Technical Issue. They have 1 plane which is departing to another destination, after that flight arrives back from said destination they are preparing it for our journey to George. Why should the customers to George deal with utter delays because there is only 1 plane to commute to 2 different destinations due to a technical fault in one aircraft in its fleet. Already been over 15 hours journey, and all we wanted was to get home. Now my issue is a well known National airline should surely be able to make a plan to get another aircraft in to help ease the delay and help clients get to their destination. Instead we have to wait because a flight just left for another destination and will head back afterwards to take us. Having flown SA Express and booked in connection with SA Airways many times in the past, I am extremely disappointed in the service received this time around.

### "apology for the inconvenience"
12 hours before flight departure SA Express only contacted some passengers to advise of a change in flight. Despite paying double for a direct flight we were re-directed via Johannesburg and what should have been a 2 hour journey ended up taking 8 hours! The way we were treated by ground staff in Cape Town and Johannesburg was appalling and despite raising the complaint numerous times have only had a standardised response and still no apology for the inconvenience. We were offered some compensation but only for 3 of the 4 travellers and still no response on this despite it being escalated to management. Do not recommend to ever use this airline

### "carrier imposed fees"
George to Johannesburg. We book tickets for our two grandchildren twice a year. As they have to fly as unaccompanied minors, I have to make the booking through the call center. The fare indicated on the website for the specific flights was R1 182.21 per person for the return flights between Johannesburg and George. Before I gave all the traveler details, I asked the operator what I would have to pay and was informed that it would be R2364.42 per child. This excluded the R100.00 per ticket to be charged because I booked through the call center. When I called back to find out if the children had been accepted as unaccompanied minors for the flight and to make the payment, the amount was suddenly R2957.22 per child. That is 2,5 times more than when one would (and could) book on the internet! On checking the e-ticket (per child)one finds the following info: Fare calculation R697.50 x 2 = R1 395.00 rounded off to R1 400.00 plus taxes totaling R461.22 and "carrier imposed fees" R 1096.00 which brings the total to R2 957.22 per child.

### "no capacity to run to a schedule"
I am a regular traveller on the Johannesburg to Kimberley route in South Africa, doing this at least once a month for the past couple of years. There are two carriers - SA Express and SA Airlink. As far as possible I use Airlink as they run on time. However this is not always possible and today I flew with SA Express. The flight was delayed by an hour - no detailed reason was given, though "aircraft availabiity" was mentioned. As we boarded the bus for the plane an announcement was made for another SA Express flight also being delayed. If I look back on the last 10 flights I have made using SA Express, possibly one has actually been on time. They appear to have absolutely no capacity to run to a schedule (while SA Airlink on the same route achieves this almost all the time). And following any announcement by the cabin crew on the plane they use the catch phrase "SA Express, we fly for you", really! What a joke! I would not recommend them to anyone, and only fly SA Express if I have no other options, and particularly avoid them if I have meetings scheduled afterwards. Tonight's flight was an evening one, but it meant contacting both car hire and booked accommodation to ask them to wait for me - inconveniencing not just myself, but others also. There must be reasons that SA Express flights are invariably delayed - but no honest explanation is ever given, and the overall long term impression is that SA Express do not care.

### "problem with the aircraft"
Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. I fly SA Express frequently because my company books the tickets not out of choice. Today again there was a problem with the aircraft. Resulting in a smaller aircraft been used for the route. The knock on effect was 17 passengers being bumped of the flight. The supervisor at Bloemfontein admitted they have a serious problem with aircraft availability. I will avoid flying with them when possible.

### "could not use the direct flight"
SA Express has a direct flight from Harare to Durban and back. As I want to avoid transfer in Johannesburg, I am willing to pay the extra costs. SA Express however canceled the flight from Durban and therefore I could not use the direct flight from Harare to Durban but was put on a South African Airways flight via Johannesburg. This was very frustrating as I had to cancel the appointment I had (we arrived 5 hours after original scheduled time). So while I paid the premium for a direct flight I ended up spending even more time for a flight that would have saved me and my family hundreds of USD. After I finally got a case number about my query on 8 November I have never heard from SA Express.

### SA Express customer review
I am a frequent flyer and unfortunately have to fly on SA Express. I fly from PE to Durban PE to Johannesburg PE to Cape Town and Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. Including returns to PE. I don't believe that in the last 6 months there hasn't been a delay on these flights. I can honestly say that the service is of the poorest in this country. The inflight service is awful. Sitting in CT now with another 2 hour delay SA Express wastes so much of mine and others time with all their delays. I would never recommend.

### SA Express customer review
Flew SA Express CPT-DUR and previously DUR-CPT-DUR. Crew have always been excellent. They are warm and friendly right from boarding where we are always greeted by a great smile. Food is good sandwiches for dinner with chocolate for dessert. A good selection of drinks were offered. Leather seats are very comfortable but are now showing some signs of age. Love flying SA Express because their planes always seem private and warm. Baggage was on the carousel quickly from deplaning. Overall three great experiences with SAX.

### SA Express customer review
We booked a flight Port Elizabeth-Cape Town in January 2014: Unplanned landing in George because of a malfunctioning cabin door no serious help from the cabin crew. In George we were sent to the transit for the next flight from Port Elizabeth-Cape Town departing 2 hours later which was surprisingly almost empty. Because of that we missed the trip that we booked in Cape Town in the afternoon. No desk at Cape Town Airport from South African Express no answer from them after we send our complaint and no "sorry" from their side. Really disappointing.

### SA Express customer review
CPT-GRJ with SAA Air Link. Love this route serviced with a superb EMB135LR. Pre-booked seats and check in easy. Domestic side of CPT airport is a pleasant roomy building with a couple of good cafe's. Flight called on time and departed on the dot. Friendly and efficient single cabin crew member managed to get through snack/juice service in 40 minute flight even though plane was full. Impressed with her diligence to cabin safety. Captain informative during short flight pointing out way points on what was a stunning day. On time arrival and picked up bags as we walked off the plane. Great little airline.

### SA Express customer review
Round trip from OR Tambo to Richards Bay. On time departures and on time arrivals on both occasions. Comfortable seats - good service. Planes are noisy (Dash 400). Baggage arrival at Richards Bay took for ages with no explanation. Rather expensive for such a short flight. Otherwise no complaints.

### SA Express customer review
Second time on SA Express - again impressed by speed at boarding and getting away really like the feature of putting your excess hand luggage on a trolley as you board (Skycheck) and receiving it as you get off the plane. Delayed one hour due to technical issues from J'burg to East London - delays constantly communicated and mentioned onboard too. The flight was a tale of 2 hostesses - one rude obnoxious and obviously hated her job 'Could I sit on this seat - 'NO') the other friendly engaging delightful - apologizing for only having one choice of white wine available (I remain impressed of the free beverage they serve on short domestic flights). Luggage out within 5 minutes off the plane. Good journey let down by one attendant.

### SA Express customer review
Maputo to Cape Town on Friday 19 July at 09.40. As a rule I try not to take my luggage as cabin luggage to make sure there is enough space for everyone in the plane for there hand luggage. On this flight I knew I had someone waiting for me in Cape Town and would have preferred to take all my luggage on the plane. When I saw it was SA Express and a small plane I decided to check in my luggage. What a mistake. I must admit everything on the flight from weigh in to landing went very well. After landing we waited over 20 mins for luggage eventually it came out that the staff had just unloaded the plane and then left the luggage outside! Really poor performance!

### SA Express customer review
CPT to DUR on 1 April. Travelling with an elderly relative who needed wheelchair assistance. Helpful right from the check-in guy to the wheelchair assistant in Durban. On time flight - comfortable seats and pleasant food. Couldn't fault the help from the crew and landside wheelchair assistants. Much appreciated.

### SA Express customer review
Jo'berg to George return. On both flights the two stewardesses were friendly and helpful. The seat was comfortable the 'light snack' in a box far better than a lot of others I've had on larger airlines. Very fresh well filled roll chocolate bar and little biscuit plus soft drinks or coffee/tea. I'm pretty sure there were other drinks but I wasn't really paying attention! Outbound flight was a few minutes early arriving the inbound 20 minutes early! As we were all on board the pilot took off then and there - great! We were able to check in our luggage from George to LHR with no problem great bonus not having to drag it from one terminal to another at Jo'berg. Very friendly check in lady at George. Very happy with all aspects of our flights.

### SA Express customer review
CRJ700 aircraft JNB-Walvis bay. Departed and arrived on time friendly cabin crew. Cold light box meal served with drinks which was more than adequate and tasty. Captain kept passengers informed - all in all a pleasant experience.

### SA Express customer review
JNB to Richards Bay return flight on Friday 28 Sep 12. Flight was delayed by almost 30 min. No reason given. Bad weather when we arrived at Richards Bay and after two attempts to land was diverted to DUR. Landed safely in DUR with the option of flying back to JNB and then out to Richards Bay the next day or we could travel back to Richards Bay at our own cost! I was fortunate to get a vehicle after waiting an hour for one and travelled back at my own cost. Pity it is the only operator between JNB and Richards Bay!

### SA Express customer review
DUR to CPT 20 Sep. Small planes limited overhead luggage space. Seating comfortable with reasonable leg room. On time departure and arrival. Helpful and pleasant staff. Special meal ordered and available and tasty.

### SA Express customer review
JNB-HDS-JNB. Very satisfied with the experience on these very short (50min) flights operated by South African Express. Seat assignment at booking fast check-in on time departure and arrival quick baggage delivery. But what struck us was the service on board outstanding for commuter flights nowadays : pre departure orange juice adequate meal box during the flight with choice of drinks (including alcoholic) and then coffee and tea. All this for free with special meal requests observed and served by smiley and efficient crew. If I add that using the company web site is a breeze (I changed flights schedule in a few seconds) I think SAA Express is a model that American and European domestic air companies should follow.

### SA Express customer review
Johannesburg - Lubumbashi return in Economy class. Plane was B737-300. Flights on time and almost empty on outbound leg. Requested vegetarian meal and had to show ticket confirmation to get it from surprised flight purser. Meal was served cold and did not taste good. Even though it is a short trip of around 2.5 hours the ticket fare is exorbitant - more than USD 900! There is no inflight entertainment.

### SA Express customer review
Durban to Cape Town - 26 July. An hour delay due to late incoming flight. Kept informed and apologies on the ground and by captain and flight crew. Comfortable seats good leg room and pleasant snacks with good drink options. Bags arrived quickly at Cape Town.

### SA Express customer review
After 4 flights between BFN and JNB I must confess that there is no standard in the service. One flight was excellent - orange juice before the snack which was served with water and a drink. The snacks are tiny. The last flight from BFN we were told that due to the short flight time only water and juice would be served. It was the same flying time as the other flights and two cabin crew onboard. Why no consistency?

### SA Express customer review
Flew SA Express JNB-WDH. Check in was fairly quick. There is no separate line for Alliance Silver/Gold. Boarding was via bus. They boarded the bus and then made us wait 30 mins as the plane was not ready. Even though it was cold outside the bus did get stuffy. We then had to wait another 15 mins by the plane before we could board. The CRJ200 has 2-2 seating which was comfortable for the 2 hr flight. A cold breakfast box was offered which was excellent. It had cereal fruit yoghurt cold cuts cheese etc. Very substantial. Also tea/coffee and soft drinks were served. There is no IFE. Service was good and efficient. Overall very pleasant flight experience.

### SA Express customer review
Used this airline on many occasions JNB-ELS. Crew always polite and friendly aircraft clean and comfortable. Example of how a regional carrier should operate.

### SA Express customer review
DUR - Port Elizabeth return. Pilots kept us updated on weather and time en route. Food was fantastic and cabin crew really friendly. Was expecting cramped seats etc as the plane on route was a CRJ-200 but it was great. Plenty of space with seats really comfortable. Considering that the price was only R180 more than the low cost airline on this route and cheaper than the other this was great value for money with full service being provided. All in all great service and would be very happy to fly them again.

### SA Express customer review
SA Express is going fast downhill. Travellers are recommended to use other airlines as cancellations and delays seems to happen frequently after the World Cup. Just had two flights cancelled and the third delayed on 4th February 2011. Service and information also very poor.

### SA Express customer review
Durban-Port Elizabeth and Port Elizabeth-Cape town. Check in was quick. Both flights on time. Crew on both flights were professional but unfriendly.

### SA Express customer review
JNB-GRJ. The flight had a technical problem which resulted in the pax being transferred to a back-up aircraft. The delay was well handled with full and clear information being given at all times as well as good humoured and sincere apologies from the flight deck. In the end we got into George just over an hour late. Congratulations and thanks for a professional and relaxed approach to the problem.

### SA Express customer review
Jo'Burg to Gaborone to Jo'Burg. Have to say overall was very pleased with this airline. Only a short 1 hour hop but seats very comfy. Small snack on board. Selection of soft drinks and 3 beers. Something larger airlines cant manage. No delays on either flight. Would use this airline again for more regional travel.

### SA Express customer review
CPT-JNB-CPT economy. I booked 3 days before departure for a quick return trip. I would have travelled SAA in preference to the other carriers but after booking I compared prices between SAA and the four other domestic carriers and comparing similar timings SAA was the least expensive (ZAR 1565) admittedly not by much but so much for 'low cost' carriers. When I saw the long check in queues for the other carriers at CTIA I was even happier to have booked SAA simply drew my boarding card after checking in online and sauntered to the boarding gate. Flights were punctual lots of information from the flight deck cabin crew attentive and friendly modern clean aircraft and decent seat pitch.

### SA Express customer review
Cape Town - Port Elizabeth SAA Express. Domestic terminal working very well considering it was Monday morning and in view of the ongoing major construction work. As SAA silver card holder grabbed 20mins in pleasant SAA lounge. Flight called 10 mins before departure and bussed to remote stand. CRJ200 fitted with the brightest blue leather seats I've ever seen. Excellent weather en-route which always helps with the sense of a nice flight. Crew served breakfast of juice muffins ham fruit bowl and coffee. Service would put most US and Europeans airlines to shame and all on a little CRJ. Landing and disembarkation at PLZ efficient.

### SA Express customer review
Cape Town - George SAA Air Link. Domestic terminal busy but check-in fairly efficient. Please note SAA Silver card holders you can check in at Business/First desks and use lounge. Flight called 20 mins before departure and bussed to remote stand. EMB-135LR awaited which as only half full was qucikly boarded and ready for departure. Captain warned of poor weather in George (thunderstorns wind and low cloud) before departure which was 20 mins late as a result. Brief 30min flight during which juice and muffins were served. Descent began into George dodging thunderheads. Broke out over George airport perimeter at what must have been decision height for a greaser of a landing. Got the feeling this was a thoroughly professional crew doing a super job.

### SA Express customer review
Port Elizabeth to Durban economy. Not impressed very rocky flight with a seemingly over zealous person on the stick. Took a travel sick tablet for a 50 mins flight! Service seemed OK and plenty of cabin crew around but I really just wanted to be on the tarmac. Possibly one of the worst flights I have known - but that may just be me.

### SA Express customer review
Full flight on Canadair Regional Jet departed at 0620. SAX has not refurbished cabins on the CRJs so they are looking a little tired and dated - would be great to have the seats installed on their Dash 8s rolled out across the fleet. Expecting the worst for breakfast I was pleasantly surprised - fruit yoghurt and a hot meal were provided. The hot meal consisted of an omelette sausage tomato and onions - the omelette was fresh and tasty and certainly the best omelette I have had on board any flight. Two rounds of coffee/tea followed by which time the descent to Windhoek commenced. Very impressed with the breakfast on this run - can't see why it can't be expanded across the network for morning flights. All in all a good experience.

### SA Express customer review
Travelled Johannesburg - Kimberley - Johannesburg and Johannesburg - Gaborone - Johannesburg in June. SAX has refurbished all their Dash 8-300s so seating very comfortable - stylish blue leather seats with adjustable headrests (more comfortable than seats on many larger jet aircraft). Service good on all sectors however catering seems to be hit-or-miss and inconsistent in terms of quality and quantity. JNB-KIM flight departs at 0555 with a flight duration of 1h20 - appaling breakfast is served consisting of yoghurt a few pieces of melon and papaya that they call a fruit salad and a stale dry unappetising muffin. Return flight from Kimberley at 1935 - different story; delicious chicken wrap savoury biscuits and chocolate. JNB-GBE although flight is only 50 minutes and departed at 0730 a full breakfast was served (why they cannot do this on the Kimberley flight is beyond me). Bread roll cold meats cheese and fruit. Afternoon departure from Gaborone at 1540 - the most disappointing of all... snack box handed out opens to reveal a packet of mixed nuts and a packet of crisps ! This definitely leads one to feel ripped off at having paid over R2500 for the return flight to Gaborone. Air Botswana by comparison have taken heed to catering feedback and replaced their peanut-and-biltong service with proper sandwiches etc on board. A little consistency at SAX would be great !
